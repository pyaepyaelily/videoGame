2018-11-05,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,My first Monster Hunter experience. It was not that fun. The combat was bad boring and clunky. For being a game that focus on combat i was suprised how porly executed it was. If you really love these kind of games then buy something else. Or if you can find it for free. But i doubt it would be worth the time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-23,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,I want to like this game but I just can't. There's very little depth to it (until you grind for 100+hours to get the end game content then you get a tiny bit more). Every enemy feels basically the same. There's a lot of weapon types which is nice but they purposely still design the combat to be slow and clunky and awkward.tl dr Boring repetative gameplay with very little character customization meaningless and dull fetch quests etc.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-15,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is great. I love Monster Hunter and I was so excited to play this game. I saved up money for months to buy it but then I came to find out the port is so ing terrible it is absolutely impossible to play.My computer can run most games. I mean I run Dark Souls 3 and Black Desert Online reliable with little to no hiccups but this game is jsut so terrible optimized it blatantly refuses to work. I tried running the game on the lowest of the low settings with everything else on my computer closed (even including steam overlay) and the game still wouldn't run. The worst part is that it gave me very solid fps for about 10 minutes or so before the game suddenly freezes my entire goddamn computer. I am guessing that is because my GPU can handle it but my CPU while trying its best just can't do it. I figured issues like this would be fixed considering they took an extra 7 months to work on the pc port but it feels like they didn't work on the pc port at all. It is just terrible. After 2 hours of trying to get the game to work because I had been extremely excited for this game for months I ended up having to give up and ask Steam for a refund as the game was just unplayable.If you have an EXTREMELY high end computer go for it. Once you get past the god awful port it is a good game. If you have a PS4 or Xbone though just play it on there. Don't bother going through the heartache of trying to get this god awful port to function at normal levels. It just isn't worth it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-18,4,4,6,False,Not Recommended,This game is so damn annoying. The port from console is terrible and the item selection wheel is controlled with wasd which makes you move still rather than using the mouse. Fire attacks go through walls no matter what. Other attacks and hitboxes just like to hit wherever whether you're behind a creature or not. Jumping on top of a creature is a hassle and only works 50% of the time. The game itself is unoptimised and has severe rubber banding and poor connection. For a game that is 'Co op' it doesn't even allow you to join a friends game unless they've seen all the cutscense even though the only cutscene is when you find the creature.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-13,0,0,122,False,Not Recommended,While Monster Hunter World is a great game I'll gladly sink hours into that doesn't exactly mean it's one I can suggest at the current moment. To keep things as brief as possible I find the game fraught with frequent and sudden crashes despite being able to run it just fine (aebit at low graphical settings) for a few hours with my PC which usually occur right when you don't want them to happen (i.e. immediately after a hunt is completed and right before the game saves). If you're willing to keep your sessions shorter you may be able to evade this issue but at the same time events such as Kulve Taroth are designed to be difficult enough they require a long fight and/or multiple quests to clear further adding to the infuriating issue present.I really wish I could reccomend Monster Hunter World but at the same time I wouldn't be able to really sleep at night if I did so while the game's in its current state. Hopefully the issue is fixed by the time certain upcoming events release as they are challenging enough to the point where it can be soul crushingly awful if the game randomly crashed right after their hunt and given the current frequency it won't be an uncommon scenario either (at least for me).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-25,15,8,0,False,Not Recommended,I realise this isn't exactly a review and I would happily give one... However since day one the game wont even start on my system / I'm one of those unfortunate souls suffering from the crash glitch that stops you from even booting the game. I thought I'd wait for a patch instead of refunding my game yet we're like five patches in and it hasn't been fixed or addressed. Dunno if the developers will even see this or pay it any mind but please fix this goddamn nonsense! I'll recommend this game as soon as I can actually play it.Capcom I'm not angry I know this game is fairly decent I'm just severely disappointed. Much like a Dad who's kid keeps saying basghetti instead of spaghetti.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I need 1 fang and yet the gem which has a lower drop chance is what I keep getting. The drop chance of things you want are so low people make whole forums with calculations on what are the odds and you can play this game for 1000hours and still cant get the thing u want. And this game wonders why people would want to mod this game. My chances of getting what I need are lower than me getting 777 on a slot machine is Las Vegas,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-31,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,The mouth animation is either not English or so out of sync it wouldn't matter if it was the facial expressions are about as good as the ones in Mass Effect Andromeda which says a lot. All 49 minutes of the game felt wrong the jumping animations were downright weird same with the climbing animation. Nor did it feel as smooth as I would expect with 60FPS(didn't find an option to uncap it doesn't mean there isn't one tho). Best comparison I have is how Lords of the Fallen feels compared to Dark Souls III. I was waiting for it to go on sale because games these days are plagued with post launch bugs/crashes/etc even with the significant reduction in price the game in general fell short of even my lowest expectations. Mostly it's the mouth animations and expressions. As someone who's hard of hearing I instinctively look at the mouths of everything that speaks trying to get what I'm hearing to match up with what I'm seeing. On the facial expressions I don't expect someone's eyebrows to try climbing to the back of their necks as if I've just sat down and stabbed a baby seal with a dull carrot when having a friendly conversation makes the characters seem downright crazy. All that being said it is a visually appealing game the environment is pretty the weapons(the limited number I've seen) look fantastic.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-14,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,The only thing more monotonous than the endless menuing through convoluted awkward and badly explained menus is the age that takes to swing any weapon once.

2018-09-12,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,While its a pretty fun game it lacks in all the social aspects of a modern game. What good is grinding for all this neat gear if no one really ever sees it. It is very difficult to join parties kind of roll the die type thing. Lots of menu navigation. The endless back and forth with items gets old very quickly.

2018-08-19,0,0,222,False,Recommended,So first things first. Everyone is complaining to no end that multiplayer is experiencing some problems. It's almost as if half the people here don't realise it is meant to be completely playable as a solo experience. Some days it works some it disconnects a lot. Get over it. They're working on a fix.So how about we actually talk about gameplay for once?It's fantastic. There's a ton of variety in weapon choice so you're bound to eventually find something to your liking. They range from slow heavy hitting greatswords to nimble aerial attacks with the insect glaive and ranged shooting with guns and bows. Weapons are not tied to classes or anything of the sort so you're free to switch to whatever weapon you feel like for any given situation. They all have unique mechanics and varying levels of difficulty to use.The monsters themselves are also great. They all have unique movements and behaviours making fighting different monsters vastly different experiences. Some are timid and more likely to try to flee from danger (like kulu) whereas others can be relentless until you actually injure them. (nergigante...) They all have breakable parts that can get you more loot and the more you hunt them the more information you learn about them making future fights easier with knowledge.There's also lots of small enjoyable features like having your own house in which you can keep small captured animals as pets. You can go out on expeditions with no set goals to simply explore and learn the locales better. You can also test and learn weapons in a closed training area.As for performance I have no complaints. I run a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K and with a few settings tweaked I hold 60fps without any issue. Graphically it could stand to have a few more options but otherwise its fine.Pros intense monster battles large amount of weapon and armor choice vast upgrade trees with everything being viable interesting areas for hunting that aren't too big or too small fast loading times no bs microtransactionsCons current connectivity issues co op framework is confusing and poorly designed performance issues for some (rollback your drivers?) story is lackluster (but who cares you just want to kill things)Despite the technical issues i have very much enjoyed my time with this game and will continue to for many hours. Co op may not always work yet but when it does it's a great time so i look forward to a patch.Overall the game does as advertised and it does it very well. You hunt monsters. Lots of monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-10,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,After playing 120 hours of MHW i have to say im kinda dissapointed. I really love the game its really good. But you have nothing to do after you defeated the 28 monsters that are in the game atm. And that takes roughly 100 hours. max. then you have nothing to do and the game just gets boring. I would really wish that they would add the monsters from MHGU. There were 93 monsters in Gen Ultimate. My conclusion if you want to play a game for 100 hours buy it. If you want alot content dont. Pls add alot more monsters and this would be the best monster hunter in the line (,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It's not a dark souls style slow attack in dark souls you have a feeling for when to use it.Here it's just missing.Hard to place a finger on it but the combat is nerve wreckingly annoying.Dark souls has a nice linear skill level you are your are kinda good and then you are good.This doesn't have any feeling of progression.

2018-10-05,3,2,1,False,Not Recommended,Was blown away by the stunning visuals and the game's character built system. Unfortunately i had to refund this game due to its lack of controller support. I run quite a number of my games on a Xbox 360 controller been using it for years had no issues on majority of my games. Though i could run this game on Keyboard/mouse but i much rather prefer it on my controller. Played the first 80 minutes of this game on my 360 controller everything was working fine. Closed out of the game came out later to my suspised my controller wasn't working. I've tried rebooting both the game and steam followed some forms online to suggest a fix still nothing. This was extremely frustrating. If this game gets a proper controller support i will reconsider repurchasing this game. A real shame i really wanted to play this one.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Too much going on at once ( weapon needs sharpening you're on fire your bleeding out and now the devilho just spawned on your quest)5. Being on fire in water6. Everything feels like a chore and nothing feels fluid (aka too much still going on)7. Hunter ranks only meaning is to bar you from other quests8. You're 2 feet tall compared to the monsters yet during a turf war you will aggro both monsters even after you've tried to sheath your weapon and hide.I'm too tired to continue this list there are things I did like about the game. kinsect glaive was nice.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Combat is clunky and often frustrating with you not being able to dodge out of or cancel a lot of slow heavy attacks/combos leaving you either vulnerable to heavy damage or outright dead. NPC's are annoying the voice acting itself is tolerable but quite stilted and theres no lip syncing at all mouths just flap slowly open and closed with no relation to the noise that supposed to be coming out of them. Animations in combat are fine but character interations outside of it are bad motions are so badly overblown it makes me think the games cutscenes were made for people who lack the ablilty to understand human reactions when done normally. You might think I just mean that theyre overexpressive but no thats not applicable here. Whats the deal with having a character wave goodbye to someone whos who's walking away from them by flailing their arm around like its on fire and giggling like they had a whole tray of edibles? Or a character nodding at someone so violently that Im actually worried they may get whiplash? Additionally some characters literally only have one animation for when youre speaking to them and continue to do it over and over again as you proceed through each bit of dialogue. Weapon design is varied and interesting with both melee and ranged options that are quite unique armor design is nice but so far I'm unimpressed with the systems behind armor.Monster design is also good aesthetically speaking and most that I've fought so far are quite different from one another but their AI is dumb as a bag of rocks. When playing in a group monsters constantly switch between party members with such regularity that you can set your watch by it. Rather than focusing on a single enemy and pressuring them till they break the monsters will attack a few times then switch to a different target even if they had severly injured their target and was about to kill them they would switch off allowing them to heal making all of their effort to kill you pointless. Some monsters also lack a decent selection of attacks compared to others thus leading to the repition of the same attack over and over and over again. Doubt I need to mention how quickly that can get tiresome. Additionally areas with lots of verticality can be a test of patience as the monsters can get stuck in a loop of jumping between two levels over and over again making it necessary to either force them to retreat by literally throwing poo at them with your arm mounted sling shot to get them to stop or by breaking off your attack and pulling back to get them to follow you. Controls are a mixed bag at least to me and you cant do any custom keybinds with the controller there are only a few different settings you can change but all the alternative options are worse than the default ones. Keyboard controls can be rebound but it will have to be done as the default bindings are hot garbage. (like pressing V to aim your gun who the fk thinks thats a good idea?)Performance is also garbage of a rather high temperature as the game on max settings at 1080p is leaving my GTX 1080 at full load constantly resulting in fps drops for more often than a game with this level of graphical fidelity has any right to do. This is the first MH game I've ever played so I dont know how much of this is normal or a staple of the series and after 40 hours at the time of writing this review the clunkieness of the combat and the systems in the game has not endeared me to the series. Maybe it will get better if so I'll update this review but I doubt the core problems I have with the game will be changed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-24,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,This is an old game that's been ported to PC. It feels very dated. Most of the dialogue is still text based and any that is voiced doesn't line up with the lips like at all. The controls are absolutely horrible. They've basically just tried making the keyboard and mouse into a controller lol. This game is ok if you use an xbox controller but definitely not for a kb and mouse.The graphics look good for the most part but there's alot to be desired for the characters. They all do the same poses after the game which doesn't sound like a big deal but when you've defeated some monster and everyone is doing the same animation in sync with eachother it just looks bad lol. The monsters do this too it's like watching a dance show as you're walking past them sometimes which really takes away from the little depth this game has to begin with.I feel like they've targeted a very young audience. The game is constantly telling you what to do which gets really annoying. Killing stuff is simple and I mean really simple even with bad controls there's no real challenge. Actually using strategy to take down a monster like hititng it in the weak spots is more random than anything else. When you slice a monster with a blade you hit most of it's body anyway so why bother having weak points.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-31,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,Given that this is my first Monster Hunter game I've ever played I'm sure some people would say ignore me. If it would be your first though then you better be prepared.First of all there's no lock on combat. I figured hey obviously you have to aim properly and acquire some sort of skill which is something I do genuinely look for in video games The issue that I have though is the extremely clunky controls and movement. It felt so frustrating to attack every mob I had encountered. Next up is using items. I had set potions to be the main item on the dial but whenever I wanted to sharpen my weapon it wouldn't activate unless I made it the main item. Sure it doesn't seem like a big deal but considering you might have to do this during combat it comes off as another unnecessary hurdle of game mechanics. I got fed up during the second quest and ended up exiting the game.I asked for a refund. Zero interest in playing this again.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-06,2,2,211,False,Not Recommended,Another edit and I still am NOT recommending this game. Save your money folks this game is not worth $50 let s get that straight. This game is a prime example when devs who don't know how a platform works whould leave that platform alone or do deep digging to make games that are good before letting them see the light of day. Firstly tutorial sections either take them out entirely or write them better. Game is downright confusing and anyone who is new to the franchise is gonna have some hard time learning the game for poorly put together tutorials half the stuff one discovers by poking around...Secondly controls for K&amp M are FUBR. Very clunky very confusing. On top of that game has very poor response reaction to whatever you command it to do. If you pick up some herbs and right there you have a foot print it will be 3 4 second delay and consecutive button smashing for the game to figure out what you are telling it to do. Plus in fast paced monster attacks you have no time to really figure out overly complicated combos you just smash the keys and pray for miracles. K&amp M set up needs to be revised ASAP! (Yes still even after radial menu revision K&amp M command responses are slow and still clunky!)NEXT of the list of disasters combat system. Aside from clunky key bindings for K&amp M you in for a treat of broken combat flow. Mainly because the healing takes 6 10 seconds after you smash the needed key about 3 4 times. Aerial combat you can smash that button all you want game will not respond all the time OR will send yr character flying in opposite direction. Monster attacks are a whole lot more fast paced than half the weapons in your arsenal that again breaks up the flow of combat. If you are stunned game takes forever to get out of it while monster is nibbling on your extremities and there is literally NOTHING you can do. By the time your stun expires you are dead. Damage application is not explained either I have triple numbers damage stats maxed out skill level but I deal between only 11 20 when attacking with 3 star potent element where does the rest of my damage go? Targeting system leaves much to be desired. It just sucks NEXT camera fireflies and monster AI and HITBOXEEEEEES. I am sure some people will say git gud but that doesn t fix a problem of monster AI. It s very inconsistent sometimes monsters just ignore 3 out 4 people of the team just going blindly after one player until either that player or monster are dead. Monster fleeing AI is very weird sometimes they run every 5 seconds or will remain in same spot for 90%of the battle. Camera will screw you up more times than you can count later on. During fights it clips weirdly through monster and can be extremely disorienting you get stuck in the monster unable to dodge out. Fireflies get dumb more times than I could count most of the group members will be sent in one direction but MY fireflies will send me in completely different direction OR they ll take the long detour around to the spot you need to be in. Let alone they get really confused when combat kicks in and out. Many a time you will have to re open your map to remind those inscect where they should be leading you...Dodging should either be taken out or made count. What's the point of giving ability to dodge if you take damage in the impending attack anyway? I might as well stand still and take the hit. Hitboxes of the monsters are insane by the by you miss them by an inch and it's held against you but monster never misses you even if you are literally across the room or not even in the direction of the attack. They are like cops in GTA auto aim and one shot skill set that half the times will ignore whatever protective mantles you are wearing. If you are a bow wielder dodging will suck double time because by the time game actually understands you wanna dodge out of the attack you are dead. NEXT... SoS calls. First of all for this particular section of the review I m sorry but for me as a veteran gamer of all sorts of games I find it quite dumb that I have to start story quests or expeditions SOLO when it s a MULTIPLAYER game!!! Then game drops right in front of Anjanath just to tell you that HEY! NOW YOU SEND SOS FLARE!!! Yeah while I do that Anja will roast my behind. The SoS mechanic is nice but implementation is idiotic. Unable to join story quests right off the bet with friends is word stupid doesn t do justice to describe it. NEXT dialogue and voice acting. I have beta tested fair share of games in my gaming life and for the game that has been so over hyped lack of fully voiced NPCs abundance of annoying clickity click text dialogue that is looks like a 5 y.o wrote it game will not only push you back into 90s but will also make you feel as if you are treated like a moron. Lack of voice acting for NPCs makes game look sloppy cheap and overall crappy.FINALLY matchmaking system For a game that is aimed to be a multiplayer lack of traditional party formation system is exceptionally idiotic. To go out on free roam expeditions you or your friend have to fire up an SoS flare because you can t pre determine a group ahead of time. You cannot join a friend in a quest until AFTER both of you discover a monster and one of you flare an SoS call while another forfeits their quest to join you in the adventure. What an backwards way to do this There is no way I can recommend a game that is so poorly designed. It needs A LOT of work revision and quality of life patches rework and updates. The game shouldn t cost more than $15 20 and that would for that cat friend of yours. That s about it. At this point not even pretty graphics cute kitten and music can make up for the disappointment I came to experience playing this game. Simply horrid for this age in the gaming industry.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There are no health bars and there are no clear visual queues that you're doing actual damage beyond numbers that tell you nothing (as enemy health isn't revealed) and the monster running away after a while.The mechanics of the combat feel like they're begging for something like a lock on system but even that wouldn't be much more than a bandaid on the reskinning of highly repetitive fights that the game offers. ""New"" encounters pretty rapidly devolve into just wailing on a big thing with the same 2 repetitive combos dodging the enemies' attack then going back to wailing on it.The graphics themselves look nice in and of themselves but I'll take solid conveyance over a flashy spectacle with little substance any day.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-08,4,1,8,False,Not Recommended,This game is a console port. If you're on Steam you may be playing this on PC with a keyboard. If you decide to start with a ranged weapon and use a PC with a keyboard the developers have an open hatred of you. The devs seem to have played some Card Against Humanity themed game where they went around in a circle and picked whoever suggested the keybind that made them laugh.Once you find a usable setup you may have bought the game for multiplayer...you don't progress in the game together. Imagine an instance in an MMO. A raid or dungeon or whatever. Typically there's trash and then the boss. In Monster Hunter World you kill the trash solo. Then you leave the instance and join a friend in their instance killing the boss. Two people who have not done any part of a quest cannot start a quest together. Because reasons.My understanding of this game is that it's like going to Disney World but Mickey rubs sand in your eyes when you show up at the gate and the first 50 yards into the park. There's also buckets of sand at certain rides...but each only gets used once per each of those select rides.

All in all I found it disgustingly boring and somewhat depressing to play. To top it off it seems designed 100% as a game and no thought put into the world or its physics. For example I kill a gigantic monster I get like 5 or 6 items from it tops. If I didn't break its tail in the fight I cannot get its tail after killing it. Cuz you know I'm not a hunter/gatherer who could and would do that. Nope...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There is no crossplay and you can't even transfer saves from one platform to the other.In general I can't really recommend the game at it's current price.

If you spend more than half of your playtime recovering from single enemy attacks there's something deeply wrong with the product.Apparently this was meant to be more of a showcase ""admire our art"" and for some reason you the paying customer decided to have control over it which the developer quickly erased by including stuns and constantly being tossed around in combination with insanely fast enemies melee weapons wielded by a massive retard who can't cancel animations and having to hammer potion buttons because apparently proper procedure is more important that survival in the world of monstrously dumb hunters .Not to mention enemies who are made of purest jelly that's just hard in the place you decided to stick your dumb face into. Prepare to get run over by enemies that will in full motion turn 180 whipping an area the size of a house to dust while poisoning and burning that area.Not to mention this is marketed as a multiplayer title and in fact you can only play this ""multiplayer"" but everything that is about multiplayer is a shoddy tack on that seems like it wasn't meant to be in the game to begin with.And just when you think after spending 30 minutes in stuns and crappy animations and running after an enemy because that's the way to do everything the fat decides it's about time for a vacation and just takes a stroll to Ibiza in the middle of the ing fight.

And oops you got disconnected so you have to start over. And the voice chat is so quiet you can't hear anyone you're grouped with.

Do you like unresponsive controls?Do you like a game that has currently multiplayer connection issues? Do you like having to wail on something for about 5 10 minutes after it got boring?No what a suprise.Game is average monsters are annoying I killed the first wall of the game anajath and it was an empty victory. I would never want to fight it again in my life like most bosses in this game. All you do is fight them and they suck. I love good boss fights but these are just dumb. To avoid attack you have to run away and then faceplant the floor becuase it has I frames. Why not have the I frames on rolls who knows it's capcom.I mean if your burnt out on your favourite games then buy this to play for a bit but it's barely enjoyable good enough to play but not even for a particularly enjoyable experience.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

After low rank is done with however the game becomes a chore.You constantly have large monsters interrupting your fight repetitively. It seems past rank 6 the game becomes hunt this one monster fight it for 2 minutes chase it for 10 minutes get interrupted after hitting it twice by a larger more difficult monster that will chase you and your target until you slay either of them. Combat i would say is less that 30% of this game.

It isn't me I have over 13 friends who own this game who also have friends I have also talk to. It is not a steam issue it is a developer issue that was a problem on console. The game died hard soon after console release I can now see why. Problem is you cant really refund the game.

Barely worth $10.EDIT After an additional 220 hours or so of gameplay since my initial review I have decided to amend my review.Though my original impression of the game was somewhat negative my impression of the game has changed. I realize now that I was far too lenient when I wrote that the game is boring and uninspired. Monster Hunter World takes ""boring and uninspired"" to new heights monsters are largely recycled versions of themselves from the beginning of the game to end game 90% of weapons and armor sets are ultimately useless and end game consists of nothing more than running the same boring hunts over and over praying to RNGesus for the thing you want. There is no way to farm specific decorations (this game's version of skill jewels or gems) and there is no trading between players.Partying is actually disadvantageous. Partying slows down clear speed and creates a scenario where you can still fail your mission if your teammates die too much. This game has no business being marketed as a multiplayer game and I question why the creators of this garbage heap even bothered to include multiplayer functionality. By the way don't buy this game with a friend hoping to play through the campaign together if two players are not both EXACTLY at the same point in the game and have seen EXACTLY the same cutscenes as each other players are not able to party together. Make sense? No? Monster Hunter World.Why are the weapons so drab? There's a Long Sword which is a really long sword and a Great Sword which is a....longer long sword but bigger. WOAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! And then there's a Lance which is a lance and a Gun Lance which is a lance....that shoots out stuff from its tip (??). DANK. Then there's a LIGHT bowgun and a HEAVY bowgun and the difference between them is....oh it. This game blows.This is also one of those cutting edge games that offers minimal data to its playerbase which severely inhibits gear strategy and build optimization. Bowguns for example can be modded which enables players to slightly tweak elements of the weapon. One such mod reads ""Long Range Up Increased attack power when firing at long range."" Well okay...what qualifies as long range? It's not like there is any kind of quantifiable range indicator I can look at to be able to tell whether or not I'd benefit from equipping this. And how much attack am I actually gaining? You can equip up to three of these and the attack bonus displayed is simply shown as ""Attack Bonus Small Medium or Large"" based on how many you have equipped. This isn't ing McDonalds where you can order varying sizes of fries. Just give me a number!!!!!!!! Is it 5 attack? Is it 5%? Is it 10%? Is it go yourself???? You might be wondering ""dude if you hate this game so much why did you invest over 200 hours into it?"" The answer to this question is very simple because I'm a ing idiot and so will you be if you buy this game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'm using an XB1 controller and B and Y are for attacks and the triggers and X have other random uses. Just a werid setup.

2018-09-30,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,I have went into this game without playing any of the previous games so this is an oppinion of a person completely new to the series. From the very beginning the game illustrates very poor design choices. It is overly complicated at points and completely oblivious to some of it's issues. For instance most of the tutorials are just pop up windows with a bunch of text the actual tutorials don't teach you how to actually play the game. Instead of wasting the first few gameplay hours learning how to run and hide the game should instead teach you how to fight monsters. You know because that's what this game is about ? To understand how to fight you have to visit the 'Trainig area' and there you learn that each weapon has a crap ton of different combos and is just overly complicated. This is not Mortal Kombat you should progress and unlock new moves as you learn them not get everything just thrown at you from the get go.And then we have the overall polish and feel of the game. Generic story with characters with large breasts. Dialoges which have voiced and unvoiced parts which makes no sense whatsoever tbh. The map design is simply horrific. You get lost in the empty bland looking corridoric mazes. Why is there no proper open world but it is devided in segments ? The camp is a social hub like in e.g Destiny but then why can you not see other players ? It's coop game when you can not seemlesly play coop with your friends because of the weird quest joining mechanics. The open world should have been a single map you join your friends and appear at their location in the camp and from there you can go and do anything you want. And now the gameplay part. I understand I can not fully judge this because I have not played long enough. It just seems to follow a pattern of a cheap Korean MMO. I can not blame the developers for this much since even big games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect have fallen into this boring trope. The monsters and the hunters should deal much more damage to each other to make the fights more dynamic and interesting. At this point chaising some poor beast slashing it 1000 times before it finally dies is simply not fun. Overall the game is a very bad package is deffinetly not worth the price tag. It suffers from attempting to go for quantity over quality. If you can not make a good open world don't. If you want to make a game accessible for players learn about making tutorials in 2018. Have less mechanics but put more focus on them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Like they will be talking and then the end of the cut seens. you have to start reading the next three lines of speech (also while they are spouting out random words that dont match the subtitles) and then back to cut seen. If you want to play the story with a friend its like load screen simulator. Load in to do the cut scenes every one has to back out then join someones sos flare because you cant que together in the begining of every quest. If you join a matchmaking server its got ten people in it going ""Hey whys everyones mics so low"" it just goes on for hours. Also the meat of the game is graphics so if your looking for a in depth game dont come here. Just lots of grinding and simple tasks. Load in kill a monster back to hq repeat. The game controls are very bleh. Its basically destiny but with swords and knifes.

2018-11-30,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Well...That was depressing.I'm told this game has a great sense of progression and that it's great fun learning to fight new monsters.By the end of character creation I really had my hopes up. By the end of the first cutscene after that I recognized the basic story from about 5 other MMOs that I've played. By the end of the tutorial I was ready to uninstall the game.1 The logical progression of the story had already partially broken down by the end of the tutorial. There was a partial 4th wall violation during one cutscene and the developers actually tried to mitigate it by drawing more attention to it.2 Character writing and dialog writing are... I'm going to be extremely generously nice and call it bland.3 Keyboard and mouse controls the developers have apparently never touched a keyboard or mouse before. I'm told the mouse controls have been improved that this is the improvement is horrifying.(I know there is an aim mode but apparently it's incompatible with my mouse)4 Camera controls if you're accustomed to inverted Y axis camera control expect to be extremely annoyed until about halfway through the tutorial. You will have no access to the camera settings until one of the NPCs gives you your main menu.5 Speaking of the camera expect to get your nose yanked all over the place as the game repeatedly takes away your camera control when IT wants to show you something.Some people will love this game. Obviously a lot of people do.For me it is not playable. If the aim mode would work (literally at all) it might be something I could slog through if somebody had a gun to my head and told me to play it but at this point I'm A glad I got it on a massive holiday sale and B sorry I wasted a whole $18 on it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-06,0,0,121,False,Not Recommended,Tl DRits a more clunky less repsonsive dark souls with worse tech and world design.summary Honestly the game would be so much better if it had 360 free aim instead it feels 4 directional and aiming attacks even with lock on feels obnoxius.several weapons (almost all) which decide your moveset have akward frames and weird recovery animations.if you want a game with decent skillgap which rewards optimization and adaptation of any sort other than spam+dodge then keep waling. i had hopes this would be a souls like with more co op focused content and crafting but it just feels just more restricted and grounded than it has any right to be. fighting lacks impact and attacking feels like peeling a potato. port quality buggy but mostly badly optimized with fullscreen/windowed offfering varied performance for some reason. final thoughts the game itself is not awful but it sure hell does not deliver quality for its price. if they would now rework movement and animations with less input delay it would have been a solid 8/10 but right now the strongest point of the game is the theme and visuals but they mean nothing if i feel like a moving square on rails attacking non square creatures. the difficulty in this game is based on how you adapt to your characters technical not the monster hunter world. grab it cheap if at allUPDATEi id like to make an update here regarding the monster ai.Its beyond at times making stupid choices or just get a meltdown and do literally nothing.it also cheats making moves and jumps and move that should not be possible considering terrain/angles present in the encounter. it can literally clip trough walls to hit you. Stunlocks learn to live with them due to awful dodge mechanic and unbalanced ai.pray to rng jesus because skill or timing cant help you in these cases.this along with weird hitboxes and area of effect dmg that can surround the whole monster although the animations/effect only show a certain range(phantom range beyond broken).This game does everything it can to break immersion and develop apathy in anyone wanting to improve. The way to win is to just get 4 people and just split the load hoping some can actually tank certain hits and thats IF you get that ideal setup which you likely wont. This could have been somewhat amended with better tools to chat and intreact with the community but i doubt it can be less inconvinient. i dont know how previous MH titles are but this one is cheap trash.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-23,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,Definitly DO NOT recomend based on a number of factors that i found infuriataing while playing. Some of the worst melee combat i've seen in recent memory. Once you join a quest you cant change weapons. So if you find out your paraticular weapon is awful or you just dont like the attack animations you're stuck with that weapon until the quest timer runs out or you die 3 times. Cant leave a quest while its running cant quit the game while quest is active. If you have a 50 minute quest timer youre stuck on that map. If you have to quit and do something else you cant leave the quest or save. Sooooo stupid. Wtf were they thinking!!? Terrible targeting. Sometimes i'll have a boss monster right in front of me and cant target it with the lock on camera. It completely baffles me. This lock on is honestly quite terrible. It will usually either de lock or not lock on the monster you want.Other than those complaints the game isn't terrible. I just found it infuriating with the melee combat. Certain weapons i.e. the greatsword or dual swords only work in certain situations. Fighting a boss monster with a greaat sword is some of the most infuriating combat you will ever experience due to the attack animations. Ranged weapons arent terrible but using a controller with one is pretty awful. All together my total combat experience was dreadful and annoying. Many times i found myself shouting at the tv because of the attack animations causing me to get hit alot. You definitly need patience in this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I've had this Steam account for seven years and have never posted a review but this rotting pile of filth truly deserves one.Most of my seething discontent stems from my inability to even play this game but there's plenty more reasons to hate this game don't worry!The good Cool looking monsters! This has never been done before and is true inovation at its finestThe really really really unforgivably bad Game rarely boots up instead I'm left with a black screen before reaching the main menu On the rare occasion that the game boots up I'm left with some of the worst menu navigation systems I've ever experienced. Confusing and unorganized. Right click goes back???? Please. The controls and mechanics are just so stupid I genuinely don't know why people enjoy this game. Stop attacking a monster for 4 seconds? The game sheathes your weapons. Want to drink a potion because you're about to die? Press a random button to sheath your weapons scroll through an item menu drink your potion unsheath weapons. The same applies to your whetstone that you must use in combat when your weapon goes dull mid fight. Almost every aspect of this game detracts from the only semi decent system fighting rather than complimenting it. Inb4 ""git gud"". Needless complexity is not fun and should not be glorified. I bought this game to play with friends. Partying up is stupidly broken requiring friends to be at the EXACT same progression points in the so called story to join up. This CORE function of the game is needlessly complicated to get working. Once I sync'd up story progress with my friends made a public party for my private party(private parties are ""invite only"" as defined by the description right underneath it but this function flat out doesn't work) chose a mission posted the mission had my friends accept the mission readied up for the mission loaded into the instanced mission zone SPLAT!!!! One or all of us were error coded into oblivion. After many attempts I have been unable to complete a single mission with friends in this AWE INSPIRING GENRE DEFINING NEXT GEN CO OP CENTRIC AAA POLISHED TITLE THAT SENDS SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE GAMING COMMUNITY Many of the textures look abolutely attrocious much of the game and especially my character is a fuzzy mess at max settings with a EVGA FTW3 1080TI Running on a flagship 65 inch curved Samsung 4k uhdtv I could really go on about how much I hate this game but I think plenty of other people have and will continue to articulate how unworthy of your time and money this trash is. Utter dissappointment is oozing from me as I write this review. I've spent enough time trying getting this game to work that I've exceeded the 2 hour ""playtime"" refund period and will probably not get my money back. This hurts me on a deep spiritual level not because of the money lost but the knowledge that Crapcom has gotten more than a penny from me for this collosal failure of a game.Other Thoughts Please do not buy this game.

I am glad I got this game for free because if I paid for it I would be demanding refund immediately.Annoying characters bad voice acting extremely slow pace forced ""tutorial"" which doesn't really explain anything useful it just forces you to do stuff which in a good game you would naturally discover for yourself and the combat is slow and janky.

Characters are annoying stereotype personalities (grates on my nerves). World lacks depth with no freestyle exploration. Graphics are poor for a new release plenty of older titles with better graphics. Combat is clunky while character is performing an attack the game does not recognise movement keys. This results in finishing one long winded attack and then performing the next without turning to face the right way. End up attacking thin air too often very annoying. Plays like a poor console port on PC. Overall am damn glad I didn't pay for this but dissappointed this was what I got for 'free' when I bought my gpu.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-21,3,1,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Well game seems stiff buggy and unpleasant. You basically have to play with subtitles on cause they voices acting doesn't work all the time and only the subtitles show. The voice acting with lip sync is bad but in general the voice acting is bad and stale. The controls are quite different and in my taste bad. All in all I attempted alt f4 but then used task manager to close it quicker so I wouldn't have to look at the game not even after an hour. Tried the game again and ended up far back before I even got my gear so now I'm stuck watching these awful scenes again without an option to skip. Seriously Capcom why the hell are we forced to watch these low budget eye/ear gouging scenes. Auto save system is garbage/non existant. This game is nothing but a waste of space on my computer will wait a year to see if the console ported junk will be any better but for now it's being deleted.Got it for free with my new graphics card now I understand why.$60 for this not even close to being worth it.

2019-01-23,6,3,7,False,Not Recommended,"Not what I was expecting from a game this expensive. Doesn't run the greatest doesn't look the greatest. High school cafeteria aesthetic to every single character and everything is so dorky and awful. For a game about fighting giant monsters there isn't a single badass thing in it. Even the biggest monsters seem influenced by things like housecats and puppies and cartoon characters in the way they move and react to you. English translation is apparently half done because half the speech is silent and none of the mouths are synced to the dialogue. You can either enjoy the dialogue or the cutscenes because you can either look at the scene or the silent subtitles. Always online is nothing but a bad limited matchmaker with no other purpose. Almost every weapon looks stupid and unbelievable which is a word the game itself uses to describe the proportions and actions of it's monsters. Think wiry childlike cartoon characters carrying street lamp spears to fight Roger Rabbit crossed with a dragon. I don't know what's with these Japanese publishers and just sticking gigantic wobbling tumorous growths on every ""organic"" design they come up with. Through and through the same terrible charicature aesthetic that kept me away from Warframe. Clunky outdated mechanics literally everywhere. Jaw flapping animated character icons on the side of the screen straight out of Hot Wheels Velocity X. The combat is like Street Fighter with half an extra dimension. Combos don't feel like you're making your dude swing his sword into a monster's vitals. Nothing along the lines of Assasin's Creed God of War The Witcher or Mount &amp Blade. The best I can describe it is like a more primitive For Honor. They make you feel like you're pulling the lever on a Rockem Sockem robot bluntly smacking vague gigantic hitboxes based on what loot you want to get as your character and his weapon rigidly slide back and forth on the monster's model with no actual impact. The hitboxes have to be gigantic because unlike For Honor there is zero precision in the melee system. It's not about swinging left when the monster goes left or blocking right when the monster goes right. It's about crudely aiming your character in the general direction of the monster memorizing sequences of buttons that make your character light up into damage mode and hitting DODGE when the monster swings. Over and over and over. You'll have to memorize a lot of dull bland crud. Movement in combat is a chore. It's a gameplay choice to make your movement slow but it has been executed in a clunky way such that your character just simply can't move in directions the designer felt wasn't useful to the move set. It's the kind of system where you can't just attack a monster above you you have to block and then attack because that's how you attack up even though you didn't want to block. Completely unintuitive. Impenetrable needlessly complex interface consisting of mostly the number 1 3 scattered throughout dozens of menus. Open world is a littered mess walking from one end to the other isn't fighting monsters but picking up berry after bone after godforsaken bug following the fireflies makes you feel even more robotic in your quest for all but interchangeable Game Progress Tokens. There is so much going places to accomplish one stupid thing. Go back to collect your roast. Go back to get your reserch. Head over to the canteen to All the most boring crap you could think of about hunting monsters they made into a game mechanic and made it take time. It's like an MMO or a mobile game. Click click click click level up weren't those menus fun?It has the whole 80's/90's feel like it was a pen and paper game put to a GUI.Maybe it's a good iteration of the Monster Hunter franchise. On it's own it's awkward and tedious in every respect from menus to combat.

Also the fact that they took an extra 8 months to release the PC version for it to be in this state and released with DRM is ALSO A GOOD MEME. on top of all this the graphics do not justify the performance if the game was 20 bucks or less I would say go for it but this is not a 60 dollar quality product.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

More like final fantasy or Metal Gear. If you like those this will probably fit right into your collection.

This is a 30$ game.I was very excited to play my first monster hunter game and thought i was going to love the concept. It's grindy and like diablo except just one big enemy against you. This sounded perfect everything i wanted. But maybe i was dissappointed by the lack of variety in this game? The awful multiplayer system?The biggest issue at launch was the horrible online system. You can't do any quest for the first time with anyone you have to go through all of the cutscenes separately quit out then start a new lobby with everyone. How ing ridiculous is this t (I don't know if this has been changed since then i don't have high hopes).After fighting many bosses seeing several new environments i kind of felt like it was all more of the same. Is this how all games like monster hunter are supposed to be? Kill a boss upgrade gear kill same/different boss. Thats it. There's nothing else to do in the game. The only variety one can argue is the armor and crafting system. There is a good amount of variety but it is broken down to collect materials to make stat specific gear that benefits your weapon. WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO IT THATS IT.I got bored playing solo incredibly fast. The horrendous sucking show all online system really ruins the flow of the game. Game is repetitive and the amount of content in this game does NOT warrant 60$. I highly regret ever spending this much on such a game. ing rip mhw my life,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-26,10,5,22,False,Not Recommended,The monsters stun you over and over with no warning and no chance to dodge. None of the monsters' attacks have any wind up animation that allows you to learn and adapt it's just random sudden jerky transitions to different moves. Your weapon has 3 second long animations but the boss is so agile that you can't ever predict when he'll stay still. The only exception is when he gets knocked down which happens once every 10 minutes. There's no way to determine a boss' health bar except when he gets really low and starts limping so if you are not doing enough damage you won't find out until 30 minutes later when the game tells you you're running out of time. The UI is confusing and it's hard to manage your items. It's hard to play consistently with a friend because a lot of the missions don't allow you to or only have certain parts where you can put up an SOS flare so your friend will be waiting half the time.tl dr weaboo trash,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-21,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Monster Hunter World has to be the most boring game I have ever played. Granted I've only clocked in a couple of hours but those hours were spent trying to enjoy the game and failing. I truly feel as if the combat system is clunky it feels like it has potential to be hack n' slash to the extent Nier Automata was whilst trying to mimic the strategic system of Dark Souls but instead of making some beautiful hybrid combat system instead I'm looking at an abomination. another point I disliked is the lip syncing animation. It doesn't fit. It feels lazy I tried it in english japanese and the 'monster hunter' language and neither seemed to match up. Not a massive downside but somewhat frustratiingI did buy into this game not knowing anything about the Monster Hunter universe so perhaps this is a learned interest over time I just couldn't get into it. I'd buy this game if you have a lot of time you're already invested in the monster hunter universe and/or you like beautiful scenery. (The environments and monster designs are stunning).If you want a positively immersive combat game either a mindless one like that of Nier or Dynasty warriors or a more mindful one such as Dark souls this isn't the game for you.I'd strongly recommend watching and reveiwing gameplay before you buy this and try and gauge whether or not there is an improvment over time or something. Find strreamers and ask their opinions ultimately I think you should stay away from this game (not from capcom usually they make amazing games),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-17,3,2,12,False,Not Recommended,This is one of the game for which I wish there was 5 stars rating.First and foremost the porting from console to PC is at least atrocious and horrible.Secondly the controls just bad and it is pretty sad to hear people on PC encouraging others to play it with a controller.Third the graphs are simply basic. Even A 2010 game has better graphs and more detailed ones than this videogame atrocity. The game content is boring. The quests difficulty is absolutely ridiculous for new players who did the big mistake and bought this game.Other than that the amount of money they request in order to obtain this game is ridiculous too. I am not wondering anymore if MH is a good game or not it is obviously not. But I do wonder however what people find in this game..,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-27,4,2,4,False,Not Recommended,"I don't know how this game even came close to making the best action title of 2018.I watched a few YouTube gameplay videos of this and I regret my mistake of buying it within the first 30 minutes of gameplay. I stuck around and played for at least four good hours hoping something would turn my hopes around but no. And the worst thing is I can't even get a Steam refund for this pile of crap because the key was purchased through another retailer.I understand now why the YouTubers mostly hide their UI in game. Graphically it's lacking for the day and age we're in right now optimization is crap with barely 80fps on my 2k/144Hz powered rig the lighting artists look like they're ""new"" (to put it nicely). But the art aside here's the biggest issues that have turned me off of this game and have caused me to write such a negative and angry review.This game was no doubt an Xbox/PS4 port and if it's not? Then it's certainly that low quality and feels like one. For PC it's crap the control schemes are clunky and in need of super polishing. The mechanics in themselves are also greatly lacking as all I can see so far is that it's run around the same boring area for 20 minutes picking up the same flower herbs and an abundance of crafting materials when they don't even explain fully what they are for or how they can be used. It is FAR from friendly to new players and in fact quite overwhelming despite the lengthy tutorial that doesn't even make it perfectly clear on how crappy your system is to play with friends.The same old Session ID/Lobby based system that further makes the game feel more like a trash pile of XBOX garbage. This might as well be a dumbed down Soul Calibur IV with worse graphics and far less cool animations. Which brings me to my next point. The characters are boring terribly designed the lip movements do not match up with the voice acting (pure laziness) and sometimes the audio dialog skips. Bugs that should have been fixed BEFORE releasing the game or in the very early stages of release. Unprofessional and it makes me wonder how this developer keeps making all it's money. Final Fantasy is a pile of garbage and the game would certainly appeal to the kind of people who played FFXIV (I lose track of which title exactly because there's so many). Why would it appeal to them? Because the UI design is clunky like it was made by a 12 year old who literally just learned photoshop.Besides all of this I should also add that me and a friend who faced the same disappointment as I have attempted to do one of the public event quests that had us hunt and kill two great jagrans or something the first big monster you fight after the tutorial basically. We go to find one and soon our battle is interrupted by what looks like a T Rex that ed a peacock or a pigeon. Interesting creature design and at first our reaction was more or less ""Ok... so it's bigger meaner we'll kill it as well!"" until we found out we couldn't kill this monster and worse the game gave us NO guidance on how to avoid or fight it! We simply had to stalk the starting area jungle for our objective avoiding this T Rex whenever we saw it because it became an avid thief of anything we tried to hunt!But now I digress what a terrible waste of 25 and I am so glad I didn't pay full price for this game. Could be worse right?Characters Narrative Voice Acting 2/10Art &amp Animation 4/10UI Design 2/10Mechanics 3/10Quest Design 1/10Sound Design 3/10Multiplayer/Lobby System 2/10New Player Tutorial 1/10Friendly to new players?

2018-08-10,6,7,20,False,Not Recommended,bought it after playing dauntless for two weeks.listening to everyone praise it thought this will be much better. clipping of armor is unbearable to watch specially with your helmet. attacks dont feel very responsive if you want to attack a certain direction you have to press the direction without attacking for few miliseconds if you wont you will attack the wrong way. not everything is voiced over for a AAA title thats unacceptable and also lip syncing is just clearly they didnt even try to change it. the game doesnt look bad but has all kinds of blur options on and you cant turn them off. if you want to play with people you have to look up guides for it. some language in menus doesnt make any sense. i have 7700k and 1080ti and the games at times drops so low in fps that its nausiating. i disabled volumetric rendering and decreased shadows still 90 fps max dropping below 50 sometimes.for AAA title this is disgusting for my standards. but as a game it self it seems pretty fun but ill wait for sale and hopefully better optimisation cause the game isnt stunning to put my rig to shame.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-22,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,TLDR If you're limited on money and don't know what you're getting into here just gamble elsewhere.*Buyer Beware* If you haven't played this franchise before do some research before buying. You'll pass the refund time before you know what the game is if you'll enjoy the gameplay loop or some of the features. I actually did do the research but still didn't end up liking it.What I liked The palicos are cute. Monster design is great. The way they look and move is really impressive. Armor and weapons look really good. Gives a grand impression with the large environments and monsters.What I didn't like The controls feel clunky. The control scheme is strange (which I actually don't hate) but aside from the learning curve with controller configuration I felt like I was struggling to get my character to even attack in the right direction. Even when locking on to a monster my character would miss the monster by inches. I was able to complete my missions but it never left me itching for another. The HUD is way too cluttered and there is way too much going on at once. In the HUB world you'll have countless updates multiple NPCs shouting for your attention exclamaition points on your mini map and those are all often unrelated. It's just too much. Always online. You can't pause. I truly hate when a game I'm playing single player won't let me pause and demands my undivided attention. I'm not a hardcore gamer who sets up a distraction free environment for my sessions. I want to casually play on the couch after work and be able to pause and come back if I need to take care of a quick task or even go to the bathroom.There's my gripes take it for what you will. Not the game for me but I can't return it since I exceeded 2 hours finding out I disliked the mechanics.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The character carries his weapon on his back you can see that it's just lazily put on there no shaft or anything it just sticks to your character like a magnet you can also see the ""thin air"" between the weapon and the character. THIS IS ING 2018 NOT 2009. I know for the fanboys and people who don't play games a lot this is a minor ""mistake"" or not at all. but for me it's immersion breaking.

2018-08-25,2,1,3,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. So some people are actually biased with what they say.Here is a genuine review from someone who likes to ""trial"" games out.Pros Graphics (""speed""/""FPS"") full screen is amazing. Story little over 60 hours give or take. Slight customisation not much but 'some' Audio is amazing and crisp quality produced sound. That is about it really.Cons Very badly done dubbing like a badly done Bruce Lee film. Repetitive gameplay as such gets ""boring"" Can't skip cutscenes esc. esc ) Have to watch intro before can do anything else (hence can't skip cutscenes above) Texture packs are mediocre. Even on 'high' it's still looks like a budget game and that's giving vredit where it's due. Stories that CAN be added by players will be benefical to keep this game alive.Now i'll go into further detail. Although it says I haave 3.9 hours on my stats. I have played more time and I can safely tell you that it hasn't really improved all that much.1. The thing that has most peeved me off is that the trailer hyped it up so much by syncing the voices to the lips and whatnot it's really shot me down. I watch a lot of anime and dubbed films. But THIS this was unbearable.2. The graphics are good and that's being generous. How about instead of keeping the 'standard' texture packs that come with the game you allow the community make the game better by letting them make texture packs that will enhance the game for others to enjoy.3. The customisation isn't like the Sims let us face that but like allow us to go into detail with the face add scars pigments skin deformities etc etc etc and all sorts let us be free!! idk just thinking out loud...4.. I absolutely HATE cutscenes. If I wanted to watch cutscenes I would play Minecraft stories or something like that not a 50 game in which I can't skip a cutscene that I wouldn't pay attention to anyways.5. The gameplay can get boring quite quickly when you get quests to go and 'slay this' and 'slay that' like... Monster Hunter Freedom Unite is my main game and still play it. I will play it after this. Not this crap.6. Texture pack can make or break this game even more. I feel like the quality of the packs used aren't that great but could have used a bit more time on. 7. When you enter full screen you may or may not end up crashing burning up or free falling from space... I jest ) but if you put it full screen and experience any issues got to where MH W is located &gt right click .exe &gt compatibility &gt 'tick' disable full screen optimisations. &lt That should get you working till they get a fix out.Capcom had 8 months to work on the PC version of this game. 8 FURTHER months from the PS4 and Xbox One and this is what we are given.In it's current state with all bugs I would NOT recommend this game yet.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,10,5,85,False,Not Recommended,"They got the spelling of the game name wrong on this game. It says Monster Hunter World but it's CLEARLY ""Knockdown simulator 2018""Do you love CONSTANTLY being knocked down screamed at apparently so loudly the only thing you can possibly do is stumble around in response and have the re loading process get interrupted so many times you might not even remember the last time you were able to actually attack rather than recover from something? Then this game is right up your alley!If you DON'T like being constantly knocked down and interrupted from being able to do a single attack avoid this game at all costs.It is misery incarnate. The game is beautiful and easy to understand and play but unbelievably tedius and frustrating. A simple ""transport the eggs from point A to point B"" quest will have you screaming at your screen as you get rushed down by everything in the jungle and get the eggs smashed over and over and over.The monsters will arbitrarily decide to run away from you which serves no purpose other than to artificially pad the game length and annoy players because it turns into a game of ""chase down the monster"" instead of actually fighting. Is it thematic and immersive? No. It's annoying. Especially flying monsters who will go god knows where and by the time you reach them they will get up and fly away again before you get a chance to attack it then you get to chase it all over again! Fun!I haven't logged off from this game in a happy state ever. It's usually ""enough is enough!"" and I rage quit. Welcome to Monster Hunter.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-15,6,5,125,False,Not Recommended,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.This is how your game will start Spent 50 minutes looking for a monster that isnt listed anywhere on your map so you either have to GOOGLE it which doesn't help or you have to come across it by pure luck. In other words 50+ minutes of running around the map looking for the ing thing. When you find it your weapon will get blunt and youll have to retreat from the fight several times to resharpen it. You will then continue the 10+ minute fight where you mash the left mouse button take damage miss repeatedly because the way your camera is angled is not the way your character is looking. And then you'll lose the mission middle of the fight because you ""RAN OUT OF TIME"". Ran out of time? Are you ing kidding me? That is how this game is. Huge ing waste of 80 dollars. Best part is when you lose you get all items. Pros Beautiful graphicsDesign your characterCons The WORST part of the game is that the first 50% of the story line which is about 40+ hours of hard grinding... literally EVERYTHING you collect (mats armor etc) becomes useless. A new tier of armor and mats become available half way through. Biggest flaw of the game IMO. Game crashes during tutorial. Had to restart from beginning. Menus are overly complicated. Game needs to be played with a remote due to the item layout screens. I cant pick items at 1 4 7 9 oclock on the wheel. If you play with keyboard setting which is set to controller by DEFAULT you have to scroll through 15 20 items before you get the one you want. Combat is beyond attrocious. You basically have 2 attacks and a dodge roll. Every attack makes your character stall in place for 3 5 seconds. therefore if you commit to an attack and want to dodge roll of move around you CANT which will result in thousands of deaths. It's really bad lol. Your weapon will often go back on your back in the middle of fights with is very infuriating. The game does a bad job to tell you how to get into groups how to post missions etc. When you fight groups of monsters you DONT have time to loot them all which is ing t. It will teleport u to the next zone before you have time to loot. What really bothers me is how the characters talk and their mouth just moves out of sequence like robots lol. Game will repeatedly kick you into offline mode for some reason. 100% of the time if you minimize your screen. Even if you dont minimize it sometimes the servers will just put you offline in the middle of a group fight. The Anjanath can shoot fire through solid stone walls and insta kill you. Sometimes buttons dont work (Example F1 and then 8. You have to spam click the button over n over n over for it to work) Sometimes using potions will cause you to glitch your hands in an upwards position which means you can't do anything until you get hit which will remove the glitch. Fainting during a mission and going back to base lose your food buff . The only way to get it back is by eating extremelly rare and expensive max potions. Fights usually go like this Get stunned by roar AOE stomp etc.. While stunned get 1 shot killed before you can do anything (stuns last 10+ seconds). Horrible game design. Commands/controls unresponsive alot of the time or will get stuck doing one action often resulting in death during combat. Bursting healing wasps will NOT always health you even through it's supposed to. They can explode next to you and not heal you at all. Making your calico put out a healing wasp sometimes doesn't work at all forcing you to spam the ing E button and then resulting in your death because you couldn't heal. Commands in the f1 hotbar will often be greyed out of Xed out for absolutelly no reason. (glitch) Some of the map zones are designed with swinging vines. They are placed so far apart that if you miss your jumping click by 0.01 second you will fall to the bottom and have to waste 3 more minutes running back to the vine. Other parts of the map the vines are further apart than possible to catch which means you're forced to either wear a useless gliding suit or run around the map for 5 minutes to get to the ing monster. Alot of the times your character will be glitched and unable to jump more than 1 CM from the cliff which will render you unable to take the vine to get to the other side. minimizing your game will either result in graphic card crashing or your status/mission to go offline which means you can't do multiplayer until you end or restart your mission. why is there NO option to go back online in the middle of a mission? You will spend 80% of your time running across the map chasing after monsters because they ""run away"" everytime they lose 1/5th of their health. It's infuriating and such a waste of time. It serves no purpose. Monsters will stun and insta kill you and there's no way to stop it until you get extremelly late game gear. Storyline is locked behind MASSIVE grind wall of the same monsters. Get to a new zone. Spend 15 hours looking for ONE monster. kill monster and get 1 line of story dialogue. Next zone rinse and repeat. The game does an absolute horrible job of teaching you what items do. how to craft or make food etc. Even after watching youtube tutorials i still don't understand how much of it works.At several points in the game they force you to spend 3 4 hours reloading the same map over and over again to search to tracks that are randomized throughout the area. EXTREMELLY grindy. Dodging monsters rolls will often glitch and insta kill u despite clearly dodging sideways before the monster reaches you (lag delays?). Game forces you to find tracks for monsters. At one point the bar was filled at 95%. Told me to go back to base since i was done all the tracks. Once at base told me i had to go back for more tracks... (progress bar glitch). The game has a bad habbit of crashing once you've completed the quest. Therefore you lose your investigation point + voucher you used and you dont get ANY rewards it showed you at the end and you've just wasted 30 minutes beating the monster for nothing. (happened to me 6 times in about 60 hours of gameplay. The game locks you at certain levels and doesn't allow you to level up your gear or weapons until you beat the monster/quest. Therefore you are FORCED to play multiplayer and have higher ranked players beat the boss for you while you hide (otherwise you will get 1 2 shoted and fail the mission. This is by far the thing i hate the most about the game). the game is NOT soloable in singleplayer. The secondary attack of sword and shield is the right mouse button. The item pick up button is the right mouse button. If you bash the boss and an item is in front of you you'll pick it up instead of attacking which often leads to your death since your character stands there for 4 5 seconds while it picks up the item. If you fail the mission you get NONE of the pieces of loot u picked off from the ground. Therefore wasting 15 20 30 minutes of your time for nothing. The only way to aim with the bow is pressing C. C is also the button for slinging. Therefore when you put your bow on your back to run you can't because the slinging mode is then activated causing you to walk slow. This can often result in your death. While fighting the diablo monster or black diablo. he will burry underground. Shoot back up and then glitch towards you no matter where you are on the map until his character model hits you for about 50% of your health. During this fight i got 0 investigation rewards from my investigation. There was also a weird glitch where my 100% stamina bar was at 50% for almost the entire fight then 10% towards the end. The wiki doesn't say anything about stamina reduction and i had no debuff icons on my character so i assume this is another glitch.There are about 10 15 more glitches bugs and bad game design choices but this page won't let me write more...",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-15,5,2,34,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR Unplayable without friends. Would not recommend if you're a solo player. If you think you can solo this game. You can't. I wouldn't recommend buying this because (1) There is no solo play potential. (2) The online is garbage. (3) No one is ever going to help you. (1) To keep it super brief there's literally nothing you can do as a solo player. The way the monsters are designed you're going to run out of lives and lose the quest every time. If you think you wont wait until you get stun locked for a full 3 minutes while the monster just laughs at you until it feels like one shotting you. Every hunt is that x100 as a solo player. (2) Online is garbage. Alt+tabbing disconnects you from the online every single time and the only way to get online again is through the hub world. That means if you were in the middle of a quest and have to alt+tab for anything when you get back even if 0.5 seconds later you'll be locked offline. You may be thinking ""that doesn't sound too bad I'll just finish it solo"" refer back to point one.(3) No one is going to help you. People only join SOS in this game and they only do that when they think the quest is already over so they can get a free carve and go about their day. As a solo player you'll spend 40 minutes of your time doing your damnedest to beat a quest then 3 people join kill the thing and your rewards are ""split evenly"" even though they didn't do anything. If by some miracle anyone ever joins you early you better hope to not alt+tab because that 40 minute wait you just did for that one person will be for nothing.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

(Imagine 3 travel points in the space of your bedroom)Absolutly nothing else to do than fight big monstersMH simulator 2018 Go Kill That Monster !Ain't anything else to do today.(I wonder which lift I should use such a philiosophical question.)EDIT 1 I forgot to mention how a new player to MH feels clueless in this game in terms of its background story and small details.For example how people can just talk to you and give instructions from miles away even though you are roaming around in the jungle in an unfamilar world?How scoutflies work and where they come from? They clearly serve a great purpose.Why people come to the new world generations after generations? Why do we care about hunting ?...Questions like this may not be significant on its own but a bunch of them add together combine with other details and game design further demonstrated how clueless devs are in terms of building an actucal WORLD or perhaps just not caring at all because apparently MH fans really just want a totally accurate simulartor with 2018 graphics?Like I said a $60 AAA game needs to be more than just this to be a good game.If you quite literally just want to fight big monster and willing to spend contless hours and $60 for it then why not.Or you are willing to pay $60 and 5 20 hrs for some initial adrenaline rush.For everybody else looking for a more completed experience this is largely not worth it.

The fighting system is difficult (you can get stuck in a move and even when targeted your character will keep going in the wrong direction) your weapons dull way to quick. This is not RPG as you agree to bountys and then get ported into an instance where the NPC's are constantly stopping your progress and porting you to new areas or yelling hey over here.Plus once in a quest you cannot exit the game. And some quests it requires you to have more in your group to complete the quest. Its one thing to do end game content that requires a small guild to finish it but if you have to do that less than 10 hours into the game then... What the Hell.

2018-08-09,20,14,4,False,Not Recommended,*Gnome Seal of Disapproval*Since I am exclusively a PC gamer I was not familiar with the Monster Hunter franchice before seeing this title on Steam. I was intrigued by the concept and purchased the game.The graphics are pretty nice and the character creation was very enjoyable. But the long intro and unskippable cutscenes made the first two hours insufficient to test the gameplay. So a refund is not possible for me at this point.The controls are very clunky on keyboard + mouse. Clearly a less than optimal console port in that regard. You can customize the keys but you will likely have to put some effort and time into getting used to the unintuitive controls. I could see myself getting over it in time but it sure was a nuisance.Then there's the combat... This is where I decided to quit. I chose a ranged weapon and did not have a good experience at all. Very clunky and grossly unsatisfying. It is of course possible that a melee approach feels better and less clunky but that's up to you to find out.Another minor gripe was the incredibly bland and stereotypical characters. Meh!So if you are willing to put up with the poorly designed interface and controls then you might have some fun here. I did not.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-22,21,1,3,False,Not Recommended,ive wanted this game for some time. ive never played an opened world game quite like it and always thought it would be a perfect game for some chill exploring with a hint of danger. and also contain options to go all in and do epic battles if i wanted. well it seemed to capture that how i expected and as i started to get the hang of it i came to the realization of one extremely bogus flaw. stuns. the first time i was stunlocked to death it was inbetween 3 monsters and it was just kind of funny because i was in a situation that i already wasnt confident about. then the next it was just one but i figured i messed up and didnt dodge. well then the third time i was stunlocked i was full health had already boosted health from food i was hit with 3 roars in a row by the same mob as he took half my health with nothing i could do at all. then he flew away all while i was still stunned and as he was flying apparently its toe hit me or something and i just got oneshot by a monster that wasnt even attacking me still not being able to move. that is ubsurd and entirely ruins the fun if i can just randomly die out of my control without it being some overleveld or chance fight. this was a single mob nowhere near too high a level and absolutely nothing i could do but sit there and die. horrid game design. i cant ever recommend a game that has that level of bull. period.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-13,3,1,16,False,Not Recommended,"Extremely slow and repetitive game.First of all your character cant level up. The only way to cause more damage is to level up your weapons and there are only two weapons per type in the whole first part of the game (one is given to you for free and you can buy the other one in the armory). One of the NPCs tells you when you arrive to the first city that improving in the game is not about buying better weapons but improving the ones you already have (which are only 2 per type remember). There are only like 3 4 tiers per weapon but there are variations of that same tier that have other types of bonuses like more poison damage or other perks but theyre still too weak. You need to gather specific monster parts first if you want to level them up and they dont tell you which are they. They are shown as ""????"" until you discover them or adquire them. Normally this parts are from bosses so the only way to gather them is to complete the main story. Theres no way to get them until you unlock the access to that boss. So this means the game is permanently refraining and slowing you through the whole game. The game doesnt care if you want to progress faster. (Like in Witcher 3 where if you want to fight extremely difficult monsters even with a sh***y weapon you are allowed to do it and even better they give you exceedingly good rewards weapons or gear if you manage to kill those enemies. Well that doesnt happen here) Even if you level up your weapons to the last tier they continue being weak and since they cause very low damage (I already have a 4 tier bow btw) it takes you a lot of time to kill a boss. Its very tedious. Not to mention all the bosses and monsters continue fleeing through the whole map when you're fighting them so you have to continually chase them and this makes the missions unnecessarily longer when you have to repeat them. All the missions (Primary and secondary) are too repetitive. Once you kill any boss there will be secondary missions available where they ask you to kill the same f*****ing boss 10 times at the very least. Once you already killed many bosses in the main story line they will give you missions where you have to kill a combination of those same bosses over and over again in a certain amount of time (normally 30 50 minutes). Of course. with the same sh***y weapons. The main missions are not that different. Its always killing a monster after monster over and over again. Even when they are new monsters feels the same. Also the game's cash is not useful at all since the guy who sells stuff has a very limited range of items so you just end up buying potions and antidotes.Finally The story or plot really doesnt matter. Feels very forgetable. And since the weapon leveling system s*cks Whats really left to appreciate?TLDR This is a grinding videogame. If you like repeating missions continually without the option of completing them faster and with no good story this is for you.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-05,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,This game is one of the most disappointing things I have ever played. Below are my gripes with the game if I don't mention a certain aspect there consider it not worthy of being in the bad list but honestly not good either. There are really no glaring positives to me what so ever with this game.Cons * Constantly interrupted hunting and gameplay* Exploration doesn't feel encourage or rewarding rendering the world itself useless and uninviting* Consolized highlights of objectives instead of taking the time to have the graphic fidelity to differentiate the clues from the environment and make us actually discover them on our own (increasing reward partially solving point 2)* Graphics are sub par in general I really don't get the praise on this aspect* Mouse controls are simply a ported joystick negating what makes a mouse an actual mouse* Key rebinding are incredibly limited if you are someone who may use different control preferences than everyone else* Lack of party scaling* Party system is atrocious and is constantly gated by cutscenes until the story is finished* It is impossible for skills to outweigh gear (i consider this a negative simply for a playstyle eliminated a game developer should never eliminate playstyles from a game simply because they want to its about the recipient not the creator)* AI Runs constantly therefore wasting a players time I play this game to have fun and kill not chase it* Beginning content just DRAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSSSS* In general the game isn't rewarding nor provides you incentive to play I haven't had this feeling since Dark Souls II (not saying MHW and DS are similar in anyway just saying I haven't felt this lack of reward in a game since my first DS II experience which was about 2 3 years ago)* Lack of quality of life in general* A tutorial/introduction that makes the player feel empowered and knowledgable when in reality the player is not they should have fleshed out the introduction or just let it be and let the player figure it out* Lack of combat depth (Provides a solid 3 4 hours of extra enjoyment once you figure out your weapon of choice but then reptition ensues as it does with everything)I really had high hopes for this game I have been pumped and waiting for around a year and to have 0 PC benefit after a 7 month delay and just a game that lacks depth polish and incentive is just incredibly disappointing. From a grind this game is as bad as Destiny in execution its as bad as No Mans Sky at its best its a 3/10. If you like grinders like Warframe you will be EXTREMELY disappointed due to lack of content and depth. This game doesn't deserve to be on PC.***Edit***Gave the game a further chance made into tempered monsters and have killed most but not all I have killed everything in game roster wise and the end game is a joke. Tempered and Arch tempered literally have no additional mechanics they are just increased damage and hp sponges (Artificial difficulty) and rate of Kulve Teroth Lunastra and Behemoth releases is asinine. This is an incredibly shallow grinder yes I got 100 hours listed some of which was left open so not really playing but in the grand scheme as a grinder you should get more than that. yes I could grind more but nothing changes from HR 30 on simply more dmg and more hp in monsters. no new monsters to discover no new zones nothing new just rinse and repeat which HR 30 is maybe 40 50 hours probably less don't remember when I hit it. Everything I said prior is still 100% valid plus a horribly shallow end game this from start to finish was a mediocre experience at its height. I do not recommend anyone to waste more than $10 on this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,113,False,Recommended,"Two things Yes the multiplayer has some connectivity issues and some bizarre design choices (co op requires all players to see all the cutscenes in a mission prior to that mission's ""monster reveal "" for lack of a better way to put it). It's still a lot of fun if you know what the restrictions of the system are and they're the same as on console so I don't understand people that say they played on PS4 for 1 000 hours and they hate this version.Second if you think solo monster fights are ""unfair "" you are legitimately bad at the game. Everything is killable by yourself period. If you can't you're just not good at Monster Hunter. Try harder learn attack patterns etc. Or quit.

All I wanted from this PC port was a better running monster hunter game and I got it. Looks gorgeous runs really well even on my mid low pc. Awwww you can't have high volumetric fog? Quit crying.

2018-08-22,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,There has to be something wrong with this game...MSI 1080 GTX and this game runs at 80 85 degrees C. While the game looks just fine it isnt out of this world good in graphics so why does this run so hot? I can actually feel the temperature in my room increase significantly thats how rediculous it is.Game wise there are some things in this game that are just straight up UNFUN. Like picking leaves killing 20 little mosquitos or looking for ??? Rathian footprints for eternity. Same thing with looking for Nergigante clues just so aids its unfun in quite a few situations.More over this game servers have the most bizzare structure to play with other people. Other people even those that are on the same quest as you can not join your party until you watch cutscenes...meaning you cant leave town in a party together. Who the actual thought that was a good idea?Furthermore constant server disconnects are an issue. Complaints have been all over reddit and other various forums. So many design and performance decisions have made this game suck which is a shame because the combat is actually pretty fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Okay yes there are launch issues. There's suboptimal optimization (it goes quite bad from time to time but wasn't gamebreaking on my mediocre laptop).There's some heavy networking issues which seem to affect some more than others. Port tweaking etc. may be worthwhile.There's the terrible albeit seemingly uncommon save corrupt which can be mitigated by backing up your save.The game itself is amazing. The content is ridiculously good the combat takes a bit getting used to if you're not a vet but once you get the hang of it it's so so good. There's a weapon for everyone. Multiple for most.If you like a challenge this will give you so many hours of great fun. Despite the bugs this is easily the best game I played in years.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-28,0,0,207,False,Recommended,There are mostly two kinds of negative reviews here (more obviously but these two recur a lot). The reviews from release when there were loads of connection issues and reviews complaining about a lack of stuff to do in the 'endgame'While inexcusable upon release the connection issues are a thing of the past and no reason to avoid this game now. So those reviews van be ignored. The reviews complaining about lack of an endgame mistake this game for an MMO. This game is not an MMO. It does not have the businessmodel of an MMO and one should not expect the kind of endless high level content that is present in MMO's. This game easily has 150 hours of enjoyable content. People complaining about 'not enough content updates' should stop being entitled brat gamers. If this game was subscription based it would be excusable but it's just a lump sum. The game is feature complete I encountered no bugs it's a full game. Stop whining for handouts. The game is good value. I had a lot of fun but at 150 hours I have beaten all monsters a couple of times and I am now not playing as often. I may pick it up in a while when the updates catch up to the level of the console versions and continue with the extra stuff. This game deserves a solid 'Positive' rating in my opinion. The mixed that is there now does not do it justice. Now actually about the game I'm a Monster Hunter veteran and this game is a breath of fresh air for the franchise. Monster behaviour seems nice and natural all the combat styles I've tried are really enjoyable (and I have tried like only half of them yet) Environments are really beautiful and the fights are action packed and so much fun. Story is not much to write home about but who cares it's just a vehicle to let you gut and skin huge monsters. I recommend this for people who want a smart hack 'n slash. You can't go in swinging wildly without any thought or tactics. That wll get you knocked out quickly. Learn the attack patterns of the monsters learn their weak spots learn your moveset to maximize it's potential. And then when you dodge their bites just right and smack them in the face with a huge hammer in retailiation knocking them out that's just so satisfying. Solid 9/10 for me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Replaying all over again excellent port so far some FPS dips at moments like when hitting multiple monsters but i'm sure will be hotfixed.Over than that runs quite smooth and if comparing to the console version load times are extremely faster which was the worst thing about the console version for me. 60 FPS monster hunter is the best thing this year for me DRunning on a GTX 1070 3770K 3.5GHz and 16GB Ram.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

And by that maybe in the future the crispy graphics of texture will be fixed because if its set without anti alias on and subscar on some texture will be blur and you will mostly like to play in 1080p just to experience the epicness with epic graphic and maybe it because the game was exported from Ps4 console (The Rumor) overall the game is run smoothly 50 60 fps with GTX 1050 4 gb with I7 7700 HQ.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-27,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Fantastic game about you guessed it hunting monsters. Monster Hunter games are often described as boss rushes and that is not a terrible description. You fight a large mean beast and take it's organs to make armor and weapons to fight a larger and meaner beast and this cycle continues. The combat is deliberately slow so you actually have to think about when you attack and learn when the monster is open. If you like the combat you'll like the game because that's what you'll be doing. Don't expect much of a story Monster Hunter is all about the combat. Monster Hunter games have never been about the story and even though this is one of the better stories in the series it's still not particularly compelling.There are a lot of quality of life changes compared to older games and this game feels more fluid overall than the older ones so if you've tried to get into Monster Hunter before but it felt too clunky for you give this one a try.There are a lot of people saying this game lacks content but that's only compared to old MH games and those have a crazy amount of content. You'll still get many hours out of this game just maybe not as many as previous entries.The port is not great but not as horrible as people make it sound. It can run 1080p 60fps on fairly high settings on a decently powerful machine just fine. You have to consider that this game runs at around 30 fps at 1080p on consoles and that's at lower settings the graphics of this game are very demanding. I would recommend getting some mods to fix some issues(mainly the low res textures bug workaround google it) but the game works fine without them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

All this plus an amazing soundtrack with a bunch of great battle songs.Overall a great monster hunter title however not without a few minor issues that if addressed would immensly improve the experience for both new and seasoned hunters alike.Issues * Voice Chat Volume This feature does not appear to be working to control other players voice levels. Currently I disabled the feature until they fix it suggest using steam voice chat instead. * Scoutflies ""Hey Listen!""

2018-08-24,0,0,40,False,Recommended,EDIT Appended for Deviljho patch and connectivity solutions.I've invested much more time into the game since the new patch and have decided to re evaluate Monster Hunter World for the PC.My experience with the game thus far has been a huge improvement over the launch version of the game. No disconnection issues no CTDs or BSOD (which may have been due to my own overclocking of my RAM setup from 3600 Mhz and reverting back down to 32000 Mhz) and smooth gameplay. Overall this is what I came to expect from this port when it comes to performance and I come away from it with a positive time since.About the gameMonster Hunter World as a game is actually very very good. This is the most accessible new player friendly entry to date. Streamlined gameplay many QoL changes from previous entries that make for a more fluid faster gameplay experience and excellent controls (despite what some of these idiots on the review thread have been saying about them. If you can't play K+M and you're an MH veteran honestly git gud. K+M is superior to any form of controller for this game. Not only am I a better player with K+M input rate via keyboard and mouse is superior to controller. End of story. Shut up. Sit the hell down. Learn to play). The low rank high rank tempered monster and post game progression is natural and complaints of a lack of G Rank are unfounded and idiotic. Listen kids this is a new entry on a new engine for a new audience that's never experienced a Monster Hunter game. This isn't just for you. Go play Generations Ultimate if you want to cry and whine about the old days. You'll miss all those tasty QoL advances they made in World when you go backward to GU and to say otherwise shows that you're stuck in nostalgia. Get over yourselves.Monster design ranges from old monsters from the franchise's history ported in glorious modern engine visuals and updated movements and attacks to new monsters that are annoying and challenging (like the Bazelgeuse).Overall the game itself is amazing. Multiplayer is pretty good as expected from a Monster Hunter game. Public Astera lobbies are somewhat empty but shooting out the SOS flare will provide you with the multiplayer gaming you'll want. If you have a good group of friends you can play with regularly that'll make your experience that much more enjoyable talking about when you're gonna farm this Temperered or how you're going to mix your decorations builds together is pretty distracting (in a good way). With promiised future free monster updates and perhaps on the horizon a G Rank update and a wider monster roster this could be one of the best Monster Hunter games ever made.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,158,False,Recommended,UPDATE Connection Issue Fixed FPS BetterHonest Review The game is amazing! I normally hate these type of games but have to say I do love this there are 4 main things that made me put off getting it at first and also the things that I don't like so lets talk about those....1 Connection Yes! there is a pain in the **** issue when it comes to this connecting to friends easy joining easy but sometimes (was mainly late game for me) you can get disconnected from the group mid way through a moster battle which still allows you to carry on but everyone else isnt there anymore. Super annoying but not so frequent as people say but you leave and do it again and works for a while. (they are working on it)2 21 9 Support *big sigh* Why they didn't is obvious they didnt know whether their first PC game would get as big as it did it does support my 3440x1440 resolution but caps it at 16 9 for me and my friends we can cope as we have massive monitors so its like playing on a big 16 9 screen still you can jump the resolution down 1 and it will pan out to 21 9 but looks kinda stretched.... BUT THERE IS A MOD COMING OUT TO FIX THIS so for those who really cant have it 16 9 then I would say not to long fingers crossed.3 FPS Its a port like any port its painful at first it can be quite demanding at times like I have 8700k overclocked and 1080ti overclocked with 16gb RAM on a 1440p its average is 70fps but with some monsters when they use a big AOE for example then 5fps for about 5 seconds 1080p would play a lot better but still a rather demanding game NOT UN OPTIMISED BUT DEMANDING there is a difference. (again they are working on it)4 Lipsync It is a japansese game so expect the english dub to be out of sync and sometimes text only can be slightly off putting (still a great story though)However I prefered playing a lot of it solo solo can have a dark souls sorta feel to it and a greater sense of achivement and rewards (this bypasses the connection issue a lot more so becomes even less frequent) the monsters items amour progression and story is amazing and genuinely a really addicting game to play even with the issues that would stop me playing it. This is as honest as i could be cause 9/10 times I would not touch a game reading the issues above but it was worth every penny I paid for this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

My expectation was this game is gonna be incredible what a cool looking weapon WOW GREATSHIELD and a ING BIG SPEAR that can SHOOT holySHIT.As a souls player myself i found it interesting to beat each big hard monster in an epic battle situation and CO OP aswell. The problem was LOCK ON on this game SUCKS. You have to do the battle manually and IT SUCKS.So after 2 hours of trying my way to fight some FLYING monster that can FLY and RUN when hes on LOW heath and then HEALS himself with no LOCK ON. haha NO thanks.so i hope CAPCOM FIX this and until thenI'm out.Refunded.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,215,False,Recommended,2018 09 23 UPDATEThe development team has continued to work on Monster Hunter World. Although the pace of updates isn't exactly fast the multiplayer and mouse issues have been fixed. As such I'm changing this review to positive and I can recommend this game. However everything isn't perfect yet. The keyboard support still isn't superb with some inconvenient and unchangeable keybinds. Some of the graphics bugs were fixed but there is still room for improvement. IntroductionI'm conflicted. Monster Hunter World is a great game. I haven't been this addicted to a video game in years. In fact it's so good that I actually wake up early to squeeze in a few hunts before going to work. I've clocked in over 100 hours since the game was released 2 weeks ago. That's roughly 8 hours of monster hunting per day. I want to recommend this game so more people can experience the fun but I ultimately can't recommend a game that is currently broken. I wish I could write a review about the fun core gameplay or the poorly designed elements but all those aspects of the game are completely overshadowed by the huge issues in this port so let's talk about those instead.Mouse &amp Keyboard SupportIt's clear that the game devs haven't played many PC games and it feels like they did the bare minimum to be able to say they support mice and keyboards. It's rare for a console port to perfectly implement mouse input but I've never seen anything quite as bad as the mouse input in Monster Hunter World. Your mouse emulates a controller joystick. That means that you get a max turn speed input lag and dead zones (i.e. small movements aren't recognized). The default keyboard keybinds are also pretty weird and because of how control schemes were designed with a controller in mind it can't be fixed with re binding. Using something from the radial menu takes 3 clicks when in any other PC game it would be accessible on a hotbar with a single click. Using a mouse and keyboard felt so uncomfortable that I a competitive FPS player ultimately decided to play this game with a controller. Graphics and OptimizationThe game looks pretty good but it's poorly optimized. I generally get 60+ FPS on high with a GTX 1070 and i7 6700k but certain maps and effects cause micro stuttering and FPS drops to the 40s. Many quality settings are outright broken. The game still loads in low res textures regardless of the texture setting. Water reflections and shadows aren't rendered. It's a pity. If this game was well optimized and had high resolution textures it could be beautiful on the PC.MultiplayerWhen multiplayer works the game is at its best. Hunting together with friends is unbelievably fun but the servers are unstable right now. Sometimes I'll play for hours with only a disconnect or two but othertimes I disconnect so frequently that it's impossible to complete a hunt online. Server stability issues aside I believe that the core design of multiplayer in this game should be re designed. You can only see other hunters in your session inside of a specific area of town or on hunts. The whole online session thing feels very dated. If I want to hunt with 3 friends I have to create an online session invite the 3 friends to join my online session post a quest and get my friends to join said quest. Diablo 3 came out 6 years ago and its multiplayer design feels more modern than Monster Hunter's.If you're willing to live with these issues the game can be incredibly fun challenging and rewarding but players shouldn't have to put up with these problems in the first place. Fixing the aforementioned issues wouldn't result in a perfect game but it would result in a game that I could wholeheartedly recommend to my friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-23,0,0,129,False,Recommended,"This is quite possibly the first step into some of the best this serie will offer. No longer will Monster Hunter simply be an other mutation of a Playstation 2 game now it is a fresh start full of oppertunity. With great user friendly quality of life features that will assure you minimal time with a wiki more mobility and a decent pool of new and returning monsters Monster Hunter World is my pick the best game I have played this year despite the fact it came so late in the year. Now maybe the that this game can be absolutly frustrating with Monsters that either bad telegraphs for their attacks or they just don't stop. Maybe sometimes it feels like you're the only thing being targeted. Sometimes it feels like you're weighed down by a few hundred pounds. BUT I can say that all of these problems are small fries compared to the problems in previous MH games. Even then Monster Hunter is not a kind of game for everyone. This is a game for all of you Captain Ahabs out there those who regularly swear revenge on virtual creatures for wiping the floor with your rump. This is for all of you who wants to Hunt a Monster skin it and wrap it's flesh on a sword shaped object to make an absurdly large sword. You have to be in a weird mindset to love this series. Also if you love cats and the idea of cats helping kill large things so you can do the whole ""wrap monster flesh on a sword shaped object to make an absurdly large sword"" then rejoice! You can make a cat buddy just for that!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,121,False,Recommended,They fixed the camera issue and the server issue which were the two main things that made me initially give this game a negative review. I'm changing my recommendation to positive but this game still has it's faults even if i love it. First issue with the game is that there is still no ultrawide support. The other is that Capcom seems to really hate PC players as we are constantly lagging behind the console versions in terms of content. At the time of writing there are still 2 major monsters that have been added to consoles but not to PC (Lunastra and Kulve). TL DR Great game but Capcom handles the PC port poorly,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-11,0,0,82,False,Recommended,At first the game feels way too easy. The developers ease you into the game so it's a slow burn. It's not until the Diablo and Pink Rathian where users start to feel the difficulty enaging. This game is all about grinding monsters repetively to equip yourself for the next big fight. Each individual monster has fantastic art design animations and unique attacks to keep you interested. After a while of over grinding and 82 hours in I beat the main campaign. Game performed fine but i'm on a 1080ti my framerate was low for the amount of graphical detail IMO. Regardless graphically its beautiful and benefits from a variety of extravant locations. I definitely got my money's worth out of this one as it has provided excellent value with hours of enjoyment. The game is not perfect... co op is poorly implemented story is horrid voice acting is good but poor lip syncing and once you get strong enough gear game gets easy again and it could use better optimization graphically. However overall as a newcomer to the series I had a blast!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Weapons 14 styles of different weapons that the game lets you play with as you please each with a bucket load of skill level and unique play style that make them fun and different. you will have to research them and watch some videos.

Maps are open world and you can go and rome in which ever direction you please exploring and FARMING capturing netting fishing cooking...and collecting (dung) litray X ). Animations are great &amp detailed with a dab of dark souls to the boss like large monsters you just so happen to find while running around doing the above.Did i mention you have pet flies who do your sniffing dirty work to track stuff?...nuff said Replayablity and diversity of builds and sets what if I add this armor peace and this weapon OMG I look awsome!...but wait I want this effect and owww...i must have a few of these to try and add to my collection! ( I may look like now due to mixing armours but my stats and spec is on point!) Solo/ Cop will not go into solo as its all there with its bells and whistles but some of us love to CO OP!...learning how to co op at the start was a little tricky what with hosting a game to which people join in a room but are not with you in a party you then post a quest which they can choose to join through a board thus creating a hunting party!Coop style opens up new ways to play the game with weapons and build styles to accomidate the encounters.9.5 out of 10 so far,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

And that's while I skipped several ""bosses"".* Monsters are quite different. At least much more various than I expected initially.* Character presets are made with care.Cons * Hitboxes are unintuitive and annoying. While most of the enemy intended attacks are easy enough to dodge when enemies move they damage you unintentionally.* There are about 7 variations of stun mechanics be ready to spend literally half of a fight being disabled before you learn the monster.* Looks like the game is not ready for multiplayer.

With that the game is very playable and enjoyable.Original Review So far this port is REALLY bad. Keyboard &amp Mouse support is absolutely terrible. Probably the worst is that you can't just bind items to vanilla 1 2 3 and other number keys (By ""vanilla"" I mean you push 1 you use that item like in MMORPG games). You have to press F1 first to bring up a submenu then press a number key. So for example to use grindstone on 1 you have to press F1 then 1. There's no way to rebind the number keys. Also mouse support is tied to joystick movement so it's not true mouse support for camera movement.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Overall I would say it's and 8/10 game accounting for the mouse lag.P.S. I don't think the delux package was worth the extra money a somewhat ugly hair style and facial tattoo don't really feel worth it.*Edit* Due to the recent patch that fixed the god awful mouse support I would like to say that they fixed it well and the new option to enable real mouse mode is exactly what so many people wanted. 9/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-12,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Game is of course very solid. Its fun to hunt isnt too complicated to craft and there are plenty of people to play with. Some actions from previous MH games have either been changed or streamlined like drinking a potion for easier encounters with monsters as you cannot run away to a new area since there are no load screens or screen transitionsThe world itself is very nice. Each map is very interesting and fun to be in and breathtaking to say the least.The monsters are very cool. You've got things that look like raptors and t rex's to demonic dogs and bloaty bats... and dragons/wyverns too of course. (though everything is called a dragon or wyvern for some reason)It runs great on my Deluxe Blasting Toaster even with Denuvo or whatever its called. If my PC was a little stronger it could easily run it higher than 60fps but as it is now it barley runs it at 60fps which of course isnt a real problem as on console (the original releases of the game) it was locked at 30fps. It looks better and the DRM really isnt holding it back though it would be nice if it wasnt there at all but this being the MH Team's first PC release I cant blame them for wanting to keep thier product safe from piracy even if in the long run it doesnt ultimatly work.All in all Its a very good game worth the price as I've bought it on Xbone and PC now things are streamlined for better gameplay monsters are great gameplay is great the world is great and it runs great.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Which will also eat hundreds of your hours depending on your luck to get the items that you need.The game is better with friends but it's just as fun if you'd rather play solo.My criticisms only involve the network connections alongside the optimisation which the game provides options for you to customise depending on how powerful your rig is and lastly the controls were awkward to start with with the keyboard especially with the ranged weapons.

While there my cat companion tames and recruits a Girros (snake lizard) to help out as well. Between the Girros' paralyzing bite and the cat's paralyzing weapon (Kitty of the valley rod) the Odogaron is paralyzed several times letting me land lots of free hits Manage to slash a toxic plant and lure the monster into the puddle poisoning it Monster flees all the way back to its lair.

2018-09-06,0,0,258,False,Recommended,Thoughts on what the game is about I already came in knowing what monster hunter was going to be as a game. I played mh4u for hours upon hours. I can say as a mh game its really good. It has nice QoL features added which is nice. The gameplay is fun since I love the series. I even branched out to the great sword for the first time and thats all i played so far for now (I mained CB in 4U). Would i want more monsters? Sure but i'm hoping they are planning on adding a snow area when they put out grank and on top of that more elders. It will be fun to Experience that. Performance So I am fortunate to have a pretty beast PC with a 1080 Ti inside of it. I turn off volume rendering and i get from 80 100 fps with everything else at max settings. I have experienced frame drops against teostra which actually was fixed by me downloading the newest nvidia driver. Before that it was dropping to 30s randomly but now it only drops to like 55 60 which is still annoying. Against the Kushala Daora though it still drops to 30 at his ultimate tornado move that has like 3 tornados. Thunder particles made me drop but it wasn't as bad as the other two. Controls I decided to try out kb/m and chose the great sword. Honestly i can feel like acceleration but changing the sensitivity higher made it so much better. Of course i wish they would put a fix out soon because it does get annoying at times. It honestly isn't that hard to use the keyboard either since you need to change like 2 or 3 keybindings. Using the great sword has been fun on kb/mConnection I have to say i did disconnect at the most annoying times. It was even consistent either. It just disconnected to with some of my friends and I. I can say it was annoying disconnecting during the first zorah fight. Since it took so long i feel like the connection timed people out because of nothing really happening. Since the patch before this i only had 2 disconnects luckily. Never tried this patch out yet but i heard connection problems are back. I have to say this game would be a 10/10 but since there are issues with the port I cannot give it a 10/10. It is a 9/10 for me based on gameplay and just it being mh. The other issues really suck since they should have been tested. Its actually ridiculous. Its like they never even bothered testing. Felt like they just ported it and just worked on the steam integration and that was it. Its even more hilarious that they were talking about bringing out quality ports LOL. Well I hope this game will have those issues fixed eventually but I'm going to give this one a thumbs up since my experience has been good. Edit Motion blur fixed connection fixed and frame drops fixed. Now they just need to catch up on dlc and fix those damn textures!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,105,False,Recommended,This was my first Monster Hunter game I've ever played and despite the fact that I am recommending this it will probably be my last. Pros The monster hunts are intense and excitingThe open class system that is defined by what weapons you pick makes it easy to switch up how the game plays and how you handle hunts allowing for tons of fun ways to play the gameThe difficulty grows at a reasonable rateYou can handle any hunt solo or with other hunters so it appeals to to solo and coop players alikeCons Story is short most of the time I spent playing I spent farming for parts off of monsters I had already hunted several timesEnd/Post game content is severely disappointing. Rather than new creatures or uniquely styled encounters you simply continue fighting the same things with bigger numbers. This didn't appeal to me.End game equipment farming for min/maxing requires farming monsters for specific crystals which are then used to be randomized into gems...two layers of RNG to keep you from your final builds with cost barriers between each points makes it a grueling experienceEnding thoughts Fun game easy to sink a ton of time into it but the end and post game content fall short of what that could have been. Definitely recommend getting it maybe not at full price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you hate slow clunky controls and long drawn out animations you might want consider passing this title up too. It's modernized to a point but it's still monster hunter at it's core. You still here? Good. The gameplay is fine. Not great but certainly fun enough. The graphics are okay and performance is decent. Why the negative review? For a lots of reasons the gameplay is just ""fine"". Combine this with the multitude of bugs I have encountered and I cannot give monster hunter world a postive review. This may be the most buggy AAA release I have played in some time. Quests breaking bosses breaking graphical errors texture errors horrible hitboxes odd hit registry terrible connectivity cutscene issues online connectivity issues with cutscenes voice lines breaking sound breaking sound endlessly repeating uneven sound design camera bugs and many many more. Now the real question is does this happen often enough to have a negative impact on your experience? Yes yes it does.

2018-08-28,0,0,254,False,Recommended,Overall this is a great game and you can put many hours in it without getting bored.It looks great and there are new event quests coming every week and there is always more stuff to do.There are some flaws with it though. For once the game has performance issues in some cases like fighting Teostra or when using thunder element weapons. For me that isn't a dealbreaker and especially after the online mode got (mostly) fixed you can really enjoy the game with friends! There are some disconnects here and there but it's not unplayable anymore. I would also highly recommend playing this game on a controller since the mouse movement is really bad right now and seems to just emulate a controllstick. Every action is rebindeable to a diffrent key though and you have full customizeability with the keyboard controlls. Capcom also stated that they are looking into fixing the mouse camera movement.I can't give this game an absolute recommendation but if you like Monster Hunter and/or really grindy games chances are that you like this one!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I played for 3 hours straight I dont nomrally play any game that long even games I love. This is such a challenging game. I can see why they have such a die hard fan base. The character customization was awesome too I spend over 20 minutes just making my character.Im on Windows 10 Intel i7 6700k 4.5 GhzIve got 16 Gb of RamAMD RX480 8 Gb VramIve had no issues running at max settings 1920x1080 with over 60 steady fps. I was also streaming my gameplay at the same time. I haven't had to turn off Volumetric Rendering I did however have to enable the xbox one controller for it to work but that took 30 seconds. Overall i can see myself losing a lot of hours to this game. The game runs smooth as butter the sound is amazing(im playing with a 5.1 surround sound set up) the controls are awesome if you have a xbox controller and the learning curve is nothing to serious. The only con is that the default keyboard set up is not intuative at all they're very bad actually but its not even a problem since I play with a controller.

2018-10-23,0,0,441,False,Recommended,Having played at least 200 hours of each and every iteration of Monster Hunter since Freedom Unite I have to agree with many that World is much easier challenge wise than its predecessors. Despite this I feel that MHW is the apex predator of the franchise. As lean and mean as a Tigrex World distills the essence of the MH spirit into an easily digestible cocktail that is no less intoxicating than any entry that came before it.Purists will argue that many aspects of the hunt have been culled to near extinction. While there are certainly features that I miss from the legacy games I have to admit that World's design benefits from being so tightly focused. It somehow feels more like the older games than the more recent ones and perhaps this is because World truly feels like a fresh start for the series. There aren't as many monsters as I would normally expect from a MH game but with the resounding commercial success of the title I'm sure Capcom will remedy that given enough time.Whether you're planning to go solo or play with others if you're interested in the game's premise it's well worth a buy.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you asking me to rate for this game I would give 8 to 9 points out of 10 for the gameplay but Co op Multiplayer RPG game that the internet server is so suck I'm gonna rate 0 out of 100 points for this game!

2018-10-29,0,0,232,False,Recommended,I remember when I first started playing monster hunter tri. Back when there were graphics and clunky game mechanics. Still good enough to pretty much hook me on the series forever. Now Monster Hunter is finally on modern consoles / PC and fits there perfectly. I'm generally super cheap but I bought a PS4 to play this game when it launched in January 2018 then bought the game again for PC in August. 600+ hours across the two platforms and counting no regrets so far.Don't let the undeniably clunky and weird early hours of the game put you off. Monster hunter games always put you through some mundane tutorial stuff for the first few missions then turn you loose into the actual game which is amazingly fun (and addicting). Monster hunter is a bit niche but notice how the game's ratings are climbing quite quickly on steam as time goes on. Humans love Monster Hunter. It just takes a bit of time to get there.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,132,False,Recommended,(PROS)Starting off with the good The game itself is really ing good the gameplay is amazing hunting giant dragon/wyverns/snake lizards has probably never been portrayed better than in this game. You can choose from 14 weapons all different playstyles getting an armor more suited to your weapon/playstyle/situation can change absolutely everything. And an extra + there are a lot more maps (that are all pretty big and open) than you would think there would be in a roughly 17gb game.(CONS)Now onto the bad As of now they released a patch to fix the network issues. The game isn't for everyone i've had some friends moan about the fights taking too long sometimes (like 15 to 20 mins) and I think the game will get kinda repetitive after you beat every monster and do all the main/optional quests.But other than that the game is awesome.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"**Edit I am going to go ahead and change this to recommended. Since I wrote this apparently connection issues are a lot rarer either that or we just got lucky and really the connection issues were my biggest complaint in terms of actual functionality. The rest in terms of having fun has workarounds for the most part. Hopefully they continue to fix the rest of the bugs but I've put about 75 hours in and am ready to move on to different games so I won't be playing enough to know whether the bugs were completely fixed or not. I personally am still a bit miffed about the mouse issues. I'm not sure if they've been fixed because my fix got essentially the same functionality but it seems like such an easy thing to implement I really don't know why it wasn't available at launch. Just using raw mouse input and a scaling multiplier shouldn't have been an issue.And again even including all the issues I still thoroughly enjoy the game. So much so that I put 75 hours into it. I just had a hard time (And still have a hard time) recommending it at this price point. I'd suggest making sure the bogs are fixed before sinking this much money into the game.And now on with the original review because I feel it's important to leave this up for full disclosure about what my experience with the game was at the pc launch. Honestly as somebody new to monster hunter and who hasn't played a capcom game in quite a while this game is great. It's just a ton of fun the whole way through. There were only a couple fights that I didn't enjoy the actual content is all a ton of fun and the story is surprisingly not awful (Though I wouldn't recommend it based on the story alone). My only real complaint is that the combat isn't quite as tight as I feel like it could be but as all my avid monster hunter friends tell me that's the staple of the combat of this series so I suppose I can't quite bash the game for that given it's part of why so many people love it.However the bugs are unforgivably bad in it's current state. I'm glad I bought the game because I would have missed progressing with my friends (Who are all long term fans) but I do not recommend the game in it's current state. Especially not for $60.You have to edit an ini file to get the mouse even remotely usable (Change in game sensitivity to 100 and lowering the ""MouseBaseSpeed x.xxxxxx"" value in the config.ini to taste. I have it set to 0.300000) because they insisted on using the mouse to control a virtual joystick rather than using raw input limiting your max rotation speed to the in game sensitivity setting with your mouse speed multiplier set at an obscene 2x by default. But even this is a poor fix because all you're doing is lowering the mouse base speed multiplier enough that you never hit the virtual joystick's max speed.The game uses textures that are far lower resolution ones than the console versions due to a bug. Particularly important things like the armor you wear. Some people have said this is an issue with the game failing to render the armor at the proper lod level which makes sense but take the word of internet strangers on the cause with a grain of salt. I frankly don't know why it happens but whatever it is results in terribly low resolution textures compared to everything else in the game.There's an end game bug where you crash and corrupt your entire save at the final fight losing 60 80 hours of work. (Thankfully I haven't run into this one). The workaround we used was first backing up your save file iirc it's in a weird spot in the steam folder?) then disabling auto saves so the likelihood of it attempting to save then crashing and corrupting the data was lower during the final fight.And networking... Oh my word the networking.People have had to temporarily remove me from their steam friend's list because monster hunter constantly tells steam it's starting spamming friends with ""Somebody is playing Monster Hunter World"" notifications from all of their friend's playing this game.Don't launch private online sessions. They are awful. Just use public sessions they seem far more stable in our experience and strangers rarely join them anyway. They constantly disconnect and people can't reconnect to the same session id because the session NEVER realizes they are no longer connected so it will deny their new connection because it thinks they are still in the session.The game constantly disconnects everybody in the party during fights but doesn't scale the monster's health down to compensate. So you suddenly find yourself fighting a multiplayer health monster solo for 40 minutes because you used a daily voucher to increase the quest rewards and you don't want to waste it.Even just alt tabbing has a very high chance of disconnecting you from online sessions.And a myriad of other issues that I won't bother to type out here.If they update the game to fix all the issues we've had I'll change this to recommended because the game itself is fantastic. But for now it's not a game I can recommend buying at it's current price point with this many large glaring bugs.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,150,False,Recommended,Not the best monster hunter (yet)but not bad for PC port.Still need a lot of improvement in terms of graphics and performanceI am running 1080p resolution with GTX 1070Ti the FPS drops to 40 on Jungle area.Other than that they fixed (80% safe) of the network issue Yes this is for casual monster hunter.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-11,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Monster hunter world is an exceptional addition to the series and a great place to start for new players. I realize that some players have had some issues with saves which is unfortnate but I have not experienced this myself. There have also been some negitive reviews based entirely on performance drops in game... these seem fairly harsh based on my experience. I've only expereineced performance drops against one end game monster (due to the attack it uses) and Capcom has already released an update to smooth out this problem Even when that fight stuttered it was such a minor part of the game it wouldn't have been enough for me to give this game a thumbs down.Do not get me wrong MHW has some problems as many of the other reviews point out but Capcom has already released a couple patches to help improve performance and introduce new content. The game won't appeal to everyone but I would recommend at least giving it a try.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-11,0,0,99,False,Recommended,My first Monster Hunter game played for 88 hours so far I'd say it's mostly enjoyable.What I liked The graphics while not perfect it was pretty enough for me to like it.Variety of equipment you got many choices to go with for weapons and armours so there's something for everyone (almost).The gameplay a mostly enjoyable experience once you bet better at the game itself. Also you'll get front row seats and even participation when 2 or more large monsters start fighting each other.Variety of monsters it's a small world but there's a fair amount of different monsters to hunt.What I disliked The damn cat while it does have its moments ultimately I decided that it's more useless than usefulAnimations (for lancer at least since I didn't really like the other weapons as much) I've played around with a few weapons and it's rather fustrating seeing how slow most of these weapons are handled such as sheathing weapon or trying to guard after an attack and I found lancer sidestep to be useless for anything more than getting back into attacking. Also the dazed animation I don't understand why you have to stand up while dazed rather than just staying on the floor.Reskinned monsters I know every game does it but that doesn't mean I have to like or accept it. Character creation your choices are really limited and no sliders for the body that's just lazy.Well to be honest it was more of a frustrating game but it'll keep you coming back for more and you will like it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,"Edit 9/11/18I haven't had a connection error in a while since one of the patches. The game now restarts my PC on launch. I've been really enjoying this game and will probably come back and edit this review if CAPCOM ever fixes the issues with multiplayer. Some pros The combat The variety of weapons and armors For the most part well designed monsters Loading times Jumping in with friends to take down a monsterThe cons Multiplayer barely works. When you have multiple people on a hunt the monsters health is multiplied by 2.6. When you disconnect and are soloing the monster it still has the health multiplier and your rewards at the end are divided by 4 for being in multiplayer. Disconnecting spams you with two back to back notifications you much click ok on. If this happens mid fight at the wrong time it can mean death. Spams your friends with ""User has started playing Monster Hunter"" every few minutes. Poorly optimized go from 90fps to 14 in some cases. Mouse and keyboard controls are garbage. There is a very limited transmog system. You can layer your armor and there is only one option samurai. The coop. The leader must watch the cutscene solo quit and then restart to play the quest with friends who are either on the same quest or well past it. Many parts of the game are not explained. Such as eldarseal or affinity. Scoutflies (in game gps which can be considered a con in itself) get confused easily and often. Unskippable cutscenes.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

As long as the continue to fix it I'll be happy enough.Onto the game it's pretty good but can be very grindy however it doesnt feel like it and I am happy the game finally on PC and hopefully we are in sync with the content consoles have before the year ends,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,249,False,Recommended,Preface This is my second helping of MHW after playing roughly 300 hours on PS4 so it must be good enough to WANT such second helpings. I've also played older generation styles such as 4 Ultimate and Generations Ultimate so it's important to note that I'm not writing this review having only experienced the newer Westernized version of Monster Hunter. Pros Decently wide variety of monsters available with DLC content arriving for free on a somewhat regular basis. Excellent moment to moment gameplay in the weapons with each weapon bringing something else unique to the table Gameplay improvements over older generation monster hunter games such as guaranteed combinations without a Book of Combos or increased mobility while consuming an item(with the counterpoint of longer stun durations etc.) Massive graphical improvements over last generation of games removal of loads inbetween zones on a map Monster Hunter on PCCons Poor optimization although it is improving. Massive online connectivity issues once again improving. Limited monster pool when compared to older generation games DecorationsOverall despite the flaws with the game both performance wise and with gameplay elements like Decorations Monster Hunter World still has a fantastic core gameplay experience fully capable of filling a hundred hours with the efforts towards unlocking all quests. The monsters save a few like Lavasioth are all enjoyable to fight and improve against and going from weapon to weapon provides a drastically different playstyle able to keep someone interested for much longer than other similar 3rd person action RPGs. It's worth the $60 price tag but if you're hesitant it's probably best to wait for a sale.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-20,0,0,219,False,Recommended,State of the Game (9/20/2018)Controls True mouse movement added in 9/20 patch ranged weapons feel very solid and agile now. Bow still has the 'fire at last position after dodge' feature which is awful for KB+M but it is very easy to break the reticle lock now with improved mouse movement. Disable extra focus/autoaim features as desired (some are still helpful for melee). Keyboard controls are good if you spend 3 minutes customizing them a little bit. Use the F1 F4 hotkey menus instead of the default radial menu change 'menu confirm' hotkey to Space and 'remove/register/etc' to R. Removes most of the unnecessary clicking and keyboard gymnastics will save you hours of your life over your playtime.Performance Decent as of 2 patches ago in line with the performance gained by doing pre patch workarounds. New default Nvidia profile no longer causes the game to trip over itself when SLI is enabled although SLI is not yet supported (game does not use the 2nd card at all). Certain monster and environmental particle effects no longer cause massive FPS drops. Anecdotal 55 100fps 1440p on a GTX1080 running 2025Mhz core clock all settings maxed except Volume Rendering and AA. Volume Rendering does more harm than good (color washout with minor foggy feel for massive fps drop) AA I prefer to force 4x or 8x through Nvidia Control Panel if I do use it (I don't for MHW).Multiplayer No disconnect issues for over a month now. Never really had problems connecting to people or staying connected after the first week following release but your mileage may vary. Still plenty of Tempered Investigations on the board every night.Gameplay Very solid and fun for the first 200 hours. A little stale after that if you're like me and still only using 1 weapon. Likely countless hours more of enjoyment if you like to experiment and/or speedrun. Still behind the console releases on content updates hoping for a big catchup during the Fall.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-08,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a solid experience with a lot of QOL improvements to the series that maake it a lot more welcoming to new players. At launch it suffered from constant connection issues but I havem't experience those in the last weeks. A commonly stated annoyance is having to wait for a cutscene to play before inviting friends in story missions. This is irritating but pretty easy to get past as it really only lasts into the first bit of gameplay and you will have toio much fun hunting to notice after a bit. It's lacking some PC performance QOL things like ultra wide screen and it's very much a console port but it plays way better than on my PS4 and I can hunt with my friends. Solid game. Solid fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-09,0,0,518,False,Recommended,My First Monster Hunter game... and will not be my last!I'm a little shocked to see the reviews are mixed on this game tbh. I understand quite a few players had issues with the performance in game when it first came out but there were fixes for those. I myself had no issues at all on my i7 4790k 16gb of ram and 1070sc.So I knew I would be having to dig both feet in with this game. I had horrors of there being hundreds of mechanics and confusing systems to get my head around. Fortunately the game did a reasonable job of introducing these things at a good pace to the player and for everything else there was google. The game has 14 types of weapon available to you and you begin by having all 14 in your armour inventory to try. Some are easier to get to grips with than others but there should be a weapon to suit everyones playstyle. Before you get going you might want to plug in a controller or get one. Learn to play with one now rather than later as 100 hours in I had to switch as using a bow in game is just a pain in the backside with the mouse and keyboard.Along with the weapons theres the amour sets. As you obtain new materials new armours become available. Armour pieces have skills attached to them. So for example your chest BONE piece may have +2 attack. By equiping other armour pieces from various sets you can max out the attack bonus.. i.e 2 on chest 1 on gloves 2 on legs etc...This can leave you looking a little odd sometimes but the results are noticible and it means you have something to work for in game. I'm now a 200 hours in and can see myself doing at least another 200 hours more. With more weapons to craft and master.. new gear to get.. and new monsters to take out.. i'll be playing this game for sometime to come!Oh just a word on those wanting to play with friends. It is an odd mechanic to get into the same game as your buddy.. but once you have done it a few times it is quite simple. Firstly if you are planning on doing a main mission with a friend then you'll both have to have seen the cut sequences first. After that you'll be able to join in. The main campaign will take about 40 80 hours.. maybe longer depending on how you want to do it. But the game really does get going after the main story is over. So multiplayer after the main campaign is much much better but still highly viable before its complete.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,Cannot recommend this game at this time. I really hope they make some significant changes/patches to how multiplayer works at which time maybe I'll change my recommendation. Not worth the price tag with the issues it has.It's pretty and somewhat fun as a single player game... but that's the only way you can play it. Bought it with the intention of playing with friends however you cannot join eachothers story quests... so it stagnates the game. Basically all you can play as co op are the optional/event driven content. Sometimes you can join another players story quest if 1) You've already completed the quest and 2) There are no cutscenes that the other player has to watch. Really stupid. Even if you are on the exact same story quest as your friend you can't join them on the quest! What were the devs thinking?Then if you manage to find a magical combination of quests/events that you can play with your friends there's a very high chance that you or your friends will be disconnected and not be able to rejoin... so you have to exit and try again.Also the controls are pretty terrible unless you use a controller so there's that. And even with the controller they feel kind of clunky.Lots of work needed for this to be considered a good multiplayer game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

In addition to the well designed boss behaviors the level of possible interaction with the environment during these fights are mind blowing and I'm not just talking about the monster vs monster fights. Your knowledge of the flora and terrain matter because you can craft mid way through a fight perhaps grab a honey to create high potions blue plants to craft antidotes traps when you run out because every fight seems to be an enduring one.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,141,False,Recommended,I'll be honest. Monster Hunter World is my first MH game. I went in (to console) knowing absolutely nothing. Coming to PC I expected a decent ish port of the game I had already sunk about 200 hours in on xbox. Did I get that? Honestly yes. The game itself is still fun as hell I'm not having any performance issues or technical problems and it's gotten me excited for the franchise as a whole again.THAT BEING SAID. There is a couple glaring issues that capcom needs to sort out ASAP. The mouse and keyboard controls can be pretty atrocious for some players and the lack of proper keybinding can be a killer.And the network issues. Not being able to play with friends at times is extremely frustrating.With those two issues in mind Capcom has already announced that they're working on both of these problems and I still would heavily recommend the game for anyone who wants to just murder a ton of giant monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,96,False,Recommended,P.S.I finally beat the game it only took 76.8 hoursAnd by beat the game I mean I beat the Story of the game not the actual game as there is a lot more content to do and future content to do. There are tempered monsters (even more powerful versions of monsters) and later new Elder Dragons that will make the greatest of Tempered Monsters look like Scrublords. Note to those complaining about MP Servers or Stability on Nvidia Machines Rollback drivers to previous patch for Nvidia WoW patch broke MHW (likely not provided to them for review prior to launch in a timely fashion aka leading to things that were previously functioning to no longer do so)MP Servers disable Steam overlay should* fix MP issues not a recommended fix however as it only happens occasionally but the recent (random) friends update changes to Steam Overlay BROKE their multiplayer not the other way around blame Gabe not CapcomHow do we know that these are the reasons things are failing and not something else?Well when you rollback the driver say hello to 30+fps recoveredFurthermore Steam overlay appears to be causing disconnection issues as when it is not present no such issues occurGame itself is great the later game monsters function like Raid Bosses with massive crazy mechanics and test you to your limits. When you are done complaining about struggling to kill an Anjanath and eventually hit 'Late' Game wherein you start to fight Elder Dragons you begin to wish for Anjanath to come back to you.At least Anjanath doesn't fly leave explosives everywhere oneshot KO you THROUGH fire resistance and blast resistance stacking and is far far slower than some of the later game bosses. Of which can cut your health in half (literally) if you get touched even once by their breath attacks (allowing an otherwise 'easy' boss much harder than an Anjanath still mind you to oneshot you). That's of course discounting the constant damage that this other boss deals to you every second while trying to oneshot you in the meantime...The game is a lot of fun has a very high skill ceiling and most importantly has at least* 100 hours of content more to come in FREE 'DLC' that adds more Monsters complete with new armor sets events quests and well the Monster. In Monster Hunter World for Console a Behemoth (from Final Fantasy) was added in as a Monster in the DLC and it is the deadliest monster out there (having access to all manner of magic and entirely new things that we hadn't seen before). Nethertheless to say the game will definitely get you your money's worth as long as you aren't running it on a toaster.Go do a 'can I run it' check before buying and if you don't know what your GPU or CPU is off the top of your head odds are you cant run it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Despite what people are saying about the performance issues I ran the game on an i5 6500 and a GTX 1060 3GB at 1080p. I played the game with Textures set to 1024 with ""Prioritize Resolution"" The game was smooth at 60FPS with little to no drops in framerate. The only issues with the game is the 1/4 online quests where I disconnect with my friends in the middle thus everyone needs to finish the quest individually. Sucks to do that with a supportive hunting horn though...Pros Smash monsters. Carve up monsters. Grind. Rinse and repeat. All weapons are equally viable.Cons Hours of life poured into the game. Cutscenes are forced onto your retina's in the most painful way possible. People online b&amp m ing about optimizations and that their GTX 1080 can't run the game with 144 fps on their 4k monitor.

UPDATES NEW MONSTERS GREAT ADDITIONSCons1cooking. 6 slots for food 3 pairs. that means 3 pairs of a food type gives you the largest benefit feel free to mix and match if you want maybe 2 pairs of a meat and 1 pair of fish is pretty standard the other important thing is freshness which gives you an HP bonus. and i cant stress how important it is to eat before at the start of a hunt.2ok so multiplayer is usually fine for me but one hting thats weird is that a monster's hp goes up to scale with the party but its a linear growth if u hunt with a party of 2 or a party of 4 the monsters will have the same hp so i doesnt matter if you have a full or partial party the monster HP is still going to be the same so its kinda lame to hunt with just 2 people 3 I hope in time they add a more complete in game guide of things like arena quests and expeditions. there are special rewards from arena and it offers a great way to learn new weapons and expeditions are a super great way to learn maps and stuff (here's a special trick not a lot of people know) the fortify skill makes u superman and in expeditions u can die as much as u want so if u do just keep going and ull get stronger and make hunting monsters that would usually be out of your league much easier. ok heres a list of my fav armor skills tips and tricks and the important ones for a couple playstylesin almost any build marathon runner stamina surge and constitution will be helpful but even more so with lance gunlance AND ESPECIALLY DUAL BLADES. in past monster hunter games u could get infinite stamina (a resource u use to dodge and run in game) from an item but in MHW its only a buff to your stamina not an infinite supply. devine blessing is a real life saver take it over defense skill any day health can be increased to a total of 150 from eating food but if you have the armor skill that icreases your maximum HP it stacks with your food for a grand total of 200 a real ""monster"" hp bar to help you survive. all the recovery skills for ur HP regen and recovery from potions is super helpful. maybe the best thing for you is the free meal skill if ur having trouble with a specific monster. ""Airborne' is a great skill if u want to increase your attack because its a percentage of your damage not just a flat increase like most others which is pretty lame. weaknes exploit is is probably the most important skill for u non airborne buds or use ""focus"" for switch axe bow great sword and hammer. and ""artillery"" for gunlance and switch axeSUPER IMPORTANT your slinger is god tier it can stagger monsters get them out of the air AND they can help u traverse the map especially in coral highlands these things called wedge beetles let you grapple onto them. and save u a ton of time. there are some on every map but coral highlands is the most important to learn the locations of they are little orange things and when u aim the slinger it prompts u to grapple it tracking is dope but u have to spend a bit of time finding tracks there are traps in the environment all over ""final boss"" in story has rocks on the outside of the arena that u can drop to do TONS of damage shave off like 5mins of your hunt.sprint while u drink potions to save your lifeapparently theres a word cap (",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-20,0,0,198,False,Recommended,Been a fan of the MH series since the first gen. MIssed the 4th gen.I would say it's a huge improvement from the previous games in terms of QoL. No more paintballs unlimited pickaxes and nets better harvesting NPC lots of other more ways to get materials no more loading zones between screens smooth gameplay revamped skill system that allows for more customisation instead of just focusing on a few skills better transition between movesets on weapons stunning graphics.However there are some issues that people consider negative but could be in the grey area. Monsters are more unpredicatable compared to the past now they could roar 2 to 4 times in a row this makes for speedrunning a bit of luck based but from another perspective it adds depth to the monster's actions instead of just easily predicting what the monster will do next which makes gameplay mechanical once you get used to it. Hitboxes are still generally larger with some moves (charge tail whip fireballs etc). Biggest pet peeve would be the variety of monsters. It's common consensus within the community that more monsters should have been in the game most of the monsters you can find are wyvern types which makes it feel like a lack of variety. They have been adding monsters over time but it could be faster. Probably gonna get a big update on the 1 year anniversary of the console to G rank with more monsters. End game grind is real but it's also optional so don't worry too much on that unless you're persistent on maxing out your build down to thatl extra 5 to 20 damage.Overall rating 8.5/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,126,False,Recommended,A few months back I got Monster Hunter World (MHW) for the Xbox One. MHW is my second monster hunter game as I started on Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. If you enjoyed a previous monster hunter game definitely get this one. The huge step up in graphics quality of life and gameplay makes this game definitely worth a buy. For people who have never played a monster hunter game it's might be worth a try. Only buy MHW if you enjoy the gameplay of similar games like Dark Souls. The combat in the game is slower with boss fights sometimes taking upwards of 30 minutes but they stay exciting the whole time. The graphics look great even on low settings. Now the story for the game is linear and unexciting and the characters are bland. If you want to play the game multiplayer either stick to the side quests or be willing to go through the tedious process of starting the mission separately finding the monster watching the cutscene leaving the mission and finally rejoining together. This is necessary for every story mission. But again don't play this game for the story the gameplay makes up for it in every way.

2018-08-12,0,0,55,False,Recommended,"I've been playing it a bunch since it came out and I'm absolutely loving it. I usually play with friends but even if they aren't onlkine I can always find randoms or play solo. It's great to play and learn how to master a weawpon knowing that if I ever get bored of it there are 13 others to pick up and learn. There is small input lag with the menu cursor and some problems connecting with friends through multiplayer (it works but you need to know how to make it work. It would help if they made it as easy as inviting a friend and them clicking ""accept"" to join your session.) those are pretty much the only problems I have had and I know I'll be grinding this game for a long time to come. I really recommend this game if you have a squad of friends to play with (usually 4 people in total) but even if you play solo I'm sure you'll have a great time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,278,False,Recommended,This is my first Monster Hunter game and I am absolutely in love with it. The skill curve was a bit daunting at the start and the sheer amount of stuff I needed to learn about off the bat was almost overwhelming but it was so so worth sticking with the game. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic and playing with other people is incredibly fun. I HIGHLY recommend this game it is very addicting and fun. Some of the most fun I've had in any game in a long time.That being said I can completely understand why this game is getting very mixed reviews. There's quite a few issues(some connection issues sometimes with online play some FPS issues and a few other random various bugs). While these are very valid issues and people's concerns are also valid...I'm sure the dev team is working on fixing these issues. Once they do this game will be even better. Keep in mind this game has a TON of players playing the game(I saw it hit over 300k concurrent earlier) and there's only 12k reviews at the time of me posting this. I feel like the people having issues with the game or people who just don't enjoy the game are a very small fraction of the actual playerbase.My advice If you're at least somewhat interested in the game then just go ahead and buy it. If you have issues with it or just simply don't enjoy it you can always refund it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Great game. If you like grinding for weopons and upgrades this game is it! Amazing content. Love the skill needed to master each weopon. Been playing Kinsect for 11 hours now and still learning new moves. Can't wait to learn all 14 weopons! The only downside I find Is that you don't see the monster his health. Maybe something for the future. Would be nice to know when you're almost done killing him.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Least intimidating of the bunch (and accessible). Still not at the level where I'd expect such a popular franchise to be but neither was Pokemon. Maybe high selling franchises know that whatever they put out will be bought. The large hit boxes on the environment drive me mad. For an exploring game I'd appreciate the ability to explore just a bit more. Multiplayer is kind of whack. That being said I'm not sure anyone has figured out the magic multiplayer equalibrium between MMO and single player game with almost an illusion of multiplayer. The grind feels nice. The exploration feels nice. The customization feels nice. The d/c'ing from the servers while playing with friends isn't nice although it is the weekend following launch. I'm pretty sure that the lore of Monster Hunter exactly matches how the Japanese (say they) do research on whales.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,156,False,Recommended,Rewriting my review since I actually enjoy playing the game and the game is finally below 50% score.I'm still LR (low rank) and have 30 hours at the moment while writing this also this is my first Monster Hunter game. The game is very fun and I had a blast playing with others. The design to the game and its mechanics are good. This is a perfect adventure game with multiplayer if everything goes alright. There's an expansive item and crafting system so there's a lot of utility and builds. Player classes are based off weapons you are carrying. Every monster is unique has strengths and weaknesses and monsters have states in combat. There's very good game design.However there are many issues in this game/port. I don't have as much as a problem with FPS etc because I have an Intel i7 7700k and an AMD RX 580 so I get 50 60 FPS. Older hardware will have MANY ISSUES! Especially how DENUVO (DRM) requires that your CPU has the FMA3 instruction set otherwise the game will crash. The multiplayer design is really bad where posted quests only show up in your 16 maxplayer sessions otherwise you need to use SOS flares in the field/quest to reach ALL sessions where rewards are disabled for joiners when 10 min in the quest passes. You are unable to coop story missions from the start because it's solo restricted at the start of all story missions where you have to play to a certain part and watch cut scenes first. So don't expect to play through the whole game with your friends as you will have to fight against the game's multiplayer system to do that it's truly atrocious. But it's ok if you play with randoms only. This game also has DENUVO where you have to be online to play and it's a pretty heavy duty DRM so watch out. And lastly as of now there are network/server hiccups/errors that sometimes randomly happen where you will be disconnected from your sessions even if you create the session and it's only you. You are required to be in a session to do any sort of multiplayer.If you can deal with all the cons then the game will be very fun and worth the buy in my opinion,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,150,False,Recommended,Game is absolutely fantastic and addictive but it's a pretty terrible port it's a beautiful game but for example the witcher 3 looks 5 times better and it requires half the requirements. The online is inconsistent but as long as you don't make a private session to play with friends you should be okay for most of the time but there are still some disconnects even on public sessions.It also has some bugs like for example 5 10 fps dropping when using certain electric weapons (if you cap the fps to 30 it still drops to 25 for no reason really weird bug) which is a shame because the electric effects look freaking sick.The game is super rich and deep though even with the negatives I still have to strongly recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,Both exceptionally good and incredibly disappointing. Gameplay primarily solo despite option to play multiplayer there's significant disadvantages such as lower rewards and much longer fights.And whilst it has approx 60h storyline (with the option to play much longer) i still cant feel the urge to play much further after getting to this stage... 20minute boss fights are great initially or as a one off but every single quest lasting this long(or longer) ends up becoming increasingly tiresome.Combat feels sluggish often unresponsive. Dying after being stunned 5 seconds ago just to watch it happen without the option to respond isnt enjoyable. One endgame boss in particular does nothing but cc after cc and if you get close to them you're cc'd again which drags out an otherwise potentially enjoyable 10 15 minute fight into a tedious 40 minutes of boredom and this sums up the entire experience of the game.It has its upsides but the downsides are numerous.Edit there were points throughout the game where it was great but towards the end you have no other option but to 1v1 the same boss fights youve already endured numerous times already.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,This game is awesome! We played only a bit so far but it was super fun no mayor issues we only had to restart the game because it wouldn't let join to my friend.The most important thing is that you can't join a quest that has cutscenes or babysitting but iff you both start the quest you wil get the message when can you send the flare. One of you drops and and comes back to the other players game. This way we were able to play most of the game in coop so far Dx resize error seams to be fixed by setting the game on borderless window mode.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Really fun game but the coop integration is really meh. Can't join a quest with friends if everyone hasn't seen the cutscenes on that specific mission? What? Why can't we progress through the story and watch the cutscenes together? Straighup cant do some quests with friends friends disconnect randomly at times sometimes the party system doesn't work. A very good game in total but the experience before getting into a quest and getting into the next quest is very meh. If they fix these issues then the game will be really good.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,106,False,Recommended,"My game crashes on startup. I never got to the starting menu but the startup stuff still runs correctly (language selection and pre game options). I have looked high and low for a solution to this issue. I first went to segmentnext.com to try out the solutions and did everything from reinstalling the drivers to looking up the base requirements for my system. After that i looked to see if NVIDIA was acting up and found out that GT 720 should be able to at least start the game. so that wasn't the issue. (I found this out after installing and reinstalling it. + youtube searching for a full minute and a half)Then i went to the Reddit in order to find more solutions. But i had similar luck they gave me similar solutions and nothing really worked. (i tried restarting the computer uninstalling and reinstalling the game setting the frame rate and disabling unrelated mods that might stop the program.)So i waited. And eventually found a Specal K mod that could help me limit the ammount of threads the game runs. So I ran a task manager (because i didn't know if i needed it) and figured out the game was running around 132 threads on startup... First off i don't know how that happened. Secondly darn it capcom.So i download this Specal K mod and i get the start menu running as normal. The mod screen pops up and all seems well. I select the option to limit the number of threads and i hear the solid snake ""enemy spotted"" sound.at that point my game closes instantly. So I think i set off the pirate alarm built into the game by modding it to run correctly. The funny part is that it kicks me out of the game at the same point it froze. So i beleve that the piracy detector required the insane thread count that crashes my computer.TLDR I'm stuck using tools that set off a piracy alarm to make the piracy detector work properly and not crash my game on startup.Ok i never got to play the game so i will not give it a bad review. But if it is not fixed soon i will make this review a bad one. because even though you can't catch all the bugs on launch it is up to the devs to fix the bugs they missed.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Though im sure its been said a thousand times ill circle jerk as well. The game is amazing the actual mechanics gameplay style and world building are superb and run flawlessy. The game is entirely playable solo and can be completed using any weapon of your choosing with 14 options being viable in every scenario which not a lot of games can boast about. Sure some weapons are going to be a lot easier to pick up and understand but the more advanced ones offer complex play styles that offer a wide range of abilities for you to take control of and look stylish while doing it. With all that being said this game shines when playing with friends or even randos the monster hunter series has always been about being a party of hunters who play off eachother's play styles to take down large and difficult beasts but Capcom has once again shown that they dont really put effort into their PC port. It seems to be entirely based on luck if you and your friends can hold a multiplayer session for longer than 5 minutes with me being able to play with only one of the four friends who bought this game and even then the multiplayer will just give out at random. It really holds back the game and nullifies a huge selling point of the series.Last but not least the graphics options are out of whack and either dont offer much customization or straight up tank your frame rate even if you operate on two 1080tis with 8700k i7. For the most part this can be fixed by turning off volumetric rendering so I wont be two negative on this front but I have heard people with lower specs cannot run the game at all on low.TL DR this game is a real achievement in the series and offers some of the tightest and most balanced monster hunter gameplay i have experienced but the constant network issues and lack of proper graphical options can easily drive away newer players to the series. I would totally recommend it if you dont mind catching on to the monster hunter series as a solo experience but keep in mind that this game really does need multiplayer to achieve its max potential.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,26,False,Recommended,There will be two parts for this review since it is a bit of a community issue with the second.Overall the game is awesome fun to play even more fun to play with friends. There is all sorts of hidden gems in the fighting that aren't displayed under the tutorial and it is awesome to create them mid battle. It also achieves a very relaxed way to hunt so you can kinda zen out while not fighting.The same things that make it awesome sadly make it terrible for your average gamer who doesn't explore game play. The hidden features stay hidden the hidden crafting stays hidden unless you unlock parts or google it the multiplayer works fine IF &lt BIG you understand it. The first few hours I spent with a friend were working out all the stupid rules regarding who can join what and play with what. After enduring the up front wall of no information it does get better. You will either have to discover things for yourself or wait until someone adds an entry in too the wiki page and the items on the wiki page are not always correct either.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

They really made a few great changes for the series and yet they also seem to have stepped backward in a few ways.Pros Beginner friendly No god awful load times between zones Controls have been streamlined to be much simpler Playing the game feels just like any other Monster Hunter which is great. Is excellent with friends if you can play together without getting disconnected. There is a playstyle for everybodyCons Conncection Issues. A lot of connection issues. It's 2018 have we really not figured this out yet? Optimization could have been better although it is not the worst I have seen. I've got an Intel i5 4690k and a GTX 960 and I can pull around 50 frames on medium settings. The Quest system is awful compared to previous entries in the series. I came to hunt monsters with buddies. Yet I can't do that because one of them hasn't seen a cutscene? Why can't we all progress on the same quest together? We're all hunting the same monster anyways! Unskippable cutscenes. A story you will more than likely not care about. The Handler should not exist in any capacity. A lot of missing settings most notably raw mouse input. There is less delay with my controller than my mouse.

2018-08-12,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Update leaving the previous review for posterity but the game has seen a multitude of improvements since release.. The biggest complaint i have now is that textures are muddy and requires a 3rd party mod in order to fix. kind of silly that the fixes for the PC version are rolling in pretty slowly and only fixing one thing at a time. Connection issues took about 2 patches to fix. I do recommend the game if you enjoy the grinding aspect but there are some fixes that can only currently be found my modders. Capcom and/or the development studio needs to pick up the pace and release more than one fix at a time.I would not recommend the game in its current state. FPS drops during any strike of my weapons its even worse when i use the long sword Helm Splitter skill. No tweaking of the settings fixed this issue either... Constant disconnect issues with other players including people within the same household. This is after applying the appropriate firewall ports to be allowed for the game.I love the game have it on PS4 Pro and played about 250 Hours into it so far (and will continue my sessions there).

Multiplayer has disconnected me sometimes during a hunt out of my 7 hours of gameplay I disconnected twice hopefully this gets resolved. Also private lobbies ""claim"" that you can connect with friends via invite however this hasn't worked for me and my friends. Only option is turning off private lobby.Note Turning off volumetric fog can save you a lot of frames also it does make the environment look clearer. Also Lod distance. I would advise against low looks like Sh*T IMO.I have heard a lot about crashing even one of my friends crashed just for petting a pig. However I haven't experienced any. However that doesn't mean it will be stable for anyone else so if you're unsure wait for a sale or until they fix a majority of crashes.There is a lot of enjoyment in this game even though it runs about 40% better than consoles. Running through monsters only to witness the monster I was hunting engaged with another monster in an epic battle. Really unique weapons armor and rewarding gameplay. Yes it can get repetitive but I would argue not quickly as the rewards are generally good and not that grindy.If you have been waiting on this game to arrive to pc try it out and if you have any problems note you can refund within two hours of gameplay and within two weeks.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-15,0,0,325,False,Recommended,I noticed there's been a large amount of negative reviews so I thought I'd review this game as well so people can get a broader perspective instead of going down and simply seeing a ton of bad reviews and thinking this game sucks. (TL DR It's great you should get it.)To start off I personally believe that this is one of the better installments of MH (Been a fan since the first game back in 2004!). This is definitely one of the more user / beginner friendly games in the MH series. The monster fights are fantastic and always give you that rush especially when a tough monster nears death (although I prefer to capture monsters over killing them). Graphics are amazing but they have there fair share of problems.The crafting system especially the weapon upgrade system is one of the nicest one's and I enjoy it quite a bit. It allows you (Especially with end game weapons!) to find which weapon has which stats and what materials you need. It's nice to be able to lokok through all the weapons and decide which of the ones fit's my playstyle (I personally prefer the blast element but that's besides the point).The storyline is a joy to go through and although it isn't the deepest it is enjoyable to have a drive to accomplish something and to get that next main goal that next big hunt.That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's flaws. As mentioned before the graphics have there fair share of problems. The game is CPU / GPU heavy and the only way to get good graphics is to have a really fast PC. That being said I did manage to get the game up and running on my laptop (as an experiement) although I did have to lower the graphics significantly. Connectivity / lag is also an issue although the past few patches have fixed a significant amount of errors with that and the internet has been much more stable since.All in all this is definitely worth the money but if your still having trouble deciding I would personally wait for a few more patches to come through just so everything fully stablizes and more monsters have been added.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,311,False,Recommended,I've played all the monster hunters and this is another good one. I just wish they didn't make stun and monster grabs so awful and there needs to be more weapons and monsters which i'd imagine more are coming soon. Definitely are not enough original weapon models in the game with all the reskins. the connectivity is better now thank god but i think it needs some particle settings in the options. Also would like older weapons and monsters to make an appearance. Don't listen to the mixed reviews in total thats just people posting a review early since the game had bad connection issues out the gate. there is a good reason it has an 88 on metacritic. 9/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,5,False,Recommended,Longtime Monster Hunter fan here. The online is finicky but if you play solo like me this is a great addition to the series. Combat is fluid each new weapon adds a unique element to your playstyle and the monster AI behaves convincingly like an animal. Haven't noticed any significant performance issues just a few dropped frames here and there on a dual 970 build. Lowered shadow quality to correct.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"I've played at least a good eleven/twelve hours so far and honestly I've very little to say about this game that I don't enjoy. For starters I've never played a Monster Hunter game EVER but this has been a pretty solid introduction if not stand alone game. My thoughts as follows PROS Graphics The game has positively stunning views and vistas. Admittedly some of the decals can be awkward or the occasional stutter bug can hamper this but normally it's a solid 10 with just the graphical side of things. Obviously maybe not as incredibly detailed as something like a Quantic Dream game that models every sweat bead and hair on a characters' body but still.Combat Although there is times where the combat and style of fighitng feels a bit awkward I've tried several weapons and found that there is a certain playstile to every single one (so far). Big heavy weapons are hard but tend to take longer to use or wear out stamina much faster than quick light weapons that don't do as much damage. There's some in between with the proto weaopns that switch types but still it's a system that I can enjoy. Every monster feels at least a tiny bit different than the others certainly you CAN just use attack/dodge/attack/dodge in order to try and take on every one but the game does tend to reward you for using your surroundings or traps.Enemies While the world seems alive and breathing with how many little creatures and critters running around the sense of scale for enemies is what really gets a lot of the fun pumping. You feel like any of these things could just crush you without even trying so beating them feels less like you just won a simple fight and more like you've triaumphed over a mighty beast with your skills. For the smaller beasts they are a nice break from the constant do or die big monster battles.Gameplay While I've only got a good 11 hours of gameplay I can say so far I've not even really gotten the beginning of the game done and I'm still just biding my time with the quests to get more gear. I do somewhat fear that I'll get bored of the cycle at some point but at least right now it's something I thoroughly enjoy. Not even necessarily because every single quest or expedition feels different (which they do because of the monster AI) but more because unlike many games where grinding is a core mechanic it's actually FUN. I feel like I've accomplished something when I make that piece of rare armor or finally get the pieces to upgrade my weapon to a true tool to be reckoned with.Extra Content There is some extra things like research missions fishing and other miscellaneous side questing that can be done that provide a decent level of distraction and fun. What's nice is they not only help advance their own points of interest but also the player character's armor weapons and sometimes their Palico's abilities.CONS Multiplayer Although from what I've played the multiplayer can be a lot of fun I have had a lot of problems with the online lobbies suddenly disconnecting me from online play or other similar issues. I thought it was my internet but I believe now it's an ongoing issue with servers. While this is definitely a huge problem that needs to be resolved I personally don't mind too much at this point in the game. I prefer hunting solo unless doing a big enemy or playing with friends and all four times I've done it there weren't any issues playing together. Any time I'm alone it's a mostly unintrusive notification that I've been disconnected which can be solved back at HQ with relative ease or simply restarting the game/waiting some time.Grind While it's not something I necessarily mind I can already tell this game is built on the principle of grinding. You have to work a lot in order to properly establish yourself and get the armor weapons or other accessories that you need in order to be a master hunter. The game's concept is itself a grindfest so if the idea of working on a base level grinding and just pushing up with more of it annoys you I wouldn't try as you may just be disappointed.Cutscenes I don't mind the cutscenes themselves more simply how they're applied in multiplayer. If you haven't seen a story missions cutscenes yet you cannot play with another friend in that mission until you've seen them. This means if you happen to play through a mission you have to quit or quickly send an SOS flare during the (presumed) big monster battle in order to play with a friend during it. It's a pain in the butt sometimes though in all fairness it is better than someone else being there and just skipping the cutscene before you got a chance to see. ABOUT Skipping cutscenes though....you can't. None of them. It's a feature that a lot of games have for this reason it's annoying as heck to play the same game through with a new character (or restart) and need to watch the same cutscenes over and over.Areas While it's more of a nitpick than anything the areas that I've been through although they vary between eachother are less vast and open than the title Monster Hunter WORLD would make you think. It is servicable and in fairness tracking a monster across 4km of crazy land sounds irritating but they could stand to be a little bigger.Tutorials It's not necessary for a game to have tutorials at all. They could just drop you in and there's certain people that would enjoy that. I am not one of those usually. The game does a poor/decent job at giving you the absolute basics but I've had to look online several times now or ask people who know the series/game in order to figure out how to do certain tasks since although the game gives you very word wall type text tutorials never really allows you to try any of those things in a safe place. It's either do or die sometimes which can be frustrating for newer players especially those that don't know the game.Lore(?) This may be removed later if I start understanding more but being new to the series I at least assumed there would be some way to catch up to what was going on in the world of Monster Hunter. Unfortunately there is very little going on in terms of background besides ""Elder dragons ed our up we gon' make them eat the dirt"". The motivations for the characters seems a little bland thus far as does the world. As rich as gameplay is the story seems lacking which isn't the largest issue since this seems like the kind of game you sit down to play not read books about but still.Graphical Options As there have been many comments below about the game does seem to severely lack in menu or game options for disabling certain FPS or memory chugging options like DOF or motion blur. I've not had any issues with it because I've managed to spend an innordinant amount of money on my new PC but for other rigs I can totally understand the sentiment to want a more customizable experience for their PC port.All in all Monster Hunter World is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of this year. It has colorful varied environments beautiful graphics good character customization (for an MMO) and interesting characters.TL DR High 7/10 at the absolute least ignore the high percentage of negative reviews they are about low computer specs and multiplayer server issues which huge releases like this always have at the start and eventually smooth over.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-05,0,0,445,False,Recommended,A solid port with a rough launch but all the major issues have been addressed now and they've comitted to fixing most of the minor ones. Multiplayer works well for me with occasional lag spikes but they're fairly infrequent. The default controls still require some fiddling with to get comfortable and a 5 button mouse goes a long way but it gives you all the tools to fiddle with so its very doable and melee combat is absolutely out of the box comfortably usable.Content updates have lagged behind initial promises but most of that appears to be due to further port improvements being worked on so I think that washes out.A lot of reviews overlook this but this is absolutely an excellent game and while it isn't the best port possible it is still well worth playing especially with the post release improvements and the support the devs have given. At this point they've either addressed or said they will address pretty much every major complaint and I suspect content release will pick up after that.

Alas the Rotten Vale is a performance sink and the complete crashes get a little old.So if Capcom let us know they are aware of these issues and intend to fix them I will change my opinion.

2018-09-16,0,0,391,False,Recommended,Capcom has worked on every little details to give us the most polished and immersive game I played in a while. I love all the quality of life improvements they did compared to console Monster Hunter. This is the game I always wanted. I have been told it is a bit short though (but I'm still far from being at the end).Know that it basically requiers a controller since mouse input has its speed capped (it replicates an analog stick and it feels awful when you are used to classic FPS). FYI Steam has an experimental Switch Pro Controller support and it works like a charm.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,87,False,Recommended,LOVE the game. But I wouldn't recommend playing it online with friends just yet.

2018-08-13,0,0,468,False,Recommended,"*Updated*This is the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. It reminds me a bit of dark souls/shadow of colossus mixed in with witcher 3. The ""living environment"" aspect of it is rather neat where monsters will attack other monsters. I think there are a ton of redundant menus but that's probably more because it was made for console and console is less efficient has fewer buttons and therefore requires more buttons presses and menus. Some of this can be dealt with in keybind options and options the rest of it can be fixed with autohotkey. But overall it's not a terrible PC port the buttons are given to me for PC in tutorials and tooltips and not console/controller (pointing at dark souls and many other bad ports). My specs are just barely meeting the requirements on CPU and a little over the requirements on GPU but it plays well enough on the settings I have it on (medium). It doesn't seem to bog my computer down either am able to still freely alt+tab to the wiki and other windows. The biggest problem which hasn't been a huge deal for me so far because I mainly play solo is that it seems to lose connection quite often. In solo play this really doesn't do anything it just puts you in ""offline mode"". However when my friends want to start playing together I can see it becoming a giant pita. The only other issue and this is basically commonplace nowadays but doesn't mean I have to like it is the DLC content that was not included in the main game (removed so you could spend more money on it if you want to). Though it seems to mainly be visual things and flair items so it's not as bad as it could be. Overall I think it's a good game and would recommend unless your sole purpose for playing is to play with your buddies. Hopefully they will make some improvements on that end but who knows.**Updated September 16 2018**The multiplayer connection issues seem to have been resolved. However now that I've started to actually run multiplayer a bit more I have noticed another flaw that is kind of annoying. When you search for games a lot of times the game will fill up faster than you can join it getting a ""failed to join"" message and reseting your search filters. This is very annoying because you get far fewer options for what you are looking for if you don't search for what you are looking for. Instead of getting a failed to join message and forcing me to re enter my search paramters I would rather it just rerun the search with my search filters in place.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-20,0,0,901,False,Recommended,Updated review after network patches The game itself is very enjoyable. The weapons are each unique and interresting. Although a bit grindy the hunting aspect itself is not boring except for a few annoyances namely some non target monsters interrupting your hunt. They can sometimes be entertaining but it gets old quick.So after some network patches that addressed connectivity issues the game's online multiplayer is now very much enjoyable. Playing as a team opens up new possibilities with builds nd strategies and fun! If you have groups of friends to play with you will get a lot of mileage from the multiplayer mode. Playing with random players online is not too bad either.overall its a solid multiplayer mode now that most network issues have been addresed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,287,False,Recommended,"Been waiting for this game since I played the hell out of the first MH on the PS2 fourteen years ago. Patiently waited out the console release for the PC release and after my first day of playing it I'm giving a sigh of relief that it's (almost) everything I wanted it to be. The combat is just as good as ever if not better. The visuals are stunning. This MH is the most living breathing iteration ever. The 3DS entries were super fun but this is the much needed modern interpreation we needed. The Hunter in Monster Hunter is finally living up to it's name.I haven't experienced any problems and I'm running what I would consider to be a ""modest"" PC. The controller thing was a little weird but we live in the age of Google so it wasn't hard to fix. I am annoyed that all of the button icons are for the Xbox (using a PS4 controller) but I'm figuring it out.My most sincere gripe thus far is that the equipment variety both literally and visually doesn't hold a candle to what we were getting on the 3DS. It doesn't really soil the experience for me as the core gameplay is really what brings me back to this series over and over but I'm hoping it's remedied through patches and DLC and the like.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There are still a few design choices that boggle the mind like being unable to drop in and out of multiplayer games without having seen the cutscenes first or the fact you can't see your friend while being in the central hub.

2018-08-25,0,0,163,False,Recommended,I want to update this review but I also want to leave my original compliant.Capcom has fixed nearly every issue with this game. You still have to watch the cut scenes during the assigned missions before you can do them with friends but that only impacts the early part of the game. Really had I known about the cutscenes going into the game it wouldn't have been as big of an issue.This game is worth full price. Its been a long time since I've enjoyed a game as much as I've enjoyed Monster Hunter. The amount of detail they put into the world is really amazing. When game developers are releasing half games then pushing the rest out as DLC this game does the opposite. You can easily get 60+ hours out of this game without trying.This game is a 10/10.If you're going through other reviews I'd check the date they were posted. Anything from the first 3 weeks will likely be negative like mine. Those issues have been resolved.I wanted to write a lengthy review about how good this game is... and when you can play it it is one of the best games I've played in a very long time.That being said for a game marketed as coop the online experience is terrible. From having to watch cut scenes solo before you can group up with friends to simply not being able to find games using the in game search.It is also a very obvious port. The game's UI inventory management town hub all scream of console design. Nothing was redone to make it more intutive for a keyboard and mouse.The game struggles late game to maintain FPS due to the particle affects on the weapons.If you're willing to play this game solo by all means its a great game.If you are coming here looking for a fun online experience I'd probably pass. For this reason I can't recommend this game. A Coop game with no coop doesn't warrant a positive review.My specsi7 4790 4.0GHzGTX 1080 8GB32GB Ram500Mbps down/100Mbps up,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-17,0,0,109,False,Recommended,This game is horrible. Once you start playing this game it will no longer allow you to see the light of day or the velvet canopy of night. It will disconnect you to the outside world. You'll will be trapped hunting monsters crafting and upgrading your arsenal developing your character and picking up herbs mushsroom and nuts. You'll be stuck in front of your monitor no bath no changing of clothes. Your girlfriend or wife will leave you (but you don't have one because you're a level 9999 nerdic virgin) because you will start to have no time with her.The system of this game is very genius. There are a lot of things to do and the more you do things the more there will be available. It is an endless cycle of quests investigations and monster hunting. The in game world is so diverse as if it is breathing so you don't need to quit game anymore just to enjoy real life nature. You will not have to worry about being alone as well because you will have the cutest most loyal felyne buddy in game ready to sacrifice its life just for your character's safety. A true in game buddy!To wrap it up stay away from this game unless you are prepared to leave everything behind you because once you start the hunt the hunt will have you.

2018-08-21,0,0,189,False,Recommended,I think that Monster Hunter World is a great game with exhilarating gameplay and immersive graphics. But for all it is worth this is a genuinely terrible port it is playable but still a very bad port. I am lucky to not have any major performance issues but there are countless cases on various rigs out there. But I still do experience crashes ocassionally. From what I have heard KB is basically useless. I play with a gamepad and I think that it is near necessary to have one. There is also the thing with Denuvo I conjecture that the incredible CPU usage of this game can be attributed to stacking Denuvo to an already demanding engine. Thanks to the recent multiplayer patch I think that it is worthy of a recommendation but it is scratching the surface imagine passing a test with just a mark to spare. I think that it is a shame as this shoddy port does not behove the eight month delay and is an insult to this amazing game. To casual PC gamers who have never had a lick of Monster Hunter buy it if you can afford it and give it a try. If you decide tor refund it I can't blame you.Pros Great gamplay Amazing graphics Immersive environments Great soundtrackCons Performance issues. Bad KB support ( Gamepad basically required) DenuvoIn conclusion great game bad port. The gamplay is near faultless but its port related issues are what you will have to contend with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,117,False,Recommended,Most Multiplayer connection problems seem to be fixed now so i'm going to say it's a 9/10 games. I will say that the balance feels a bit off. Maybe it's just me but the bows just seem superior to the bowguns in most situations. They seem to have more damage with the only downside being the lack of different but the tradeoff seems to heavily way in favor of the bow (at least i'm my opinion from the time i've played). Same goes for the melee weapons but in my however many hours i've only seen one person using a heavy bowgun a handful of light bowguns and a fairly decent amount of every other weapon type (except sword and shield). Don't know if it's just that they're not balanced well though may just be personal preference but i thought i'd mention it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

For a new player Monster Hunter World (MHW) has a good difficulty progression for every large monster that you need to hunt. From a small monster and simple battle to large monster with complex item used battle.3. The world is mesmerizing. Different terrain different method to kill the monster.4.

Crash and Bug especially ER12 Graphic Device Crashed.

2018-08-14,0,0,222,False,Recommended,"The dealbreaker for me was multiplayer. It was quite terri bad originally and to some extent it still is. My best piece of advise is to finish all story quests solo with occasional SOS signal sprinkled in only then can you hunt tempered monsters/investigations with your pals without that many complications.The second letdown is the performance. Oh boy the performance. I messed with the graphical settings a tad in order to get decent framerate. Ironically the larger strain is on CPU rather than GPU however some explosions create serious but short lived lagspikes. Considering the fact this is hardware dependent I don't want this to be a determining factor for my review.Right now there are two ""versions"" of Monster Hunter Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for switch or 3DS or this game for consoles or PC. Unless you're some sort of fanatic I wouldn't recommend buying a new console for a single game (MHGU).For newcommers MHW is an excellent starting point no ""unfun"" difficulty helpful Palicos for the first time in history fluid weapon controls on keyboard with reasonable defaults and rebindable keys for important commands (nice port in that regard btw) larger map smoother item gathering bounty system which is a great alternative to gathering quests (which still exist smh) expeditions for simply exploring the map in an open world fashion. The list can go on.I like this game more than its predecessor simply for better controls and weapon mechanics alone. The game is in fact easier but it merely opens the room for experimentation/trying out more difficult weapons which I value a lot in games. It's a great way to reveal the game for a new PC playerbase.The game is not without its flaws yet most of them don't affect gameplay that badly. The worst thing that can happen is when you get disconnected while playing multiplayer in which case you have to kill a tougher monster solo without an option to reconnect back to your friends. As the servers become more stable this seems to be less of an issue.All I'm saying you'll get quite the bang for your buck I guarantee it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It's quite amazing really I dare say it's the single most awesome well done pc port I have ever seen and not an old port of a 5 10 year old game but recent one. Even at 4k all maxed smoothness is good and in fullhd it's perfect. Online feature is a cherry on the cake no t restrictions unless you put them on yourself and let's not kid ourselves when you fire an SOS flare you do want some high level badass preferably to come help you instead of similar level guys to come and die alongside you.Don't know about hardcore fans but as a newcomer with no affinity with previous game from the serries I'm enjoying it quite vigorly. That is with a level of progression around start of high rank I'm a bit worried that I as well as the rest of new or casual players might bounce back from asianization and grindfest that I've seen videos/pictures of further away in game.

So far I have not disconnected on any hunt but there are rare moments I can't connect to my friend's lobby.WHAT'S NOTI still get drastic frame rate drops especially fighting an Elder Dragon who summons 4 tornados or a full party hunting with elemental weapons. FINAL VERDICT 9/10 READ OLD REVIEW HERE As a hunter since MH4U but skipped on the current gen console versions playing MHW is such an awesome experience it really is a step up(gameplaywise and visually obviously) BUT when you really get into the game it really shows how badly optimized this version is. Matchmaking is a nightmare frequent disconnections in a middle of a high risk hunt unable to join sessions sudden fps drops in low density area(I'm running the game on a TITAN this sucks) and more just read the other complaints. These problems can be easily fixed through an update until then this is a thumbs down wait for Capcom to fix their servers and optimize the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I have over 120 hours in the game and I'm only a week in But every time I try to get into a party with friends or just respond to a SOS Flare I get disconnected almost immediately. It wouldnt be an issue if the difficulty got reverted back to single player stats but once you are in a squad it is stuck in the multiplayer difficulty. In closing it is a great game just terrible connection to the game servers.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Just can't recommended this game at the moment. It's a shame that we've waited for 8 months just to be presented with a half port by Capcom.EDIT After recent updates it seems that the connection issues are mostly fixed no disconnects so far even after 3 hours playing.There's still some optimization issues though hopefully they'll ironed it out on future patches.I can recommend it now.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-24,0,0,355,False,Recommended,Amazing new entry for the Monster Hunter series. Having played every main Monster Hunter game except the original on PS2 Monster Hunter World is a great leap forward for the franchise. World is not without its problems though. Technical issues aside the short roster in World is an problem for me. The end game presently revolves a great deal around the few Elder Dragons MH World has and unfortunately they're not very engaging compared to previous titles.Fortunately you can gurantee that the sequel(s) will rectify many of the issues I personally have with the game's content. I'm eagerly looking forward to the DLC Capcom provides and sequel(s). Monster Hunter World is an excellent game and is deserving of its meteoric success.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,424,False,Recommended,I initially left a negative review due to the mass of communication errors that began happening.After the last patch they seem to have become a far less frequent disruption.So I'll list off what I enjoyed and dislike about this latest version of Monster Hunter.Overall though I have been enjoying the game very much. Pros Access to all the weapon types introduced up to this point.The way you and the monsters can interact with the environment is very fun.No more getting dismounted from a monster if another person hits said monster.The various gadgets you and your palicoes get access to are fun.Being able to acquire pets to place in your private rooms is a very welcome addition.I do miss being able to place decorative objects like in Tri/3U though. Cons Offline and Online progeession should have been kept seperate.As is you have to wait for a cutscene to play before you can even join a friend on a hunt if you haven't already done it.This goes all the way up to the final story mission.Until then you're stuck with it though.Very painful to try and join your friends session I always have to hand out my session ID to friends in a messenger outside of the game instead of just being able to invite friends on my friendslist to join my lobby like with almost every other steam game I own.Trying to use a mouse and keyboard to play this is an exercise in frustration without proper setting adjustments.Adding to my above point not enough settings options for controls and graphics.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I have recently read some articles complaining about a surge of hackers making the multiplayer aspect of the game 'far less enjoyable'.

2018-08-12,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter world is a fantastic game. It's challenging and rewarding addicive and relentless. But you knew that that's been common knowledge for six months since the console release. Don't let the haters who are bad at video games steer you wrong.But how's the port?Well not amazing. Unlocked framerate is nice and there are some options in there but optimization is not great. If you want 60+fps with the settings reasonably high you better have at least a gtx1070. I have a 1070 and an overclocked i5 6600K and I have trouble with frames in 1440p so I had to go down to 1080. Make sure you disable the fog.The multiplayer implementation also is very goofy as it's unchanged from the console release. Having to wait for friends to see cutscenes before you can join is arduous. It should take you back to the gathering hall when playing with friends not to town. That being said I still can't say I don't recommend it. Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game and I will enjoy putting several hundred more hours into it.I just hope they give us some patches as a tune up for the performance at least give us some more graphics options to adjust or disable.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Multiplayer once you get the hang of how the system works is also pretty solid for grouping with friends. Granted it could've been a little less convoluted.Gameplay is an A+ because I love the depth of the Monster Hunter combat. The servers aren't currently as stable as we'd like but that's because of the outpouring of PC enthusiasts. It'll stabilize as time goes on. 8/10 from me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you can play it id get this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,Its a decent port however the game has a couple of quirks that really make it hard to recommend the game. The controls in game are okay however playing the game there are alot of small items that were not converted well for example one of them is the quick item use interface in game referred to as the radial menu which simply does not work with keyboard as it was designed for a 8 point axis e.g. a joystick. Even mimicking the general direction by pressing W A simply does not work and you have to use its clumsy scroll over one item at a time menu to access important items. This can really be annoying in a fast pace game like this when your trying to scroll between healing items capturing traps or etc. The chat interface takes 3 subcolumns in the menu to even access so you can't even simply press enter and type to your teammates which makes VOIP the only method of talking to your teammates in game as well.However even with all of this the one issue that I cannot write off on is its network issues. At the time of writing this review its almost nay impossible to actually connect and have a couple of hunts go well without the game disconnecting you or your teammates and this can be incredibly frustrating especially in a hunt where the difficulty settings do not dial down after a player leaves. The game will at sporadic times kick players off a hunt making the remaining players to fend for a boss thats meant for 4 people and often times you may find yourself kicked out of the session to face a boss thats now significantly harder then it should be. If your ultimately a solo player (which the game will adjust itself for) and you can deal with some quirks here and there then the game is fine for you. However if your looking for a dark souls esque experience where you can get help or join in on a boss once in a while then I recommend you to pass up on the game until the issues are resolved.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,105,False,Recommended,For those wondering if you should get it.Get it. THERE IS NOT A CRASH BUG/CORRUPT SAVE. Your save does not get corrupted unfortunately your computer is hot garbage. Check Reddit. However might want a beefy CPU as there are some GPU driver issues that affect the performance. I have a very old rig. FX8350 with a GTX780. I use old drivers and updated my Physx settings and went from 40 to 80 FPS. I recently upgraded to a GTX1070 and that alone fixed my issues. I'm just waiting on my new mobo and processor to come in for an even better experience.Cons At launch yes connection was atrocious. And the multiplayer system is archaic.Once you figure out how to actually use the MP I promise it's a breeze albeit again archaic. It's CPU heavy so be weary doubt there are plans to optimize that.It's an incredibly addicting and fun game. I've put in a full work week and I still havent finished the campaign..

2018-08-12,0,0,316,False,Recommended,UPDATED REVIEW So it's been a hot minute. I've defeated Xeno'Jiiva and my game has not crashed at all. And I've beat him a multitude of times even after all this. I'm beginning to suspect this one guy's review is a bunch of crap. With all of that being said...Monster Hunter World plays beautifully remove the LOD Fog and you'll have yourself a consistent 60FPS game on Medium on the GTX 1060. Honestly I can't quite understand the gripe with the graphical performance. Monster Hunter World shows no real hiccups (except for Tesotra's explosions which drops FPS to 20 30).Multiplayer is getting better as of this review I have been able to get many multiplayer sessions in. As an HR 54 I have appreciated people who have been able to provide Tempered Monster quests along the way. There have been no disconnects as of late. To wrap it up Should Capcom have gotten this release right? You ABSOLUTELY BET. This is definitely ienxcuseable to gamers all around. However I appreciate Capcom continually supporting their game. I hope to see improvements down the road and for Capcom to start taking the PC platform seriously in the years to come.Good luck and Happy Hunting.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,Gameplay is solid. But the abysmal performance won't let you enjoy it.This game has no apparent game mechanics nor visual fidelity that could justify the framerates.Compared to previous installments in the series the endgame is completely missing. Right when you start to get the hang of your weapon and other game mechanics the game abruptly ends. MH4U had about 70 monsters this game only has 34. I'm getting bored around the 100 hour mark but I expected the usual 500 1000 hours of fun from a Monster Hunter game when I purchased it.I don't really understand what went wrong. You came up with a timeless recipe for awesome games many years ago you just had to make a bit of technical effort this year. There's probably an awesome game under all the washed out blurry mess for newcomers but it could be a serious disappointment to long time fans.

2018-08-15,0,0,472,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR PLEASE FIX CONNECTION ISSUES.Played the game from start to ""Story End"" before making a review. This game has quite a review (below 50% when this review is made). So i'll make a detailed info VISUAL GRAPHICS Aesthetically 9 out of 10Since i'm using a high end PC pushing all settings to the right makes the game look beautiful. Except for Volume Rendering Quality which i set to off (It disturbs distance viewing and looks terrible in some areas)Performance wise 6 out of 10The game was surprisingly demanding for my pc build (Overclocked i7 7700k and GTX 1070). In the first day on play there was a high CPU usage (It was fixed quickly). Other than that there are drops of performance when fighting co op with many particle effects (It gets worse when it rains). A friend of mine plays the game with i5 6600 and GT 1030 Changing the settings to the lowest still doesn't help much and there's no much fps difference when changing between Lowest and Highest settings. The only way to make it 50+ fps for low end computers is by lowering the resolution (like 1280 x 720) AUDIO Soundtrack 10 out of 10The music are good and it doesn't get old. The part i like is the Private Suite and victory theme after beating elder dragons.Sound Effects 9 out of 10The sound of sea waves and seagulls in Astera. The roar of large enemies (especially high rank bosses). It was really good! Every SFX fits the environment very well.Performance Wise 7 out of 10I used a surround 7.1 Headphones with ""Wide Dynamic Range"". It feels truly real. The problem is Music is overpowering Background SFX. I tried lowering the music but since the SFX itself was pretty quiet from the very beginning lowering the Music ruins it. I wish Background SFX (Sound of winds sea) and Monster sounds (Roars stepping sounds) are divided. GAMEPLAY Balance 7 out of 10Sword and Shield is overpowered in Solo Run. Long Swords seems pretty common in Co op play. Hunting Horn users are rare. LBG is too fun (and easy) for me to use...Difficulty 8 out of 10It starts off very easy on solo run. After High Rank quests are unlocked the difficulty spikes pretty quickly. Punishing new players (like myself) and casuals. But then i give 8 because that's the beauty of challenge. Even with the latest armor available the next boss is still not going to be easy. The eye opening bosses are Anjanath Odogaron Diablos. Elder Dragons are the main course of difficulty. STORY Voice Acting 10 out of 10Every characters have great voice acting. The commander is amazing during Zorah Magdaros quest. The Player's Handler is like able and not too annoying. I personally liked The Huntsman tho.Events 6 out of 10*After certain quest*Commander Looks like there are more elder dragons! The Field Team Leader search the Ancient Forest The Huntsman search the Wildspire Waste The Third Fleet Master search the Rotten Vale!*few seconds later*Field Team Leader Hey Player please look for clues in Ancient Forest for me!Huntsman There is one in Wildspire Waste You (player) look for it.Third Fleet Master Rotten Vale ""miasma"" is getting worse You (player) should look for clues there!Me (! &amp )#$&amp (&amp $ !(#$%&amp ( &amp $! ($ MULTIPLAYER Community 8 out of 10So far no toxic players (a plus). Some turns on their microphone and making rubbish noises. Sometimes it's getting annoying fighting with newbies (Tried making the enemy sleep for barreling but they woke it up... Tried mounting the enemy for stagger but they keep attacking).Connection MINUS 10 out of 1083 MW1 50382 MW1 5098F MW1 5028F MW1Disconnected in the middle of fight. Forcing you to fight enemy with ""Multiplayer difficulty"".Made an SOS Quest but got disconnected instead.Can't connect to any server. Make one myself but still disconnect in a few minutes.Capcom confirms the problem and currently trying to fix it. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE GAME 1. Options for Depth of Field and Motion Blur. (Motion blur kinda ruins the game for me)2. 21 9 Ultrawide Support. (My Monitor is ultrawide for working purposes. I hope they can support Ultrawide quickly.)3. Skippable cutscenes. I don't mind seeing one in my first run. But some ""Story spoiled"" players or players who moved from consoles to PC might want this feature.4. Much more support for Mouse Keyboard players. There is a confusing keyboard binding and the Radial menu was set on joystick by default.There might be more but this is most common on discussion forums (except 2 it's personal).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,111,False,Recommended,It's monster hunter... if you like monster hunter you'll like this. I've got a pretty good PC and haven't done a lot of multiplayer so I've avoided a lot of the launch issues which probably helps my opinion. The only weird issue I've run into so far is occasional crashes when alt tabbing. For everyone else it'll be really great if the port is cleaned up.Edit I've done a fair amount of random multiplayer now and have had fairly few disconnects when joining hunts.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-23,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,"Monster Hunter World bring the Monster Hunter franchise into the the latest generation with stunning graphic and environment design but doing so at the cost of halving the monster amount you would find in previous titles. The new seamless map to hunt and fight in arent really gamechanging when you realise that monsters will fight you in numbered zones and will avoid fighting in corridors inbetween them functionally only removing load times from previous titles and not much else. The end game is pretty much tacked on with tempered meaning inflated stats with no moveset changes compared to Apex or just G Rank from MH4U who offered more aggresive monsters with an expanded moveset that kept you on your feet MH W feels disappointing. Due to low monster count and the removal of blademaster/gunner distinctions the armor sets have never been this few. There is more variety in high rank sets but half of those are simply color swaps. Also considering that the style and uniqueness of armor sets that have been one of the trademarks of the Monster Hunter series have been completely toned down and neutered in favor of ""realism"" probably in an effort to attrack ""the western audience"" MH W ends up looking like a pale shadow of the previous titles in the series.And finally the efforts of casualisation made this game incredibly easy compared to the previous titles with no real roadblock until maybe Nergigante and only if you dont have proper armor otherwise the whole game is a farce compared to say 3U or 4U.About the port The game is largely unoptimised for PC and the PC audience disconnections are frequent and the inclusion of Denuvo is a major CPU bloat that will slow down decent to strong machines of they dare to play a music playlist in the background while playing making experiencing MH W on the pc needlessly unpleasant for the paying customer.If you're a series veteran you should avoid this game it has nothing to offer but pretty lights and the unfulfilled promise of a last gen Monster Hunter in all its glory.If you're a series newcomer I still think you should avoid this game. While having the lowest barrier of entry the casualisation is so major it will spoil your experience if you try older titles where the actual meat of the series is. I'd recommend newcomers to go and play Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate or Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate if they can. They're vastly superior titles with a nice presentation that offers hundreds of hours of play with twice as many monsters and A LOT more aesthetic charm to it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,390,False,Recommended,"Update they fixed the mouse input and the networking issues. Changing the review into a yes because the game is pretty damn good when it's not half finished.___________________________________tl dr game is broken at launch don't buy it until it's fixed.Pros Fun gameplay if you're okay with playing soloCons Network issues make co op pretty much unplayable which is a massive issue for a game like this. If you're lucky you'll manage to get into a co op session with randoms and finish your hunt without dropping the session halfway through but connecting to my friend's game is impossible for me right now even though I should be able to join. The game is constantly disconnecting and reconnecting to Steam meaning that it spams all my Steam friends with ""X has started playing Monster Hunter World"" notifications every few minutes it's extremely irritating if multiple friends are playing the game . Mediocre port when it comes to graphics no 21 9 support some options cannot be adjusted at all. Kb/m controls are garbage you're going to have to use a controller.

2018-08-23,0,0,573,False,Recommended,"Opinion At this point in the game. It doesn't hold my attnetion anymore. The whole game has drifted into the grind and nothing feels fun to play or do. Using different builds solo/pug/grou play. Just feels like all a grind now so i'll be off and on the game and will move onto other things. End game has barely any holding and the only holding is the RNG deco grind it has which will be a short 100 200 hours for some and maybe 1000+ hours for others with bad rng. The gameplay great just port was bad on launch this horrible trickle down content from consoles capcom barely talking to the playerbase to let us know what they know.Update 4th patch was various bug fixes addition of the harvest festival and the Wyvern Ignition Great Sword. Along these updates Motion blur can now be turned on or off instead of being tied to AA for some odd reason. Update 3rd patch was mouse improvement controlls was released on Sept. 20st 2018. What was added was acutal mouse support instead of emulating a joystick. Though it isn't true raw mouse input it is much much better than before. Much playable and the game feels so much better. Also following the next day patch 4 was a hotfix for Tempered Deviljho event not working on the 3rd patch and fixing some CTD when booting the game. 2nd patch was released on Spet 5th 2018. Content was added was Deviljho of course tempered jho is behind a event quest that rotates out. Also in the update fixed Thunder Stutter which playing with Dual blades &amp Glaives with thunder elemetal playable.Alright so I decided to wait till the first patch was released which was released on August 22nd around 10 30pm CDT (almost 3 weeks after launch for our first patch). The patch says it fixes some of the disconnects players have been getting. Some say the update fixed it for them some say it didn't very few say they can't connect after the update. Also some people have reported the game being using more resources.What I did to fix the disconnects was put in my steam.exe was "" nofriendsui tcp"" and restarted steam. This seemed to be my fix and was able to play online. Though I still get d/c its about 1 2 a day now compared to 3 4 every hour. Alright now that update portion of out of the way onto the game itself. The gameplay is like any other monster hunter. Hunt big monsters use their materials for gear repeat. Its focus around grinding and players skill. By skill in this game is from learning your weapon your reaction &amp learning the big monsters movesets weaknesses and strengths.The story aspect was a miss for me (I've played MH3Tri MH3U &amp MH4U in the past for reference) and monster hunter story is pretty meh. At least you can skip the story not pay attention to it and won't affect gameplay. The handler voice and personally rub me the wrong way and most of the English voice cast I didn't like compared to their models.Multiplayer aspect of the game is very seamless and quick to jump into (thats if you can ever try out the multiplayer aspect if not burden by the d/c's). How its setup in MH W's is a player makes a session that session can hold up to 16 total players in it. These players can join quest any other players have posted if they're the right HR rank to join. The game also has a SOS feature where it'll over right your password locked hunt and be placed under the SOS list of hunts. SOS requests are shown to everyone on any sessions. Usually they fill up within 5 minutes so if you need help don't be afraid to fire that SOS flare.Alright now the pro's and con's IMO of the game to whether to buy wait not buy. Pro Still the same Monster Hunter combat just on the consoles and pc now. Very easily to join hunts and to find hunts. The SOS feature is a great addition to the game. Makes those wanting to help others find those who need help. Great environment and locations in the game (there's a total of 5 areas you can explore especially freely with no time limit as well) Gathering materials in the field is much much better than older series. Can just grab and go instead of about a 3 second animation gathering. To add you can go back to camp and deposit stuffy you collected into your item box and go back into the field. There's their own slot of fishing pole(unlimited usage can find bait in the field for certain fish to be caught) pickaxe (unlimited usage) whetstone(unlimited usage whetstone fish scale are much better and faster use those when you have a supply while needing to sharping in battle) and BBQ grill(tbh I only used this for the achievement. I gave the canteen a raw meat before every hunt and after the hunt I would get 4 rations out of it.) No framrate limits Very quick loading times. I use a HDD and longest I've waited was around one minute. Con NOTE All cons are techinal problems and the only gamplay affecting is getting d/c randomly though getting d/c after the first update is pretty slim still can happen. No 21 9 support (there is a mod and though it isn't perfect its there. Still no official support yet) Bug Fixed on Sept 5th 2018 Using Lightning Elemental weapons will cause everyone fps drops even when not in rendering distance of them. This is even more noticeable on Dual Blade users. Texture option is bugged and some will show low res textures and some stuff will show high res textures (there's a mod that fixes armor textures but not world textures for this) Option added to disable Motion Blur on October 4th No option to turn all Motion Blur &amp Depth of Field. Fixed on Sept 20th 2018 Mouse Controls emulate a joystick no raw input for mouse yet (including max turning speed and deadzone) Very few interesting weapon models. Majority of the weapons use the base weapon models with a recoloring or adding feathers to them. Very very few unique weapon models. Performance problems with those in the hardware range to run this. Some option settings do not work. Getting D/C in a hunt will not scale down the monsters health pool. Very weird default control scheme for keyboard (yes you can change it but insert for chat interact for right click. Just the default layout is not normalize layout you'll except) End game grinding is about decorations which are all RNG and some deco have every horrible drop % for some decos. There's no other way to cruve the rng except save scumming and deco sniping tactics.Edit 1 Had to enable comments the option was disabled by default?Edit 2 Added 2nd updateEdit 3 added 3rd &amp 4th update. Removed ending as I seen it wasn't needed. Added a con about end game grinding. Changed to recommend after mouse fixes.Edit 4 added 5th update",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"Ok after beating the main story and going through a good amount of tempered quests I think I can give a fair assessment.This is a 100% recommended for me I cannot stress enough how good the monster hunter series is and how good it is that finally one is on the PC.That being said this game is not perfect.Pros This is going to be a pro for every single monster hunter game the combat is spectacular really rewards you for sticking at it and getting better This game is one of the most accessible in the series its super easy to learn but hard to master a lot of good quality of life features like tracking items/ monsters with the scout flies auto aim on stingers that require contact. The ability to set loadouts is super helpful and useful for creating new builds which believe me makes this game super fun to play The ability to use any weapon you want and still be useful allowing you to switch weapons whenever you want to try something new (I do wish crafting to the higher rarity weapons was easier maybe add something where you can just skip the lower rarity ones so you dont have to go farm lower rank monsters to build up to a high rarity weapon which materials you already had) The graphics look incredible the scenery is amazing for example stepping into the coral highlands for the first time was amazing it makes you want to stop playing for a bit and just walk around and loot at places huge props to the design team The monsters difficulty scale really well USUALLY forcing you to get better learn different techniques upgrade your stuff and maybe even switch weapons. This means once you get into higher rank/ tempered missions people die a lot less because the game really forces you to get a firm grip on the mechanics. The fact that really almost everything is useful I actually love the fact that there is really no reason not to take everything you get because you can either use it to make something that makes fights easier (like flashbugs or powders or potions or even power and armortalons) or you can sell the stuff you get for a bunch of money or use it to craft new lower rarity weapons into higher ones The areas which you fight monsters are well made and I love how a lot of the time you can use the environment to help you fight (jumping on monsters dropping boulders onto them trapping them in the groud/vines ETC). This allows battles to not only be about brute strength but how well you can bait monsters or outsmart them. All the monsters graphically are really well made and look greatCons Major Issue that can be fixed 1 This is a problem that I cannot really complain about since I'm running this game at slightly below the minimum requirements (I have a GTX 750ti with an i5 2400 3.10GHz) and honestly despite some freezing the game runs at a playable to good framerate but this is a problem I'm seeing a lot where people are having problems with the optimization. Hopefully this gets fixed to make the game a little less CPU intensive but for now it runs pretty good on most systems but definitely can be improved. Major Issue that can be fixed 2 The voice chat function is unusable there is no push to talk function and for a modern game on the PC to not have push to talk but to have voice chat means no one is using the voice chat making it unusableThis makes communicating with your team impossible meaning a lot of weak hits on sleeping monsters instead of bombs. Balance is a smaller problem. Remember how I said "" The monsters difficulty scale really well USUALLY"" well this is not the usually part. Some monsters have 1 hit ko attacks and even with the best gear the best you are usually gonna get without minmaxing for full defense is surviving it with half to low health (this is a lot harder for people who used ranged weapons/ small melee weapons since you don't get a defense boost and you can get 1 2 hit a lot more). The problem with this is you can't really expect players to dodge every attack so you are going to get hit and that can put you into a confused state sometimes (also sometimes you get into a 10 second stagger animation when a monster roars or something) and boom you get hit with a powerful move that takes you out (the monster ai is pretty good and will do that a lot they will also a good amount of the time focus you if you are low and or healing). This can lead to some deaths really not being your fault and just because you got combo'd or 1 hit. This isn't really that big of a problem since you'll continue to get better and those deaths will happen less and less (they'll still happen no matter what just less) this might scare off newer players trying to get into the game once they hit difficulty spikes like the diablos or the nergigante. Oh and last thing the research base is almost entirely useless its sad because its a well made area there is really just no reason to go there after beating the mission you get there.Overall great game and I would recommend it 8/10.(The only reason I wrote so indepth for the cons is I really wanted to showcase those 3 problems and why they are problems)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-28,0,0,572,False,Recommended,"So where do I begin...Firstly are you a Hunter from the past? Have you played and enjoyed this series? You will like it. It is NOT open world but big enough. Essentially they made the map segments larger and all load at once monsters can roam around in a general hunt similar to older Expedition/Moga Woods set up. This also has expeditions which is where a quest will leave you less you choose to go back. There are so many changes to this title from the series and it's evolved well. Originally i'd thought I wouldn'tl ike the western vibe but it's growing on me. It's stupidly easy but it's ridiculously fun. I mean just exploring the world solo is totally worth it. You are completely overpowered your skills simply activate if you have attack up/evade/etc on the arms you now have that skill. Stack these with a charm or other armor piece and you gain many skills. They got rid of the blademaster/gunner armors and made it general so now that GS Hammer etc build works with the bow. Weapons moves lists have become awesome mounting is fun but it's going to throw you off in general. This game is so different. You have to play it if you're a fan.IF you have never played MH before you essentially run around killing or capturing (it's now worth it for various reasons) monsters sometimes in arenas sometimes on no limit quests and others 50min. This is the first time i've expored so much on maps to get to the time before in this series since the PS2 original. Not because it was hard but because it is NOT lifeless. Everything is great. It's just...easy. It's almost like Dark Souls took a few things from the MH games. This sort of now plays like that. Large open maps huge bosses and great weapons. You have team work that allows for three pooled lived so you don't want to ""cart"". These things are good for beginners right now as lots of people in the later levels are running back to help others learn but the game really does reward you for exploring and pretty much doing everything. so many things will make sense as to how this is what Tri was attempting to be other things will make sense in how the games progressed. Overall if you're a fan of games where you need some actual skill to win and you can craft many things hunt for rare parts and upgrade the crap out of yourelf and your friendly cat you'll begin to appreciate the ""RPG"" elements to this game. There really isn't much to say. Buy it.Also i'm running a stupidly old Inspiron 546 and running it smoothly. Some hardware doesn't like this game but it's bloated specs. it just depends on how you want to run it. I'm running it on toaster mode and it's running beautifully. This is even with how low my setting are to keep it from chokes. There are FPS drops and bugs being resolved but a recent patch seems to have done well and we don't have a bunch of DC going on. Hopefully we will get the new monsters and possibly other armor layer things (transmog?) Anyway go buy it i'm going to go back to playing it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Learning curve is definitely there but it isn't too difficult to overcome in general.It is a grinding game hunting same monster a few times more to get materials needed and craft equipments from them. However the grind is not infuriatingly long with the exception of jewels as they are quite RNG some have easier time with their build some don't. I've played this on PS4 and I'm spending more time on PC despite the content differences because I have more friends to hunt with on PC as well as smoother experience in gameplay as I'm more suitable with Keyboard and Mouse than a controller don't get me wrong though as I've experieced both control methods this game is perfectly playable on either one so just pick up which ever is more comfortable and get the hunt going.As for content I can't deny that it's rather repetitive over time and there's really not much else to do after you feel like you've done everything. But this applies to pretty much any game and most of the reason why I play games are usually because I have friends to play with providing slightly different experience every run trying things out and fooling around.That doesn't mean this game is boring whne playing solo. I'd honestly play this far more casually solo but I try out new weapons and builds to keep myself entertained.Music and Graphics are both amazing I personally love Bazelgeuse's Theme the most and my favorite area is Coral Highlands mostly because it definitely feels like an ocean floor but dry. It feels like the various pieces of music played for different monsters and situtaions really add up to the experience. As for the game's graphics there are so many attention to details which helps with immersion of the game as even leaves and grasses just move around according to the interruptions caused by the situations such as presence of movement nearby and even SOS flares pushes leaves away as it flies away too. It's just impressive how much work was put in to this game. I loved other monster hunter games before but this felt like a whole new game to me quite a refresher really. When you're tired of hunting just enjoy the artwork of this game I sure don't regret spending quite a bit of hours in this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,159,False,Recommended,"First time writing a steam review played around 10 hours solo and a bit more with friends that have been waiting for this game for months I can definitely say that Capcom deserves the mixed review tl dr if you're looking for a solo experience this game is good however if you're wanting to play online and with friends prepare for a painful experience.The goodThe game itself is top notch out of the MH franchises so far so much detail and effort went into the MHW as well as a lot of QoL changes that honestly I hadn't thought about till now clearly it was a labour of love from the people at Capcom towards the western audience and a good sign for the franchise in the future if you don't ""get"" why the game is good try switching around weapons and honestly one of them is very likely to click. Honestly the turf war between Barroth and Jyuratodus made us lose our minds it was that good.The uglyThey fixed most of the issues i had in an almost timely manner",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,255,False,Recommended,"This isn't my first MH experience but this is my first MH game and I enjoyed it to a great extent so here's my take on it.Gameplay wise this game is extremely fun if you love strategic boss battles don't expect that you'll be able to do fast paced hack and slash esque combo deal massive damage and try to get the kill ASAP. We have to learn more about the monsters and prioritze our survival first because this game can be merciless if we don't know what we're doing.Monster Hunter World is supposed to be played strategically by learning about the monsters by discovering their footprints on the ground their scales and their fluids (but not to the extent where it gets annoying) which will unlock informations about their weaknesses and drops we also have to learn about their movesets weak points and breakable parts where their nests located and even their unique behavior in order to secure our hunts They can get enraged when they're angry some of them can feed off on other monsters or use them as weapons to smash you with or throw them at you they can also use the environment to their advantage and et cetera that's why learning about them is one of the core gameplay in MH. The progress is not about how can we deal massive damage we know we're progressing when we learned and understand how to tackle certain monsters.I truly appreciate the depth that this game offers. Visually it's pretty even the environment itself breathes life as monsters react to their surroundings as well as they react to other monsters. MH has never been about the story so story wise it's a ""meh"" it's just there to make new players get more into the game.This game is probably a 9/10 game for me it offers great depth to the gameplay despite its rather shallow story.Therefore I'd 100% recommend this.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-04,0,0,126,False,Recommended,I've bought this game under a biased mindset that it's only going to be hunting monsters and nothing else. But after a few hours of gameplay I'm starting to enjoy the game more there are a lot of goals you can set for yourself be it getting the best damage gears (min/max) or hunt after the coolest looking armor. The story itself isn't so bad but it's not top tier either. I think what draws me the most is the combat mechanic of the hunter against some monsters which even now I still could discover new tactics against certain bosses.Would I recommend this game?Hell yes.It may not be the best game in the market but it'll certainly provide you with hours of fun and also frustration.

2018-08-11,0,0,46,False,Recommended,This is a game that takes time and effort to learn. If it's your first time you will fail and that's part of the learning process. These monsters feel alive and make you work for the rewards and work towards understanding them. The weapons feel unique and it's safe to say that whatever your playerstyle is in a videogame they will have a weapon to help you.Don't be afraid to fail and don't walk away after getting frustrated. Once you start understanding a monster's patterns and how to counter it you feel so good. Hitting a monster has energy and makes the battle feel alive watching two monsters have a turf war and fight each other brings life to the game. Once the PC issues get fixed I would say this game gets really close to a 10/10 experience.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,186,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter for PC!! It's here!!!Hunt monsters with friends or alone. This game is all about that. Choose monster fight it use it's parts to craft armor and weapons. This game is similar to the Diablo series when it comes to loot and replayability.There are about 30 different large monsters in the game now. More are expected as free DLC. Once you've decided on a monster you're thrown into a map and the hunt begins. In order to kill the thing you can choose between 14 very different weapons each with its own style and skillset. Hunting a monster solo takes about 20 30 minutes. It's a marathon not a sprint. You're required to ""read"" the monster. Not only does it telegraph its attacks you have to pay attention if its enraged exhausted going to flee etc. It's a constant hit'n'run gameplay. It's about knowing when to attack and when to stay back to sharpen your weapon or buff yourself up.The series itself is from 2004 this is the 5th installment. There is plenty of information about the gameplay on YouTube. This can't just be compared to Dark Souls or Skyrim. It's a different genre. The only other games on PC ""like"" this I'm aware of are Toukiden series God Eater series and Dauntless. All shallow in comparison.Monster Hunter shines with its love to detail. Things just make sense the world feels organic.If you're a returning player coming from the handheld versions... they did a good job. A LOT quality of life stuff added but it's still monster hunter no doubt. It has less content than previous games but it looks better.The technical side. Since the game is currently review bombed...It's fine. Yes it looks not as good as other recent PC titles. Yes it's a resource hog and other games achieve better visual fidelity. But there are no gamebreaking issues. I can enjoy the game on my laptop (gtx 850m) with solid 30fps on lowest or on my desktop (gtx 1070ti) with avg 80fps on highest settings. No crashes or other issues during the first 12 hours since launch.Get the game on steam and try for yourself. The hype is there for a reason. Happy hunting!!PS It's interesting how this is still an issue in 2018 but... the game controls are optimized for a GAMEPAD. They refined gamepad controls on various consoles for 14 years now and this is the first time they do mouse/keyboard controls. Go figure. Personally I didn't even try playing with mouse+keyboard I'm used to hunt with gamepad for years now. Many people report wonky mouse control.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Most of the bosses have their own unique way of being an annoyance and that's what I enjoy about it because it makes each monster feel a bit different. Progression is pretty fast as I didn't bother upgrading any of the low rank gear and just powered on to the the high rank gear. Game also has many choices of weaponry with different playstyles. The armor sets can also define what type of playstyle you go for(you can choose what skills you want to have/or choose to have more gem slots).

2018-08-13,0,0,221,False,Recommended,Damn this game is amazing. Spent countless hours on MH4U on WiiU and MHW on PS4. This version is the BEST version of the game. For the loading times alone. The possibility to run at high res high textures at high FPS is also a bonus.HOWEVER the port is average at best. There is no 21 9 resolution. The mouse movement feels crap. The game doesn't run as well as it should. And then there are the random disconnects. And I can never join a game via the 'matchmake' feature. Also the game is missing all the new Monsters available on the consoles! AND there is no way to import your save from the consoles! So as much as I love this game and this version of it IS THE BEST version I can't give it a thumbs up.

2018-10-01,0,0,392,False,Recommended,"For those coming into this game franchise for the first time like me then there's an age old annoying analogy I have to make.It's like Dark Souls (stick with me here) in that the combat has that similar 3rd person hit and dodge tactic to it but very unlike Dark Souls in its deep RPG elements of crafting gear making items and building sets of gear to take on specific enemies. You'll also be using more tactically approaches like setting traps luring monsters to fight one another or using environmental damage to your advantage. So as a Dark Souls player you'll probably think the combat is rather clunky and slow at first but will appreciate the much larger array of choices available to you when you're not being hemmed into an arena by a fog gate.However this game preys on the in built human desire to be perfect at things and it does so by enforcing a lot of grinding to win against its RNG based loot system. You'll be happy to know though that the grinding is lot more fun than say ""Get 20 pig hearts"" or whatever other contrived tedium most other RPGs would throw at you. Grinding here is fighting a huge boss or several different bosses in a variety of different arenas and locations and you're totally free to spice up how you do it. Still for some that may not be enough but for me at least the variation of weapons items and all the myriad combinations of armour skills gives me more than enough to satisfy my tinkering twitch.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Collecting materials is soo much smoother being able to move while doing it. But being able to move while drinking potions and being able to cancel potions/whetstones by rolling is what I feel making the game too easy. There's little punishment for drinking a potion at the wrong time.The amount of monsters put into this game (Not including events) is so tiny. I feel like I have already seen and fought every monster in my playtime. In MH Generations I had somewhere around 80 hours and hadn't even explored end game content yet.This was obviously to get new people into the series but it holds your hand way too much for a Monster Hunter game.

2018-08-19,0,0,94,False,Recommended,I cant recommend it enough. Its feels so good. and its super fun and awesome to play.I only have a few things i dont like.1. Controller commands cant be disabled.2. Conversations doesnt seem to be completely skippable when NPC's keeps telling you the same stuff when you just wanna craft something.3. Some keys needing abit of rebind and i cant seem to rebind target lock which is the F key. Too close to D which moves you to the right. Keep hitting F sometimes and gets f'ed up by suddenly bieng locked onto the mob and unable to turn away for a few seconds.Besides all of this i find it really really fun and the game feels really really good.And if you are worried about the always online thingy. Yes you make sessions. But you can make it private and passworded and then you are never bothered by anyone.Also if your connection drops or anything it just goes to offline mode.

2018-09-26,0,0,296,False,Recommended,"Pretty good port with some minor issues. This is my fist Monster Hunter game and enjoyed playing it. Grind loop is entertaining and key part of the gameplay. The game has its own mouse acceleration and there is no option turn it off making it feel terrible to play with mouse and keyboard. A minor bug playing in full screen mode with a controller mouse curser shows up when on some menus. Again no option to turn the mouse cursor off. To my knowledge to get around this is to play borderless full screen Runs great connection issues resolved.Personal thoughts Game was developed for controller yet they still use analog navigation with the map and smithy.

2018-08-09,0,0,422,False,Recommended,Overall Ill say this is a great game with a couple flaws. This is my first monster hunter game and its very accessible to newcomers to the genre. If you like the idea of making a character your own and making multiple builds weapon and item loadouts and min maxing this game is for you! Each weapon has several different mechanics even the simpler weapons have nuances to learn and they feel rewarding to master. The story isn't anythign amazing but its still very fun beating a monster for the first time. The graphics are pretty decent as well however there is a low resolution texture problem(it can be fixed with a mod thankfully). I would also like to mention the animation quality is really great on both monsters and weapons. You can unleash some flashy but devastating attacks with many weapons and they are all animated very well in my opinion some of them will blow you away upon seeing them the first couple of times ). Monsters are also really well animated for the most part and have some really cool interactions/turf wars with one another. Negatives that I would like to mention are theres only so much content in the game and its taking a while for the pc version to reach the console in terms of updates/events and content. Endgame consists of mostly jewel/streamstone farming.(These are used to insert into armor and also augment weapons and armor for further bonuses). But it definitely gets boring after a while. Personally I started feeling burned out by the 300 hour mark but your mileage may vary. This is also a very demanding game highly recommend that you play at or above the recommended specs if you want the full experience. Despite the negatives Ive had a great time with this game and is definitely worth full price. Currently a 7/10 but with the potential to be a 9.5/10 with better optimization and more content! I will be revisting the game in the future to see what is added and play more!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,83,False,Recommended,"This game is fantastic and I cannot get enough of it. There are some connection issues that are the main cause for the negative reviews as the actual game itself is damn near perfect. It's just the port quality that is getting the downvotes. However there are a few things to note there.1. The ""Permanent save file corrupt"" on the final boss has been proven to not be a thing.2. A patch was released to improve online performance and connectivity and they are still going to work on the issue to polish it further3. A statement has been made about improving mouse controls (which I prefer over controller as they are now anyway. They work fine.)It is really heartbreaking to see bad port qualities tank the reviews on this game. It does have issues such as framerate dropps on thunder weapons. However they are in an ongoing process being fixed and non of these issues are game breaking.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-23,0,0,84,False,Recommended,"This game is awesome. Let me preface the review with I have already put 300 hours on the game on Xbox I am playing on a top 88% PC and I use a controller. That being said I can't comment on the K/M problems which I am aware they are there. The main reason I bought it again on PC was for the 60 fps and hoping the loading times would be better. I was not disappointed in these two things. Monster Hunter World on PC makes an already fantastic game better. The steady fps makes the monster's movement much more fluid. The loading times are almost none on PC. Graphically there are some texture bugs on your armor and a few other places but nothing game breaking and nothing that hurt my enjoyment of the game. The game looks fantastic on my PC.The only issue I have run into was the disconnecting issues which happen a lot. I played on Xbox first and it also had server issues for the first weeks but Capcom fixed them. I have read there is a PC patch today that addresses the server issues so hopefully they get fixed. Every PC game has server issues when they release so none of this really bothered me and I love playing this game solo just as much as multiplayer so none of it really bothered me. But I can see that it can be an issue for people who bought the game just to play with friends. For the game although I don't like some of the changes made from previous games this is easily the best Monster hunter to date. All of the QOL changes are fantastic. I was against things like adding damage numbers and the new armor skill system when I first heard about them but after putting tons of hours into the game I have come to like them. The damage numbers are not distracting at all and really are just there to finally see what your weapon actually hits for. The armor system is more simple than the past games. There are no negative skills and no activation tier. If you have any points in a skill then you get some benefit from it. It is much easier than the past games. I have come to like both of these new changes.The changes I don't like are the stupid cut scene multiplayer block and I am mixed on the SOS system. Honestly as much as I love this game the stupid multiplayer system where you can't join your friends until both of you have seen the cutscene is terrible. This game shines in multiplayer and the game makes it difficult to play withe friends for the story part. That being said once you finish the story and are at endgame you can join friends or randoms with ease but other games had no problem mixing story cutscenes with co op play. It's a dumb system and must be changed when they release MH6.I am very mixed about the SOS system. It's fantastic that I can jump in and out of hunts. It's fantastic that I can search SOS and join people. The actual system is great. What is not great is that the SOS system has killed the social aspect of the game. In the old games I met so many people that I am still friends with today. In the old games you could enter an online room and you would hunt with the same people for hours and get to know them through chatting. With the SOS system people don't really go to the gathering hall ever. They just join SOS hunts and then disband after the hunt and search SOS again. It really killed the social aspect that was a huge part of the Monster Hunter greatness. If you already have friends that play then it's fine but this new system has almost killed making new friends just by hunting.Monsters fight each other!!! Ever since I first played Monster Hunter more than a decade ago I have dreamed of the monsters actually fighting each other and I finally have that dream realized in World. Capcom did a fantastic job of implementing it. The New World is a living breathing ecosystem that plays out like a real dog eat dog world where the food chain affects everything. I love the new Turf Wars system. There is nothing better than when two monsters start attacking each other. It's a sight to see.The new combat system keeps the Monster Hunter style and adds to it. Each weapon has new moves but the old moves are still there that made the combat so great. This is not a hack and slash game though it takes skill timing and knowledge of how the weapons work and what the monster will do next. It frustrates me when I hear someone say the combat is clunky because once you learn it and understand it it's one of the smoothest combat systems in any game. There are things the game makes you do to add some challenge and skill to the game. Chugging potions is not instant you have to sharpen your weapon food skills can add things to help during hunts etc. You have to prepare before the hunt and know what to bring as each monster has different things that affect them. Traps slinger ammo antidotes and more will really help you win or lose the hunt. Personally I love this part of Monster Hunter. This is a grind game so if you're not into grinding the same monster over and over to get mats this might not be the game for you. That being said there is enough to do where the grind hangover doesn't really kick in until around 100 hours or so. It never kicks in for me because the grind is why I play but I understand how it could for people. I mean the whole point of the game is to kill monsters use the mats to make new armor and weapons that are better than what you had and kill more monsters. The player doesn't level up at all just the gear does. So to take on the tougher monsters you have to grind the lower monsters to gear up.The other side of Monster Hunter is the gathering part. They have improved this system by allowing the hunter to gather on the move. You no longer have to sit in a spot to gather herbs you can just grab them as you run past them. No more pickaxes breaking or bug nets. Just run by and press a button to gather stuff. I like this improvement.The design of the game in general is awesome. I love the monster designs and love the armor designs. The weapon designs on the other hand are not that great. The old games had such awesome weapon designs. Each one was very unique and they even had some ""fun"" weapons like a lance that was a shark or a corn on the cob. These ""fun"" weapons are not in World. Honestly there aren't cool designs in World at all. 90% of the weapons in World are just the previous weapon upgraded with a little fur added or maybe a horn. I miss the old weapon designs and I hope they go back to the ""fun"" designs instead of the realistic designs they have in World.The story in World is ok. Monster Hunter has never been known for it's stories. World's story is a little better but it still is just about finding a monster that is causing disruptions. It does have actual voice work and some fun things that are enjoyable but in the end it's just about hunting monsters.Since this is a new generation and not an expansion or all star game the monster count is lower than previous games. The PC version is still at release count but the consoles have grown to having 34 large monsters which the PC version will get to eventually. I started with TRI which only had 17 large monsters and I put 1000's of hours into it so 34 is fine by me. If Capcom follows suit like previous games there will be a G Rank/Ultimate version that will have double the amount of monsters.The endgame is fun but boring also. The endgame is all about fighting tempered monsters to get the rarest and bets jewels. The problem is there really is only 5 or 6 monsters that give you a chance at these jewels. It can get boring hunting the same 5 6 monsters over and over again. That being said if your at endgame you've probably already put 100+ hours into the game and easily got your money worth. I do hope they clean the endgame system up in the next release though.Even with some issues I love this game and highly recommend it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,43,False,Recommended,Do not listen to a lot of these exaggerated negative reviews. There are a lot of issues yes. This is true and you should be aware of this... however the core game is already so MUCH better than the console edition that it makes up for it. It's worth buying because these issues will be fixed and these issues do not make the game unplayable at all. It's harder to play online sure... impossible? No. I've done all of the story online with friends and I have done even more quests with random people. Of course there are issues with the online that are pressing and need to be fixed but everyone is talking about this game like it is unplayable. There are some game breaking bugs out there that need some priority but usually they happen because of end game bosses so you can enjoy most of the game right now.

2018-08-25,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Bought the game a while back for my PS4 and loved the living hell out of it. Had 300+ hours on it when it came out on steam and I can just say things only got better. But first what did not get better?CONS There is no option to disable the incredibly annoying depth of field. I can't remember this DOF being in the PS4 version so I am left wondering why the hell they implemented it. It is however nothing mods can't fix. Motion blur idem as the DOF The system requirements for this game are not a joke. My specs are intel i7 7700 GTX 1050ti (4GB) and 8 GB RAM. These are just above the recommended requirements and I sometimes get slight stutters so if your system can't handle it don't buy it! If you want to play with friends you are bound to have some networking issues they are however fixing them.PROS It is so far the best Monster Hunter game to date and it is just a beautiful game. They made a massive amount of small quality of life improvements (you ca ndrink potions while running no loading between areas monsters also fight each other etc.) that really help to make this the most enjoyable Monster Hunter to date. Compared to PS4 the loading times when leaving for or from a quest are severly reduced. Instead of waiting half a minute for a quest to load and then waiting another half minute for the area to load you only wait a few seconds for both.Overall I think it's an amazing game and it will be even more amazing when they fix their networking issues.

2018-08-09,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,"After spending 101 hours playing mhw here are some pros/cons *PROS* Gameplay mechanics are on point Incredible looking environment Many classes are available for you to choose (long sword sword and shield dual blades bows etc.) If you love grinding/farming then this game offers a ton of it. NEARLY every monster has its own technique and fighting style the ""movie"" feature where they show you the weapon stlye palico's equpiment and your own equipment The game stays fresh by teaching you new mechanics in game ""tutorial unlocking new npcs etc.""*CONS* Story feels meh. Characters are werid looking always positive and happy. Furthermore the handler and her annoying act (she's a useless npc in the game where the only thing she does is to get you into trouble by fighting monsters.) Also it feels so weird when an npc speaks to you and you're just mute. Sometimes the handler does the speaking for you.... Characters are not memorable. Mainly because they all have share the same positive energy. Also if you noticed that NONE of them have actual names... Feels like devs ran out of ideas since the spent that ""naming creativity"" in naming monsters Frames tend to drop at some point. With gtx 1070 my frames drop to approx. 30 whenever I did the dual blade combo when I get surrounded by little monsters Multiplayer feature is a mess. You gotta first get all of your friends in a lobby then all players in the party must watch their own cutscenes by soloing then abandon the quest when they meet the monster then they'l be able to join. If you think that's not bad enough how about constant DC ing? The endgame is not THAT great. Finished the main quest? Fight the same monsters with the same abilities with one condition the deal a ton of damage. I'm personally not a fan of it but others might enjoy ittl dr If you want to solo a game where you simply kill everything and grind then by all means buy the game. If you want to play with your friends then I suggest waiting until they fix their serversIf you want to play for the story then I suggest you pass",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This is my case with the game some people might have more DCs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-25,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Don't let the negative reviews deter you this game is excellent.The gameplay exceeds expectations. Fans of the franchise will notice immediately that they retained everything we love about Monster Hunter while still adding tons of new features particularly the different ways to interact with the world. The armour set designs are gorgeous the item progression is fluid and not too heavily RNG based and armour skills are now a lot easier to understand. Every weapon has received an extensive revamp that makes them both more fluid and more enjoyable to play.The main and only issue I've encountered so far is the poor multiplayer connectivity. It gets pretty frustrating when you receive frequent error messages when you're trying to connect with a friend or if you keep getting disconnected mid hunt and the game isn't kind in these scenarios. The game isn't particularly well optimised but should be able to run smoothly on a mid tier PC.Even with that considered I would fully recommend this game given your PC can handle it.

Feel free to just spam ""Get gud scrub""Still not recommended. First the connection issues seem to be sorted for now although this has happened before then returned.TL DR If you like Dark souls and the like you may get more out of this.My main problem is that I feel like I don't make progress. The content behind you can be laughably easy but the content in front is always stupidly hard. Maybe I'm missing soemthing but this is the game as I see it Do you want defense? Then you can't hit because the monsters will always interrupt your big hits in general fights. You want to wind up those big hits when the monster is distracted/disabled? Prepare to be juggled or 1 shot. Defense value means nothing elemental resistance means nothing because even if you just go down to 1/4 of your health after being hit once you have to heal. If you heal you'll probably just get hit again and die.You want to hit monsters? Prepare to be 1 shot because you have no defense.You want to evade? Good luck because the evade move is about farting distance and the hitbox for the monsters attacks is easily double/triple that size and will hit you anyway. Its not a matter of evading you have to evade at the right time for invul frames in the right direction when in the right position. Get any one of those wrong you're dead.The game just feels cheap at times. The feeling of achievement when you get past a hard point is fantastic buit short lived. Did you kill Neg? Good job now kill him 15 more times because you need his parts for something.It seems that no matter what you do the game has a counter for it. That's fine if it didnt result in game over screens constantly.You should bring in friends to help. Ask strangers send up a flare. No wait that means that monsters are buffed beyond double so its actually harder even with both people's output.I can't think of a game in recent memory that induced such rage in me and others.

2018-08-28,0,0,272,False,Recommended,This is my introduction to the Monster Hunter series and I have to say that it has impressed me greatly. The game has great controls for a port quick loading times and the fights are challenging enough to be rewarding while not being too frustrating. Each weapon feels unique and special and rewards you for knowing how to use them properly. The only black spot this game had was its connectivity issues a problem that is mostly fixed(I've yet to have any disconnects at all since the patch came out but I have heard others still have problems.) And the fact that you cannot play a story mission with someone who is also at that point in the story unless you go in watch the cutscene and then leave to join them after they see their cutscene.I highly highly recommend this game. From what my Monster Hunter Veteran friends have told me this game is by far the easiest Monster Hunter game to get into. The learning curve has been toned down from ridiculous to decent levels and from what they've told me it's a much needed improvement.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-28,0,0,121,False,Recommended,*NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE MISLEADING* Most people are complaing about the server problems but promise you they are fixing them and are actaully stable right now. Now a for a brief review. Monster Hunter is a different type of game and may not be for everyone. But if you want a challenging game give this game a try and see for yourself. Mastering a weapon is an art and is very satisfying and rewarding once you learn it as no weapon is overpower over the other. By far most balance game as a whole and never feel made wrong choices. Each weapon has its place just need to know where and when to use it. Most other Monster Hunter games always release another version of the same series that is a lot harder also. This is just the stepping stone of MHW! Safe hunting adventure!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Overall the game comes as a console port but it done well enough that it can be used by either keyboard and mose or a connected controller. Game plays well solo however if you are looking to play with people the SOS beacons can be nice. I would looks for groups to play with that have a Discord as I and many other disable ingame voice since it on all the time. There is a chat box you can access or use emotes to communicate if you set them up.There are a few things that can be frustrating such as that your quick bar is tied to your loadout slots.

2018-08-22,0,0,190,False,Recommended,"I'm a Monster Hunter addict I have well over 3000 hours over several games (Tri 3U 4U Generations and now World) accumulated ever since I started playing in 2007. MHW was the biggest game of the year for me and I was bummed when I heard PC players were getting shafted with a 6 month delay. Was the delay worth it? I can't say so.Monster Hunter World brings the amazing gameplay of Monster Hunter to PC for the first time in the west with high risk high reward action being the core of the game. Areas are expanded upon and the QOL changes in World remove a lot of the bloat and tedium of previous that were archaic by the time I started with the series. The animations visuals and sound are the best in the business production quality is perfect. However MHW comes with a major caveat in that because the whole game was designed from the ground up for a high definition era (which was long overdue) you're missing a LOT of content later games had. The visuals of the Monster Hunter games were relatively unchanged so they were able to bring over a lot of content in previous titles to later games and it worked well. By the end (Gen U) you had around 100 monsters tons of armor sets and weapons that had been accumulated through nearly 20 decades beginning at the first MH. MHW doesn't have that much content not even close with 30 monsters and a weapon selection that honestly feels anemic. However being that this is MH's first HD outting it's forgiveable and it's only going to get bigger from here.Now onto the big issues and the reason I can't recommend the game Capcom's 6 month delay to make the ""best they could"" for PC is absolutely pathetic and the game hardly functions when it comes to its online components. Performance shakey at best on the best systems because of poor optimization some visual settings don't do anything because they're straight up broken and getting the visual fidelity of the console versions is nearly impossible unless you want to match the 30fps as well. The biggest crime in all of this is that the multiplayer is completely broken and it's random if it'll work for you. My friends have occassional disconnects some don't have any but some of us (including me) have gotten the short end of the stick and getting a disconnect happens every 10 or so minutes guaranteed. What this boils down to is I cannot complete a hunt with friends because I'll be disconnected from them 90% of the time. People say Valve's to blame but it doesn't matter this is unacceptible and should have been fixed the weekend the game came out. But it's now two weeks later and we still haven't gotten a SINGLE patch. Rumors state we're going to get a bunch of updates tomorrow (8/22/18) and hopefully a lot of bug fixes but why the hell did Capcom choose to wait two weeks after release to fix basic network features? There's literally no good reason for this and it's pathetic PC players have been shafted again. I've spent a lot of money towards this series with merch collector's editions and now all the DLC they have available and it's quite a bitter taste.I'll update my review if this is fixed hopefully that being tomorrow. Capcom botched this up something fierce and I never thought I'd see a ""Mixed"" rating on Steam once this released but there you have it.Within the HOUR of this review Capcom released a patch to fix all of the connection issues I was having. With that said and the game being playable I'm switching my review to recommended. There still are various graphical issues that need to be fixed but I'm sure that'll be fixed with time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,30,False,Recommended,I have over 100 hours in the ps4 version. I stopped so I wouldn't burn myself out. It's a great game. There are network issues that require port forwarding which is a huge PITA. I can randomly connect to other's game without doing anything to my ports. The game recognizes ps4 controller as XBOX controller but there is a community mod to fix it. This is a really great game at its core but it needs some patches to really shine. Old PCs can run it at lowest graphics so the requirements to play can seem high if you haven't built an up to date computer in the last 4 years or so.Game needs some patches but if you're a monster hunter fan this PC Port is worth taking a hard look at.edit After opening my ports I've had no issues with multiplayer dropping or finding games to my satisfaction.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

That's super annoying and needs to be fixed Also disconnect errors plague the game. If you want to play for more than an hour with your friends in the same session ya no good luck with that ever happening. Seeing that I hit disconnects every hour and have friends that hit them every 10 minutes it's basically like this game is a single player game with unfinished multiplayer support. There's no way to fix this and we now play the waiting game with Capcom and seeing that their track record is absolute garbage we can expect it to be fixed MAYBE by the end of the year. You have the top selling game on Steam and the fastest selling Capcom game ever but you can't even play with friends. Until this massive issue is fixed I will not be recommending this to anyone for multiplayer aspects. However for a single player standpoint this is hands down one of the most fun games you will find on steam. Also killing the last boss in the game and finishing the story currently has a 25% chance to corrupt your save file meaning you can't load your game and that save slot is completely gone. Another thing that needs to be fixed ASAP. Hackers are also rampant and very common because they are using Peer to peer connections with no Anti cheat to be seen. Overall 8/10 for single player because of no 21 9 ultrawide support and game corruption issues2/10 for multiplayer because it's just plagued with disconnects and issues and you are likely to run into hackers if you can stay in a multiplayer session for more than 15 minutes.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,132,False,Recommended,It's an absolutely fantastic Monster Hunter game.It's by far more accessible to new comers than previous entries but in a good way. It also retains the depth of previous titles that us veterans have enjoyed for years.If you've never played a MH before just know that this is a very satisfying and rewarding series to play. You will have so much to learn and you pretty much won't stop learning. In my experience the MH community is very friendly and willing to help newcomers.Unfortunately there are connectivity problems at this time early in the release area. The game will randomly kick you out of rooms. It definitely doesn't happen all the time but it does happen.Having said that I'm sure it will be ironed out in time by Capcom. This is nowhere near a good enough reason to not recommend MHW. All of these knee jerk reaction down voting reviews are veering potential newcomers away from this amazing game and series.I've been playing the series for years now and have also put in around 250 ish hours on the console version of MHW. I am thoroughly impressed with what Capcom has accomplished here.

There are a few minor annoyances with this game though that I hope that will get fixed Software rendered mouse cursor this makes the cursor movement feel slow Restrictive keybinds like why are multiple different actions tied together into one keybind or why can't you even change the keyboard ""radial menu"" F1 F4 / 1 8 keybinds? The default radial menu is utter trash on keyboard thankfully you can change it to keyboard Camera annoyances but you can fix most of them by changing settings FPS drops Connection issues with friends but they are currently looking into thatBut as I said despite the launch issues this game is great.

2018-08-13,0,0,191,False,Recommended,Let me start out by saying I am new to the series so maybe I don't fully grasp what it is to be a monster hunter game. But that being said.I love this game. I was excited since it was announced and knew I would get it on PC. The extra half a year wait for it to hit PC was WORTH IT! the 60$ price tag for me seemed a bit steep but after playing for less than an Hour I knew it was money well spent. The graphics are amazing the enviroment feels awe inspiring! The gameplay is engaging in a way a lot of games these days just aren't. After almost 40 hours of gameplay I still do not find the fights to be mundane and boring. Each fight brings new things to light and you only improve more and more as you fight monsters.If there was any negative that I could think of it would be the control scheme. Clearly Capcom is a japanesse based company and they are not known for their PC titles or ports. So the controls seem a little weird at first but you quickly pick them up. The one thing I didn't pick up at all and still to this point is the use of the right mouse button to go back menus or to cancle things all together.All in all if you're looking for a title with an epic feel and that will literally chomp away HOURS of your life and only seem like mere minutes.

Monster Hunter World fits that bill again like the rest of its other editions.There are some issues with the game on not the greatest optimization for every system. However if you see all the negative review complaining about connection or optimization. I can some it up to you real simple ""You are going to need a mid to high end PC to run this game."" As for the connection issue I've lost connection in a mission like 2 time in the whole time I've played this game as of the time of writing this review (95.6 hrs on record) that's not bad in my book.Graphic Level4/5 its a beautiful environment they created for this game.

2018-08-19,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,If you're a fan of Monster Hunter then this is a must buy. The game itself is amazing even though it's a bit easier than previous entries. The only problem is that the port isn't the best. First keyboard controls are very awkward for someone who had logged a ton of time on the PS4 version though my friend seems to be having an alright time using them so it might just be that I'm used to the controller. Second there are a bunch of graphics settings that are missing like motion blur and depth of field. Honestly that's really not a reason for me or any of my friends to avoid the game so it's whatever you think. Lastly the servers are a bit wonky. Granted it's not as bad as some people have said as I am able to play with friends quite easily despite my connection dropping every once in a while. All in all I give this game a solid 8/10 and would definitely recommend it to both experienced monster hunter players and new ones.*EDIT*Apparently this game literally melts me and my friends CPU's (I got up to 98 degrees celsius after a meager 2 hours the other day) and because of that I can't recommend the game anymore.

2018-09-02,0,0,129,False,Recommended,I think the game is great. After the network patch I haven't had any connection issues which seems to be the biggest complaint about the PC release. From a game design standpoint I think the game is fantastic. Combat feels great and varies greatly from weapon and weapon to suit your playstyle. Monster's scale up in difficulty as you progress through the game. On multiple occasions I had thought that I had gotten good enough to beat the rest of the game easily but would end up having to change an aspect of my play or learn and implement a new mechanic to beat a new boss resulting in a very rewarding experience when you finally get good and beat that boss. While there isn't much of a story that isn't the point of the game. The point is combat mechanics boss mechanics and grinding to create that perfect build for your playstyle. Whether its min maxing stats or just building the coolest looking armor set for your character. Definitely recommend this game as it has been a very positive experience for me. Most complaints seem to be about the release schedule and bug issues which in my opinion should not really be used to judge a game. (Though I really have encountered pretty much no bugs other than the connectivity issues which like I mentioned aren't an issue anymore).Final Conclusion Fantastic gamewould recommendfirst time getting this sucked into a game and dropping 90+ hours in a game in two weeks for a long time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

On the other hand I miss a better combat resume in the quest summary screen something like the damage dealt by yourself and the rest of the party members.My only negative point is about the optimization the FPS acquired during my game time is not too high having in mind that I have no problems with the majority of the last games launched.In general is a good game but I do understand the current reviews where most of the 50% are negative due to the initial connection issues and also for the poor optimization from console to computer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-26,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Some hardcore fans might say this is dumb downed version of MH series. For a casual gamer this helps us balance RL commitment with our deep obsession in monster hunting. Unlimited whetstone for starter no more meaningless grinding that takes away our precious time. We casual gamers can focus on the main part monster hunting. The difficulty does increase as you progress with the game but I am probably sure hardcore games will complain that this game is too easy. In summary this game welcome new fans and those old fans who have been waiting to play with friends in monster hunter's environment. But this game is definitely not for masochist gamers. *Looking forward to play with friends but crossplay not available yet and multiplayer is still buggy according to few people. Well in the mean time you can just enjoy the story. For those who want to play the Multiplayer probably need to wait for patch. I even got connection error from broadcast request from a friend.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-27,0,0,156,False,Recommended,Despite the connection issues for multiplayer which have got better since the last patch this is one of the best games you will play. Having played the Monster Hunter franchise for over 10 years I can say that this one is the best one yet. The Gameplay is engaging and although this game is based on grinding which is usually seen as dull and repetative with Monster Hunter Worlds grinding the monsters is a dynamic experience and feels fresh even after multiple runs.This game is fun as well with other people nothing like battling it out with 3 other hunters to take down a giant lizard with wings. Whilst the main story servers as more of a long tutorial once you start getting into the high ranks the real difficults of the game starts to show. Fans of Dark Souls series will particularly enjoy this game as the hunts on here are somewhat comparable to boss fights in Dark Souls.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,193,False,Recommended,Just beat the main story Really enjoyed the game.Gameplay (7/10) Good gameplay though it requires getting used to the heavy feel of the MonsterHunter weapons. You'll feel slow and clunky but this forces you to learn the monster's move set so you know when you have enough time to get a combo in and when you do the game rewards you satisfyingly. There are a ton of different weapon and skill combinations that support anyone's playstyle. There are also a bunch of different consumable items that can be really useful if you take the time to learn how to use them. Unfortunately this game is a console port and the control scheme clearly had no intentions for supporting a mouse and keyboard properly (poor UI designs) You might be better off trying out a controller unless you plan to use any of the ranged weapons. Even with that said I still use a mouse+keyboard.Graphics (8/10) Good graphics and great level design that really immerses you into the game. The playable maps are big enough and there's no loading once you've started a mission. Some textures on big armor pieces can look shoddy as if the resolution isn't high enough. There are a lot of different monsters although some are just reskins of the original (first one you encounter). In some encounters there is a framerate issue especially with elemental monsters (Tobi Kadachi and Kushala Daora in particular) that causes brief stuttering although I'm unsure if this is just happening to me.Audio (9/10) Great soundtrack and sound effects with dynamic battle music. Make sure you keep your BGM on when encountering new monsters. Though because of the grindy nature of the game some music might start to get repetitive.Replayability (10/10) The replayability is very high as there are a lot of weapon and skill combinations to try and of course trying to rank the highest in the arena time trials and it's always fun to smash monsters in co op with your friends. Plus there are more monsters coming with future DLC (previous MonsterHunter's DLC was free).Fun (8/10) For the most part the game is very fun and satisfying to master. However there are some really sour moments that can ruin the mood like getting chain stunned to death by a monster or having your tracked target leaving the map after you've almost killed it (why?). There are also some issues with multiplayer connectivity but it seems to be getting better with every patch and even if you do get disconnected from a multiplayer session you can still continue your mission as is without any drop outs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,81,False,Recommended,Good Day everyone I love Monster Hunter. I couldn't play any since my PSP broke. I have played MHF MHF2 and MHFU before and I really enjoyed them. And I was really hyped for this titel since it comes to PC and I am no Nintendo player.I really like that this title feels just like them. It is an amazing hunting experience and I defenetely will keep on playing. I really enjoy the new things that are introduced in this title. Like picking up or using stuff while running envoironment no load screens and so on.What I miss a bit though is the challenge to find Monsters and to kill them in time. There are sometimes timelimits but I never had a problem with it. The scout flies are just overpowered. Luckily there is a mod that actually nerfes the scout flies. Of cause there is the problem with the connection but if I am honest I have been a solo player and I still am a solo player and up until now there was no monster where I needed the help of another hunter. Also I am pretty sure that these problems will be fixed in the near future.This game is so much fun for countless hours and I have pretty much just mastered one weapon. I need to try out all the other weapons too. This game is in my opinion the ultimate Monster Hunter experience until now.Have fun and enjoy the game. ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It's a good game burdened by two major issues.1 It does everything it can to make playing with your friends impossible it totes being a cooperateive game while locking you in boring unskippable dialogue cutscenes telling you that you can't play with friends because of various reasons using progression as an excuse for not letting you play with friends and even outright removing you from matches because of bugs or server issues.2 The game tries to create artificial difficulty by being unfair. If the game was more difficult it would not be a problem but what the game does is a mix of broken hit boxes hitting you out of animations where you are recovering from being hit and constant chain stunning make it so that you often die immediately even if you do nothing wrong.

You might experience lag freeze on Teostora Bezelguese and some monsters that have this flashing skills that freeze even my Dual 1080ti card.

2018-08-27,0,0,178,False,Recommended,So as a Monster Hunter Veteran it was clear for me to get this game for PC (also got it for PS4 since I couldn't wait any longer P).I kinda expected the release not to go that good because I got used to new games having big issues at first.. may it be connection issues frame drops high cpu and gpu usage for no apparent reason and so on... BUT I also know/knew that developers are closer to the community than ever before so that if those issues occur they will do something about it if not even immediately.The first 2 weeks since the release of MHW on PC weren't that great... alot of the time I couldn't play with my friends because of the connection issues (those btw also existed and still exist on PS4(but not to that extend)).Basically when they needed advice I could just tell them and they had to try because alot of people around me got this game as their first even Monster Hunter Title (as for most people on PC I assume).So after alot of disconnect issues low motivation of actually trying to get a multiplayer lobby running with friends even if it was just for 1 hour most of us just played through the game in singleplayer.This was also my first playthrough only using Bow as my only weapon and it's amazing.Now we are here... AND I FREAKING LOVE IT NOW. It is so enjoyable to play now after CAPCOM did something about the connection issues... I know some people still have issues and get kicked out of lobbies online mode and even complete hunts but for me and my friends it is a blast playing it... we had multiple sessions without any DC's at all where we played like 20 30 hunts and everything was running perfect.Even after a total of 400 hours (PS4 and PC) combined I still love this game as much as ever.The funny moments happening on hunts random 2 3 man carts where you just laugh your of because something hilarious happend or the time when people first experience the accomplishment of a well deserved monster kill.As the game is now I absolutely recommend it. I see more and more people that have this game on their wishlist and are willing to buy (or atleast consider buying it) now that the connection issues are mostly gone and I hope that if anything this game will thrive with the future updates.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I had a blast learning how to counter diablos with a heavy bowgun. Yeah sometimes you randomly disconnect from other players on the hunt but thats not a gameplay issue thats a networking issue.

If you want really good feeling combat that lets you beat the unholy snot out of big monsters and get some cool stuff on the loot treadmill from the hands of RNGesus it's a great game. If you want anything else it's probably not the game for you.Also cannot fault Capcom's post launch content release schedule.

2018-09-06,0,0,231,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is my first foray into the Monster Hunter Universe. Not knowing what to expect I found myself happily exploring the New World and slaying giant creatures. To my delight I found that Monster Hunter World is like a brighter Dark Souls complete with a bit of challenge for the uninitiated.What I Like A rich background story that gives the sense of a grander world. Fourteen unique weapons to suit just about any playstyle with lots of subtle nuances and tricks to help master them. A fast paced challenging combat system that feels different depending on your chosen weapon. A wealth of character customization options including appearance gear and weapons. A fairly simple and very efficient crafting system. Choosing an item to craft allows you to build its precursor components without having to fumble through all the menus. Lots of games can learn from this kind of system. The game rewards preparation from crafting items to use during a hunt or changing your elemental damage you can always make your hunts easier by spending a moment to prepare before heading out. Active developers that are constantly adding new content to the game.What I Don't Like Despite the rich backstory I find it odd that all the NPCs have literally the most generic names possible. Sometimes the quest for better decorations for your gear can feel a bit hopeless and grindy. Some monsters can feel like damage spongesFinal Thoughts I find myself in a happier version of Dark Souls complete with a large selection of weapons each with a unique playstyle and moveset to master. The monsters are relatively challenging and typically a kill (or capture) feels pretty rewarding. If you like a game that challenges you from the start with a vibrant world to explore or comes with numerous character customization options Monster Hunter may be right for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,143,False,Not Recommended,Bad port. They made a damm bad job on porting this game the controlls are clearly emulated and work real bad. If you really wanna play get a controller!!! Even on on max graphic config the textures arent good. Some stuff looks like they need to be rendered but not. And the worst thing on my opinion the damm servers are too instable they simples drops your session randomly. A MP game that you can't play regularly with other people.It s a shame beacause I love the Monster Hunter franchise but this version disappointed me badly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-18,0,0,367,False,Recommended,Instead of writing an exhaustive list of pros about this game (the only con was issues with the network that are now resolved) I'll just say that this has been one of the best cooperative games that I've played in a long time. It is a lot of fun solo but it is even more satisfying to take on monsters with friends. The monsters in and of themselves are quite unique but beyond that is the weapons which happens to be one of my favorite aspects of the game. You can start off with any particular weapon of your choice (Greatsword Gunlance Lance Dual Blades Hunting Horn etc.) become a beast at it and then change to another weapon type only to realize you just attained noob status again until you learn the tricks of that weapon type. As strange as it may seem though that's one of the reasons I enjoy this game so much. The monsters can be difficult but learning (YouTube is your friend) and perfecting weapon types is even more difficult and satisfying in my opinion. The first time anyone unsheathes a Great Sword I can almost guarantee they don't think it's possible to use...but the first few times you get that triple charge to the monster's head or tail and you break multiple parts...good luck putting that back in the armory.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,228,False,Recommended,EDIT 9/1/18 The first official patch has fixed the game entirely for me! Absolutely love this game and playing with friends is the bees knees. We've had ups and downs but mostly ups since the last fix. If you're considering purchasing to play with friends I can finally recommend doing so. Combat is fluid soundtrack is pretty good social life is now dead because of this game. THANK YOU CAPCOM FOR FIXING MY (and most others') CONNECTION ISSUES! Also Nvidia driver 398.36 is still the only stable driver for my wife's rig (GTX 950). I don't know why the newest drivers render the game basically unplayable on her machine.OLD REVIEW Love the core game itself but I cannot play online with friends (or anyone for that matter). Can't even play with the wife in the same room. Do not purchase with the intent of playing with others. Graphically the game is beautiful. Had a couple of crashes my first few hours but fixed with some minor tweaking and I haven't had a single issue with stability since.AMD Ryzen 5 2600AMD RX 480 8GB16GB DDR4 3000MhzSteady 60 Fps (1080p) on max settings(For AMD users the current 18.8.1 drivers work great)On the wife's rig I noticed the game was downright unplayable (10 20 Fps 1080p lowest settings everything disabled) with the new driver for her Nvidia GTX 950. After rolling back the driver to revision 398.36 (Current driver is 398.82) everything was fine (50 60 Fps 1080p mostly mid settings z prepass off volumetric rendering off). This seems to be a trend with GTX 900 series cards and backwards. The newer GTX 1000 series cards seem fine with the newer driver but the older ones don't seem to work nearly as well without rolling back a driver.Once this game has a proper working multiplayer I'll rescind my negative review. Until then I do not recommend the game in its current state to anyone wishing to play with others. If you're going to play solo minor adjustments (if any) should grant you a beautiful stable game and many hours of playtime.It hurts my heart to post a negative review because I know the team of people that built this game worked so hard to achieve such a beautiful piece of art. However after waiting 6 months for optimizations and receiving a product that does not work as advertised my disappointment is significant. Ten days after launch still no patch still can't play online reliably (if at all). I would love the option to host my own game and take the unreliable game servers out of the equation entirely.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"EDIT Game is good now. Connectivity issues have been corrected new content is forthcoming and things are coming along smoothly. I'm sad it took the better part of a month after release to correct it a month with saw all of my friends beating the game independent of each other but at least we can finally join up and enjoy things now.Having that said this is a gorgeous game with a widely varied and well balanced cadre of amazing weapons all of which have their own play style and functions in combat. Items are meaningful and managing your resources mid combat is both challenging and easy to do with a control system that is tight and easy to understand. The game doesn't explain every mechanic to you so at least some of the game is going to require experimentation and discovery which can be daunting when you consider how much you have to hunt to get some items. However going by the console release there's only more amazing things on the horizon with MHW and I'm sure you will love it. Just bear in mind that the ""tutorial"" is going to last you the entire length of your refund window if you have any reservations. Just saying.______________________________________________________I'm going to preserve my (750+ helpful rating) previous review here for posterity and to encourage Capcom to think twice before releasing a game in this state again I've purchased this game twice. I bought it for PS4 and fell in love with it. There were little disconnects here and there but I assumed that was an issue with the stability of the console and my wi fi internet. For months I enthusiastically sold the game to my friends on the promise of that fun and when they agreed to purchase it for the PC I was ecstatic because it meant I'd get to share it with them.I bought a second copy for PC so I could join them on their adventure. We joked around about the unskippable cutscenes and the mandatory slow tutorial. I listened as they plowed through the first missions so they could get to the point where the game started letting them team up together and when we all finally got together for our first group hunt we endeavored to launch a mission as a squad.Oh wait squads don't exist on PC. You have to around with Steam Groups. Finally got that figured out? Bam disconnect. Restart the mission. Bam error code 503820 MW1 gotta rejoin a public session with my friends. Wait now your friend hosting the session isn't showing on the ""friends' sessions"" list. Gotta restart the session. Someone still isn't seeing it have them host instead. Their game crashed everyone loads back in finally groups up and launches the mission. Bam another disconnect. And another. And another. And another. And another.I'm 54 hours into this game over the last two weeks and I've finished less than a half dozen hunts with my friends. Most of the time everyone gets kicked out of the session and you have to finish the battle alone against a monster that has scaled up to 140% extra health vs 4 players. Lag disconnects on a wired connection hosting issues and networking problems galore have plagued me since buying this title on PC. I've disconnected more times in two weeks on PC than I ever did in 8 months of PS4 gameplay. Several of my friends have beaten the game by themselves and are waiting for the game to be fixed so we can do something ANYTHING together. And to think... Capcom took an additional 8 months to release on PC because they wanted to ensure the game was ""optimized and delivered in it's best possible version.""Monster Hunter World is a brilliant game when it works but it is marred by constant and persistent stability issues time wasting unskippable cutscenes and credit sequences occasionally unfair monster behavior (Pink Rathian perma charging and Kirin lightning RDM I'm looking RIGHT at you) and an absolutely amount of networking errors that have yet to be resolved after 8 months of preparation and two weeks of the game being released. Toss in Denuvo DRM (seriously DRM) issues with Big Picture/Steam Overlay that almost require you to DISABLE TWO CORE COMPONENTS OF STEAM in the platform settings and the fact that Capcom has only issued a blanket statement about ""investigating the issues"" with no follow up over the last few weeks and you have a recipe for an avalanche of continuing problems with no time frame for correction.I'll change this review later if it's fixed *maybe*... but for now give this game a pass. Capcom isn't taking it seriously so why should you?",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World so far is a great game and runs smoothly in 1080p 60 fps on an i5 6400 and GTX1060.I myself had few experiences with the MH franchise except Freedom Unite for the PSP a couple of years ago so take my opinions with a grain of salt.The game explains its basic mechanics really well despite the use of textboxes I myself perceive as incredibly annoying in most titles. The game(play) however is relatively complex with many different factors to weigh in most importantly the weapon you chose before going on a mission which leads me to my favourite feature. The weapons. They are awesome and really really well balanced in a way that you can get stuff done without having to look up tier lists for example. Of course different weapons serve different purposes and the users skill plays a big part in the overall effectiveness of the weapon but that is so fun about it. Learning the movesets and finally pulling off that awesome combo you saw earlier in a real combat situation is incredibly satisfying.You really feel your character getting stronger as you forge equipment out of the monsters remains you have slain or captured earlier. All the gear looks cool even the earliest armor and weapons you acquire.I could go on and on about the amazingly designed areas of the game and the overall polishing of the game but I'm sure you read that dozens of times. (The cutscenes suck though they feel out of place)So why do I not recommend this game if it is so good?The problems I had below have been fixed in the last update!What is more important is mentioning how awful some of the technical and multiplayer aspects are as of now.The game frequently crashes when tabbing in and out setting up coop takes longer than actually being able to play in it due to the frequent network errors. The game makes a big deal of coop constantly making sure to remember you of how awesome and useful it is so it is even more apparent that it is poorly implemented in the PC version. Playing multiplayer feels like a burden (mostly because of the beforementioned issues) just doing the missions yourself is way more fun because you have to face the monsters yourself but I may be biased because of the Souls series.I really hope most of these problems get resolved so I can wholeheartly recommend this game to every RPG fan.Demanding long staged fights and a very accessible crafting system doesn't that sound good?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,219,False,Recommended,"Original review reflected state the game initially launched in. I no longer get nearly as many disconnects to the point I believe it may be fixed. I'll be changing my review to a thumbs up.The game is absolutely beautiful and even though you go through the same island hundreds of times it never gets old. There's always a sense of wonder/adventure and if you look hard enough you will find something new! The story of the game is kind of meh (maybe due to translation maybe just trying to keep a lower ESRB rating) but the gameplay itself can help with that. You might go through one canyon one time and get obliterated by some monsters so the next time you decide ""well maybe I'll try this cave opening and see where it goes maybe I can go around"". I find myself talking to my Feyline companion a lot of the times when in uncharted areas or when theres a very powerful monster around. You sort of get the sense even though you're out on ""quests/investigations/expeditions"" you are the master as well as player of the story unfolding in the current zone. The Zones animals and even armor/weapons are for the most part beautiful. Some of the monsters seem to follow a theme which I suppose makes sense but personally I wouldn't mind some more outlandish looking ones. The elder dragons in the late game make up for it though. The map of each zone feels very natural but at the same time is structured in a way that makes you think decide mid sprint which path is the best to take to get to where you need to go. It can be missed in the heat of a chase but the scenery is so well done you truly feel like you're in a desert forest highland range etc... The weapons and armor range from bland to so beautiful you want to stop everything and just farm for that partcular thing. They truly shine towards the late game where you have everything unlocked so don't be disappointed if every weapon you are using looks like a plain metal/bone weapon with some locks of monster hair glued on there at first. P That will change! Speaking of grinding the last thing I want to mention is that this is the only game I've played that understands what kind of game it is it understands its a grind and embraces it. In games notorious for grinding which are still decent great games you feel the grind. You dread it. In this one you crave it. You want to get back out on a hunt. Even if its for a monster you've killed 100+ times you want to go back and bash it's face in with a powerful weapon you just made as payback for the dozens of times he killed you when the two of you first met. Don't let that idea spoil the your expectations for the first kill of every monster though. It will be the toughest part of the game and you never lose that sense of accomplishment all the way through. Even while you're leveled up and bullying the once terrifying monster you think in the back of your mind that not too long ago the situation was reversed. The ways to go about encountering that monster are very versatile and you can set up your own quest and prepare (or jump right in) and gather party members to help or even go solo... However I prefer dropping into a player's quest who has shot an SOS flare. I like feeling like I'm helping out and truth be told I'm a bit of a showoff so I like lower level players to look at my armor/ weapons and be amazed at how well and how cool I look lol. I'm not a fan of the X/10 ratings system or anything like that but I will say if you like adventure if you like character creation and customization and you dont mind having to use your imagination for a story you can get lost in then this game will provide you with hours upon hours of enjoyment. (Friends to play with make the game interesting and play a totally different way but it's in no way a requirement. You can have fun just playing solo if that's your thing.)Original review follows Wait until they fix the multiplayer connection issues to buy. The best part is playing with your friends or shooting an SOS flare to have people come help you when the battle gets too intense. You cant do that if you get an error message that can't be fixed until you restart the game and then your friends have to create a new lobby because it's bugged from your error code. I'm betting it's Denuvo because nearly all multiplayer and cpu usage bugs can be traced back to that POS program. I'm no game dev though so whatevs could just be capcom dropped the ball. Other than all that bug BS it's a fantastic game. When this gets fixed it's worth a buy. In its current state it's not.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

A lot of settings you have to find and change. Mouse feels unresponsive.Neutral Monster Hunter combat Don t expect Dark Souls or NieR Automata. Some weapons take time to swing. Big weapons that do big dmg feel heavy. You get locked into animations easily so you have to fight intelligent. Some people hate it some people love it.

Installing MSI afterburner and setting the power limit from 100% (default) to 120% (max).

Just spent about an hour and a half doing 5 quests hunting Anjarath on High Rank to get disconnected every single time. It doesnt help that the monster scales up when you're in a party but if you get disconnected it doesn't scale back down. Which means you're left fighting a monster meant for a 4 party group all by yourself. Dealt with the exact same issue earlier today hunting Rathalos as well. Playing this game would be alot more awarding and satisfying if you didn't have to deal with constant dc issues every 10 minutes into a quest.

The issues are not game breaking see Issues section for more details.If either playing coop or playing with mouse and keyboard are a must for you then you can wait for Capcom to fix the issues. If your PC can't run this unoptimized game ask for refund on steam (REVIEW Coming from a new fan of MH MHW is my introduction to the franchise the The concept of the game is great The story is good it's intriguing have you wondering makes you curious and The way the game introduces you to the mechanics of the game is appropriate it The game has 14 weapons offering a great variety of playstyles The game is perfect for any new player to the franchise want to explore the world does have a lot of tutorial pop ups but they do help a lot if you are new to the tranchise. The difficulty of the game is appropniate for me I played the souls franchise and this game is surely easier but it's still challenging at times. (At least from my experience my perspective is that the game is not as punishing as Souls The graphics are gorgeous I sometimes just stand there watching the environment enjoying nature ISSUES Server/connection issues coop can be a hassle. Currently working for a fix with steam. Perfomance issues I have a good PC RX Fury coupled with Ryzen 1600 I have Mouse support is very poor I strongly recommend playing with controller.

2018-08-16,0,0,217,False,Recommended,Great game some snags on multiplayer issues with steam popping up notifications all the time as steam disconnects for a half a second makes using steam chat impossible as the in built client chat is poor quality and you can't increase the volume enough.That out of the way the weapon selection provides differing ways to approach the game and the skill curve is pretty damn satisfying along with the power progression. Like the movesets for the weapons aren't that complicated but there is a huge amount of room to master them. The monsters each have their own behaviours giving you unique ways to hunt them. You can go in all guns a blazing or slowly wear them down perhaps use the environmental options like boulder traps or paralysis toads. The maps are stunning and maze like and will give you a headache trying to figure out where to go the first few times. I've barely scratched the surface of the game at 30 hours and can see it providing a huge amount of content for me to plough through in the future.Other negatives why no cross platform play really capcom should have released this for all platforms at the same time and had cross platform multiplayer as this gane shines in multiplayer when you can get it to work. The story missions have multiplayer gated until you watch the cutscenes and even after that I often got failed to join game messages.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,137,False,Recommended,Disclaimer I've been playing Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter Freedom on PSP but I'm not that kind of person bragging that I was there before it was cool on anything. It's awesome that a franchise I love finally gets the success it deserves.So with that out of the way let's go. MH W is by far the biggest evolution in the Monster Hunter series and I love it. Capcom did an incredible job at understanding and addressing Monster Hunter's quirks and weaknesses all while retaining its essence and adding a lot of new stuff too.Example the delivery quests. Old timers will remember the long tiring and bothersome delivery quests. There was a lot of ranting about these but on the other hand I've always felt that they had their place in the game since as a ranger you're supposed to know and take advantage of the nature surrounding you. In MH W most of the delivery quests are gone replaced by a few optional quests to increase the Canteen's ingredient pool. However exploring and collecting are still rewarding in a number of ways bounties Palico gadgets and more.There are a lot of examples like this one but you get the idea.Of course there are still a few technical problems (the notification swarm the unsteady connection...) but these will be fixed in the future and they mean nothing compared to the gigantic effort that Capcom made to produce such a game. oldtimerpride I mean go look at what Monster Hunter Generations looked like just to get an idea of how much of a revolution MH W is. /oldtimerpride So if you're an old timer go play it because it feels like a whole new world (pun intented). And if you're a newcomer go play it too. If you get hooked on the universe you'll have a lot of fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,268,False,Recommended,This game is a good. When you take in the feel of combat and the beauty of the world it feels all so immersive.Now many players seem to have fps issues and disconnections and downvote it simply because of that. I have experienced some chugging in fps for about 5 seconds on about 4 different occasion and i have been disconnected from online about twice a day. However this is nothing compared to the Dark Souls 1 port. Anyone reading this review remembers Blight Town or the horible desync in pvp will understand. I will still call Dark Souls a great game and Monster Hunter World is also a great game despite these hangups.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,250,False,Recommended,"For me it's a great game. I didn't play other console ported games but with my i7 4790k 8gb ram and nvidia 980 i can play MHW at 1080p and 60fps so it's pretty ok for me. I mainly play with a bow and controls are also good. I changed only aiming from keybord to sidemouse button. And i don't have problem to hunt any monster. Mouse sensitivity is a bit faster after longer move but it has really small or no negative impact on my game at all.. First few hours with tutorial and getting used to new controls was a bit wierd but next day all that feel was gone and it was a good ride till the ""final"" fight.Biggest problem for me is that there are some connection issues that are annoying so most of play time i give up on playing with friends. I would appreciate some ingame friend list but that is not so important..I played all my previous MH titles on PSP only therefore this pc version is like a dream that came true D Dream with some small bugs here and there but in the end that feel when i deal a final blow to a monster is still unbelievably satisfying. I love this game",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-23,0,0,257,False,Recommended,"The game has a few issues. The connection problems for example can be really annoying though Capcom are working on the issue and the most recent update seems to have helped even if not completely solved the issue. Overall though this is a pretty good entry in the Monster Hunter series. When it does work the multiplayer is much better than it has been in previous titles. The SOS flares are a pretty good idea and the fact that you can just shift from solo to group hunting mid quest is pretty awesome. Not to mention the whole joining late thing. For the first 10 minutes after a quest starts you can join and still get full rewards.Other additions to this entry in the franchise that could be considered ""dumbing down the game"" are really just convenient. Want a Rathalos plate but aren't having any luck? There are weekly bounties you can do of various difficulties that give you items to redeem for rare parts generally one per week per tier of reward. So rather than grinding Rathalos for 5 hours and getting shut down by RNGesus you can kill 4 of some other monster or something. Of course you're free to not use this if you prefer the long grind that Monster Hunter is known for but personally I like having the option. Other time saving mechanics like farms getting you honey plants or mushrooms return as well as sending palicos out on expeditions.The scoutflies replace paintballs allowing you to locate track and see the status of a monster on the minimap without having to throw any items at it. It actually makes you feel more like a hunter looking for tracks or scratches for where the monsters passed by actually tracking it. They'll often pick up the scent before you find it though but with the maps being bigger and less straightforward than others in the series I'm okay with this. Gone are the days of going in a circle checking which number the monster is in. The whole thing feels more natural.The Investigation system rewards you for taking on slightly tougher than normal quests like lowering the number of times you can get carted back to camp or reducing the time limit. In addition to the regular rewards you're rewarded with usually 2 or 3 items from a different loot table corresponding to the quest. It's a nice change of pace and adds variety.Skills have been dumbed down a lot but as with other things I don't mind this change. Rather than armor charms and decorations having a number associated to a skill and then that skill activating if the total number for that skill is high enough and powering up more if it reaches higher thresholds gear just has skills. Combining makes them more powerful and most have more increments than they used to. It allows for more customization I think and while I do sort of miss having to plan out this crazy looking mismatched set of armor that would activate the skills I want negate the negative skills and not leave me completely vulnerable to fire attacks I also like to be able to swap parts in and out hassle free without it breaking the whole set I have going on.Overall it's a pretty good game and I can see myself putting a lot more hours into it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

That said game can be recommended now that you can actually play with friends. I'm going to keep the old text up and unedited.*/edit*I semi recommend this version if you don't mind playing solo. The game is really good probably the best Monster Hunter to date if you can excuse the lack of a G Rank and the somewhat sparse number of different monsters compared to earlier titles. There are a ton of improvements and additions made from MH4 that I love but this port has a number of issues mostly with online.Completely unreliable online and no easy/reliable way of joining friends playing makes playing with friends annoying and difficult. Disconnecting at random and a completely bogus way of matchmaking. On consoles you had squads which allowed for a quick and easy way for groups to get together in one spot. On Steam even though they have Steam Groups somewhat integrated in they're absolutely useless the only thing that the game does is display your group name and avatar in game. Steam Groups do absolutely nothing to connect whoever is in that group into a shared jump in/jump out session.The amount of disconnects that happen in the game is unforgivable. At launch on PS4 there were nowhere near as many issues and you could reliable stay connected in someone's session. I don't know how the backbone stuff works on Steam but whatever way the game is speaking to Steam needs to seriously be addressed.This is also kind of a gripe with the base game itself but having to turn off/change a lot of default camera settings to get the intended Monster Hunter experience (switch Focus Camera to Target Camera turn off everything having to do with dynamic/automatic camera setting camera distance to Far) is not good and I hate it. The default camear settings are bad and not at all recommended.A lot of my friends were holding off on getting MHW to get the ""better"" PC version but having the game come out in this state 6 months after the initial release on consoles kind of calls into question what was going on in that time frame.Until these issues get fixed I'm keeping this as Not Recommended.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-28,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Right off the bat I want to say this there are certain parts of this game that needs work and fixing and day one this game was not working correctly and it makes me extremly sad that in one day of this games realease its review dropped to 43% its getting better but the rieview score does not tell how good of a game this actually is. to start off adressing all the concerns about graphical settings and complains such as mouse acceleration I 100% agree with the complaints about these things they do need to work on them and implament them into the game but the issues that I will not conced to are the complaints about the severs. yes day one the servers were actual trash and didnt work but two to three weeks after realease they have improved ten fold the only time I have been disconected from a server when I didnt want to be was 8 days ago and if your wondering about how good my internet is let me tell you its trash to give you a good idea when im plaing a game like league of legends my ping is about 150 so that should give you a good idea of how bad my internet is and now how well the servers hold up. as for people who say that late game is a RNG GRIND fest I agree to a certain extent alot of it is rng BUT you can counteract this by simply breaking off parts of the monster that you need and the chance of getting that set item goes up by quit a bit. Gameplay wise this game is fantastic its smooth satisfying and caters to new players and vetran players alike as well as giving the player a full range of weapons that each cater to their own playstyle that is unique adn interesting. the monsters are fair(for the most part looking at you nergigante) and with enough practice it can be beaten. in conclution little to none of the negative reviews dont bring up gameplay and for the most part is just ing about the settings and almost every review site and person that you go to for reviews of games has said the same thing this game is ing great. so should you not get this game becuase of the review? hell no all those reviews are just people being crybabies because they dont get exactly what they want. dont beleive me? just look up reviews and what they say about this game or what sites like metacritic say or something even better buy the game youself weather it be on steam or some other party site that you can get it for cheaper and then see for yourself that this is one of the best monster hunter games out.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Now for the notable issues Whenever opening the game steam shows a pop up to all your friends that you are playing MHW which is no problem. However it also does this at random intervals even when you have not opened or closed the game. It seems to be a server thing since if it happens to one friend it usually happens to the some of the others at the same time. This can get annoying for some people but it in no way hinders gameplay. We have learned to ignore it.Sometimes one of us is unable to join the others through the ""friends' sessions"" when looking for online sessions. This is usually solved by joining the friend that has problems connecting. As loading is blazing fast on pc this isn't too much of an issue.We regularly experience disconnects from the server or from friends' sessions. HOWEVER this only happens when one person is not in the same instance as the other such as in the workshop or tradeyard. Out of all the collective time we have played so far none of us have been disconnected while on a hunt together or in the same gathering hub. This can happen even while solo on a hunt though but that is even less of a problem. As loading is blazing fast on pc this hasn't been too bad of an issue. If a friend dc's while you're on a hunt together I would blame his internet.Very rarely I get a spike in framerate drops meaning my game freezes for a few moments before resuming. I don't know what causes this but it is so infrequent that it hasn't harmed me yet while on a hunt.I've seen some people complaining about the negative mouse acceleration. Although I'm sure a fix could be implemented to give you the option to turn it off I don't see why this warrants a negative review. Myself and none of my friends have had any issue with it. Deal with it. Now for the pros This game looks great and plays great. I love the details that have gone into the environment and monsters and while my GPU isn't top of the line and some of my friends have far worse computers none of us have had framerate problems or graphics issues. Others may just need to update their software but I am no graphics expert.The general gameplay reminds me of dark souls a lot. Movement and attacks feel heavy and impactful while making poor gameplay decisions such as that one extra swing or trying to heal at a bad time punishes you heavily. I like this type of gameplay and so do my friends but it isn't for everyone and does require some ""getting good.""All the weapons. Holy moley so many weapons. Since you get the basic version of each weapon for free you can just pop into the training room test them all out for free. Each one very nearly changes the entire game you're playing.Each new area is unique and refreshing. Once you've fully scoped out and hunted everything in a zone you're hit with another that has completely different dynamics and environmental features/hazards.The way the story progresses makes you always feel like you're moving forward some way or another. You're either getting that sweet new gear and constantly upgrading or unlocking new missions and areas and getting rewarded finely for each hunt. There is some rng to the rewards but hunting a monster again can be fun if you learn from past mistakes. Nothing is more satisfying than stomping on that Anjanax you've been having problems with.On the topic of gear the true endgame is fashion. I'm sure most of us can agree on that.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-28,0,0,92,False,Recommended,It's a good game for beginners to the Monster Hunter franchise and a good game fro returning hunters. The differences are mostly quality of life improvements that make the experience on PC feel much more polished and thought through than a more traditional Monster Hunter game. Hundreds of hours of playtime and new monsters for over 60 of those hours plus free gameplay adding DLC (the only paid dlc is cosmetic) makes this an excellent value and an excellent game. Online connectivity is currently spotty but already leagues better than at launch and the patches released so far have only improved performance on my somewhat aged i5 4690k and 1070. Can't wait for dlc releases for PC!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-28,0,0,200,False,Recommended,"I highly recommend playing this game. It is true that there is a networking issue but that has not prevented me and my friends from playing together. Only added a minor annoyance.I certainly don't think this game should be downvoted for a known and fixable problem unless the parent company leaves it for a while... And MHW hasn't bene on PC that long. Monster Hunter world is a game about (surprise) hunting monsters. Expect to come in pounding the ever loving crap out of an easy range of monsters while gradually upping your understanding until you're dancing with finesse around some predators that were an obscene challenge once upon a time. I've seen many veterans knock on MHW for being the ""entry"" or ""streamline"" game in the series. ""made too casual for the sake of being an entry title."" Well in my opinion that can sometimes by a good thing. Perhaps an entry title that doesn't threaten to utterly frustrate all but the most fanatically dedicated players could help the franchise. I'm certainly glad to have a game I can casually play while knowing that if I don't put the effort in to learn and improve i'm never going to get past some of its mid to late game hurdles. Yet I have the freedom to enjoy the challenge without being overwhelmed or being subject to overly serious elitist fans either. Is a good game. I had fun with it and that is probably the most important quality a game can have. Being a joy to play.P.S. Handler Waifu gets 7/10 hearts. Would grope again.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-28,0,0,90,False,Recommended,Just showing my support for a great game. Not the BEST Monster Hunter game but never the less in my 10 years playing this series (started playing in 2008 the original game came out 2004) would I ever have expected to be playing it on the PC and for that alone is a dream come true.The disconnects that were frequent during week after launch seems to have mostly gone now a few hiccups here and there but otherwise I've been able to find people to play with using the search or SoS flare.Even then you can progress through the game alone and OFFLINE a little lonely with a cat following you around but it doesn't deter from the great game it is.Performance wise I'm running the game on a machine with 4 year old hardware (looking at you GeForce GTX 970 and 8GiG of RAM) so I'm playing with custom medium settings and the only massive slowdown is during the really crazy fights (Teostra/Kushala Dora).Anyway don't want to type a long review. If you enjoy spending hours on end hunting the same monster for a part to make awesome weapons and armour only to hunt cooler monsters for cooler parts to craft even cooler weapons and armour sometimes alone with a cat or other hunters then this game no this series is for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"Pros +It's a Monster Hunter game. On PC.+Great animations and visuals in general. +Weapons seem to be well balanced in comparison to prior titles.+Less tedium. Especially when gathering.+No loading times between map areas (about time)+Highly customizable loadouts item belt settings etc.+Good tutorials. Nice for beginners.+Combat is tons of fun. Albeit a bit crazy sometimes.Cons Menu navigation Just awful. Much more awful than in previous titles. I am especially triggered by the book animation that is played when browsing quests EVERY SINGLE TIME. (I know about the speed up) Lack of graphical options. Motion blur and DoF need to be optional. No option to disable the annoying af scout flies. I am not blind nor stupid. I can find gathering spots without it. Please don't clutter my screen. Hilariously bad optimization. Srsly considering the looks of the game it runs like garbage. Get 2+ ppl with elemental weapons and watch any NASA PC spew out 30 fps on average during combat. No matter the settings. It's unforgiveable for a multiplayer game. Speaking of which reduce the special effects and particles in combat situations. Spares my eyes and boosts fps. ez win/win. Chat system. Why is it so hard to access? Why are NPC dialogues progress notifications and other junk displayed in the same screen area? Let me press ""y"" and ing chat. I don't want to navigate through 3 menues to say something. Can't see hunters in headquarters. And nobody is in the gathering hall. Ever. Network errors are far too common.

2018-08-20,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,New player here almost played for 2 days a row... pretty enjoying because of the graphics sceneries etc. but one thing I hated the most is when I played to hunt/capture different bosses for hours then I started to save (3 times always + 1 save before Iogging out my account)... but the frustating part is when my account still going back to the start when I need to start hunting again those monsters that I already killed. Furthermore Fix the connectivity issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Exactly the same Monster Hunter as the consoles (DLC later) with a few technical quirks. Most of the crashes are gone with the latest patch so that's good. I'll update this review as the game is fixed.The game is extremely CPU heavy and not very well optimized yet so good luck. Even the 1080ti OCed can barely hit max settings 60fps at 1080p. That being said my 1050ti OCed is hitting 45fps on medium settings 1600x1200. If you have a 4 3 ratio monitor hold off on buying until the next update. 16 9 works (mostly) fine but 4 3 is screwed up. The only known fixes for the problem (the game tries to play 16 9 and downscales) is to 1) play borderless window or 2) turn down the resolution until it fits.Some of the graphical settings don't work right. Volumetric lighting is broken and just lags dynamic scaling is a joke right now there aren't enough settings. That said in a future update from today (8/11/2018) this will surely be fixed.The gameplay should be done with a controller but if you have ever played Diablo or competitive Starcraft a keyboard will work. The guns are way better with a mouse than with a controller.So far I have not found any game breaking bugs since the patch except for one. NEVER EVER TAB OUT. The game will probably crash as mine did and you'll lose all your progress.The actual game part of the game is all there and works fine which is why I'm recommending the game.Now why are ports this broken (usually) at launch? Well a port is very different from making the game and a different team usually handles is. They have VERY limited play testing abilities and when tons of people finally play the game (release) bugs are found. All that tasty new testing data is then used to fix the bugs. Otherwise the release would be much farther in the future.So in conclusion Nvidia users Good luckAMD You have the best experience rnEDIT The game has been slightly optimized and online works a lot more. Aspect ratio errors are still rampant. 9/20/2018,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,99,False,Recommended,Finally a Monster Hunter game on the PC for us Non Japanese players! (Monster Hunter Online exists but it's JP only.)I haven't played a MH game since the PSP...or Wii version whichever came out last. This game is AMAZING. Combat is so much more fluid. And there are SO many QoL improvements that maybe newer games have but I have never experienced! I've primarily been a ranged player Bow in games that allow it Bowgun in the rest. Trying to use them on handhelds and the Wiimote or in general on older games was a lesson in frustration to say the least. But the Bow is so fluid to use in this game. Aiming ranged weapons is cake now and bowguns don't feel like you're just an immobile turret. The Crafting UI is fantastic. For armor all of the sets are on their own row instead of scrolling through a long list looking for each part to craft. For weapons you can see the weapon tree so you can easily plan out what you'd like to go for.Haven't tried MP because I've heard it's a pain. No biggie. I have two friends that are playing it one of them experienced and one not. We're all going through the storyline ourselves to get experienced with this game. Hopefully by the time we hit the free range at the end they'll have this game patched up and MP will function better.There seems to be a few bugs two at least that I have experienced. This game REALLY doesn't like to be alt+tabbed out of. It'll work a few times but eventually one of the times you focus on it again it will crash. Thankfully the game can be played in windowed mode if you really need to go back and forth a lot. The second one seems to be the textures. I've seen pics and vids from the console versions of this game and while I'm running it at max settings the consoles look so much better. Sure things look good if you're far enough away but the closer you get the more you realize that you aren't running high resolution textures even though the options say you are.I've seen a few people complain about controller support. I'm using an Afterglow 360 controller USB cable not wireless and I have zero issues. Worked right from the start. Game transitions seamlessly between controller and KB + Mouse too.Overall I'd say this was a pretty damned good launch! Looking forward to getting all of the events and DLC that the consoles have been getting all this time!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-20,0,0,29,False,Recommended,Just as an initial caveat I bought this specifically to play single player and maybe eventually dabble with multiplayer. So there's that.I've really enjoyed this game. I STRONGLY suggest playing around with all the weapons to see which one fits you best. I'm NO good at the whole combo thing and I've found despite WANTING to play melee I'm just no good at it. A heavy bowgun however has been very fun and while I hesitate to say I'm good with it I'm capable. But even not being reat I've had lots of fun so far and look forward to more.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The combat is impressive in depth and takes a while to master each of the 14 weapons (what would otherwise be entirely different classes in other games in the same genre). Visual and stat customization have a bit of depth to them where you can specialise into full on DPS niche forms of combat like jump attacks or mounting or support builds with the option to do a bit of each without hurting your overall enjoyment. The monsters are varied with just enough in common with each other that you can pick up tells quickly but there is always the risk of getting caught in a lucky hit and going down anyways.

Grouping is less painful now that the servers arent constantly crashing.Quite a learning curve for people who are new to the series like how I was... but I think its worth it.

The game looks better without it and you'll easily gain 20FPS or even more depending on the area.So far I have run into no issues with this port I only have a little bit over an hour but in this hour I have played the beginning tutorial and the first hunt.I am running 1920 x 1080 60FPS+ almost all the time. This is on the highest settings minus the volumetric fog.For me this port seems to be pretty good. Not sure what the scare was about beforehand you don't need a real beast to play this. I am sure I could get alot more frames if I decided to turn some settings down but I am perfectly happy with 60fps. Also Capcom said that the graphics are technically the same as compared to consoles and honestly they're right. However seeing the game in a silky smooth 60FPS+ makes everything look and feel so much better than console.My specs for reference.CPU Core i7 4790k 4.6ghz OCRAM 32GB DDR3HDD Samsung Evo 850 500gbGPU GTX 980 SCLoad times are ultra snappy especially compared to consoles this is because of my SSD though your mileage may vary depending on what you have.

2018-08-18,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Edit It appears they have fixed the disconnection issues for now although I haven't played during peak hours I suspect it will be fine.The gameplay and amount of content is great but the multiplayer is a bit clunky. It's plagued with unexpalined/unintuative design details that will lead to a subpar experience when trying to play through the game with friends especially if you can't spend all day dicking around.This is particularly frustrating as multiplayer is the best way to experience the majority of the game.Also mouse smoothing that can't be disabled?

2018-08-16,0,0,446,False,Recommended,I dont think I have words to describe what could be one of the best game I've played in years. This game is top in Singleplayer content replayability and ability to make you lose track of time when playing. Granted the game has several issues such as the famous connectivity problems and other bugs affecting gameplay experience. What I will say is that these problems will most likely be fixed sooner or later and 95% of the game is accessible regardless of them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,"Summary If you have played a Monster Hunter game before you'll most likely enjoy this game but if you're a Monster Hunter newbie to the franchise avoid.Detailed If you're like me in that you've never played a MH game before then Capcom doesn't really know what to do with you. It explains simple things multiple times (ok game I know how to get a food buff thanks for the fourth reminder) but fairly serious things only once (for instance sharping a weapon. Heck I had no idea until a few hours in that it was a constant thing you needed to do and not a one off. If you don't do this fights take forever)It means you don't get the full experience. It also means tasks which should be ""easy"" turn into a trial of attrition. It dampens the whole experience. I love the gathering and fishing aspects of the game and it looks very beautiful. It really does look amazing. I feel that Capcom expect the user base to already be understanding the concept of their game so they didn't put much effort into teaching new people the ropes.Multiplayer connectivity issues aside the game also can't decide if it's a solo game or a multiplayer game. Some missions you can group up with friends others you can't. Some missions you can't group up to begin with but halfway through without warning the game goes ""lol you can try this mutiplayer flare see if anyone turns up"". It's just so jagged. There's a hub world you can connect to which looks exactly the same whether it's solo or multiplayer except you have to be in the hub world before going on any quests. And then you get disconnected and have to go through the whole process again.I'll keep trying to enjoy this game because I feel that once the core mechanics are understood this could be an amazing game. If Capcom fix the mutilplayer issues too and make it slighter easier and less intrusive to group up then yeah it'll be much more fun. But I cannot in good mind recommend this game to those brand new to the franchise in it's current state. If you find people to group up with to explain the game who have played MH before then it would be a blast and if you're already a MH fan you couldn't care less about this review! But for brand new people? Avoid. Or at least wait until these issues are fixed or a sale. Otherwise you'll just be disappointed. Like me.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,232,False,Recommended,The core game experience is a masterpiece.Each map is beautiful and filled with both secrets and mechanics specifically aimed to help you in the hunt of a monster provided you learned how to trigger such mechanics.It's definitely not easy to hunt a monster but the system built around it is very rewarding and gives me a great sense of accomplishment and reward whenever I am capable complete a hunt.However there is a great downside The Multiplayer.The overall UI is overly complicated because of too many redundant tools.In my opinion just the core game experience (offline single player) is worth the 60 bucks.Once the servers have been fixed I am convinced that the game will be rated as best game of 2018.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Though not the best machine to play this on it's still playable. Was surprised that the game can even play with specs like this though I had to put all graphic settings to the lowest and the resolution to 720p and it's hovering around 25 30 fps with occasiona framedips. But it's still acceptable for me since I've played the previous versions and the framerate and graphics looks the same (or even better) when I run the game on this laptop on low.

2018-08-23,0,0,72,False,Recommended,My first Monster hunter world experience. It's been nothing short of awesome I've always wanted to play a MW game but never had to chance to console limitations and other reasons. Glad to finally have just strached this itch. I have had almost no huge issues with this game unlike many others. No crashes in 50+ hours only one freeze that came back 5 seconds after it happened. My system also managed to play this game very well with a 3 year old gpu (rx 480 mid high fps 75+ constant fps). There has been a lot of network connection issues early on but to me I always play games solo so it didn't affect me much. Biggest issue from me is just low res textures and some graphical settings that just plan don't work. Patch should have come in by now. Honestly though its 100% worth it for me at its current state. The game is really just that good. Again we do still need some pactches to fix some things excited for the future of this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-01,0,0,239,False,Recommended,I've played Monster Hunter World into the late game and so far I'm loving it. I'm not too great at writing reviews in a paragrah format so I'll make some Pros and Cons.PROS Long story Amazingly fine tuned combat 14 Different weapon types (all feel completely unique) All weapons viable if you wish to use them Plethera of unique monsters World feels truely alive and sense of scale is nailed. Each monster has an armor set associated with it The grind isn't tedious ( I usually hate grinding) Everything is rendered in game engine (seamless cutscenes) Character customization is robust so is the Kitty customoizationCONS Story could be stronger but is good enough Some characters can be annoying this can vary Some end game content can practicly melt your CPU (I have under the REQUIRMENTS for my PC it still works) There is a difficulty spike somewhere in the mid to late game that can be a hurdle Mods can be risky as Capcom has not shown support in the past Connectivity to online can be shoddy (offline play is a thing)Over all I give this game an 8.5/10. The game could use some work but I've been addicted since I first started playing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Edit Now that time has past and the game has been updated I can finally update this review. FIrst here are my specs Video card &gt GeForce GTX 1060 6GBRAM &gt 8GBCPU &gt Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 6600 CPU 3.30GHzTime has passed the game has been updated with performance fixes for online and it's gotten gorgeous. I feel in love with this game even more and now I can 100% recommend this title to everyone who wants to get into a Monster Hunter title. FIghting against (most) monsters is a challenging joy the progression feels meaningful and the gameplay is just fun! While past games had some annoyances like standing still to consume an item this game let's you move during. A welcome and life saving change and just one of many small examples. This is the best title to become a hunter period.In my original review I talked about how awful the optimization is. Since then it's gotten better but I can only partially confirm this as I use a mod to disabled the anti mod program. The game would otherwise kill my CPU and that's something I don't want to bother with. Loading times are super small with this fix now screen transitions are fast. The game just feels so much better now! The online connection is also stable now. I didn't lose the connenction once since they lasted updated it.So overall yes. Go buy this game. It's worth it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-21,0,0,241,False,Recommended,First off the learning curve is steep and the game doesn t explain everything. I was 50+hours into it before I realised my switchaxe has two guages seriously just watch tutorials to avoid needless frustration. Often you ll need gear to fight certain monsters properly grind it first not being equiped properly is the source of a lot of frustration. I ll give you the example of me trying to farm nergigante ( highly agressive elder dragon ) I wasn t equiped with a weapon that had elderseal or exploited a weakness of his. To make matters worse my armorskills were all over the place it was disgustingly frustrating to fight this thing on my own. Now I have farmed for the armor I needed and have a new weapon that exploits his weaknesses to some extent + has high elderseal. It s pretty easy after this save yourself the headache and look it up first. it ll take you 10 hours to figure it out on your own. The story is meager at best but I didn t expect much out of it what is dissapointing though is that pretty much every quest is just a plain filler. When you get to hunt monsters this isn t an issue but when you need to go looking for tracks... It is tedious extremely boring and frustrating because you can run around for an hour not having found what you re looking for. It s stupidly easy to get a lot of gameplay hours out of a game with this little content and the content is little. Then there are the Zora Magdaros quests load up cannons fire at a huge monster and having no idea if it s actually doing anything. There are parts where you get on his back and destroy magma cores you re swinging at a rock that starts glowing and then spews magma you need to get away from. The thing is it doesn t leave you enough time to do so again frustrating. Those are the story missions everything else is straight up fighting monsters wich is far better then this.Enviroments are gorgeous and easy enough to navigate a variation of smaller animals roam the lands it feels alive no remarks there. Even your headquarters look awesome and everything you need is right where you want it. The monsters are impressive especially in turf wars the first time seeing a rathalos ( flying monster ) just plain picking up an anjanath ( t rex land monster ) and dropping it on the ground for massive damage was amazing.Now the combat it s my first game out of the Monster Hunter series and honestly I expected the combat to be more fluid. I have to admit so far I only have experience with the switchaxe wich is a heavy weapon by all accounts. It s just realy difficult to play reactive you can t weave combo s and dodge monsters at the same time. Sometimes the monsters can just charge run you over and then start stunlocking you. You don t survive 10 seconds of not being able to do anything in this game it s frustrating dying like this it doesn t really feel fair. I m 50 hours into this and my gear is still crap I m struggeling to get trough. Dark souls gives you a sense of achievement when beating a boss because you can simply try again without having lost anything. Here you have to farm up what you spent trying to kill something that guts you with 1 attack. You can t play reactive because everything stunlocks you and the weapons limit your mobility greatly. Half the time you re running around the monster with your weapon sheated hoping for a gap so you can heal. Then when you take a swig of your potion it turns around looks at you from half way across the map and then jumps you. Taking a potion will also limit your mobility and it heals you gradualy. I d say it takes about 2 5 seconds to down and it draws monster aggro so if you need to dodge or get hit you ll lose half the potion + take the damage the monster dealt. This is the reality when fighting on your own having multiple people to hunt with greatly improves the experience.Would I recommend it? It s not for everyone I can tell you that much casual playing isn t an option you need to grind for gear to take on bigger monsters. If you re not willing to put in a huge amount of hours to finish a lackluster story then don t buy it. It is time consuming and a lot of RNG you can manipulate what the monsters drop by breaking certain parts but when you need gems... Good luck decorations are even worse. If your friends are playing it then yes it is fun to hunt together. Single player? Not so much.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,610,False,Recommended,First of all the gameplay in Monster Hunter World is excellent and You will definitely have a lot of fun in Monster Hunter World. The PC version or should we say what it really is the PC port is okay but it's actually not quite where it could have been after these 7 months of extra development. The game looks fantastic but some effects can cause some pretty big fps drops during certain fights. Most controls are rebindable which is good but some buttons I'd really love to have rebound aren't rebindable. F1 F4 can open additional bars on PC but F1 F4 are not rebindable which isn't good. On launch the online service was spotty at best frequent disconnects and lots of frustrating moments because of it. These problems have been worked on by capcom and these latest days I've seen 0 1 disconnects over the course of 10 12 hours of gameplay. It's no surprise that this game has received alot of negative feedback on steam due to the connection issues but the problem has been worked on and is much better now. Because of this I will recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Even if you treat this just as a single player game I think it it's well worth the price.All the content is soloable until Kulve or Behemoth which are balanced for full party only (raidbosses).

2018-08-15,0,0,649,False,Recommended,Edit 26 Aug 2018 With the recent patch the connection is significantly more stable and the heavy fx caused by lighting attacks and some elder dragon attacks don't crash GPUs anymore though they're still heavy.I love monster hunter. Been playing since the MHFU days. This one is a vast step forward and definitely the next big monster hunter title. Graphics are stunning. The world comes alive and after finishing up on the 3ds you feel like this is how monster hunter is really supposed to be. A lot of game mechanics and weapon systems have been refreshed making it an all new experience for even veteran hunters.But as everyone here has said the connection issue is seriously wrecking the game for everyone. People can suddenly disconnect mid quest and a monster that's health has been scaled up to 4 players is suddenly yours to face alone. Even staying in the gathering hub where all tlhe other players are for a while can disconnect you.Please fix this Capcom. The game is a 10/10 minus the connection problem.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,134,False,Recommended,CONS This game makes it a pain in the behind to play with your friends. The matchmaking is flakey and the cutscenes make the game pretty annoying to play in general and interrupts the flow of combat. I also get tired of the camera zooming out and around the recent kill of a big monster making it really hard to gather materials in the time alotted at the end of a quest or expedition. I have been staring at that monster for the past few minutes and had to chase it across the map to its lair... I think I know what it looks like. I also do not care about the story... At all... I am sick of the game forcing me to play it... I only want to play the game with my friends. Sorry writers and designers... But not really...PROS Still fun for the most part.Upcoming updates may fix the cons above.Stratagies are fun to figure outMonsters are usually fun to battle there is a little sameness in some of them.Most of the ingredients you need for gear are picked up along the way and are plentiful and respawn often.Expeditions add a splash of random events that keep things fresh.As it stands 7/10. If they improve matchmaking and change how some of the game flows to avoid breaking the momentum I would give it an 8.5/10. Overall I can tell the Devs care about this game and are ready to improve it which is a plus. I am totally excited to see what comes of the game and I am looking forward to playing more of the game in the coming months.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-23,0,0,144,False,Recommended,Amazing game plays great beautiful graphics havn't had an issue with any online matchmaking also have had no bugs or crashes in my 40 hours of playing the game. Have no frame issues after messing with some of the settings sure they can add more advanced graphic settings but I honestly couldn't care less about that given that the game is very enjoyable all the same. If the negative reviews are making you second guess buying the game look at the hours each person has put into the game. If the game was broken due to the a bad port servers etc. they wouldnt be putting in 30+ hours into the game. Its a great game this being nitpicked bc of the fact it is a port. Again this game is probably the most fun I've had in a pc game to date and it is just getting better can't wait for the free content updates so that I have even more things to do.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-24,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World has gotten a lot of hate recently for its poor matchmaking and subpar optimization. Since the previous update I have had no problems with the matchmaking system and played many multiplayer quests. Even though I m running a GTX 970 with an i3 6100 I typically get around mid fifty frame rates on high at 1080p. It may require slight tweaking (particle effects seem slightly messy) but even my modest build can get pretty consistent 60 FPS on pretty high settings. Also the recent gtx driver update has helped solve a lot of the minor frame rate dips for me. All in all Capcom has definitely fixed the majority of problems here and this game is extremely fun to play.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,236,False,Recommended,The game is great if they could just deliver the online multiplayer part of the game. Otherwise don't even bother picking this up as there's a high chance you won't be able to play with your friends. Had this issue on the PS4 and for it to persist to steam. I just don't know if Capcom online coders are drooling troglodytes or what.UPDATE Its still broken for some people and game sessions are scarce for country locking but they are doing something about it. Still would not recommend for online play but spectacular gameplay that id recommend it as a stand alone offline single player experience,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,236,False,Recommended,Great game fun with friends and solo less content than other MH games but on a next level of polish.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,414,False,Recommended,"80+ hours in finished the story and all I would say that this game completely beat my expectations of it. This game has TONS of new features compared to the previous MH installments such as extended move sets for different weapons (also suited for different play styles) random monster encounters (one minute you're hunting one thing the next second another monster joins in and it's up to you if you want to take advantage of the encounter or just run away) easier crafting able to change equipment during hunts (w/c is pretty useful if your current weapon isn't very effective for the current monster you're hunting) changing armor pigment (a huge deal for me even if it's only changing a small detail) etc.But it's not all fun and games though since the only con I found on this game is the server disconnection issue w/c is a real heartbreaker for this game. As most players know monster stats are boosted when 2 or more people join your game and having them disconnect during the game and leaving you with the boosted monster to solo is a huge pain (high rank radobaan took me almost 40mins to solo w/ boosted monster stats). For those who are completely new to the MH franchise this game is unforgiving. You could say that ""this is like dark souls"". But i'd say this is really MH itself. It's not supposed to hold your hand and guide you through everything and put you through scripted monsters that automatically die in 3 hits. Nope it doesn't work that way. If you plan on playing this game for the long run be prepared to be frustrated and enraged. As a veteran MH player myself i'd advise you to ask for help from veteran players (don't bother with the arrogant ones) ask for help on reddit if you find the steam forum toxic ask your friends to play with you so that you can all learn and experience the game yourselves etc. The game is doable on solo if you read the tells strike when the opportunity arises and not rush in like an idiot.Compared to the previous MH games i'd say this is definitely easier. If you don't know what i'm talking about go right ahead and play the previous MH games and you'll see why.As for those who are complaining that the game is a horrible port bad optimization etc. That's on their end. This is a graphics heavy game and don't expect it to run smoothly if your rig is way below the minimum specs. I myself play this game on a laptop (passed minimum requirement) and it runs pretty well for most of the game except for the Teostra battle . I'd say that capcom needs to implement more graphics options for potatoes to run the game. Well. I think I've rambled on too much. This is truly a gem of a game and i'm glad it came out on PC (I wasn't planning on buying a console to play it firsthand #PCMR). Highly Recommended! 9.9/10 (would change this to 10 if they fixed the server issues)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,87,False,Recommended,So far I have about 70 hours in the game. It was very fun and amazing to play. There were connectivity issues at first when I tried playing with my friends but we ended up each soloing those monsters anyway Now that there is a patch for the connectivity issues everything has been great thus far. Hunting monsters is of course fun he grind for leveling up your HR is fun everything is fun. The only actual problems I have with the game is with the mouse sensitivity problems. It just mimmicks the movement of a joystick and that could be quite annoying. But to sorta fix that until an actual patch comes out for it I just tampered with some files and now it is atleast bearable. Nonetheless I'm excited for what this game gives in the future.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,At the moment I am posting this review I can't recommend the game because of 3 main issues Servers are crashing / disconnecting you constantly.It means playing with a friend for more than one quest is a pain and even then it can disconnect all of you mid quest you have to set up another room and try again often.They fixed the multiplayer issues with the 1.01 patch as far as I can tell. Graphical issues/ particules bug.The game runs more than fine for most of the content with constant 60fps I've heard some people started having issues in the forest when it rained having micro stuttering same for Elders Recess at all time but the worst is when you fight Kushala Daora and Teostra.My frames drop from 60 to around 10 when Teostra burst with his blast attacks. The Kushala fight is at 15 20 fps constantly when 3+ tornadoes are up. At this point it's useless to try to fight them you'll just die because you can't dodge stuff in time thanks to the stutter.I also saw stuttering when using lightning weapons especially the dual blades it makes them unplayable.This problem is not only mine some people with a high end pc can't handle the Teostra either so I can only assume it is a bug. Save corruption bugYour save can be corrupted if your game crashes during the last boss cutscene you should save your gamefile beforehand just to be safe.In the end it was only an issue with outdated video codec that made some people unable to watch the last cutscene this is not a save corruption bug update your codecs and you should be able to see the cutscene and play again if you had the issue.Edit One of the three issues is now fixed and the other can be resolved by updating your codecs even though they should have put those codecs in the game install it's not something you should be worry of. The framerate bug has not been adressed at all and it's still not fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game is all about multiplayer and this broad server connection issue is complex and inconsistent. It's bad!

Additionally there are loads of unskippable animations that just waste your time. For example after crafting you have to wait 5 seconds for the game to stop presenting your item before you can do anything. It does the same thing for harvesting monsters and you can only harvest one monster at a time and you're constantly facing multiple monsters. Furthermore it lacks tons of support like other people have mentioned and that's not really acceptable. I'd suggest that you wait until they fix these issues before you purchase this game or you skip it altogether because there are better games out there.

Also Turning off Shadows or Anti Aliasing and other Graphical options oddly doesn't effect FPS performance.Lastly Monster Hunter World has been experiencing online connection issues. Most common error being Error code 50382 mw1 and others like ""50152 MW"" and ""83 MW1"".With a great and successful game like Monster Hunter World and the potential it has to offer I sadly cannot recommend Monster Hunter World in its current state due to poor optimization and online issues.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I originally played this on the PS4 (150+ hours) and stopped several months ago in anticipation of the PC version.I was hoping it would have ultrawide support but unfortunately it does not. For it being the first PC port I went ahead and bought it anyways in support of the developer. It feels like I never left the PS4 but with improvements to the graphics.It does have some performance issues people have reported. I have not expereienced any of that only slight screen tearing and that might be a setting I need to adjust on my end. I'm running i7 6700k with a GTX1080FE.I'm using the steam controller only qualm I have is the right senor button or w/e you call it. Camera moves slow.

2018-08-14,0,0,99,False,Recommended,I have been watching this game for awhile waiting for pc release. I was a little hesitant but got it anyways and glad I did. At first I didnt know what was going on how things worked. As with most games these days there is no in game explanation of a lot of stuff. Kinsects and glaives...I didn't know how to use the Kinsect properly til last night. When in doubt google it.I sent out one SOS for help on a quest and some others joined but I was still early in the game and not perfected my controls yet dying too easily. Now I have at least one person that joins me and I him and we got get stuff done. I'm enjoying the game but trying not to rush through it too fast and just take my time grind some investigations for armor spheres for later upgrades. The vespoid investigation are there daily and are easy and quik armor spheres and cash. Usually 3 mins or so to complete in ancient forest NE base....easiest way to get what you need.The servers are overloaded right now with players at this moment there are over 300k in steam in the game. Even Ark never gets that much. So there are some connections issues people are complaining about BUT that IN NO WAY makes the game unplayable. Just means solo for a bit here and there.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,131,False,Recommended,This is one of the best game released for pc all year. The devs took their time in making the port and it runs great on my 4 year old laptop. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can buy it. Its story is weak but the gameplay is stronger then ever in this addition to the monster hunter games. This is by far the best monster hunter to date.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,172,False,Recommended,Product received for free. It a great game with the core elements of monster hunter games in it. However since the release there has been and increasing amount of connection problem such as when I try to find SOS matches online I get a error saying failed to join session. This has prevented me from playin with my friends. The graphics of the game is also lacking compared to the console versions. From what i see having my graphics on max with a 1980 1080p resolution monitor still have me seeing certain parts of the characters and environment blurred as if they were pixelated. This compared to the console version makes a clear difference in graphics texture and kinda annoys me as I like to see the game in its full beauty. This might not be a problem for everyone but it gets quite obvious when looking at some monsters as certain body parts such as the legs can be seen to be blurred. I hope this is a bug and that Capcom will fix this soon as this graphics bug is ruining the beauty of this game not entirely but still enough that people can notice. However other than this problems the game runs great and is definitely worth buying. I only have a measly 17hr in the game but from what I ve seen so far other than this two major problems the game is great and definitely worth buying.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,19,False,Recommended,So what can i say its a good game beautiful world cool creatures combat is a bit repetitive i think but not bad in terms of it being a mutliplayer story game its more like a singleplayer game with random errors that remind you that you cant play with your friends and the characters acting and dialouge are pretty cringy and your character makes grunts and nods as if theyre appropriate response to anything he is told but once you get past that and get into the world its pretty nice monsters all seem unique and the way they move is very smooth and looks good but the few times i was able to play with friends online it was definitelly more fun like 8/10 but offline with no friends to distract you from the cringe it feels more like a 6/10.I cant say I'd recommend it but I also cant say that I wont recommend it.but since im forced to pick ill recommend it just because i feel like theres a diamond somewhere under the coal.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-24,0,0,189,False,Recommended,As a big fan of the previous monster hunter series (last played on psp) Monster Hunter World is somewhat a more modernized version of the old games where less important things such as paintballs to track monsters made unnecessary with the use of scoutflies or whetstones becoming infinite. However more important aspects of the game such as combat and customization are still kept diverse and complex such as armor choices and the numerous skills available in the game.During the release of this game a major problem with it was some connection problems that may kinda be what caused this game to have bad reviews though recently the game has been (claimed to be) patched or updated in order to reduce this connection problems which it did.What I'm slightly disappointed about would be the lack of monsters and content at the moment which will hopefully increase in the future. Otherwise I would recommend this game.TLDR its like old monster hunter but better. Connection problem is now better than it was at release. There are only 29 monsters at the moment but updates should come and give more content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-24,0,0,106,False,Recommended,Bringing up the review score one review at a time.Don't let Monster Hunter's curent poor reception fool you this game is fantastic and worth every dollar its worth (This is coming from an australian who spends even more than the price shown due to currency conversions _(ツ)_/ ). The game had a rocky start mainly due its connection issues with the multiplayer however capcom quickly let us know that they were dealing with it and just as well a week later they have fixed 99% of the issues surrounding multiplayer and are continiuing to fix any other present issues surrounding the game as a whole.Now that the game actually functions properly as a both a single player and multiplayer experience I can't think of any major draw backs the game has that would prevent someone from enjoying this game (unless obviously this game isn't your cup of tea to begin with). The gameplay continues to be chalenging and fun even after 70+ hours of playing and even after said 70 hours of gameplay i still haven't even experienced everything that the game has to offer. and did i mention that the game looks AMAZING. honestly everything from the people the flora and fauna and everything else just looks SOO GOOD.honestly I could probably go on for a long time about the things i enjoy about this game but who really wants me to talk about every little thing when you can just experience for yourself so let me just say this It good it fun give it a go ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,97,False,Recommended,After the 8/23 (i think?) update I can say on my end I have not been disconnected once so far. The only problem i've had still which is minor is sometimes the SOS bugs and won't pick up much or any quests but this is often fixed by making a new lobby. So how's the game now that connections are supposedly fixed? Game's great in short. If you're familiar with Monster Hunter its the same as ever. Go kill it and get cool stuff to get make better stuff to kill better its. First time? Same here but heres some tips that may be useful Use a controller keyboard is meh atm Practice all weapons in training area (talk to housekeeper) and try to just focus on one until you get uncapped.Bone armor is good to start out with not suspectible to elements much and easily upgradable. Solo as many mobs as possible.PICK UP EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THROW EVERYTHING INTO ITEM BOXPICK UP EVERYTHING AGAINYou'll learn as you go so don't worry kid.

2018-08-29,0,0,212,False,Recommended,As an avid fan of the series and playing countless hours across the all the games MH W does scratch the itch that is Monster Hunter. I have said for years that Monster Hunter on the PC would be AMAZING. And while the controls are on point the loading screens are not bad the combat is great and the farming is fun. But on even on 4k there's stupidly low res textures sometimes the audio drops some plants look great but that one looks like someone zoomed in on a PSP graphic. The armor/face details are off putting the 'toons smiling looks terrible the wrinkles are way over done I think there is dirt over everyone? For a game to release early in the year on a console at full price then ANOTHER full price released to port to PC I'd expect better. Over all the game is MEH for full price. The traditional MH W community is lacking typically I can easily find groups/clans to run with I think this may be those net code issues.If you are a direhard fan of the series play it it's worth it. The controls the monster the weapons THERE IS NO LONGER BOW/BLADE armor! The armor skills are easy to understand. It's a great step forward.If you are NOT a direhard fan of the series for a AAA game release I feel you may be disappointed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-29,0,0,287,False,Recommended,It's grindy because that's what you're here for. It's good because it keeps drawing you back for one more hunt.Controls are precise no button mashing here very smooth and when you get to the item/ammo wheels almost too smooth to the point of a simple stick error could cost you dearly (though Type 2 radial controls helps with that).I play on a PS3 controller and I gotta say it's a great time. With friends even more fun and often silly.Don't mind the elitists this game is as casual as it gets until you become the elitist.It's new player prohibitive in that you have to learn a metric **** ton of little things that the game doesn't explicitly describe and the sheer overwhelming info drop it plants on your face right off the starting gun. The tutorials are slightly informative at best though it is said this is the most approachable of all MH games. I am a new MH player and it took me a good bit to get my bearings.However if you're patient and put some effort into learning its nuances it's a really really satisfying game for that itch when you just want to go kill (or better capture) a monster after work with or without friends.Pros...Each monster area and bit of gear is very nuanced and complex. It might not be immediately apparent but when you put all the numbers into a stressful combat situation where precision is rewarded that's where it shines. Secrets to find and combos to learn timing to perfect and builds to master. The rabbit hole goes quite deep leading to some nice theorycrafting and testing while honing your skills before some heart pounding fights.It also looks good sounds great moderately fast paced combat and once you get the hang of it gameplay is dreamy good.Oh and its name Monster Hunter speaks volumes to its gameplay. It's not just waltz in and crush some dragon skulls. You track them and hunt them down to break their spirit like the vicious bastid you are.Cons... It takes a while to get used to the hit boxes of monster attacks but you learn them and learn to exploit them.The whole layout and functionality of the game is unfamiliar and will need time to get accustomed.Anti piracy can be a bummer for weaker PCs as it chews up resources.Story is kinda meh.. whatever.Most people start with a longsword for a reason. Very straightforward and powerful weapon which is not too complicated.Once you get your bearings though each weapon is a world unto itself and that's a whole lot of fun. It's even deeper when you get into groups and specialize roles in a fight often with multiple giant monsters on the field.I started with the Insect Glaive because I like hyper mobility and had I done it again I would have gone with a longsword for at least the first dozen hours. That said putting in the time to learn such a complex weapon as the insect glaive is so rewarding. You can pull off really fun and flasy stunts while still being very effective in battle... that is until you have to sharpen it every... well.. you'll see. It's biggest downfall is it doesn't keep sharpness well at all. In fact it's the worst melee weapon in that respect. But holy smokes when you git gud at it you can easily outdamage a longsword until you have to sharpen again so it all evens out really. Quite well balanced.8/10 ... because flinging poop at pesky dinosaurs and dragons interfering in your serious murder business is ever so satisfying. Srsly. If you're trying to capture a monster they'll steal your prey and kill it on you. Always pack some poop shot.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Disappointing. Unfortunately if you don't have a super beefy computer this game can barely run itself. On top of that even if you turn the settings on the lowest it still barely manages to run for most computers that aren't purely beefy gaming computers. Next to that this game tends to crash... A lot. The online doesn't seem finished. Hell it doesn't seem like the damn port is even finished. At this point in time it would be more worth your while to get it on PS4 because it runs better looks cleaner and doesn't manage to crash every 10 minutes. Thanks Capcom.Future Edit It's been about a month after purchasing MHW on the PC. I have the PS4 version and I do think this game is fantastic. However one problem that stops me from playing this version is the constant graphic errors that always show up a few minutes into starting the game. I literally can't complain about the multiplayer being busted because I can't get past the first encounter with Great Jagras and Anjanath. I don't even have a weapon yet. So I really hope CAPCOM decides to fix this bug.Recommended for players with gaming computers. Not recommended for everyone else.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-09,0,0,145,False,Recommended,"MONSTER HUNTER WORLD The 119th Hour ReviewWHAT IS IT? It's like Pokémon that you hunt for monsters but without the ethical problem of catching them in order to make them fight each other because you kill them and farm their carcass to make into weapons and armor so that you can kill their brothers and sisters better while horrifying them because you're wearing their sibling's face as your mask. Also the monsters are less polite than Pokémons because they won't wait for you to choose an attack. Well it's a matter of courtesy anyway because you willfully disturb them on their habitat. You could also choose the humane way catch them and let japanese version elves dwarves other humans and cat creatures kill them in a farm. This way you get more loot!IS IT FUN? Its fans will tell you it's fun. F*ck them. This is a tedious game. This is not a game. It's a job without real world benefits. This game gets ""fun"" after playing it hours upon hours mastering its sh*t controls sh*t camera and hard to learn hard to master mechanics just because it has awesome reward loop high risk high reward gameplay incredible graphics cute helpful cat creatures and funny as hell animations. Okay when I say it like that it does sound fun. This game is Marmite. Some hate it others love it.DO I HEAR REGRET FROM HOW YOU'RE TYPING THIS? Yes. I hate this awful game to bits. Steam has a policy where you can refund a game if you played it for less than 2 hours and I accidentally ran this game for 4 hours so might as well play it. I played it for a record 119 hours now so I got my stupid money's worth.BUT THIS GAME HAS SO MANY FANS. F*ck 'em all. Go to any of its online forum and say you're playing MH World and they'll chastise you for being a noob because World is a Japanese game designed for western audiences so this game has much more quality of life improvements such as being able to run while drinking a heal potion and other stuff that made this game much more accessible than other MH games. Even if you're a veteran MH player and mention you played World they'd say World made you soft. Really f*ck the MH players I chatted who I don't know in real life. Bastards. I got real life friends who play it. They're the ones who are cool. Stick to your real life friends. The internet is awful.HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? around 1 500 in Philippine Peso. I've heard PUBG players who got interested in it say it costs too much. PUBG is Php760. The cost is actually cheap relatively. Original Japanese games especially really hardcore ones that has English dubs like Monster Hunter normally cost upwards of Php3 000. The last Japanese game I bought before this was Ni No Kuni and it cost Php3 950. It varies. Also this is one of those very rare ""AAA"" games that does not have pay to win microtransactions. Thank the gods.OKAY BUT... I HEARD YOU MENTION CAT CREATURES. They're awfully cute. Helpful too! They give you buffs for more damage and stuff. I hate cutscenes and I skip them if I can but the cutscenes with palicos(those cat creatures) I don't skip. They're that cute. Just don't mind the fact that those cute animations were made possible because adult Japanese men in tight mocap suits acted them out to make them.SO... HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE THIS GAME? REALLY? Like is a strong word. It's like being forcefully but getting mind blowing s anyway and you keep coming back because your friends are into it. Fine. I'm not going to argue.SO HOW DO YOU RATE IT. About 9.4 out of 10. But it's the worst 9.4 out of 10 ever.THAT's AN OXYMORON. So are funny jokes but even victims still laugh to them. You can use intelligent artsy fartsy words like ""oxymoron"" but you can still be wrong.SO WHY TYPE POLITICAL LIKE THIS MARL? My depression medications make me fully awake for days and I get to have times when I have nothing else to do.STAY OUT OF POLITICS. YOU'RE AN A*SHOLE. I share your sentiment.SHARE? THIS IS A CONVERSATION INSIDE YOUR HEAD. I'm clinically bipolar but this is not one of those symptoms. I need a new therapist. Go back to where you came from disembodied conversationalist.LÄ! LÄ!

If I truely disliked this game why have I played 100+ hours.I think I am reaching the point where I am mostly done with the game unless new content comes fairly frequently.This game after the story is all grind. Heck even to finish the story there is serious grinding required. The network is still a bit sketchy but there have been improvements. Overall though the game has become more fun as it has been fixed. The weapons allow for several different styles of play. Apparently Pipes and Hammer are not my jam since I get my kicked every time but messing around i've got a couple I like and a couple I can use if the situation calls for it. Network is rubbish playing with your friends is a pipe dream.So after the initial lauch problems were handled I was able to play. I'm still a bit non plussed by the whole launch experience.The research into new weapons to create is either not unlocked because im too much of a noob or it's not finished. I'm not sure which but it looks broken. On further play this is not broken it's just locked until you discover the right monster bits.When you can play with your friends the game can be pretty fun. What's currently keeping this as a not recommended product is the amount of network trouble. Sometimes no worries everything seems fine. Other times can't connect to matchmaking. Every time you join a server couple minutes later you drop off. This can make doing quests difficult and annoying especially if you're trying to get four people in the same lobby.It's getting better once the network is stable it should be a fun experience.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

No disconnects etc. so far either.It runs with my 2GB ancient graphics card although it really shines with some better hardware.Don't complain if it doesn't work on a potato PC with less processing power than a modern smartphone and don't about online issues if you're using the Starbucks Wi Fi from 50m down the street.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I also use the sword and shield aka the best weapon this game has to offer. Seriously why is it even rated that low? Silly if you ask me. In all honesty this game is amazing. After a few issues with servers that usually tend to be issues with new multiplayer games like this anyways I was able to enjoy the game far too much. Definitely a 10/10 game to play with friends and if not it's still a great game to play by yourself if you want to make some dumb Palico builds. Palicos are OP don't underestimate these cats. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to finally play a MH game outside of a handheld again and now on the beautiful PC masterace. Before I know it I'll be playing this for over 1000 hours I'll see you then when I start complaining about still not getting any attack decorations.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,140,False,Recommended,The first hour of this game is just awful (excluding the character creator). Horrible lips syncing half of the dialogue is not even voiced and unnecessary cutscenes that drag out that disaster. My first impression of this game was that of a cheap unpolished Asian mmorpg. And receiving daily login rewards only solidified that opinion. But thankfully that is not what this game is about. Stick around get to the actual gameplay experience a few hunts and you will feel the beauty of this game. I was very disappointed at first but now I think I'll spend many hours enjoying it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,Computer specs i5 4570 + r9 290 Crashes and Crashes Had constant crashes before even the Capcom splash screen and only now just got the game to work. For those of you who are also having trouble getting the game to boot at all try the following Update your graphics drivers and go to your MH executable in the steamapps/common folder open up the properties and set the exe to always run as administrator. Once you do that launch steam as administrator and launch the game. This is the only way I have gotten the game to launch and I have to launch steam as administrator every time but at least it launches.Negatives your mouse works as an emulated right analog stick with all of the components that make analog sticks usable on console. However these same things on a mouse absolutely ruin the experience by making the mouse feel unresponsive slow and unintuative. For a game that the developers held back for over 6 months to perfect the optimization doesn't necessarily seem to fit the bill. Cannot remove Depth of Field or Motion Blur so playing the game with friends is a constant state of dizziness and headaches for me. No FOV sliders so the headaches from the aforementioned motion blur and DOF are exarcerbated. Overall I would have happily refunded this game after the first headache if I hadn't bought the game on GMG. It's a great game but this PC port is not worth your time YET.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"I've only dipped my toe into this game but I really enjoy it so far. There is a great number of weapons that all behave very differently. There's something for everyone. So if you don't like the first weapon you try give the next one a shot.There are many types of monsters to fight. Both large ones and smaller ones. And they all live naturally in the open world. Sometimes two can even meet up either to fight each other or team up against you. A hunt for the same monster can play out many different ways which keeps things interesting.However this port has some issues...First off it needs to be better optimized as the framerate can struggle to stay at 60 at times. I've also experienced quite a bit of issues using my XBO controller. Sometimes I couldn't use it at all and at times it would ""disconnect"" making me have to unplug it and plug it back in. However I solved this by running the .exe as Administrator as well as checking the XBox Controller box in the Steam Settings.I hope these issues will be ironed out and I believe they can be. Because even with these issues it's still an amazing game and fixing these will only make it even better.Do recommend.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,267,False,Recommended,A brilliant and successful effort to bring the console series to PC.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,76,False,Recommended,I have completed the console version and spent 100 hours on it. Here is my PC version hunter's opinion.My RigGPU GeForce GTX 1070 Gigabyte Gaming G1 Overclocked Core 139mhz Memory 400mhzCPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 4690K CPU Overclock 4.30GHzMemory 16 GB RAM (15.94 GB RAM usable)Game installed on HDDController Dualshock 4OPTIMISATION Mixed reaction as expected for a console port. That said amazing effort from the devs. The game runs in 1080p flawlessly. There is frame drops in some areas so you may be looking at 40 60fps with all high settings. But 60fps is more than enough to make up for this port. If you have experienced the console version you will definitely welcome the improvements here. Loading times are 3 5 secs!!! And that s only on a HDD.GRAPHICS Same as console port. But with the option to run in 60fps you will feel the difference. The weather effects are much better and the textures look clearer.ONLINE Same mechanics with joining instances. Similar to how you join quest in Warframe or Diablo 3. Monster Hunter is a growing community and you will have the opportunity to have countless co op games. As always main quest requires all players to have unlocked that part of the story in order to join one another. Which brings me to...GAMEPLAY Challenging The controls are not for everyone but give it practise and you won't stop completing quest after quest. Main story takes a while to complete and is not short. A majority of time will be replaying instances to grind for materials to forge new gear and weapons. But what makes this game unique is how unpredictable the quest goes. The environment plays a huge role in either denying you an easy hunt or giving you an advantage on mounting that monster with huge health. It is recommended to play solo most of the time and then try co op when you feel you are ready for a challenge. Controller is a must for this game. I do not recommend Keyboard and Mouse.SOUND and MUSIC Simply epic it is nice to hear orchestral music throughout with hardly any synths or electronic instruments. Voice acting is average but makes up for it for...STORY There's actually not much really going on. But what you will find unique about the story is it is about the eco system. You really do feel you are a Zoologist or explorer in a brand new world. This is a nice change of storytelling than the simple saving the world scenario. The story is about discovery and learning about the various monsters you encounter.TUTORIALS There are a lot of tutorials that help teach you the mechanics of the game. You will find many tutorials popping up on your screen. At least you won't need to google search what to do when the game already has a lot of tutorials.GENRE This is semi open world warn you. The areas you explore are huge but not in a grand scale like other open world games this gen. What makes up for it is the level design. Everything lives and breathes all around you like you are in another world.REPLAY END GAME Infinite. It's not easy to let this game go once you get so invested in it. High Rank hunts where the real action is at. DIFFICULTY Main story is challenging. High rank hunts are very HARD but worth it once you know what you are up against.I highly recommend this game to newcomers who want a challenge. For gamers who already played challenging games like Dark Souls will instantly love this game. Try it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,3,False,Recommended,And just like that Monster Hunter World is now portable. For anyone who needed to know YES. This game DOES indeed run playable on the GPD Win 2. *of course with everything set to LOW and some tweaking.*Just dont go in expecting it to look like the PS4 version and definitely dont compare the experience to your desktop. But if your coming from a 3DS MH experience though playing it on the Gpd Win 2 will be one of the best things you ever do. It's unbelievable. On the little screen it looks great. Im still in the process of tweaking for performance and maintaining a clear resolution balance. What I did Resolution set to either 800x600(this looks awful) or 944x540(much better) Models set to Low or Mid Turn off that Skin Model setting (it's not named this but you will know what im referring to when you see it.) locked my frames to 30. Turn off Water Reflections Shadows set to LOW Turn off that Volumetric setting Foliage set to OFF Im sure once more people get their hands on the game they will master the tweaks for this system.

Every weapon and armour have their unique strength and weakness.CONS Currenly players are expreriencing server disconnection which occurs rapidly. Capcom says that they are fixing this problem.

2018-08-14,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Writing my first review to show some luv for this game! I'm running 1440p at approx. 80+fps at max settings with everything turned on atm and the game is butter smooth and incredibly pretty. 8700k cpu 1080ti and 32gb ram all at stock speeds without oc. Don't intend to overclock atm since I'm fine with the way it is currently running. You can probably push this past 100fps if you intend to go hardcore and if it even makes a difference for you. First issue I have atm is the lack of support for ultra wide displays. It has been a while since I've played a AAA title with the ugly black bars at the sides of the screen. My fear is the developers might not even see this as an issue and might have no intentions to 'fix' this. The game doesn't crash for me but what has been heavily emphasised by the other reviews hold true that online connectivity cannot get any worse currently. But I'm sure that are players out there that enjoy playing w/o coop like myself at the initial phases of a game and should continue to pick this game up esp if you do not alrdy own the console version. In terms of gameplay new players will not have a hard time getting used to the basics and catching onto the game mechanics. The controls are easy to master coming from a player with little MH experience. Sure that are mechanics that are not immediately introduced to you during the course of completing the story mode but that's where exploration is rewarded as you revisit each map and Astera when you test and master each weapon and etc.Some might find the price tag of the game too hefty. It is perfectly fine to wait. You know how steam works this will get cheaper with time. But if you have the cash to spare and wouldn't want to miss every event that is introduced then I say wait no more. This game is oddly addictive and a good change from other AAA titles atm and will for sure be one of the games you'd want to boot up after too much battlefield or fortnite/pubg.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The one poor thing I can say is that connecting with friends is not great at the moment but it wasn't for a bit on Xbox either but it got fixed. The game is definitely an enjoyable experience solo (monsters do not regenerate health no matter what idiots say this in these reviews) but is a much better with friends. Immerse variety in the way you can tackle missions 14 weapon classes (with 5 elements and 4 ailments) and a great roster of new monsters (except Great Girros screw him) is what you can expect from this game.

Only flaw in my opinion is the slightly awkward multiplayer regarding story missions but its not that big of a deal people make it be. 9/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,139,False,Recommended,Amazing. Takes everything that makes the Monster Hunter games fun and amps it up while fixing a lot of flaws. Although no new weapons have been added in this installment (outside of the Slinger a weak sidearm available to all classes) existing weapons have recieved a bunch of new abilities that make them even more complex and fun to use. Monster designs are as cool as ever with popular monsters from previous games making cameos alongside a host of brand new unique and creative looking creatures to murder. Additionally the new Scoutfly mechanic helps reduce the amount of time you spend dicking around the map looking for the monster and allows you to get into combat much more quickly in a way that feels very natural. If you're a fan of the series you'll love this game. The biggest criticism I have is that the controls suffered in the port to PC. Ranged weapons in particular suck to use with a keyboard and the item select wheel is straight up broken. I'm fortunate enough to own a mouse with programmable side buttons which pretty much fixes this problem but unless you've got something similar you'll either have to try and mangle the control scheme into something usable or just use a controller. Thing is the elements of this game that fans love are the same things that will drive others away. The combat is still extremely slow and weighty which means that depending on your personal tastes it will feel either incredibly satisfying or clunky and terrible. Monsters still take 20 40 mins to kill which makes this game a bad choice for those with limited free time for gaming. You still need to grind in order to upgrade weapons and craft useful items which is a whole different discussion. I love this game because of these elements but if you've tried previous installments and hated them this probably won't be the game to change your mind. Ultimately this game is loads of fun and the best in the series so far. If you love Monster Hunter this game is a must have. Only thing left to add is mod support. You guys are adding mod support right Capcom? Right? Cmon pretty please?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,104,False,Recommended,"I am changing my review to positive given the recent bugfixes.The good Graphically high quality. I run the game on the default Mid settings for my GTX 970 (although I could push it to High) and it looks great. Don't use TXAA settings and you won't have the nauseating motion blur most people complain about. NPC animations. The NPC animations are really well done. I've found myself sitting back and enjoying some of the NPC activities and totally not trying to get a camera angle up the guildies' skirts as they move about the base doing their things. The monsters also have this in their activities and have more personality and quirks than previous MH games. I stalked a few monsters just to watch their behavior scratching an itch eating something rolling around etc. More quality of life. No longer do you need to waste inventory slots on whetstones and gathering equipment. You automatically craft core useful equipment upon gathering all the items allowing for fast resupplies just by running around the area. You can now use potions on the move and cancel out of using an item useful when you have a monster charging straight at you while sharpening your weapon.The bad Game breaking bugs. Read any of the other reviews the connection issues are abhorrent. I tried many times to hunt with a friend today only to get the infamous connection drop. We both run wired on 100+Mbps connections so this shouldn't have happened. No other games have these connection issues during our troubleshooting after hours of attempts at playing. Fixed haven't dropped out of a session recently. Unintuitive joining. I can't easily join a friend's game. Steam invites don't work like they are advertised to. I have to copy and paste the key from the online session (like a Paradox game if you've ever played Stellaris or HoI IV you'll recognize it). I cannot do a ""friends only"" room. Can't progress cooperatively with friends on key quests due to cutscene synching issues. Really guys? Previous MH games had no problems with this. Multi monitor issues. Working around this requires .ini file tweaks and multiple game restarts to get it working. Once it's finally working it only lasts for the game session. Restarting the game puts it on the wrong monitor again and the ini file gets changed. Changing resolutions requires the game to restart annoying when the monitors its jumping between are a 4k and 1080p. You can work around this by going to Steam steamapps common Monster Hunter World right clicking each .ini file and checking the ""read only"" box once you have your settings the way you like them to prevent this issue from occuring. Lacking some graphical options like motion blur and DOF settings. High resolution textures occasionally don't load. Female hunter is thicc. Does not have the nice hindquarters that some of the NPCs do. Also no cute girls like MH Tri and MH4U. That being said the female NPCs are easy on the eyes if you get my drift.

If this issue is resolved this would be my game of the year hands down but because of this online issue I have to knock the score down until they fix it so I give it like a 6.5/10 if fixed then it easily be a 9/10.

2018-08-11,0,0,142,False,Recommended,This really pains me you guys don't know how much but I have to do it.Game works like a charm GoT level for me running on a 1080ti tho gameplay replayability graphics it's great in all aspects (mind the freaks playing the game with KB+M) but only if you play solo.If you want to play with friends well... It's a hit or miss you may play 5 hrs straight with no prob or get constant disconects from online sessions / coop hunts every 5 minutes for an hour.That's the only reason I can't recommend it right now and will change the review once those issues gets addressed.Connection problems got fixed a simple driver downgrade helped improvement on my friends machines (nvidia) and special k mod is a nice adition.What are you waiting for?

2018-08-19,0,0,108,False,Recommended,MonHun by itself has been and still is a great game but multiplayer being the core of the franchise weighs heavily in the $60 dollars paid imo. If an early release on PC means the delay of multiplayer then that's fine as long as it was clarified. Some people would happily clear the solo campaign and find things to do in this elaborate open world game in the meanwhile but promising false hope is a terrible thing to do especially when it could negatively impact the player experience. If you treat it as a single player game it's great. If you want to experience it as a monster hunter game it's not in its best condition at the moment. Also i pray G rank would be added as a dlc... even a paid one would be fine but please don't make it full priced again lakjhff,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,163,False,Recommended,I'm new to the Monster Hunter World series and I'll admit the game has a bit of a learning curve. I feel like so much of this is finding a weapon/fighting style that works. After trying MANY of the hard hitting slower weapons and struggling I found the high evasion/mobility weapons seemed to work much better with my playstyle.The kill collect craft repeat loop to this game sounds simplistic but there is a surprising amount of depth to this mechanic. Identifying weaknesses of the monsters (elemental weaknesses) but also weakspots ultimately define what pieces of gear you will need to take them down. I largely have played the game solo and I will admit the multiplayer/networking experience still needs some work. When I have played with friends though it has been a blast and it has seemed much more stable the last few sessions of play.If you like action games with some RPG mechanics you will find a lot to love in this one!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,454,False,Recommended,"My review targets SOLO players familiar with the series. I won't be commenting on multiplayer issues (the main cause of ""not recommended"" reviews). This is the first game in the franchise that I decided to find out stuff on my own rather than seeing videos. I came in just knowing what monsters I'd be fighting but not their moves new features no clue about the story etc. Finally I'm a veteran of the series since the very first game on PS2. I have over 5000 hours across all the MH games I've played. At the time I'm making this review I just reached the Coral Highlands (3rd map).NEW STUFF PROS A TON more stuff to do not just hunt specially if you're a completionist. Gathering and fishing have been improved drastically. Extremely fluid. Forget restarting the quest because you forgot traps/tranqs on a capture quest! Also the story blends very well with hunts and tasks. You're exploring with the Handler one moment a new monster appears and you get the quest to hunt it right there and now. Really cool! (You can choose to retreat and re take the quest). Tuft wars are awesome! They don't happen as often as I thought they would tho. Daily log in stuff and even more frequent new events. Environment interaction.OTHER PROS Absolutely the best looking game in the whole series. More so than MH O. New features for a lot of weapons. Combat is even more rewarding. If you're like me and you like it this is a pro the game still does jack on explaining most combat mechanics and other stuff you'll eventually find out on your own. CONS I hate that I can't chose to have my stamina and health bar permanently visible. Or at least I haven't been able to find that on the settings. If you prefer to be taught everything by the game this is a con the game still does jack on explaining most combat mechanics and other stuff you'll eventually find out on your own. Particularly the first map the Ancient Forest is an absolute pain in the to navigate. Controls aren't good nor well optimized. As they STILL expect you to play with a controler many keys share actions. For example your secondary attack button is also your interact button during hunts. You have NO way to separate these actions. You want to gather? Hit that right click. Maybe I haven't found out how to properly use it but the item wheel works like You have to use WASD to select which item to use and I haven't found a way to change this. At least navigating your item bar is really easy with the mouse wheel. Game feels rather easy for a veteran player.PERFORMANCE My specs i5 3330 (below minimum) GTX 760 (minimum) 16 GB RAM (double recommended)Game at low settings with medium textures.Surprisingly game works fine very well actually. Average 30 FPS no FPS drops (except when I added in FFXA Antialising which caused a 1 2 seconds freeze every 20 mins or so) and game performs smoothly. My cores are at a constant 90%+ usage tho. Even in low settings the game looks AMAZING.FINAL VEREDICT I recommend the game being aware of those ""cons"" I mentioned as some particularly the keybindings are infuriating sometimes. This new game adds a bunch of QoL changes takes combat to the next level and looks incredible.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I couldn't use one in all my hours of play.. and the futur content behemoth REQUIRE you to use one otherwise you will fail 100% need to interact with objet with right click button. SO IF YOU USE RIGHT CLICK BUTTON TO ATTACK AND THERE IS A ITEM NEARBY AND YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL YOUR ACTION WILL BE CANCELED A POP UP YOU CAN'T EASELY DISMISSED IS DISPLAYED AND WHILE IT UP YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING. can't chat manually with player at all. no chat box.

Each has their own unique style and combos to execute.Hunt boss like monsters and use their loot to craft more weapons and make them into your armor.Craft your armor and form your own build and playstyle using the armor skills/perks. Endgame involved grinding tempered version of monsters which hits harder for decorations or what you might call skill gems. Slot those decoration into your equipment to min/max your skill build according to what you want.Is it grindy or repetitive?Well it depends on the RNG. If you're lucky you might get what you want from the reward pool within a few monsters. Personally I enjoyed the combat every fight felt dynamic and doesn't make it repetitive for me.Overall it's a great game to play solo and with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The settings are creative and lively the monsters are intimidating and a true challenge and most of all this is the first time I've played a Monster Hunter game that feels like a true *world*. The monsters and even smaller creatures have their own habits and behaviors. They fight against one another feed on prey and sleep when tired. ""Quality of Life"" improvements is a true understatement to how far this franchise goes in making the absolute best first impression as possible and on that front it exceeds on nearly every aspect. The connectivity and and technical issues are pretty disappointing though. I don't have any friends so the online issues haven't effected me *as* much but...I'm hoping I can reliably play with others someday to experience the Coop aspect of this game.

2018-08-11,0,0,90,False,Recommended,It's a Monster Hunter game with a lot of QoL updates some that are good others are questionable. It plays just like you would expect a Monster Hunter game to play if you like Monster Hunter games you will enjoy this one. At launch it had some isuses but these days what games don't. The update in graphics is a welcome addition but as with any update in graphics there are downfalls much higher graphic fidelity results in longer time needed to create assets like weapons monsters maps and other features of the game. Capcom has decided to help speed up their time to create new weapons monster they would reuse assets that already exist with some minor to weapons and major changes to monsters all weapons of the same time share the same structure while all monsters of the same time share the same skelton. With that being said Monster Hunter World is a great game and I hope Capcom takes the time to put new monsters and weapons in the game along with a G Rank upgrade. This is coming from someone who started monster hunter on the Ps2. It's a great game that requires some patience. If you are looking for a hack n' slash game this is not it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Changed the settings to off/low and the res to 720p and it made no difference. Lowered FPS to 30 and was able to keep a constant 30 with both settings I had tried previously. Rolled back drivers and now I'm able to play it at an almost constant 60 fps on off/low settings at 720p. 1080p at any setting still completely tanks my FPS. Considering the minimum spec info and the fact that I can play The Witcher 3 on med/high settings at an almost constant 60 fps and MGS5 at max settings at a constant 60 fps (both games at 1080p) I don't see why this game runs how it does.

2018-08-11,0,0,48,False,Recommended,I am thoroughly hooked on this game. Been waiting for it for months and I have to say I am impressed. The optimisation is solid running a 1070 Ti with a 2700X Ryzen and the only tiem I have frame dips is when I am watching a stream on my other monitor. Never encountered any of the issues anyone has had I have had a few disconnects maybe around 3 but that's given since it has just released on PC. No doubt we will see some patches in the future. Multiplayer is great fairly easy to find games to play matchmaking system is top notch and I really like how easy it is to navigate the multiplayer menus also to be able to select what monster you want to kill and it finds you lobbies is perfect. Story co op with a friend is a bit niggly some missions will be 2 player 1 player of have room for 4 players. The cutscene thing isn't much of an issue as people say as when you friend sends out an SOS signal you can join him which at the same time completes your quest when he completes his. That being said it is a bit niggly like I previously stated but it's easy to get used to. Not really worth the negative reviews/blowback this game is getting.

2018-08-11,0,0,28,False,Recommended,MONSTER HUNTER WORLD on PC brings an already incredible game on consoles to 60FPS high resolution glory filling the hole we've had for Monster Hunter games on PC since the series started. Thankfully Capcom did a great job porting the game over.I've played many hours on my original model PS4 and I can say that the game definitely has the potential to look better here on PC than anywhere else and it is fairly well optimized contrary to what everyone believed a few weeks leading up to release (shocker right? *eyeroll*). There are plenty of graphics options including some that I've never even seen in a game before now which is pretty cool. Opting for a dynamic resolution to maintain a stable 60 is pretty neat for PC and I wish more games did it.Keyboard and mouse controls leave something to be desired but with a little remapping you can definitely play solely with them. It's also much easier to communicate with other people on PC since everyone has a keyboard right in front of them to type on. That's something I've been looking forward to for awhile so now I can finally tell those plebs not to wake the monster up and let me sleep bomb it without typing for a minute+.The Steam groups replacing squads is a welcome change in theory but not being able to join a group's session like you could on console seems like a little bit of a step back and I hope that it's fixed in the future. I planned to build a community for a large Discord server I'm in but that makes it much more difficult for people to play together.Going off of the PC/console changes and differences World took an already fantastic series and completely changed it into something we never knew we wanted for years. The open world environments work perfectly and they are so much larger varied and in depth than what we've ever had before. All of the weapons got revamps that made them more fun to play monsters fight each other now the quality of life throws EVER needing to go back to town out the window unless you want to forge new gear... It's almost perfect and I can tell it'll be one of my top games of the year. It is truly phenomenal and it almost brings a tear to my eye.Should you get MONSTER HUNTER WORLD on PC? Absolutely. None of the issues that people are talking about are something that can't be fixed or added in a patch and the whole Denuvo debacle isn't nearly as much of a problem as everyone makes it out to be. If you want to lose yourself for hours killing monsters over and over again with your friends with not a care in the world you'll find no better game to do that in. This is easily without contest the best game in the entire series.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter has always been a game with a high level of entry so there's quite a bit to learn early on for new players. It will click with a short amount of playing around and once it does it's one of the greatest series ever. With all the quality of life improvements this is probably the best entry point for new players. For veterans it's a no brainer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Has been a solid PC port for me with the game running very well even when I'm using a rig that is worse than even the listed minimum specs. Is on lowest settings of course though the game still looks decent enough surprisingly. Controller worked immediately without any fiddling around. Only issue that I've come across and a friend has also ran into this is sometimes there are some connectivity issues. Nothing major for the most part just some weird thing where the game acts like it can't connect to the internet and thus we can't start an online session until the game is restarted. Could be entirely on our end but I'm not sure.As far as the game itself goes the mechanics are a pretty objective improvement over the previous Monster Hunter games in my opinion. I never had issues with the older games but this game feels so fresh in comparison that it might be difficult to go back to the old titles. A bunch of little quality of life enhancements really add up overall to make some things less tedious. Gathering for example is now quick and easy instead of the absolute chore it used to be. Planning what equipment you're going to craft is much easier in game through features such as the wish list and the ability to view entire weapon trees without consulting a wiki. The graphics are also an obvious upgrade despite playing on the lowest settings though I can't really see how good looking this game can get until I upgrade my computer. This has to be my favourite Monster Hunter. The only thing really holding it back is the lack of monsters (which means weapons and armour too) in comparison to games like Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations. This was to be expected though as it is a complete rework of the series and hopefully a G Rank DLC is in the works or at the very least the next game will be able to build content wise upon a strong foundation.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-24,0,0,134,False,Recommended,a fantastic game truly the best of the series (imo) especially if youve never played before. i have about 800 hrs in mh3u and almost 300 in mh4u and this game while it has less content off the bat (free dlc quests are released on a schedule atm) the quality of life changes are more than worth it. biggest/only complaints are the dripfeed of content (new monsters have yet to even be announced though it is said it will be on a quicker schedule than the console releases) and the connection issues are really nothing to be ignored. i genuinely encourage you to buy this game but absolutely do wait until the online connectivity issues are resolved.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,176,False,Recommended,"This is one of those games where I really wish there was a number rating system. I'd give it a 7/10. It's an average game that's decent fun but has a lot of problems.First off the combat.It's great fun hunting monsters but there are so many mechanics that just don't need to be in the game that are there solely to screw over the player. Get hit more than once in quick succession and you get stunned for about three seconds which is more than enough time for the monster to finish you off.That's not that big a deal but the monsters are also able to ""hit"" you just by walking into you. If they walk over you repeatedly they can stun lock you to death from full hp. It's just a matter of RNG. Most monsters have attacks that are so fast and wide ranging that doding out of them is nearly impossible since the attack covers way more ground than your dodge does.That wouldn't be a problem but you can't sprint with a good deal of the weapons drawn and most heavy weapons take forever to sheath and unsheath.What you end up with is a situation where you are likely to get hit (Not to mention hit boxes really need work I've been hit by tails that were no longer attached to the monster) and you end stunned and watch helplessly as the monster gets another free shot at you. You can't use items with a weapon in hand so if you want to heal you have to put away your weapon to do it. It should be noted that in the time it takes to do that a monster can full on leap fifty feet across the battlefield and screw you over while you're locked in the animation.To make matters worse there are a bunch of mechanics that take away control of your guy. Reloading sheathing monster roars monster stomps they all take away control and you find yourself helpless.It's kind of stupid that a giant monster can attack faster than you can and I get that the weapons are big but if a freaking t rex can leap 50 feet I should be able to roll out of a reload.Basically if you want to have an easy time winning fights use a fast weapon. I switched to bows and sword and sheild and it became so easy to kill things when I actually had the ability to fight and stay mobile. Greatswords Heavy bowguns and the like are just too slow. Especially when you start fighting the tempered monsters.The end game is also horribly lame. Most monsters gain a cheap one shot kill attack that you can't really survive and with buggy hit boxes you'll get hit sooner or later. You even have to farm tracks just to fight the monsters in the first place. Who the hell wants to farm foot prints? I'm here to kill big monsters not pretend to be an acrheologist. If you do sit through the crap prepare to get rewarded with worthless gems you didn't even want because the end game is literally just gem farming with really low drop rates for anything you actually want and it's totally random. I've gotten three gems and none of them were for a weapon I even use. Twenty hours of game play and I've made almost no real progress and that's just stupid.The monster fights are fun but for god's sake the animation locks countless stunning effects goofy hit boxes and lack of mobility with most of the weapons really drags down the gameplay.In dark souls I always felt like I desereved to get hit. Here I find myself constantly saying ""I could easily have dodged that if I'd not been locked in a reload and the monster was able to dive 100 feet across the room."" or ""How the hell did that charge hit me when I was behind the monsters?"" and it just feels cheap.Like I said the game isn't bad it just needs work and it isn't going to get it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,358,False,Recommended,"tl dr This game leaves me with seriously conflicted feelings.On one hand you have beautiful set pieces engaging vibrant environments tons of content and mechanics to master awesome artwork and character/monster/weapon designs online multiplayer an awesome arching single player experience fantastic sound design Pallicos weighty complex and demanding combatAnd on paper this all seems like what a AAA title needs to be. It hits all the right marks in very satisfying (albeit sometimes frustrating) ways.But often times it's the moments between the action that really kill this game and make it unplayable. Ignoring the fact that the option to disable mouse acceleration/joystick emulation isn't available (since I don't really mind playing with controller) there are a whole host of bugs and design flaws that break immersion and sometimes break the game.1. Online multiplayer network issues where fixed.2. Online multiplayer is great (part 2)...when it doesn't pull you out of the story. I'm not really clear on why Capcom decided to run with this mechanic but party members aren't allowed to join each other on main story quests until the monster of the hour shows its face in an elaborate cut scene. On the surface I get it this stops people from being boosted to higher tier monsters right from the start. However the complete downside to this is that people who want to quest together have to all slog through the quest hit the designated cut scene and then back out of the mission either all together to start it again or have one person stay and chance that the other members can leave their quest and hop into the one that's continued beyond the cut scene (remember network issues). This mechanic kills gameplay immersion like a brick to the face and doesn't even stop people from being boosted since a veteran can join a newbie player's quest with relative ease.3. Bugs for the most part have been addressed.4. Targeting. Monsters jump and frolic across your screen like they're made of feather and tissue paper which makes keeping track of them challenging at times. What's worse though is that the targeting system does little to make sure you're hitting in the right direction or even looking at the right monster. Sometimes I would have the cursor lock on to a monster that was right next to me only to have my character swinging fruitlessly at an empty space position unchanged. Also with the amount of monsters and wildlife at play in any given area one bad swipe or even touch to RS and you've found yourself looking at a monster in a tree 200 yards away. tl dr our hunters' attacks feel solid and deliberate but the targeting system feels like it's from the perspective of the monsters flailing around on our screen chaotically unfocused.After some fine tuning I can finally recommend this game it's just sad that it took so long for an already ""polished"" port to be brought up to standard for release.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

TLDR PROS gameplay so awesome i could not to find the right words here so believe me the gameplay is just what you expected on the trailer good prices you will spent hundred hours or maybe thousands to hunt item that really hard to find so you just gonna repeat the quest again and again for your own satisfaction especially when you play with your friends ( if you have) so you can show off rare items. Worth to buy compared some another overpriced game that only offer you single story that you can complete around 30 40hours as a controller user I find it same as the PS4 version I don't find any error while using xbox controller on windows operating system. Just plug and penetrate.. Ugh I mean plug and playCONS I'am trying using my mouse and keyboard and find it really hard to play because so many button that you have to press in the intense gameplay and you need some times to get to used to it but you can set your own keyboard shortcut to make it fit for your hand.

This game just make them easeir to get into than all the past games by a mile. Few weeks in we still have some networking bugs. I have yet to see a crash but I did get the latest video drivers prior to playing so no issues there. Honestly the port to PC in my eyes is fantastic minus the multiplayer issues with disconnects and not being able to connect with friends some times. Highly recommend the game even in its current form.

2018-08-22,0,0,234,False,Recommended,"After 14 years of relative obscurity in the West this titan of a series leaps out of the handhelds and onto the PC with a mighty roar.Monster Hunter World is an action RPG placing you in the role of a rookie Hunter in employ of the Guild the ruling body of government in Monster Hunter's world. As part of the Guild's Research Commision you are sent off to explore the ""New World"" an uncharted landmass across the sea to investigate the cause behind a great migration of dragons to the area. Once you touchdown on the New World you are slowly eased into the game's mechanics. For many players new to Monster Hunter Monster Hunter World will truly feel like a new world. Monster Hunter differs from many action RPGs in that your hunter is just that a human hunter with (relatively) human limitations You are not the Dragonborn able to cast magic and throw monsters around with your voice.You are not a Witcher though you can have white hair.And you most certainly are not a blond elf wielding a magic sword on a heroic quest.You're just a Hunter with only your weapon your armor your experience and your wits to arm yourself with. There are no experience points or levels in Monster Hunter. How strong you are how you fare in combat against towering beasts depends entirely on your skill with your weapon and how much you've mastered your quarry. Each strike with your weapon follows your weapon's attack arc and deals damage if it connects. There is no tab targetting like most MMORPGs or Skyrim you must aim your attack precisely finding out where your target monster is weakest and capitalizing on it. Landing the blow is only half the job. You must also account for what happens after your blow is successful. Did you stumble the monster and leave them open for more hits? You can continue attacking position yourself to hit their primary weakspot or take the time to retreat and heal your own wounds.Or did they not flinch and are getting ready to counterattack? You can prepare your own counterattack and aim to stagger them or dodge with a roll and hasten your recovery from your wide greatsword swing. Did your party member hit the monster during the monster's own attack windup and is about to get slammed by their tail? You can fight on and hope they can tank the hit use a wide range healing item to leave them with a sliver of health or throw a flashbomb in the monster's face and save them from certain death. Even the choices you make before combat and even before the quest begins play a role in your fight. Perhaps you knew that a certain monster was susceptible to an element or weapon type. Instead of going with a greatsword you plan to exploit a monster's weakness to blunt damage and use a hammer to knock them out. Or you made a new armor set to deal with a certain monster's overwhelming lightning damage. Even if you've mastered a monster's tells and behavior every fight is different especially with the varied locales and large seamless maps with no loading screens. A monster may take the fight to a cramped area between mountain crags where your own mobility is hampered turning the tables against you. Every decision every action leads to new possible decisions keeping combat dynamic and fluid. Unlike Skyrim or other RPGs your quarry is dynamic as well. They will not stand in place and allow you to simply hit them. They are wild animals and will fight like wild animals to the death. Larger faster and stronger they will use every trick and boon given to them by evolution to survive another day. From hardening skin that will cause bullets and blades to glance off to fireballs that will melt susceptible armor or agility that will keep you running away in fear every monster poses a different challenge a different fight to master. Conquering the goofy bird like Kulu Ya Ku is a whole different fight from tracking down and slaying the belligerent T Rex known as Anjanath. Fortunately you are not without your own adaptation your skill and wits. Preparing for a quest and to hunt a monster is just as important as fighting the monster. All armor and weaponry is crafted by the player from monster remains and various ores gathered and collected during gameplay whether on hunts or relaxed expeditions. Knowing a monster's weakness and behavior will help you decide what armor to make what armor skills are helpful and what weapon will help you outmaneuver and overpower your quarry. There are helpful items that can give you an edge in combat such as flashbombs to blind a monster pitfall traps to stop them from moving and tainted meat to poison especially hungry monsters but none of them are free or given to you. Like your armor and weapons you must make them.And therein lies the draw of Monster Hunter that has made and kept fans for over 14 years. Every struggle against a tough monster every slash that staggers them every tail cut and every kill is because of you and your skill. Your weapon did not kill the monster. It was your mastery of the monster your knowledge of how to hunt them that earned you the right to the kill and the carves. For the first time in the series all quests can be done in multiplayer with friends and strangers. No longer is there a split between offline and online quests thanks to the leap from handhelds. With 16 player gathering halls there is never a shortage of comrades. Gather track hunt and slay monsters with 3 other players in any quest. New players going in solo and find themselves in a tough spot can call for help with the SOS flare. Don't be afraid to call for help you're going to need it. Unfortunately many of the negative reviews on Steam tout the poor connection issues plaguing the game at launch thanks to Valve's overhaul of Steam's social functions. Many of these problems and error messages were present on the console launch as well. As of 8/22/2018 improvements have been made and less disconnects are being reported. Though there were some connection issues Monster Hunter World is a respectable new addition to the long running series.To the new players eager to jump into the Monster Hunter series Welcome to the New World.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,180,False,Recommended,Absolutely love this game. Now it is my first time playing Monster Hunter World so I'm coming in with fresh eyes unable to compare with previous versions or against console version. However I love it. Not sure it's it's not super sociable of a game due to it being newly released to PC or if thats just the vibe of the game but it works well with steam friends (although can be confusing on how to get friends to join as it varies depending on gameplay). Controls So you can use keyboard and mouse but it's definitely optimized for controller. default key bindings are a tad weird (also weird to change binding) but there's also so many different and changing controls (changes based on weapon choice menu and fighting) so it's understandable it's gonna be wonky. would just like to see it more streamlined/defaulted towards keyboard and mouse.Because there is a myriad of controls items weapons armors devices loadouts quests palico stuffs ect. there is bound to be confusion and difficulties just getting used to the game. but once you've got a good grip on it it becomes easier to navigate. Events As of now we havnt seen any of the special events include PC along with xbox and ps4. so that's slightly frustrating but also understandable as this is the very first time Monster Hunter has been on PC. Hopefully Capcom is working on getting bugs worked out and better streamlined for PC.If your interested in the game but unsure check my channel out on Twitch (https //www.twitch.tv/waldo_487).

2018-08-09,0,0,22,False,Recommended,I played this game a lot on PS4 but when it arrived on Steam I bought copies for both my wife and myself. We both have systems with i5 7600 CPUs and EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition video cards so I can't speak to the issues seen by other users with regards to pre Haswell CPUs or Radeon cards. This game has played very smoothly so far on my system with faster loading times and equal responsiveness as on my PS4 Pro. I did not experience any crashes or black screens but my wife did have a CTD. I keep my GPU drivers more up to date than she does (with GeForce Experience as much as it's annoying) so that might be a factor.While the keyboard controls are clunky I was allowed to seamlessly switch back and forth between my XBox 360 controller (I have an old school USB dongle for it) and the keyboard not that I really wanted to. This is not a game with an epic story. Having played it before I wish I could have skipped some of the cut scenes. They don't add much but are useful if you haven't played on another platform yet. This game exists for you to go out kill some monsters upgrade your gear then go out and kill more monsters. And... that's it.Favorite part of the game is definitely my Palico.

At 3840 x 2160 with setting somewhere between mid and high (switch off volume rendering quality for starters) it stays in the 45 55 FPS range and at 1920 X 1080 on high the game stays well above 60 FPS. I don t have an ultra wide monitor or 144hz so those issues don't matter to me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,222,False,Recommended,First Impressions Fantastic! I logged about 200 hours into the console version and after being able to play on PC with way faster loading screens way higher FPS (I maintained around 60 on 'High' settings. Some people said to turn down shadows but I'm not having any issues with them on) and much prettier detail I don't think I'll be able to go back to the console. Bought it on Green Man Gaming for around $50. Worth it. Definitely gonna need a controller though. Mouse and Keyboard seem pretty difficult to use.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,135,False,Recommended,I'm having fun with this game. Key differences between this game and the previous releases Lack of G Rank Less complex item combination No true single player campaign Damage numbers (please don't let this turn into healthbars)Lobby size is up from 4 to 16 which brings it up to the normal Japanese standard I feel like the monsters got easier but that might be from the fact I've put over 5000 hours int oMonster Hunter as a franchise game. There are a few people I'm seeing that say this isn't a good game for anyone who isn't a veteran of the series I disagree. This is one of the most user friendly games in the series not including Monster Hunter Stories. This is a good lauching point for anyone looking to get into the series to give you a good feel for what you are in for. Your item pouch is much more intuitive than the onld one in previous games your monster drops no longer share space with your usable items and your gunner pouch is no longer missing when using a blademaster weapon. Speaking of Gunning Using the Bow Light Bowgun and Heavy Bowgun are much easier on PC thanks to being able to aim with the mouse. Some things need to be rebound to your preference which is the beauty and purpose of a PC port. The music is great and it's always rewarding to hear the Songstress during the credits. One of my favourite bgms is the Rotten Vale Battle theme. The soundscape in this game is pretty amazing in general. You are always aware of how much is going on b audio cues. Music stopped for a second? Must be a monster showing up. Music fades out during a fight? Your monster is leaving the area or going to sleep. Relaxed theme stopped? Something's trying to fight you. Overall this game is a SATISFYING experience... Up until you need to find a specific gem for your item set. But it wouldn't be a Monster Hunter game without the desire sensor. I give the game 9/10 The 9 is for the 100 hourse I dumped into the game in the last week and not even noticing.Docking 1 beacause while it feels like the game the developers wanted to make the game follows a theme that's not written very well and is pretty easily interpereted through the elder fights.

HOWEVER between constant stuttering in some later game areas to visual fidelity that is worse than consoles even on some of the highest settings the port leaves much to be desired Connection issues have been resolved so if you do have a machine that can run the rather unoptimized game then I would still recommend it.

2018-08-23,0,0,276,False,Recommended,"TL DR Game's good has its issues first PC release for the MonHun team and arguably (and in my opinion) they did things a lot better than most other Capcom PC ports (or so I've heard)Somethings to mention before going in 1) Min Max Specs factor in the option ""Volume Rendering"" which eats FPS turning it off is advised.2) The final boss/monster ""bug"" doesn't corrupt your save its just your computer being unable to render the end cutscene. You literally could load the game onto a different computer and run the cutscene if your codec drivers aren't corrupted/outdated (there is a Reddit post about it on /r/MonsterHunter)3) This is the Monster Hunter team's first ever PC release (MHOnline notwithstanding as that's developed by a 3rd party).Meat and potatoes Pros Beautiful graphics and overall a lot smoother than the console version. In built controller support that is highly customizable (half in part to Valve half in part to swap the buttons to ""Japanese"" controls on the PS4 controller that means swapping X and O to confirm or cancel). Easier to find groups/communities to hunt with (Steam communities Friends lists one click copy paste Session IDs and pretty much all Session IDs starting with ""3pseat""). Easiest game in the series (overall and to get into the series as a whole) while still keeping the Monster Hunter ""anything goes"" playstyle and difficulty curves from older games with refreshing mechanic overhauls.Cons MonHun's dev team's first PC release so quite a few things are an issue like particle effects causing frame drops (compared to the things they've done a good job with on the port this is the most standout issue). Mods that while good ones do exist like a transmogging mod are easily abused to hand you almost everything in the game aside from Decorations (to my knowledge). Silence on key issues often times we're left in the dark about the current status of Capcom squashing bugs like the multiplayer connectivity issues which have recently been somewhat addressed. Hackers (obviously) but more so than in the other games due to the popularity of PC gaming compared to rigging a console for hacking or the need for 3rd party items like Action Replays or Save Editors and various workarounds.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Wonderful game with a wide variety of playstyles to choose from. The game requires some time to get used to in terms of difficulty but playing multiplayer helps with that. There is grinding but it's reasonable (Example you may need to fight a monster more than once for the items it drops for a specific piece of armor/weapon). I highly recommend playing with other people but it's easy enough to find randoms if you don't have friends who play. The only downside to this game in terms of gameplay would probably be the lack of tutorials. I was lucky to have friends who played previous versions of monster hunter (even the concole version of this one) to guide me through the more intricate mechanic. Even though there are some splashscreens that give you the basics now and then the information they give you is slim and I can see why some people might have a hard time getting into the game. My best recomendation would be to look up a few beginner guides on youtube or check out the Monster Hunter Wiki.Unfortunately the console port is not very good (how do you only have partial controller support for a game originally released on console?). The are plenty of reports about bugs regarding graphical performance but I haven't had those problems. Your mileage may vary.At launch multiplayer connectivity was awful but since then I have had almost no issues when trying to connect with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,154,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter finally gets its debut on PC and is simply delightful. Originally released on the PS4 the port functions entirely as expected. This review is 3 days after release and sometimes there are issues with staying connected to the online services but there was the exact same issues on the PS4 launch that was resolved early with a patch.Now if you'll excuse me I have monsters to hunt and new gear to craft.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,141,False,Recommended,I cannot recommend this game enough. Almost 20 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface of what MHW has to offer. Pros massive game. Lots of monsters to kill lots of items to collect lots of quests to do. There are people on console with more than 300 400 hours in this game still missing certain items. That gives you a sense of scale. good controls (ecept KbM). weapon variety. There are 14 total weapons and each one feels unique even ones that are similar on the surface (such as light and heavy bowguns). Switching weapons can feel like a whole different game QoL improvements over previous titles. Unlimited pickaxes whetstones and capture nets. No loadtimes during a hunt. the slinger. Yes this gets it's own bullet point. The slinger is a new addition to the MH series and it feels so integral to the game I'm honestly surprised that it's not in previous games. You can use the slinger to move arounf the map but primarily it fires various items at monsters like stones torch pods flash bangs etc. It's fun to use and very potent against your enemies. stunning visuals. The graphics are amazing first off. But equally or perhaps more importantly the world design is amazing as well. Each area of the map is discinct and beautiful. The world moreso even than the monsters dwarfs your little hunter which is a perfect segway into the world is a living ecosystem. There are things to interact with in the world like endemic life natural traps climable walls and more. In addition the world largely ignores you if you just walk around. Some small animals might flee or growl at you but the world doesn't stop moving because you're there. Large monsters won't always aggro on sight and they won't chase you for long if you flee from them. Overall it makes you feel like an outsider like a minor character in the ecosystem instead of the star which personally I really enjoy.Cons multiplayer is spotting and annoying. For the story missions you have to both enter the mission then each watch a cutscene seperatly then one person leaves and joints the other. Fortunetly the story missions are only like 15% of the game at most time wise KbM doesn't work right. You don't get raw mouse input CPU intensive. For a number of reasons this game is very CPU demanding. The required specs overall are pretty steep but CPU especially. minimal story. There is a story but it's not very rich or long.As you can see the pros far outweigh the cons. This is a game I plan to spend a lot of time playing both solo and with friends.It will take a while with this type of game to really unlock it's potential. I urge you to give it a long hard look and stick with it if you hit a wall. Failing and trying again getting better each time until you succeed is the essence of Monster Hunter.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Network issues are similiar to the launch issues on PS4 the only issues outside of that is with people either not knowing how to use settings not checking the recommended or minimum specs or not downloading the newest drivers for their hardware game runs perfectly fine with great graphics.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,160,False,Recommended,Running an I5 3570K and an Nvidia GTX 970.Getting a little bit of bottlenecking and slight stutter while running the game anywhere between 40 60fps with everything maxed except Volume Rendering Quality Shadows and SH Diffuse.Looks and feels way better to play compared to what I have experienced back on the PS4.Biggest issue was disconnecting during a quest a few times at peak time (about 280k players online) and sometimes we had to have different people host an Online lobby because somebody couldn't join the original server. Otherwise it's been smooth sailing.Monster Hunter World itself is an incredible game and you should play play it. Any issues that others may still possibly be encountering will be ironed out within a week. The MH franchise is Capcom's baby and they'll take care of it. I doubt the Monster Hunter dev team that was tasked to make this port from the ground up had much experience with preparing a PC release of this scale. Good Hunting.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,84,False,Recommended,"I've noticed that there are a lot of negative reviews for this game so I figured that I would chime in.The game itself is very enjoyable but that doesn't mean it's without problems. Personally I find the weapons kinda boring to use for the most part with a bunch of weapons feeling pretty similar with slight differences between them. That's not to say that it's bad but personally only 2 3 weapons of 14 really seemed ""fun"" to me.Combat is pretty decent I can't really complain too much outside of a few times where a monster will get stuck between two heights and stand at a weird angle (but this doesn't happen too often.Graphics are great!Bad stuff Sometimes it seems like there is a little bit of lag in online play but it's hard to say whether that's a server overload issue or a ""bad port"" issue. Personally it's never been a problem for me I've seen one or two monsters teleport very briefly.People complain about a lot of connection errors and things like that. I can't say that they aren't happening but I've never personally encountered one.I play on pad so I can't speak to kbm controls however I've heard that they are working on addressing the mouse issues with the game that other people are complaining about so far. The biggest complaint that I have is the lack of explanation for key functions of various aspects of the game. There are very barebones descriptions for how things like capturing monsters stats and even how weapons actually work. They go about as in depth as saying ""hey this is a thing that exists"" and kinda leave you to work out the rest. You can piece a lot of it together just by playing but some things you're better off just looking up than trying to learn through playing.Conclusion Overall the game seems to have issues for a ton of people but its' been runnign fine for me. The sidequests can be a bit dull but they're sidequests you don't really need to do them. I've enjoyed the game so far and would definitely recommend picking it up if you're a fan of monster hunter or even if you just enjoy similar types of games.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Just wanted to say this game is amazing hunting monsters solo or with your friends it's both fun in games and the grind is awesome for a change. The bounties and other investigation missions are really fun and you will go back and forward between the places you've been. The cats are freaking cool too. The story is pretty cool to don't want to spoil that part so won't say anymore about that. And the mixed combat with all the weapon makes your charachter take on a unique fighting style for example the two handed sword is for heavy damage and imitating Berserk or something use your imagination.. Dual blades for Naruto no Flurry Jutsu style or Levi from Attack on Titan if you wish flurry that stuff around and doing cool moves. Or make some noise with the bagpipe to support your friends with buffs and awesome music goes great with dps as well. Myself I play well with Switch Axe (Axe with a sword combo) it's really fun makes me feel cool you know. Lance is pretty neat as well recommend the short sword and shield though for begginers just feel around and you will find the weapon for you. Once you find your weapon of choice that's when the magic start to happen. People complaining about crashing issues are just peps with bad rigs I've had MHW running 12 hours straight in the background and playing from time to time and not crashing once I'm playing with a crappy 980 but since it's CPU heavy game the Ryzen 5 is cool. Bad port? Please. I've not even once encountered connection failures or something alike.I've not encountered any bugs that throws me of balance from the game just some minor bugs but nothing serious or game breaking. Games are never bug free these days just accept it.Buy or not? I say buy it it's worth the cash and time. Oh and a final note look up on all the cool collabs Capcom has made with different devs for this game it's awesome and can't wait for more to come in the future.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I never did get to play online however as high speed internet was still very much in its infancy and I didn t have the equipment to take my PlayStation online.Monster Hunter World has rectified that issue for me. I ve had a blast from the very beginning. Yes I ve experienced the graphics crashes and lost connections but those since I can just boot the game back up and start playing again it s not game breaking.Don t buy this game if you re looking for a deep story with interesting characters. This game doesn t hide what it is which is a grind for loot.

It's a great game! You get to smash monsters with huge weapons grind those beasties for parts to make new gear repeat. You know what you are getting into because of the title. Be willing to grind.

2018-08-11,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Potentially the best game in the series maybe even better than 4U or GenU. Maybe even my favourite game of all time.Obviously some people's concerns need to be addressed.It's a demanding beast but you need to remember top end settings are for top end hardware. I've got a meaty machine with a 1080Ti and 4K is a 30fps ordeal. 1440p sits above 80fps constantly. And at 1080p it doesn't even break a sweat. Load times with two SSDs in RAID 0 are about 3 seconds. My 5 year old laptop with a 930M chipset gets 18fps average. So new hardware should play on lower settings easily. Controls next. Nobody should be using keyboard and mouse for this game that's just masochism. It's like playing racing games with a game pad and expecting to be competitive against people using wheels. Connections. A lot of people are having connection issues and most are related to port forwarding and the way matchmaking works in MHW. In fact its the same as the way call of duty works. No random disconnections no lag. Occasionally I can't connect to an online session but it's launch weekend and it's online gaming. No biggy. As for gameplay Monster Hunter is hard but Monster Hunter World is markedly easier than it's forebears and is a great entry to the series. Just don't expect to be good off the bat you're going to get your handed to you. The franchise harder and more complex than any From Software game it just doesn't advertise that on the box. If you're getting KO'd it's entirely your own fault. Not the controls not the gameplay not your gear. But once it clicks with you you'll be laughing at how easily you're wading through the things you struggled with before... Only to get stomped by your next challenge.Another thing to note is that no monster Hunter really starts until you finish the story. Just a heads up. That's basically 30 hours of training wheels you don't know you have. Then the real fun begins. All in all Monster Hunter World is an incredible achievement. Incredible to play solo and with friends. Give it time and it will reward you a thousand times over.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Can't join a friends session unless you input the session ID. It works on the PS4 just fine why not here? Then if I try to join my friends quest I get a ""Failed to join quest"". Thanks Capcom. You didnt learn from your botched start on xbox. You made it even worse.Edit I should add that the sound keeps cutting out for a second or two randomly. Most likely because Denuvo is doing some calculations again and kills some ""unneccessary"" workload to have more for itself...Unless all these problems are not fixed within the next week I will issue a refund because Capcom is scamming over the legit PC players with this Denuvo t.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,489,False,Recommended,When looking at any game there are two important things to consider the gameplay (IE if the mechanics are solid and the fights feel good) and the performance (IE framerates online connectivity crashes etc.). This is something I don't feel has been very well distinguished in a lot of the reviews I've read concerning this game. So in hopes of painting as clear a picture as possible I'll start with the performance as it's what I have the biggest problem with. On launch day the online connectivity was absolutely terrible. One friend and I couldn't stay connected in the same online session for more than one quest and it was a 5 10 minute process reconnecting to a mutual session every time this happened. That being said there was a hotfix which I understand has had mixed reception but fixed the vast majority of the online connectivity issues I personally had been experiencing. Now I'm able to play with friends in a variety of different locations with only an occasional session drop which now only takes a few seconds to correct. Another thing I had an issue with was crashing. Although quite infrequent maybe once every 50 60 hours it was a serious problem due to the way the game autosaves sometimes causing me to have to repeat a quest immediately after finishing it. This has also has seemingly been fixed as I haven't had a crash in almost 100 hours of in game time. One last thing to add I would recommend using a controller to play this game. The mouse and keyboard controls felt clunky and awkward to me but they're fully rebindable so with enough patience I'm sure you could make them work. This brings me to the gameplay. I've always had an interest in the Monster Hunter series but before this I had only played MH4U for the DS. This is to say that I'm not the most experienced Monster Hunter player but I have a tremendous amount of respect for the series and am super glad it's finally seeing a port to PC. I don't have the same kind of hardcore passion that some veterans have so I'm not very bothered by quality of life changes such as the scoutflies instead of paintballs and having an infinite whetstone although I understand how some people could be upset by seeing some of the series staples becoming more casual friendly. I however don't think it's good for a series to remain too arcaic for too long and Monster Hunter is taking a step in the right direction with most of these changes in my opinion. The scoutfly system makes it feel like you're actually tracking monsters and gradually learning more and more about them eventually becoming able to tell where monsters you've hunted over and over are from the spawn by looking at the map.On a side note a lot of weapon types have had their movesets updated with some new moves that output more effieicnt DPS than standart combos from previous titles meaning veterans of the series will have to re lean how to best use certain weapons such as the greatsword. To finish up this is one of my favorite games of all time. It has problems but (for me at least) the majority of them have been addressed leaving the core gameplay to shine through.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-25,0,0,122,False,Recommended,so far I am 58 hours in with no plans of stopping taking my time through the game and have yet to finish the main quest although I am close I have not touched Multiplayer I have heard about how bad it is and have played every minute of this game in Single Player.Being my first Monster Hunter title I went in with high hopes and those high hopes were met and succeedeed with the mix of Weapon Depth &amp Variey as well as the Monsters. Monsters are not just Boss Fights as they have their own cycles they will look for prey Wyverns will prioritise their eggs and if you try to steal one good luck. The Early Game The difficulty for Monster Hunter isn't prevelant at the start having been a souls player and being well adjusted to the hit &amp roll mechanics I quickly adjusted to the game and killed the first Monster the Great Jagras with ease. I met my first difficulty spike at the Anjanath though this could be due to the fact that I was using an Insect Glaive without knowledge of the harvest mechanics if you don't know what this means imagine buying a very expensive Gun to hunt a bear only to use BB Ammo. I painfully killed my first Anjanath and after this fight I realised my DPS was very lacking I decided to switch my weapon to the Heavy BowGun.Without bloating this review with too much storytime I quickly found out that every single weapon performs differently in a Souls game going from a Greatsword to a Straight Sword just meant you had to spam RB a few more times before rolling but in this game that is not the case from using different weapons the weapons are more like classes. The Hunt When you hunt a monster you will start by looking for traces such as mucus faeces scales fur etc. Leveling up your research in that monster will allow you to eventually pinpoint a monster's location just from interacting with one trace. When you locate the monster it is up to you on how to approach you can wait silenty for an opening or you can charge in like a madman if you're feeling comfortable. You will be hunting monsters multiple time but I have yet to be bored of a hunt with the interactions the monsters have with eachother and the AI of the monster having a brain every hunt will be unique. Gear &amp Variety The game doesn't lack in variety there are hundreds of armor pieces + weapons that you can craft. The Weapon Upgrading system is one of the best I've seen in any game. If you upgrade your weapon to a far point in the tree using valuable resources and want to divert to a different path you can downgrade your weapon and get every single material back this will cost you in the Zenny which is the currency but that is a small price considering how valuable some resources get later on. Armors are less about defense stats and more about the skills each armour piece has a skill in the game with a set number of levels and mix and matching armours are required here you can also change your playstyle dependant on the skills that you choose. an example of this is combining the Quick Sheath skill with Weakness Exploit you can turn a Greatsword all up in your face combat style into a hit&amp run style which trust me is alot more fun than it sounds.The depth of the game is incredible more than just the complexity of mastering is weapon. There are a few mechanics that the game does not tell you about and while this is a 50/50 pro con it feels more old school when you discover a mechanic that can help you some other mechanics REQUIRE you to search online especially when it comes to buff stacking. Is This Game For You? People are often turned off when hearing you have to kill the same monster over and over again to get the set / weapon that you want and while this does sound repetitive the combination of the satisfying combat and the monsters feeling like they're living in the world not because of you makes the gameplay very dynamic.To keep it nice and short Do you like huge fantasy monsters? Do you like a massive range of weaponry? Do you like games where skill &gt gear?Do you like a combat system with depth?Do you like food porn?If you answered yes to 4/5 of these this is a must buy. If not it's still a must buy just wait for the sale.NOTE If you plan to play online with friends you will probably of heard by now the massive amount of connection issues and disconnections Capcom have put out a patch recently which is said to fix this issue I can not confirm or deny but I'll take their word for it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,145,False,Recommended,Pros Fast paced gameplay once you get through the cutscenes. Massive variety of weapons to master and tons of minor aspects of each weapon to perfect. Upgrade trees for days between both armor and weapons this game does not run out of things for you to get and reasons to hunt Unique monsters especially as you near end game they branch out and become more challenging Satisfying multiplayer Monsters do not get boring Audio is fantastically designed as are the animations making the greatsword feel like an actual slab of metal and the resounding crunch of attacks connecting is music to my ears. Managed to cut out a vast majority of farming via the botanistCons Occasional disconnect can up a good run but I hope they fix that soon Monsters can be painful to grind once you've already far surpassed their skill level namely the early game ones if you are looking for a non tempered high rank monster Not for people who don't like grinding for rare parts. Reminds me a lot of Diablo or warframe but it brings a much more intense gameplay style to the table. Unskippable cutscenes are by far the worst part of this entire game which is good if you think about it. Nergigante DLC isn't out yet but nothing to be done about that.First Monster Hunter I have played and I can honestly say that it is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Coming from a background primarily of CS GO and Overwatch and transitioning to a more casual style game it is still an exhilerating game to play. I have dumped so much time into it since its release 2 weeks ago and have yet to grow bored. I can 100% say it is better to play with friends. As someone who usually plays DPS in his FPS games I find that playing support is equally rewarding and satisfying simply because you still get to be in the fight. I have also dabbled in Dark Souls and this is everything I wanted Dark Souls to be as much of the walking between bosses got boring for me. Also to brush over the topic of connectivity I rarely disconnect from friends servers now although admittedly it was worse on release and the poor reviews on the first few days of launch are justified. Also the who said that his file was corrupted and blamed the game should burn in hell because he got a bunch of people to bandwagon when it was later proven that there was no way that could happen due to the game. Overall a 10/10 game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Gameplay wise the game is good specially when playing with friends. If you enjoy fighting large monsters by strategy and not just hacking your way throuh it. This game is for you. If you love fooling around with your friends while they give their all into the game this game is for you. Every battle with large monsters is thrilling requires a lot of strategy and observing to fight them. I haven't progress enough to say story is good but it is a step compared to the psp versions since those games have vaugue story.

2018-08-11,0,0,271,False,Recommended,"Finally a Monster Hunter for the PC. Perfect game for newcomers to Monster Hunter series whilst for the veterans various QoL improvements have made this game easier but less MH esque. Gone are the days of forgetting to stock whetstones pickaxes or paintballs for hunts which I feel is infinitely better than the previous MH series though some MH elitists are gonna say otherwise. But this review is for the new players to the series. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS1) Graphics 4/5What can I say. It looks good just as a Triple A title should be. Monsters are full of detailed textures. The world looks crisp. It really makes you go ""Wow"" the first time you delve into the World. Currently some textures are bugged out and other graphic settings don't work. Capcom have said they would consider releasing a higher graphic pack for the PC too so fingers crossed.2) Music 5/5Peaceful and harmonious. Intense and heart pumping. 3) Story 3/5MH series are not known for their story. But I give it a 3/5 for trying.4) Content 4/5Tons of contents for you to rip through and have ginormous fun solo or with friends. Though the latter nets you a more memorable hunt. There are some events and monsters that are not yet added into the PC version but the base game is good enough for you to spend hundreds of hours into. Personally I felt burned out after crafting each of every weapons and just farming for decorations every single day. 5) Gameplay 5/5You hunt and you grind. And you do it with huge a** weapons. Satisfaction guaranteed. But seriously this game is about you grinding the monsters countless times to craft the gears you had your eyes on and then use them to make your life easier in killing more powerful monsters. Its addicting.6) ConclusionI would say this game is much easier in terms of picking up right from the start for beginners compared to the previous series where they throw you to the wilderness and expect you to learn for yourself the many features of the game (I like it though). In World you get to be spoon fed for a couple of hours to prepare you for hunts. Monsters are also seemingly easier to take down. Loot rewards are aplenty making crafting different equipments much much easier. Generally the game feel a lot faster now.BUT this is what happens. These QoL improvements have made this game so much easier that for some people it has made the thrill of the hunt dissapear. You do not have to get to the gathering hub (gathering halls etc.) to create a group anymore. The new drop in feature made farming easier but takes away the interactions between players. This QoL have sped the farming game a thousand times. I still vividly remember farming for days just to craft the final tier of a weapon type in previous series. In World I get to farm it in a day and 2 to 3 final tier weapons in a day to boot.It may not necessarily be a con but it does serve as a catalyst for making me feel burned out by the game already. All in all definitely get this game it definitely worth EVERY. SINGLE. DOLLAR.tl dr Game is great. QoL have pros and cons.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,15,False,Recommended,First couple of hours I loved the game. A few hours later I hated it. Now Im 12 hours into the game and I am hooked. I now realize that I havent even begun to scratch the surface of the game yet.SO at first I hated the fighting controls locking on is useless so far and my character will miss strikes completely standing next to a monster. Thats super annoying. After practicing with a couple weapons I understand the way the fighting is in this game. The weapons are huge so there really is no such thing as being agile. Don't fight like you are playing Dark Souls....its way different.Throughout my playtime more items have unlocked monsters are getting harder strategy is more important knowing the plants to use to set traps is getting easier. I have learned the couple maps by heart so that helps with strategies. I learned how to use my weapon to jump onto monsters climb around and strike them. So now battles are actually enjoyable.So I know this is a very random and basic review but in a nutshell this is a game that you will love when you start to play hate it when you are thrown into combat with minimum explanation about the many game mechanics but once you learn about the mechanics tricks monster habits etc. then the game really shines.Multiplayer issues are still there tho. I havent had any other glitches or any frame drops tho. I will be playing this game for awhile because through all the annoyances its still a fun game that I am enjoying.

2018-08-10,0,0,184,False,Recommended,As a long time fan of the monster hunter games MHW is a very welcomed renew of the serie as it started to get extremely repetitive and games like MHX just didn't have the same feeling of marvel and exploration as the earlier ones did and I'm excited to see what this one has in store despite an original bad impression I had before starting the game.Same as the others MH MHW is polished and has the finishing touch which makes the game feel alive with great (really great) animations attention to details and location design. The soundtrack seems good so far too.As for graphics I run it at 40 fps with a mix of high low settings in the most dense area of the jungle with a 960 GTX and the game does look great. High resolution scalling is good for far away details but takes away a lot of your FPS (I don't use it). Optimisation wise it's not a Witcher 3 but definitely better than a Deus ex Mankind Divided or Ghost recon Wildlands.One little thing that I appreciate enough to write is that monster don't cycle their attacks between players/Feylin in a set manner like anymore and may focus a target with attacks multiple times in a row making them more unpredictable.One thing that I dislike enough to write is the tutorial. Tutorial are great but please let player decide on the intensity of it at one point I just ignored it altogether maybe missing actually interesting explanation because of the amount of useless ones that were poured on me.They went to great extent to make the gameplay feel more fluid and flexible it feels waaaay nicer to dodge and jump around than it did with the rigidity of the precedent MH. Gathering of plants shrooms were also made faster so you can swipe by while doing whatever you're doing and I thank the devs for that.They also made an effort to make the hunt more interactible as an exemple you have this monster that feeds on fruits hanging above ground which you can shoot beforehand with your sling so that he doesn't fill himself with poison to throw at you.I didn't encounter any bug other than a crash when I went back to the game from the desktop.Some tips For your character creation put textures to max so you can work on something clearer than a pixel fest Don't use MH language like seriously it sounds for full sentences Detail setting is what makes the game look nice mostly Don't use Antialiasing if you're not putting resolution scalling to max otherwise the game looks really fuzzy SnS is obviously the best weapon (proved by multiple scientifical studies),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I personally experience no bugs (or i don t notice them xD). But still this game may bug out on ppl. I heard about the issues "" As i said personally for me it works.

2018-08-10,0,0,44,False,Recommended,I've waited for this one for a very long time... and so far it's amazing! No problems high framerates on an outdated mid range PC and the game still looks amazing. The port is good. Really good. Capcom did a spectacular job porting the game to PC. Now yes the game has malware in it called Denuvo so if you uninstall the game that crap will stay but it doesn't hinder the game in any way. A rare thing in Japanese games using Denuvo malware usually Japanese devs don't know how to use the malware like Sega but Capcom did okay. I'm not that far into the game yet but I have to say one thing plug in a controller. Mose and keyboard are serviceable but the game was designed with a controller in mind. That being said even ranged weapons feel great with a controller and I usually hate how that works. If by any chance you can't or don't want to use a controller DO NOT USE the focus mode. It doesn't work well with a mouse the good news is that with a mouse you have a way better camera control without focus mode so it's not hindering you in any way. So far I recommend you get this one.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

While in theory dosn't bring anything new it feels fresh and i can sink hours and hours into it and feel satisfied and wanting more and more.There sounds to be some performance problems though i've not run into any (I seem to dodge a lot of these with games). I don't have a super computer and run smoothly with no issues Intel core i7 7700k 4.2ghz (8CPus)NVIDIA GeForce GTX 97016gb RAMAs of launch the network seems a little janky at times though this will probably be resolved with an update or when players drop off as I don t think the devs were expecting 230k+ concurrent players x'3 That being said I am still able to group up and play with players all times of the day fine being other players joining me or I them.The controls ones tweaked on mouse and keyboard work well and for a while I debated to use them or a control but with the camera controller works slightly better.

2018-08-12,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Before I say anything about how bad this port is I will just say that the game itself is great. But I wouldn't recommend at this time of the review.Horrible port with bad optimization is one thing but servers disconnect constantly I'm unable to actually play the game online. This game is designed for multilayer from its core yet horrible executed with poor design choices revolving around consoles. The party system is garbage being unable to free roam with friends without doing some ridiculous workaround is laughable and not being able to play with friends that are further into the game than you is bad enough to make one cry. And not being able to progress in the story together is also a ing joke because this means that you have to first complete the friends main and than yourselfs main to progress at the same speed Choose for sake is it a multilayer game or a singleplayer game if you can't play with friends in a simple and intuitive way what is the point.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Phenomenal game with the same types of launch issues as all PC games these days server issues and room for improvement on optimization.

But i would still 100% recommend if you want to enjoy a PvE game where theres always something to do and probably has the best map design/atmosphere on steam right now.I would agree that the port is pretty poor compared to the console but the overall problems are easily solvable through future updates (if they fix them). But honestly i cant go back to the console version going from 25 30 fps to 60 is amazing.At the time im making this id give it a 7/10 because of the inconveniences. but if they can match the console version this game could be easily a 10/10 if your interested in PvE.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The combat is challenging and fun the controls are excellent the monsters are awesome.That isn't to say the game is perfect I have some big complaints Network errors. I've been unable to play with friends three times already but other times it works fine. It feels very random. I had to turn off volumetric effects to get good framerate. I don't miss them but I'd prefer to play at high settings. Mouse control is kind of bad but I prefer a gamepad anyway. I haven't had any trouble with Denuvo but I'd prefer if they got rid of it.I'm still going to recommend it because none of that has detracted from my enjoyment of the game but I do hope they fix the issues soon.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you plan to play single player it is great. if you are getting it to play with friends wait a while and pray they fix this ""feature"".

2018-08-10,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Awesome game ! Thanks capcom,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Runs wonderfully on my machine. If you enjoy monster hunter it's probably the best in the series. It makes me not want to go back to previous installments. If you've never played one before know that the game is a bit grindy (but that is the point). The objective is basically farm a monster for resources make gear from those resources to fight better monsters. Your character's damage and skills are not determined by EXP but by the gear you wear so it's all about gettin that grind on. If you're not a monster hunter fan to begin with you'll be happy to know that the story is more intriguing than the others (as I've seen it so far) and that gear is not as resource demanding as it has been lowering the grind requirements.The multiplayer is leagues better than it could have ever been on any DS system and better than 3U on the Wii U. I run the game on medium (970 16gb i7 4790) at a constant 60fps and it looks terrific. I will update this review as I play more but man as a previous monster hunter fan I cannot recommend this game enough. It takes everything I loved and hated about the old games and improves upon them greatly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'd recommend the game but make sure your system doesn't rely on sli to run well. Luckily a single 970 is still decent enough.

2018-08-15,0,0,80,False,Recommended,It's a great game. Some minor issues related to the game itself and a few PC problems but overall it's great.Really the PC issues that I've seen are as follows poor mouse control and connection problems. Otherwise the game runs beautifully I have yet to crash at all and have seen only one bug (a girros was wigging out and teleporting which stopped when I got a hit on it). Mouse control is an issue to be sure but it's been acknowledged by the devs and they say they're working on it. And really it's better than Dark Souls 1 was. My preference for 3rd person games tends to be to use a controller so it doesn't really bug me much. Connection problems are definitely a pain it can be really annoying when you occasionally can't hold a stable connection for more than one hunt. But honestly this is Monster Hunter if you can't kill a monster by yourself maybe you should switch weapons upgrade your gear look up its weaknesses... or knuckle down and get better.As for the game it's disappointing that there are so many reused (with new leather or feathers taped on) weapon models. IMO this is the most egregious with hunting horn practically 50% of the tree is bagpipes. Otherwise like any other MH game it's got a lot of the same monsters the weapon movesets aren't very different and the story is as meh as ever. The changes that are here are quite nice I am in love with Wyvernsnipe and HH is so much smoother to play. The new monsters are cool and I particularly like that there are monsters that are like old ones but different. As an early game example Kulu Ya Ku is like a Yian Kut Ku but toned down which is great.The thing is it's fun. I am having a whale of a time trying out new weapons helping newbies kill their first Rathian and teaching my friends how everything works. It's a beautiful game too. I honestly don't care about the problems because it is so incredibly entertaining despite that. Plus Monster Hunter is no longer just that thing that a friend and I play it's something that almost my entire friend group has suddenly gotten into and I even have coworkers who don't really play games who are interested.Really it's been a week since release and the devs have said they're looking into both the mouse control and connection issues. The absolutely hilarious amount of complaints and negative reviews do nothing but make the PC using fans look like children and it's kind of sad to see. Even if there's some issues they definitely optimized the game well (re performance and stability) and this is the first time the MH team has developed for the PC. What's so hard about being patient and giving them the benefit of the doubt?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,190,False,Recommended,MHW has issues like most of the games released nowadays but hopefully they'll be fixed soon. The combat still has that original Monster Hunter feel to it but it's a lot easier for new players to learn. Maps are beautiful filled with enviromental interaction and incredible depth. The boring parts of the grinding on previous titles were made a lot better on this one no more expedition spams to gather plants and berries. In my opinion the game is a 8.5/10 right now possibly a solid 10/10 once co op issues are dealt with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,209,False,Recommended,First of all I'd like to say I am a MH fan so my opinions will be a little biased when it comes down to the games problems and how I personally feel about them but if anyone ends up reading this I'd like to ask you to hear me out.This is a great game I already have a few hundred hours on console so thats the least I can say but for their first pc Monster Hunter game it is meh. The problems can range from people complaining about certain video options not being avalible to their game crashing at the beginning cutscene. Personally the only issues I have had were once in a while I would have connection issues which I can get over since the game did just come out and most games are bound to have issues like this and maybe about 2 times where I have had an issue where the game would have a fatal error having to do with the graphics card causing me to have to close the game. But these issues seem to vary depending on the person. There are some people who are extremely angery with the game and it's understandable as I would be angry if I spent $60 on a game for it to have minor to major problems or in some instances not work at all but all the problems will be worked out eventually as I cannot see them leaving the game as is and just ignoring the complaints especially since they wanted to do good on their first pc Monster Hunter game.The game itself is good but being their first game on pc and the amount of problems they are having hopefully you can understand the beginning is going to be a bit shakey . So I'd say if you're interested but the complaints are making you unsure wait for a bit as they will eventually get around to sorting out the problems and fixing them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There are some nice improvements over previous installments mostly quality of life improvements (reducing mundane/repetitive tasks isn't dumbing down/casualizing). The current and most justified complaint about this game is the servers and to a lesser extent how online is set up in general.

2018-08-12,0,0,268,False,Recommended,Very fun game to play if you do not mind grinding for materials. New monsters and new moves for weapons means more novel experience for people who are MH veterans. Very good graphics the armor looks good and the multiplayer and the SOS signal mechanic seems to be working just fine for me. I would have struggled way more to get Rathian materials if I went on a quest alone for the first time so I like this method.Issues? Nothing to major has happened to me yet excpet for getting disconnected from online play a few times (which was not really an issue to me as I was playing solo at that time. I'll edit it if I find any more glaring problems in the future,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,24,False,Recommended,Played it on PS4 like 700h + and play it again on PC and no regrets its a great game overall. All the bad reviews maybe go back to bad setups and yeah there a some bugs but we can be for sure they will be fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,117,False,Recommended,It's been many years of playing this series on handhelds and then consoles always dreaming for a PC version. Now that it's here I can finally play it the way I prefer. Compared with the XBox version performance is superb extremely quick loading times (on SSD) and easily runs on max settings (i7 6950X GTX 1080). My single negative for now is the lack of ultrawide resolution but due to the large number of complaints I am confident that a fix will come soon.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,81,False,Recommended,This is the first Monster Hunter game that i actually rly like. I tried some other titles before like MH Freedom MH for the ps2 and God Eater. Neither of them got me so hooked like this new one. I think it was the big hype that got me to buy this game and i was glad i gave it another try. It got alot simplified so its very beginner friendly. lot of Weapons/armor to choose and upgrade. You can do some combos with ur weapons. I dont think they got this in the older titles. Mega grinding well its Monster Hunter No button smashing. positioning and dodging are very important. A lot of crafting I believe it got deep mechanics. In late game u probably have to choose carefully what gear to choose for each Monster individually ( i got only 16 hours gameplay now so im scraching the surface so far.) Some quests u can clear much easier if u have the the right gear for example the quest to carry 2 eggs to ur base.I expected that it would be very buggy and unplayable like many other titles for first day release. I got some luck that i do not have any problems at all except multiplayer sometimes. Give Capcom some time maybe 1 week or 2 to fix the biggest issues. In my opinion its not okay to just leave a negative review because of performance issues the release was ing 3 days ago. There are alot of games that do not function perfectly on release day.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,131,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter Worlds... This is my first time really playing a MH game others consisted of some attempts at a game boy version many years ago that I have no memory of. So I will treat this simply as a new player to the franchise. First the elephant in the room the price and the connection errors.The price is very hard to overcome it is undoubtedly a reasonable price given the work and content placed into the game. But we cant simply deny the fact that 50 is alot of money for the average gamer/person so can I say that this game justifies the sacrifice?Well yes and no right now unfortunately as you may already know from the tears shed in the reviews that the multiplayers servers are 100% unstable. You will be able to join others but it will be for an unpredictable amount of time. You may kill 10 monsters or get kicked out of the first fight halfway through. Forcing you to fight a monster that is 2 times stronger than single player alone. Not only that the game is far better playing it through with friends. Another problem is that unless the player has watched and attempted then left the story mission prior to others wanting to join. Then they will be unable to do so until you finish watching the cut scene. At that point you either fire an SoS or simply leave and restart the mission with your friends ready to join with you from the start. There are some other problems with the servers but in short you can play with others. Just don't expect it to last long and with MH being based around multiplayer this is unfortunately game breaking for many. Making the game at this moment in time NOT worth the 50. Now that is out the way lets get into the real game and ignore the multiplayer for now.First the game is extremely time demanding on average you are looking at dedicating 15 20 mins per fight without the ability to pause obviously. So you have to ensure you can dedicate 20 mins each time you start a mission so be aware.The weapons variety is amazing and also tedious in a way. There are 14 types each with their own play styles and impacts to a fight as solo or multi. If you really want to get into this game I highly reccomend you dedicate alot of time to the training area and try out all the weapons to decide which one you like. BUT every weapon is viable give or take some being harder against some bosses they are all more or less suitable for all bosses with some practic. So dont waste your time seeking ""op weapons"" and spamming the population with a lack of variety in fights.Upgrades no doubt the best part of MH games is the upgrade trees. You find a weapon find a set of armor. Then set yourself off to grind until you get all the materials you need to finish them both. This will take the majority of your time although it is tedious. The time it takes is perfectly balanced and most weapons can be built by gathering items from similar sources meaning you dont have to travel all over for 1 weapon. Making it straight forward and rewarding maybe this isnt to everyones liking but for me its flawless.Boss fights? Ok this is one thing they did wrong for me. The first few bosses all the way up to nerg are great. Each having fun mechanics and somewhat difficult fights to help make you really feel like its all on the line 24/7 keeping you on edge all the way. But as soon as you beat nerg you are left with 3 elders and the final boss. Basically the game teaches you how to use all your tools like flashes/screechers with healing clouds and all sorts of terrain traps AND THEN. You walk into these last 4 bosses and smash them in the face till they die in all honestly I still dont know any of their mechanics and I 1 shot them all. The last boss in the story should at least be a game breaker one that makes you scream at your monitor until your blue in the face. Then finally you get the mechanics down and win. But in the case of this game that simply isn't true whether that is to attend to the lesser skilled gamers or because they wanted to we will never know. But to me it hurt me I wanted a fight to be remembered but this was fights to be forgotten. The skill requirements for this game are low the only challenge is nerg and that is easy once you learn the mechanics. Now that I am into the more difficut monsters I hope to see improvements if I dont see them I will eventually seek more difficult games rather than time wasters.The load times and graphics are absolutely amazing. I can load a map in the space of 5 seconds without a SD card. But I am running a 1060 and a i5 so it is on the higher end of average. Whether it hurts the game in anyway for having less than that I am simply unable to say. But for the most part it seems very optimized I have only had FPS lag once and that was out of the blue. So I have nothing more to give on this.Right now to the end result. The game is a grind but not a massive one finding a weapon is hard but you will eventually find your favorite and main it. the monsters are fun and difficut right until the 3 elders and the final boss then its like playing a hack and slash without any extra mechanics. And the variety of things you can do to improve gear weapons and utilities during fights is respectable leaving me to give a simple answer.This game is well worth the money and time (ignoring the fact that multiplayer needs repairing). So if you can look past the issues or are willing to wait I will highly reccomend the game to you. But don't expect an intense game with high difficulty. Just expect a reasonably hard game with fun encounters and an enjoyable past time of farming and aiming for your end game goals. If the price is too high for you then dont worry this game will be here for a while and you can easily wait until it goes on sale or reduces its price a little. All in all an amazing game I had and am having great fun and hope many others will do and are doing so too. Just ensure that you have self control otherwise you will find yourself spending far too long on the game and end up destroying your daily routine and going to work tired.Thank you for your time and happy gaming.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Amazing game would give it 10/10 if not for it being a rough as guts port to PC. When using melee weapons I just connect up my controller and it runs smooth as butter. When using ranged weapons however I want to use keyboard and mouse and the whole thing the bed. You can only keybind things as if your using a controller so the same button does up to 5 different things depending on the state of my character.

2018-08-11,0,0,441,False,Recommended,After playing every other monster hunter game in the series with over 1000 hours easy on monster hunter unite alonethis is the monster hunter i have been waiting for here is why most people will not appreciate this game as much as a series fan will.To me this is the FINAL FANTASY/DARK SOULS combo ive loved for many years1.Zone loading.Imagine this every zone that you go through there is a loading page you must sit through acident or not this is a major change to me and i love it. no more being knocked or rolling by accident into another zone dreading that the monster doesnt hit you when you load back in2. Drop in and drop out multiplayer.OMFG i cant take hearing from people how the servers are it honestly makes me want to throw a dung bomb in their faces because they have no idea how big of a change this is to the series. YES this is having some major issues now but to me this is dream come true even if a player does drop out you are still able to continue the quest and have them rejoin!(ps i have found the best work around for finding your friends and joining their games is to start the game in your own online session and than going to the notice board to join their session. not sure why this works but there is an issue with joing straight from the main menu right now. youre welcome.)3. User friendly. This game will point out everything to you heck... for the first time ever there is a forced tutorial.. ill be walking around an fireflys will point out every item you pass instead of having to look for a physichal crack in the wall to mine of hope that a bush will provide bugs for you (love how you actually grab bugs off the surface) tracking a monster is a little annoying sometimes but im getting used to it.4. Chanhging gear mid quest. This part is so amazing i misspelled the title part on purpose! finaly you can go into a mission and have the option to change your gear mid game to suit the needs of your situation and team mates. i will change between guns and long swords even the hunting horn u used to HATE it now something i enjoy using in this version of monster hunter.5. The enviroment. EVERYTHING LOOKS AMAZING!!! you can swing from trees jump off walls grapple onto bugs on trees kick a frog that will parylize the enemy DAM like.. its so fluid and you feel like you are a true hunter instead of relying on your own provisions you can use your knowledge of the enviroment to aid your quest!These are just 5 reasons to grab this adventure of a lifetime. i didnt even mention DAMAGE INDICATORS or TURF WARSCapcom i love you so much for making this series i have started streaming this on my twitch page (https //www.twitch.tv/asideofbread) i bought a cable from japan so i could stream my psp screen playing monster hunter unite it took 3 weeks to arrive! i can honestly say i will be following this game till the day i die.few Glitches and tips i have found.*players cant join from menu (as i said above there is a way around this for now)*pukie pukie gets caught in vines. now i dont know if that is intentional but when they fly away they glitch on the vines &gt D *WHY THE DOES MY PALICO GO RUNNING TO THE BOOK GIRL AND NOT ME WHEN WE MEET UP?? i feel like a horrible owner is there some way you can put a pet feature in for the palico? or i can give them a treat? i want to let them know they are appreicated &lt /3*push to talk would be nice as there is no way to adjust my mic input in game and if i turn it off i cant hear anybody talking to me which kinda sucks cuz voice chat is an amazing feature*key bindings are totally welcome i just upgraded my mouse it has buttons i just dont have a use for them in game i would like to...

2018-08-11,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Amazing game a real good challenge at times and a blast to play with friends. There s so much to do no two hunts are the same and the weapon choice is huge. If you re not expecting 60fps at max settings on a 4 year old pc performance should be fine too. Like others have said there s some graphical tweaks that will help boost performance significantly as well. Of course there s a few quality of life issues that will hopefully be worked on over time but the game plays absolutely great regardless.

2018-09-03,0,0,87,False,Recommended,An amazing game although the lack of postgame content and fewer large monsters in base game do leave me somewhat wanting. Promised future updates should sate these needs as they're gradually released. Server issues present at launch seem to have been completely fixed which was one of my main issues with the experience. While others have reported issues with performance (specifically low framerates) I haven't had any such issues running the game on a Best Buy toaster.First timers may be put off by the difficulty and grinding aspects of the game however those new players willing to stick with the game after its initial barrier will be granted one of the most rewarding satisfying experiences in gaming. Veterans are sure to be pleased as the classic gameplay remains intact with some spectacular quality of life fixes although hardcore fanatics will be disappointed with the lack of G Rank and somewhat lower quantity of large monsters as I was.Monster Hunter World certainly lived up to the hype it built up (and I would say even further beyond that!).tl dr 7/10 needs more content,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-26,0,0,205,False,Recommended,The Game MH fans deserveRemember when you were young playing your favorite game? You see it as if it looks so damn impressive but it actually doesn't. This game is a perfect representation of what my young eyes saw on the PSP game Monster Hunter Freedom Unite in which i spent hundreds of hours on when i was in highschool. Monster Hunter World brought my young self's imagination to life. The world feels so alive and you can see every element of the game interacting with each other. Monsters never felt more believable and unique and how the devs put so much effort on the little details that make them feel so real. The weapons never felt so hard hitting and every weapon type have thier own viability strengths and weaknesses that can support so many playstyles MHW is welcoming enough for new players to get into the game but is also deep enough for veteran MH players to still be surprised of how much new stuff has been added in. The online systems though not the best in all the games right now is the best online system any Monster Hunter game ever had. I am aware that it doesnt work for alot of people but when it works it works you know? It just works. Its fairly easy to find pickup games and farm up what you need by joining into other player's hunts. Its also pretty easy to find people who will join your hunt through the SOS system ( given that your quest has good rewards that is). Gitting Gud is a big part of the game and the difficulty of this game is not for the faint hearted. But even though the game is reasonably difficult going solo is very forgiving compared to past games due to how monsters scale when going into a quest alone. So thats one more freedom the game offers tackling hunts with a team does not make hunts too easy and going solo doesnt make it too hard either. Its not the perfect balance but you know It works.This game is how I saw Monster Hunter when i was young and i am very pleased of how the devs made this into a reality.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,33,False,Recommended,I am a casual gamer playing with mouse and keyboard. Amazing Graphics don't concern me nor does Denuvo so long as my game runs. Keep that in mind.So far I'm really pleased with my game. That said I find listing negatives far more important than listing positives so this review IS going to sound overly negative despite my recommendation.Biggest gripe so far Lack of skippable cutscenes This doesn't concern me for first time playthroughs but starting a second file and having to slog through an hour or more of cutscenes and tutorials is annoying. And if you try to rush through it already knowing where you have to go you'll likely have to backtrack back to your companion so they can tell you something.Controls Overall I'm okay with the mouse and keyboard defaults but it's definitely not perfect. Also if you're using mouse and keyboard like me I highly suggest using a mouse with a fourth button. I currently do not have one but I think I would have a much easier time if I did as currently my mouse thumb is sitting around being useless while most of my left fingers have to jump to multiple buttons depending on the situation. The main keys I'm not a fan of are aiming (holding v or tapping c) and the special button but I think a fourth mouse button would help alleviate at least one of those problems.Lack of a 'Pause' button when fighting alone This is a minor concern and I understand why it's not there in a game that has a big online aspect but as someone who plays alone 80% of the time it'd be nice to have an option to pause in case I have to go do something quick.Aside from the above I've had no problems so far. I'm using a new Dell G7 laptop (1060 Graphics Card) and I've had no problem with framerate. I've seen many complain about Motion Blur which I hadn't even noticed though I'm a sucker for having as many options as possible and I've heard people are getting motion sickness from it so they should allow people to turn that off.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,180,False,Recommended,Now I write this review to provide in the hopes of delievering a fair review to discuss the current state of Monster Hunter World.For an idea of a similiar game look to Dark Souls for combat and JRPGs for indepth mechanics and systems.Brief Description of the Game Monster Hunt World is what you can expect from the title alone a game where you hunt big monsters for fat loot. Loot that is used to hunt even bigger and meaner monsters. Though I admit the actual hunting part of it is more or less running around trying to find monster tracks it is a fun action RPG.Past Experience with the Series Having discovered Monster Hunter a little over two years ago with Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the 3DS I simply fell in love with the idea of just hunting large monsters. I got to G rank and hunt the baddest bads in that game truly a difficult challenge. I am no stranger to farming in games for materials as I did this for MMOs and other tedious games. Shortly after Monster Hunter Generations was announced I picked up that game aswell and progressed fairly far in that game.Now that I told you my previous experience with the game series I will atempt to explain why I found this game enjoyable and what I dislike about it. I have played the game before on the PS4 upon release back in January of 2018. My opinion may be a bit bias but at stated I will try to remain fair. Pros The Combat The combat in Monster Hunter has always been a bit sluggish in the way you input it but in Monster Hunter World I believe the combat is an improvement to the series. It is a lot more fast paced and fluid along with interesting combat techniques that can be performed with the various weapons. The ranged weapons used to be incredibly hard to use in pervious games but how they are now truly makes them feel like effective weapons. The enviroment also adds a layer of combat as you can leap off various ledges and grapple points. Along with a few parts of that you can destroy to either disrupt the monsters' movement or completely imobilize it. Monsters for the most part (except Kirin screw you lightning unicorn) are fair and challenging fights with enough varies in movesets to keep things interesting. The Enviroments/Visuals Now the visuals in this game are pretty not as much as an improvement I was expecting over the console version but still better. The world still looks great and feels living as opposed to the flat maps of previous games. There is a lot of additonaly things to learn in the maps that you wouldn't catch the first 10 times. RPG Systems Now I am not what you would consider and expert on the systems in Monster Hunter. I know the basics of most of the stats like affinity damage numbers sharpness ect. These systems however offer a depth to the gameplay in optimizing a build for yourself or several builds to better play your strengths and protect your weaknesses against certain monsters. Subjective Points Co Op/MultiplayerNow this part of the gameplay is subjective and entirely based on personal player experiences. If you have friends who can find a game like this enjoyable and are able to learn the game you can have plenty of fun in this. As this game is basically you versus a boss monster in the name of loot. When the multiplayer is working (a point for later.) the game is quite enjoyable as you and your friends can strategize for taking down the monsters. Although when joining random games people tend to either be ignorant and focus simply on kiling the monster as fast as possible or are just there to mooch off your hard work as more players means more health for the monster. Take this part with a grain of salt. Cons Performance issues galore Like most reviews for this game in it's current state as of 8/12/18 the game is riddled with many performance issues. The fact the game eats up your CPU usuage more than any other game has any right to be (this is coming from a guy who put 300+ mods on skyrim while watching youtube videos). Along with constant frame drops for apparent reason. My computer would be considered either above average or high tier gaming PC. Running this game has been irritating time to time as I had a view random crashes (two so far out of 34 hours) and frames dropping to 40 45 frames. I understand this game is a port but they should have at least attempted a public beta to gather information better. Needs more diverse monsters Now this was an issue at the launch of the console versions of Monster Hunter World there just isn't enough monstes. Most of the monsters spew fire whiich results in resistance which results in fire weapons dealing overall less damage than other weapons. That alreadly limits your arsenal. Several of the monsters are just variants of previous monsters I.E. the subspecies monsters where they only have added difficulty. I'd prefer more monsters with more elemental types to gain the use of various weapons. There is only one monster in the game that actually uses ice attacks. Also choosing to launch this game as a slightly updated release version of MH W was a mistake in my opinion as you now have to wait more time to get this game caught up on the update schedule of the console version. This is personally one of the biggest faults in the game. Constant disconnects Now I understand this may be being fixed at the time of writing this but as of right now joining an online lobby is almost impossible for most people. I can't join friends for the most part as the servers do not allow me to connect and joining random hunts is not even possible. This is hurting the game and its community currently. Final Thoughts So is Monster Hunter World worth a buy on PC? In my honest opinion if you have a decent computer don't mind 30 FPS and can deal with a few issues here and there go ahead. The game runs fine for the most part when playing single player as you don't have to worry about disconnects or additonals people for your computer to keep track of. This game is fun the combat is fun for each weapon and I will continue to play it when I can. As of right now though veterans will enjoy it if they push themselves for it but casual players will have a lot of trouble learning this game. The issues are simply stacked too high for them to be ignored. TL DR Buy it if you want a fun monster hunting experience in a single player manner don't but it if you want to play multiplayer until the bugs are fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,In a game that's all about fighting monsters one would think that the combat system would be great. Unfortunately this is far from the case. This game has one of the most unpolished clunky combat systems I've ever experienced. Why?1. There is no strafing2. The targeting system is utter garbage.3. Combos is simply a matter of spamming 2 buttons in various orders.4. The camera is 5. You can get knockdowns/stuns that last what feels like forever. Seriously if you get knocked down you might as well go make a coffe or dinner and by the time you're back you might have recovered. I had 100% hp and got hit 4 times and died because I lost control of the character and couldn't move in between the attacks. 6. Your weapons wear out extremely quickly forcing you to use the Whetstone time and time again during the fight in order to do decent damage.7. I've done the 8 first monsters and they were all the same. Spam your 2 buttons while evading every now and then.If you're a true monster hunter fan you might enjoy this but for people like me who play this as their first game in the series it's a big let down. This game does not hold up to modern AAA standards by any means.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but impossible to play online with your friends since you continue to lose connection from servers every 5 minutes. Absolutely terrible connection server needs a fix asap. Also it is the hardest thing to setup to start an assigned quest and find a way to make all of your friends also join the quest. Terrible settings and multiplayer setup. If you're going to release it on PC atleast make it playable as multiplayer but instead it has both a terrible server connection problem and a terrible system to setup for multiplayer to play with your friends.Also fix mouse input delay and fixed camera movement spped. Shows Capcom did a stupidly lazy PC port. Keyboard and Mouse controls feels terrible.Can't recommend until these problems are fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,9,False,Recommended,As a returning player from MHF2 and the original MH from the ps2 glory days I have to say this is the most accesible and player friendly edition to date. The combat is leagues above any MH to date with correct hitboxes and fluid controls never at any point did I feel cheated out of a hit or rage at a monster that somehow managed to hit me despite being nowhere near it as that no longer exists. Every hitbox on each monster seems to fit exactly what you see on the monster so no more dodging a charge and still getting hit because you were 100 pixels in range of its leg.Graphics wise this game is beautiful I can just about run this at high settings and quite frankly it is still stunning to look at compared to previous editions. There were a few hitches here and there where the frame rate tanked in the middle of a fight though this lasted for a few seconds before it picked back up to between 40 60fps. Everything is player friendly right from the get go with constant tips and hints as well as button guides for each weapon displayed on screen. There's a tracking system in place to help you find the monsters as well as any materials in the field in the shape of scoutflies which will fly to whatever you're hunting at that point. The whole menu system is fluid and easy to read as well as understand for example the armory has a tech tree for every weapon and will tell you exactly what you need so you can plan out your weapon progression.Only downside so far is the appalling lack of multiplayer not once have I been able to connect to a game so I've been forced to battle monsters by myself. This I have no problem with as it increases the challenge and thus makes it more fun but it would be nice to be able to connect to other players and go out hunting together. Though this I'm sure capcom will fix ASAP as it is letting down the game by quite a bit.All in all I would get this maybe not at full price but it is still worth getting and blows any older MH game out of the water.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-03,0,0,48,False,Recommended,TL DR Worth getting if you're a fan of earning gear in games and enjoy Dark Souls combat.(+) Combat is generally satsifying and challenging.(+) Great gear progression system that really elevates the combat as well.(+) Playing online with randoms is pretty simple and fast.( ) Playing online with friends is pointlessly clunky and overall poorly designed.( ) Story and voice acting are pretty weak though it doesn't really matter too much in a game like this.( ) Inconsistent graphics some things are rendered beautifully some look like skyrim rocks. I'm pretty surprised by the mixed reviews for this game. Runs well and looks good on my PC with an i5 970x and 8 gb of ram.Positives As far as the game itself goes it's pretty addicting. I really like the way you build gear in this game where you need to break certain parts of a monster's body to get specific pieces. The gameplay is very dark souls like (though what isn't these days P) which means there's a lot of learning patterns and dodging at the right times. The fights themselves can be pretty tough which makes hunting some of the harder ones a lot more satisfying when you beat em. The portion of the online that works well is the SOS flare system which makes joining random people's games and random people joining your game pretty straightforward and quick all things considered. I have not had any random disconnects or lag the online has seemed to have solid server strength (maybe just for me I'm on west coast).Negatives With some of the harder fights while satisfying to come out on top the lengthiness of the encounters can be pretty extreme at points. Some monsters take 20 30 minutes to kill depending on what playstyle you're going for which is definitely too much time to commit to one enemy. The story and voice acting are cringe worthy but you kind of expect that in a game like this so it's not a huge deal. And the most commonly voiced negative opinion of this game has to do with the online system which I can mostly agree with. The core faults of the online really boil down to the clunkiness of the system and the pointless complication of playing with your friends. Inviting a friend to your online session then starting a quest then progressing alone until you finish all the cutscenes of the quest then having your friend join from your online session wait 5 minutes for them to load in and get to you then fight a single monster together to repeat the process later. That's pretty dumb regardless of your overall opinion of the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-03,0,0,199,False,Recommended,I got this game for the PC even though I'm MH Rank 100 something on the PS4. I wanted to see the difference you know the pros and cons. Only played this game on the PC for 2 hours and I'm loving it. More stream lined. Graphics are improved but not by much but the biggest pro that I'm seeing is the load time. My hunt loads and I can click almost instantly to go to the hunt.This game has a grind to it and if you don't like it then I wouldn't suggest it. I don't mind it because there's that feeling of accomplishment that goes along with it. Monsters that you initially say I'm staying far away from become the monsters that you want to put on the endangered list because of the gear you can craft with parts that you get from them. The game always updates and has new quests every once and a while. I don't mind paying twice for a good game and this is a good game. Only con that I see in this game is that I am unable to transfer my save from my PS4 but at least with the fresh start I can set some things that are permanent like the name for my cat which I misspelled on the PS4. All and all There's going to be a lot of time put on this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,206,False,Recommended,So I came from dauntless after putting 15 20 hours in and after playing MH W for 10 hours I doubt I d ever be able to go back.Pros Overall good graphic quality the maps are so well done there s no dodgy hit boxes on the maps lighting and environment feel are really nice Enjoyable combat after the first few behemoths of which are purely what I d call tutorial level difficulty the monsters start getting more advanced and the fights become less about dealing damage and more about taking less damage. This gives for a dark souls style combat with less dodging and more slashing. Loot system is very good with multiple different drops for each broken part on a monster and heaps of avaliability with map materials makes for less grinding more playing. The idea that your herbs are automatically crafted into potions is brilliant and so on. Armor and weapons styles are great the styles easily being linked to where they came from and the way that weapons are upgraded gives a sense of progression for the limited abount of grinding The challenge provided is rewarding whether it s getting a new weapon or defeating a monster the game feels like you actually get rewarded for completing tough challenges.Cons Some behemoth attacks don t line up with their hitboxes causing for some frustrating failures however almost every attack is memorisable and can be avoided. Playing with 3 players seems unbalanced playing with 2 and 4 players feels easier even playing solo does. Not casual friendly. If you re not looking at this game as a potentially dedicated player I wouldn t buy it straight up if your even slightly hesitant I wouldn t buy it as the gameplay is not designed for someone who doesn t live for this genre.Overall I d give this a 8.5/10 and say that if you know you ll enjoy this game then just buy it or at least wait for a sale it s the best opportunity to really dive into this sort of gameplay that you ll ever get. For those who aren t so sure about their dedication I d recommend to start by trying dauntless as the game feels similar but with less content and is also free. It gives a great idea of what monster hunter is like while not even getting close to the quality but if you re still not looking to pay the price for MH W then dauntless should serve you just fine.UPDATE After another 100 hours the game has gotten much more grindy but the gameplay content is still there playing solo isn't as enjoyable as with friends but the quality is still there the port is still a bit rough but since the gameplay has managed to keep me the most indecisive game chooser playing past storyline I am going to up my rating from an 8.5 to a 9.5/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,"I have never played any of the games from the MH series and approached this title without having seen a lot of spoilers. I waited a few days before purchasing because truth be told this would not be my first choice of genre and only did so because several friends jumped in before I did. I was aware of the already negative reviews and wanted to see for myself what the fuss was about. I am now roughly 35 hours in and this is the feedback I will leave for now Overall I feel that the game is fun at its core. It's repetitive and grindy but not worse than some RPGs/MMOs I have played in the past. There is a number of features that is added to the game as you progress through the campaign and overall I feel like I get my bang for my buck *when the game works*.You can play the game as a single player and there are several multiplayer functions available. Solo the game runs well on my system. My machine is high end ish (1080ti 16gb i7 7700k) so the game runs pretty well at maximum details in 2k resolution. A lot of people have complained about not being able to adjust some of the graphics related options (motion blur etc) I can't say it bothers me the game looks pretty nice as is and I usually only adjust the presets of my monitor for gamma / brightness etc. I haven't had a single hardware related crash nor black screen freeze etc. The game seems to be pretty stable for me. The other detail mentioned in many of the reviews is mouse acceleration being locked once again I can't say it bothers me as I play with an xbox one controller and it works really well. I play every single game I own with kb / mouse but it felt more natural to play with a controller.Now I did buy the game to play with friends and this is where it gets bad. It is not possible for me to stay connected to the game servers longer than 5 minutes. I have tried creating games joining friends joining random online sessions. Sometimes I even get disconnected at title screen. Most of my friends have the same issue and we have different ISPs. There seems to be some kind of communication bug between Valve's servers and MHW game servers / login servers. As soon as I join a MP session (or create one) MHW seems to sign me out from Steam's servers. I do not get any notification that I am offline from steam itself but if I go to the store page I can see that I need to ""sign in"" again to be able to leave a comment. MHW gives the network error mentioned in so many of the negative reviews ( you are not connected to steam basically not that you are not connected to the internet).We were able to play together a few times but networking has been pretty nightmarish at this point and most of my friends would be asking for a refund if they could. Overall we all feel a bit frustrated. If you are a new buyer be aware before making a purchase The game in itself is pretty fun beautifully made and overall bug free. Cinematics can not be skipped in any way. If you are like me and spend 30 minutes on character creation alone be aware that you will have to wait another 30 minutes after that to be able to get a rough idea of the game before you are unable to refund. I find this a bit sketchy and I am not one to refund games constantly and for no reason. The game is great solo but unplayable for many of us in multiplayer.I recommend this game to people wanting to play solo.If you want to play with friends I would recommend that you wait as you will (most likely) not be able to play with anyone else.A shame really it's a pretty fun game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-28,0,0,684,False,Recommended,Most of the negative reviews were at launch and have to do with two issues that weren't really the fault of Capcom.Connection problems This was caused by the new Steam UI/Friends list update. The update happened far too late for Capcom to have enough time to smooth out any issues.Save game corruption After beating the final boss a number of users reported getting crashes and having the game stall when they tried to reload giving the appearance of a corrupted save. This was caused by codec issues on the user's machine what was happening was when the game was reloaded it'd try to play the ending cutscene but because the codec was missing it'd stall making it seems like the save file was bust.That being said there were/are more legitimate issues such as blurry low res textures and certain graphical effects causing fps drops.

It's practiacally glitch free. It runs at a solid 30 60 fps. The gameplay is excellent and is really great for first time monster hunter players. It has beautiful graphics. And it is overall the best Monster Hunter game. And I can tell even though I've only play this game for a few hours.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,29,False,Recommended,Awesome game. Fun to play with others Options for Armor and Weapon sets are endless I have always been a Moster Hunter Fan and had all the Monster Hunter Games for PSP back in the day. PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT CRASHES AND OTHER ISSUES NEED A BETTER PC I'M RUNNING THIS ITS HIGHEST SETTINGS IN 1080P ON MY LAPTOP ASUS STRIX GL702V INTEL I7 7TH GEN NVIDEA GTX 1070 8GB 12GB RAM GSYNC ENABLED 4K ENABLED VR ENABLED.

2018-08-10,0,0,174,False,Recommended,"(Early review Update to follow)TL DR good game worth the price has areas to improveAs I'm writing this the current review status is ""Mixed"" and it's a shame as (imo) it does not reflect the overall quality and fun this game has to offer hence this review.The game apparently has a few ""gamebreaking"" problems as reported by some players preventing them from playing the game.So far I did not encounter any such issues. No ctd black screen controls work both with keyboard and ps4 etc. The games runs smooth at max graphics 60fps+ (2560x1080 resolution didn't try 4k yet)As a reference here are my specs Windows 7 i7 4790k nvidia 1070ti 32gb ramGameplay Very fun to but still too early in the game to properly assess. (update to follow) Things to improve (mostly cosmetic) Although these are by no means deal breakers here are some areas Capcom should really address as soon as they're done dealing with the game breaking problems certain users are facing. (Perhaps us pc gamers have too high expectations but for many the higher quality expected from pc releases is the reason why we wait for certain games to be ported instead of buying them on consols early) Resolution If you're still playing on a 16 9 resolution you're missing out but this won't affect you. The lack of a 21 9 option (or higher) is a bit disapointing for a AAA big developper like Capcom. Most games have this by default now (as it is not a complex featuer to add) including Indy devs emulated games and such with a much smaller budget... This oversight on their part and the fact that fans have to build mods to bypass this is underwhelming.FOV options would be good too being able to see slightly more around me when surrounded by a bunch of dino'ish monsters could be very helpful to avoid death'ish. Texture and visual effects Most of the time the game look great especially during action scenes where you don't really have the time to really pay attention to minute details around you but in many instances it really shows that this was made and optimised for consols.It does not appear that they made much change between the ps4/xbox version and this pc release.Maybe take example on lets say...FFXV pc options high rez texture pack bloom light shafts ambiant oclusion and such would be a welcomed addition.After spending probably way too much time on my char creation I was a bit sad when I realised that in game it barely looked the same and most of my fine tuning to get it just right didn't change much. Having the option to change the texture resolution of the character (closer to cut scene or char creation page quality) would be nice. Controllers This might have to do with my steam setting (although I doubt it) but when using a PS4 controller having the correct button icon would be ghelpful instead of the Xbox ones. By now I'm mostly used to it but every now and then I get a brain fart and when I think/see ""X"" I end up dodge rolling instead of using my potion &amp vice versa...Since this was a PS4 release this shouldn't be much of an issue unlike certain games that were only on Xbox prior to pc port. More to come... (maybe)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,146,False,Recommended,As my first Monster Hunter game I was a initially hesitant to give this a try. However now I can say that this is one of the few games I can honestly say is worth the price. In an age of free to play games and microtransactions Monster Hunter World gives much needed relief without having any microtransactions at all. While there are DLC that give you additional gestures or skins they're purely cosmetic. With a story that took me upwards of 100 hours to complete while taking my time and enjoying the scenery. While the story isnt great in itself it serves as a good way to help you progress through the different bosses of the game. And post story gameplay has tons of content with stronger bosses better looking armor and even new utility items to really let you continue this adventure for as long as you desire. 10/10 Easily a contender for best game of the year.

2018-08-19,0,0,34,False,Recommended,"MH W is a great game in short(Note i also own the PS4 version)As a Veteran of the Franchise since ye old PS2 days i was optimistic for finaly getting a Monster Hunter back on a TV screen &amp Capcom delieverd. Game is much more "" beginner"" friendly which i had a hard time at first but got used to it &amp appriciate the Changes so New players get easier in the Complex Concept of what MH is.Grafics Are the best i ve seen sofar. My game runs on High settings with constant 60 frames ( exept when Bazel decides to show up &amp Bomb the entire screen then it stutters just slightly). Great Loading time( PS4 takes 1 2 Minutes to load while PC litarly takes mostly liek 5 sec). Could have used some more FOV settings &amp some more finetuning setups. But for what it has it s atleast on par with PS4Pro Grafics if not even above.Gameplay Simplyfied yet Complex or easy to learn hard to master. The game sure got ""nerfed"" down for new players &amp u can see that. No Whetstone farming anymore (thank god) no Paintballing Monsterto track them(ok) no separated Areas but 4 overall Maps without loading times inside of them just to name a few changes. However the Scoutflies do there Job pretty good (unless there drunk again). Crafting system is easy to understand &amp all the Monster behave unique ly exept for some ""Copy"" versions of Monster. All Weapons are Good &amp no the Hunting Horn can kick seriouse Butt if u know how to play. It s basicly a Buffhammer. But in the beginning Bows &amp Dual Blades sure have it harder to down Monster but they get Stronger by each Hunt. Tracking Monster Fottprints &amp other "" Leftovers"" gets easy of the hand &amp takes no time at all. Maps are litered with stuff to Collect ( Herbs Honey Minerals Bones etc) &amp are well places in the Maps.Multiplayer And here is the big Issue i have with the game. Multiplayer in itself would be fine if... u could connect to friends easier. ( the PC Version is currently riddled with bugs &amp crashes &amp other stuff). However if u can look past the Connection issues that the game currently has the Multiplayer works Fine once ur actual in game with friends Or Randos. The other Big Problem is connecting to Friends. On Ps4 u can make Squads which basicly works as a guild system where only u &amp ur friends can be in a session. On PC we get connect to friend( which means a friend has to be either in an open Lobby or make A private one) &amp if the Open lobby is full or he isnt online there is no ""gathering"" Lobby where each of ur friends can connect to.For now atleast i wont judge the game on its Connection issues so the game gets a pass till the "" online Patch"".Overall I personly like the game alot. It has issues from not enough monsters ( atleast for release but Capcom promised to put more in over time). Once u get past the Story the game gets slower &amp makes u repeat alot to increase Hunter Rank &amp throws just Powered up( basicly more health) Monsters at u. New Players will be ofc overwhelmed by the amount of craftable items u need to actual work in High Rank &amp above. The Online portion is currently a Russian Roulette. And lastly i can see alot of ""casuals"" getting bored real fast on how grindy it is.But all those Negatives don t face me because i love teh Franchise since the beginning &amp with World Capcom has Outdone itself in the Franchise. So i will stay &amp play till the next MH will show up &amp if asked i recommend this game for everyone who likes Big Swords Big Monsters &amp being a Badass.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-01,0,0,348,False,Recommended,"Alright 180 hours is enough to qualify for a review yes?I've played Monster Hunter for years and I've enjoyed many iterations of it. MH World brings it all to the console and PC and I love alot of what it has to offer.The best part of the game is the combat that's unique to MH. The weight of your attacks stunning of enemies and now the destruction of the environment really makes this game a hunt as opposed to typical action game beat 'em up. To add to that this game has a much better incline in mission content compared to most. Not alot of Gathering Missions in the beginning with super low rank enemies like a Great Jaggras being the wall to sotp you from going up in hunter rank. Now you got big game all over the field and no loading zones to save you. Its great. The variety of weapons in the game (14 of them) give you truly uniquely playstyles to home in on. Some really shine in a multiplayer setting which others can redefine how simple a boss is in a solo run.The downside comes from near endgame as with most games of the live service variety. The content in game can prove to be challenging on the way up the ranks but somewhere after HR49's climactic Tempered Kirin Fight content hits a slow drag to the next big thing. If you have what you need there's little to do besides join SOS calls. From HR49 to HR 100 you have nothing on your agenda except perfecting your loadout gathering materials for your weapons between missions and maybe whenever the emergencies show up. The promised expansions and collaborative content to come is certainly on the way but the ""expedited"" half of that promise is to be seen. If we're ever to catch up with the console players we should be getting the content one after the next if not overlapping so that we have adequate time to do said missions and get to pick up the pace too.Perhaps I'm a tad impatient since we already had to wait for the PC release which now bleeds into the bonus content. Not sure. But I do know that even with that this is stilla damn good game.P.S. The preformance issues of the game aren't as prevailant for me besides the Capcom logo occasionally eating pavement without actually crashing. Otherwise it's fine.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'm playing the game fine on low settings and getting around 40 58. Very rarely drop below 40. About the control I think its not bad just need to get used to it. I played on PSP and 3DS before this so I know how the control differs but for me its not unbearable. After awhile you'll get used to using keyboard and mouse. If not get a controller.Gameplay is same as previous ones I guess. Not much to talk about. A few useful features for me like tracking monsters detailed maps that shows resources and other little imorovement. I only got a few hours game time as of now because I'm not at home for two days but I think its good enough. Honestly I didn't even think I would be able to run this even on low settings but seems its alright.

2018-08-10,0,0,144,False,Recommended,Gameplay You slay monsters turn their body parts in to gear then go back and smack the monsters again with their dead relatives desicrated corpse. Combat is reminiscent of Dark Souls where you need to learn the monsters pattern and press the attack at the right moment. There are 12 different weapons that all have their own unique machanic and can be upgraded in a variety of ways. There are loads of different armor sets that can be mixed and matched to counter monsters strengths. And there is a variety of items that can be collected to be used to craft potions bombs ammo and traps. Overall it's a lot of fun with enough content to keep you engaged for many hours.Story Its okay. Nothing spectacular but I do find it better than many japanese games I have played recently. My two biggest complaints are the horrible lip syncing and the fact your character is perpetually silent.Graphics and Preformance I have an i7 8700k GTX 1080 16gb RAM and I play on 1440p resolution. I max all settings except the volumetric fog setting and play at a stable 60 70 fps. With lower end hardware more settings will need dropped to hit 60fps. I find the game quite beautiful. According to some people there are some bad textures compared to the PS4 version. While this may be true I find it to be a non issue. The game is still pretty and runs okay. Load time are also very fast. Overall graphics could be better but they are not bad.Controls Mouse and keyboard controls work well enough but they can feel clunky at first. I played about 10 hours with mouse and keyboard and never experianced any unplayable moments. I then switched to an XBOX controller and found it to be superior in certain aspects specifically radial menu use and targeting. The controller feels better overall but I think this comes down to Monster Hunter being built from the ground up as a console game.Multiplayer It can be a major pain to try and get multiplayer to work. I seem to be kicked from lobbies at seemingly random times. Sometimes it wont even let me join a match due to some error. I expect this to be fixed in the future but for the time being it's probably the biggest issue the game currently suffers from.DRM Denuvo is used. It forces you to use an internet connection in order to even play the game. I hear it potentially even slows down preformance but I am not positive. Anti consumerism at its finest.Conclusion Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game at its core however the bad multiplayer experiance and use of anti consumer DRM can cause issues. The multiplayer will almost certainly be addressed in the future so it should only bother people soon after launch (atleast one would expect this to be the case). Sadly Denuvo is an issue PC gamers will most likey have to learn to deal with as the industry does not seem likely to stop using it. While the graphical preformance could be better it by no means ruins the game like some people insist. This game is definatly worth $60.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Just like Dark Souls japanese games don't work well with keyboard and mouse they don't understand how they work so don't expect it to work. Get an xbox controller get a steam controller get a ps4 controller just get any controller and you'll be happy.The graphics are both amazing and terrible at the same time with some texture work being laughably bad but the overall look and feel of the world is great.The gameplay is deep and challenging and you'll be rewarded for your perservance.I haven't had any connectivity issues but I wouldn't be surprised it's the first few days after launch and there are over 300k+ concurrent users on steam for it I pity their network and infra engineers. The ps4 version had some network issues to start with as well and they got ironed out It's a major release and it'll be resolved soon enough if there are issues.Do you like grindy games like warframe? Do you like fighting and riding giant dinosaur like creatures with your mates? Do you like not having your hand held to find out about a game (though it's a lot more forgiving and helping than earlier titles)? Do you like gameplay that is gonna take you forever to master? Get this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,118,False,Recommended,This is a fresh take of the Monster Hunter franchise that I know some people have been begging for now available for the PC. In terms of barebone mechanics it's very similar to all the previous titles with mounting still returning from MH4U. A lot of new and user friendly features were added with a huge amount of options at your disposal making this instalment feel like anyone from fresh hunters to veterans can pick up and enjoy. The cast of new monsters while I was initially disappointed with when they were revealed definitely feel like a part of the core Monster Hunter series. On top of that returning monsters like Rathian are improved having better telegraphs and smooth animations. This in combination with the seamless world full of life and color make gathering and exploring actually fun for once. The game can become very CPU and GPU intensive but I have rarely had any issues with stutter using an Intel Core i7 7700HQ and Nvidia GTX 1060. I haven't had much online play so far but the few times I have the hunting has been smooth and without disconnects.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Great game with lots of content. Some may be pushed away by the grind but its all opinion. The graphics are quite good love that there is always stuff to do. Also very relaxed atmosphere in my opinion. Ive waited for this game to be released on PC since it was first shown in trailers and now here I am loving it. Right now since it just came out its experiencing network issues like almost every other game first days of launch but i dont mind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,60,False,Recommended,the short part of the review you need to see as a standalone game monhun world is damn good if you like monster hunter. if you like monhun you should own this on PC or console. because if you don't do you even like monhun or is that something you tell your friends to sound cool?also world is a casual monster hunter game. for casuals.it's still monster hunter and it's still really fun.but if you want seriously challenging hunts like stupid ukanlos G rank from 4u? you're not getting it here. wait for Generations ultimate on the switch or something.the rest of the review in no logical order because i don't care world's gameplay obviously differs and while it seems cheap to add in all these extra QoL things the only thing that makes the fights truly EZmode is your cat giving you free heals for free all the time without any input from the player at all.took some damage? nah you didn't here's that health back. also here's free health packs around the field that instantly heal you rather than having to wait out you chugging your potions.i love the grapple hook you can use on those bugs around coral highlands (once you get used to using them you'll save so much goddamn time you'd otherwise spend climbing vine walls) and the seed launchers are fair and useful as hell when you start remembering you actually have one. also while i initially complained about the item box being available mid hunt this saves you from cancelling a whole hunt because you left your other switch axe in the chest while fighting rathalos with a goddamn fire element swaxe. still being able to withdraw infinite health potions doesn't hurt because your cat is always giving you so many free heals i've yet to run out of potions mid hunt anyways.server issues at launch (as with most any multiplayer games nowadays) with people getting dropouts mid hunt on closed servers. whatever that was likely going to happen.not the best optimization as compared to other games nowadays i get far more frames on higher settings with other games compared to this one. who cares you won't die with a few frames dropped here or there. just enjoy the fun instead of getting worked up over things that don't matter. yeah it could and should be better and while capcom isn't new to pc monhun is so whatever.the pc release was delayed for an eternity because i don't know (seriously what the fug capcom). this is stupid and don't do this again or i'll REEEE louder than Legiana.tl dr 10/10 would buy again.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,131,False,Recommended,Its finally a Monster Hunter for PC with a European release T_TThus I am finally able to show some of the beauty of this magnificent gameseries to friends that do not own a 3ds (or were not interested in a game like this due to the small screen size of said 3ds).In my opinion The game is great and I recommend it. It runs smooth enough on my aged hardware.HOWEVER the online functionality is buggy at times (losing connection not being able to find friends etc.). Opening a new online session room (and restarting the game) usually fixed that problem for us.I hope these server/connectivity problems are fixed in the future. They are annoying but I still love the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,183,False,Recommended,Although the multiplayer component currently (at launch) presents technical issues I firmly believe this is the best iteration of the MH series so far.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,85,False,Recommended,Great fun! Some bugs with multiplayer currently though I've not run into anything like disconnects mid hunt and mouse controls are a little floaty. Neither is enough trouble to not recommend.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Probably just over a decade ago I played the first Monster Hunter on the PS2 and was absolutely enthralled by the playstyle and have since followed many of the titles from consoles to handhelds just to get a taste of some new monsters. This new installment of the game is phantasmal in my opinion. The new ability to join quests already in progress has completely eliminated the dreaded wait for other hunters while also having the ability to eat on the quest you can seemingly go from one quest to another without moving from the gate while still getting all the benefits.There are some connection issues so far but that's a little bit of both my system and the current state of the multiplayer however the search functions and multiplayer hubs have been an amazing experience in terms of finding hunters to team up with and gather some guild cards.Overall if you've played MH before you will very likely enjoy this title as it does a lot of what we wanted in the old games while adding new QOL features. If you are new the story will help you get into the game and will teach you how to hunt well and will be an amazing experience all the while through.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Tl dr framerates are inconsistent on every PC config doesn't perform how it should messy port great game.Monster Hunter is a great series I've only played 3 installments myself but loved every moment of each including this one but I can't help but think that the 6 months they put into porting this game were for nothing for were to make it from completely unplayable to playable at 45fps on average then called it a day.My specs are GTX 1080 i7 4790k 16GB RAM and i can't get this game to lock at 60fps at 1080p medium to high settings but I can get it to lock to 30fps a majority of the time at the same settings but 4K. I'm sure you can already see a glaring issue with that performance.First off don't believe the CPU requirements they mean absolutely nothing. Battlefield 1 GTAV and Far Cry 5 use more cpu than this game. This game averages 56% of all cores at any time with 5 chrome tabs open in the background and whatever background processes I had.Second go in with expectations of never getting a 60fps lock. Even at low on a 1060 you can kiss that goodbye but the framerate never dips into truly unplayable territory unless you have a lower end system.Third some settings don't work at the writing of this review. Texture resolutions aren't displaying at the best they can screens scape reflections doesn't really do anything water reflections are broken performance differences between some settings don't make sense like High shadows compared to low shadows is almost minimal on average about 3fps in most scenes for me. A rig of this level of hardware shouldn't be struggling to play this game at low at 1080p 60fps locked 24/7 (not including loading spikes) and struggling to keep above 40fps at 1440p medium settings. At 1440p during the rain and end of a fight I experienced a drop to 37fps while that entire fight was about 45 50fps. Like I said it's playable especially with a 30fps cap but this isn't what I should be experiencing along with many others.But all that aside.. this is a fantastic game I'm enjoying every moment of it the game (While not the prettiest) has its moments where it's absolutely beautiful at 4K with many bright colours. It's just an extremely fun game and I want to recommend it so i will but if you are scared of the performance issues I really recommend you skip it for now until it's (Hopefully) fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,354,False,Recommended,Bought it for PS4 and PC. Enjoying it more on PC because the load times are so so much shorter (even than PS4 Pro) a 20 30 second load time on PS4 is now under 5 seconds for a new hunt and almost instant loads going into smaller areas like the player house. I do have the game installed on an SSD.I haven't had any issues with optimization running at max settings and having a great time. Some server stability issues (I've lost connection during 2 out of 50+ quests) but that's not a huge surprise for launch weekend with 300k people playing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,187,False,Recommended,I recommend this game because it's awesome and truly amazing game design but try to get it on sale because the port over to PC was definitely a budget job and CAPCOM could have done so much better w/ it.Ports glaring issues No wide screen support.Forced motion blur and DOF.The keyboard &amp mouse controls seem oddly inconsistent at times.Inconsistent frames and performance (might be caused by Denuvo piracy protection).Also the servers seem to have pretty awful bugs that have been around even since console release.Sometimes a session will randomly become bugged and you can no longer join any session member's quest (which sucks because they have to restart the quest if they want to leave the bugged session so that you can join them).Occassionally the servers will just kick you out or simply not let you in.ALSO I still haven't received my pre order bonus in game which was only useful for the beginning of the game in the first place so that's nice.But besides the glaring server and console port issues this game is spectacular. The monster animations models and design are some of the best in the gaming world. The challenge is pretty well balanced in my opinion. You may get frustrated at times but you'll also have a lot of fun with the combat and general gameplay. The story is surprisingly very good. Overall it is a very fun experience and even with the issues I would recommend it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,459,False,Recommended,I've played all since MH3. It's fun fluid and it's more actual monster hunting than menus this time around. I can't even go play MHGU now thanks to this. 90% of connection problems have been fixed so far Capcom SEEMS okay with visual mods but it's still kinda up in the air? There's not a lot of weapon model variety and of course the monster pool isn't as big but that's to be expected with an upscale of a series that's used to being on a 240p device.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-31,0,0,198,False,Recommended,So I bought this game on a whimBest buy of the year so far! Pros? Its Monster hunter you spend about as much time as you do in a Moba match to take down a giant monster! you and a group of 3 others (if you choose) go to take down monsters..sometimes the size of big building! to carve pieces of their bodies to make weapons/armor so you can deal better damage/take hits better so you can go do it all over again!the quality of life changes really make this game great! Cons. Its a tad grindy though no where near as bad as its previous counterparts. there were connection issues in the beginning which the dev team so far as I know seemed to have fix. Bazelguese. Over all its a fantastic game that takes some getting use to but its well worth its price IMO. and for the moment it has free DLC! (though the game wont be truely great until they patch in G Rank hunting.),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,171,False,Recommended,I've always been a huge fan of the MH series starting way back when it was a smaller less known title on the PS2. Seeing the game evolve and finally make its way to PC has been one hell of an adventure... and wait. While I can't say the launch of the game was phenominal for the Multiplayer aspect the game was still extremely enjoyable and would suggest it to anyone to play it in that state. Now that they've done some fixes for networking errors they've totally blown my expectations out of the water. The gameplay feels like a brand new experience while still retaining some of that old MH feel. The game is worth the purchase! Don't hesitate!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,221,False,Recommended,Fantastic game in all senses of the word. The world is beautiful and different the monsters feel alive and the hunts are satisfying. MHW is my first foray in to the franchise and I'm having a blast. My only gripe for us keyboard/mouse people is that the controls are not entirely mappable. It really helps having a modular keyboard/mouse that you can set out of game.I do reccomend this game with a caveat this is not a casual game you're going to have to put in a lot of time and effort to understand the gameplay and the mechanics. The combat is very different from any other game I've played (I was never into games like Dark Souls or The Witcher). It's methodical incremental and in some cases I found it to be unforgiving. The itemization system is fairly intense and determines the worth of your character rather than a leveling system. And knowledge of the monsters coming from in game experience or online research tips the scales of a hunt. I am 60 hours in at the time I'm writing this and I am still exploring parts of the crafting list equipment list environmental elements of combat and finding new monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-31,0,0,84,False,Recommended,Well worth the buy only trouble one can experience is hardware ineptness. Fantastic gameplay grinding that s actually fun a play style for everyone and it s pretty much open world when you re on a hunt. The great thing is that these monsters while entirely unrealistic in our world fit the ecology of their environments. Plus you have a cat companion who can give you vigorwasps at the exact wrong moment in a pinch. I recommend everyone to try it. So worth the sixty bucks.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,161,False,Recommended,tl dr Definitely a good experience with friends if the network connection sticks through a session.There are some awkward deficiencies with this port that is unexpected of a 6 month delay such as low resolution textures network disconnections poor performance on some of the fights (particle effects are quite taxing). Possibly the most aggravating issue is the SoS system failing to place you into lobbies which takes about 12 controller inputs each time to refresh the list of available SoS missions. Then at times after you actually get into an SoS lobby the system can boot you out of a mission halfway leaving you with a multiplayer scaled monster that you have to deal with solo.Overall I'm still going to recommend the game as it has high entertainment potential despite the current flaws. Hopefully Capcom will turn this game into the masterpiece that it deserves to be.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,261,False,Recommended,It isn't as dense in content as other titles in the series but that doesn't change the fact that almost everything else about the game is fun and worth the $60.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-31,0,0,538,False,Recommended,My issues with the port connection issues and bad optimization in some places/during some fights. Everything else is fine for me. I don't mind the mouse and keyboard I'm using it on multiple of weapons and have no problems.There is really no competition to this game on PC the demon hunting whatever game had way worse PC port and dauntless is... well different not my kind of different.The hunts are satisfying and if anything like stuns or roars annoy the heck out of you you can just mod those things out with eq (you can for eg. become immune to stuns).Very few unfair situations once you learn the game and actually use the tools you can craft the game becomes a fair challenge for solo and group alike.Game has a lot of potential as a coop game where crazy things happen but if you just want to hunt solo it's entirely possible (and I even prefer it on some tempered monsters).If you liked the idea of Monster Hunter in the past but couldn't go past the camera controls or gamepad in general this game is for you (though you can still play with a controller) the price is pretty high but there is A LOT of content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,67,False,Recommended,I will start by saying in its current state this is really a solo adventure with SOME multiplayer capabilities. Do not buy at the moment if you're looking for Co OP gameplay. It is pretty much unusable. WIth that being said this is my first foray into the Monster Hunter universe and i am enthralled! The game looks amazing and i'm not experiencing any issues while solo. Granted i have a pretty beefy system but it has ran smooth. The gameplay is addicting and this game features HUUUGGGEEEEEE amounts of content. I can see dumping more hours into this than witcher 3 which is saying something. I'm hoping the Co op gets fixed as time goes on but for now i am having plenty of fun solo ing the heck out of some monsters!**UPDATED** The Co op has since been mostly fixed (not fully but FAR LESS issues) and the game is still amazingly fun to play.

That's not to say it doesn't happen but from my experience it didn't hinder us.This game is amazing overall and playing with a few buddies makes it great. There's a lot of depth and variety with the different weapons as well as skills abilities etc. The combat itself is very good however you might have to adjust the controls for the ranged weapons. Items are varied and crafting is relatively simple but enjoyable even eating in this game can effect how you play. Story's a little bad but I don't care. I just want to play the game most of the time.Some people say that this game doesn't look as good on PC than on PS4 and they might be right on that. There are a few frame drops here and there with some monsters but other than that it runs well enough. With the problems involving multiplayer I still recommend this game it's pretty deep in it's combat and gameplay while also giving us a lot of content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I've never played MH before.The fights aren't ""epic"" they confused the word with ""long and tedious"". Dodge hit from the side rinse repeat until it eventually dies. No strategy all the ""weak points"" are impossible to aim for anyway when a monster is moving and it doesn't matter anyway when the above strategy works whether or not the monster can spit poison at you periodically. There's far too much time to run away and recover if you do get hit and healing items are plentiful.Will I be playing it some more?

I've been playing MHW mostly with a friend in a 2 player session and have done lots of 4 player missions. 58 hours of gameplay and haven't really experienced any network issues eventhugh my own internet connection is far from exellent. The only issue for me is that I can't run the game on very high settings on a decent PC with more than 40 50 fps.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,53,False,Recommended,"The game is great I'm using an i7 3770K and a 980ti with 16GB ram nothing spectacular but pretty alright I think. whatever the case Im running the game with video settings at high with anisotropic filtering off at a solid 60 fps with i believe around 60 70% GPU usage and around 50 60% CPU usage (I haven't gotten to check those percentages while I'm fighting a big monster cause I don't want tab out while a monsters in front of me if the percentage goes up a significant amount worth mentioning I'll update my review). I haven't really noticed any textures not rendering correctly everything looks the quality it should be. And to address online issues while i haven't tried doing an actual hunt with other people I've had no problem connecting to an online hub and staying connected nor am i getting any errors during hunts preventing me from firing SOS flares. I don't know maybe I'm just lucky but I've yet to experience any issues the negative reviews are talking about so as long as that continues i can confidently give this a reccomened since I myself haven't seen any problems. If you decide to buy the game after this review (which I doubt because I'm only talking on my experince alone which as of right now is fairly limited) and you experience issues by all means either wait for the patches or just refund the game. be warned the opening of the game took me about an hour and 15 minutes so don't spend too much time on character creation if you want to be able to refund it.After checking the percentages with multiple different monsters in different locations of the map I can say that I fluctuate between 60% and 80% for both CPU and GPU The average was probably around 62% for CPU and 72% for GPUAfter a friend of mine bought it we started playing with eachother and can say from multiple different play sessions that we never disconnected from eachother even after playing for more than 3 hours there was never a single disconnect at least when it wasn't caused by us there was one disconnect that was our fault because we knew that alt tabbing out of the game can result in a disconnect but we were doing it anyway and after a couple time we had gotten a disconnectI think that's the last time I'll have to edit my review so if I were to go off my own experience alone I would have to say that I really can't believe the game got such a low rating because so many people have connection issues I've tried to cover every issue other people are talking about with my own experience (except for the stupid complaints of things like no 21 9 support because it isn't even close to important and only continues to prove the toxicity of ""pc masterracers""). First time writing a review of this calibur and the only reason is because monster hunter is a series very dear to me (I've only played 4U and generations and planning to get gen ultimate when it comes out but those two games were probably some of the greatest games i've ever played in terms of enjoyment and fun and has gotten monster hunter to be my favorite go to series) and I can't just watch it get bombarded with negative reviews for things that I haven't even experienced I mean there are so many accounts of the issues and capcom even acknowledged the issue but with me never experiencing any of these problems I can't say that I haven't had my doubts if even for a couple seconds.(also if you actually play this game with keyboard and mouse you're actually crippling yourself controller emulation or not and if you plan on playing this game you need a controller seriously I can't believe how many complaints there have been about this it's been a console came since it's conception and then it was moved to the 3ds you really think a game like that is going to work better on KB/M?)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,213,False,Recommended,I would love to give this game a thumbs up because it is fun but I can't because of multiplayer.I first played Monster Hunter on the playstation 2 back in 2005 and the multiplayer networking is better than this game. Did capcom underestimate the number of people playing? I don't know much about networking but from my experience of multiplayer games this is poor for a 2018 game.So if you want to only play this game solo it is great as a solo game the cat helpers are sometimes better than players but if you want the monster hunter experience of playing with other people which is kind of the whole point of monster hunter well sadly this is not good enough.EDIT They have brought out a patch that has fixed the disconnection there are still other problems like poor optimisation and lack of PC options (e.g key rebinding)so you can buy now knowing the problems or wait for it to go on sale.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,123,False,Recommended,"I am reviewing this game as someone who has only played one MH game prior to this (a long time ago) and who primarily plays solo.MHW has a lot going for it with a few drawbacks/quirks. Let me be upfront and blunt about this this is a complex game. If complexity scares/bothers you this is probably not the game for you. There's also no comparison between this game and Dauntless MHW's very poor FTP clone there's far more content in MHW's first area alone than there is in ALL of Dauntless (at least at the time of this writing). Still if you've tried Dauntless and the basic idea behind the gameplay appeals to you (but you felt like Dauntless was just lacking) then you should definitely get MHW. As for specifics here's a short(ish) list of things I liked and didn't like about MHW Good stuff 1. Monster design/behavior monsters in MHW (at least the large ones that are generally the focus of your hunts) are actually parts of their ecosystems not just some AI critter plopped down in a map with no thought of how it would go about its day to day life they hunt for food drink water have lairs and react to various things as you might expect wild animals to react. Each one has its own behaviors strengths and weaknesses and knowing what those are will make your hunts that much easier. Most of them have their own gimmicks in combat. For instance the Great Jagras the first large monster you will hunt will swallow prey whole causing its chest and stomach to enlarge. It will then try to body slam you with that bulge. The Kulu Ya Ku a giant dodo like bird will pick up and hold stones as shields against your attacks. The Barroth covers itself in mud then shakes the mud off at you hopefully slowing you down so it can charge and slam into you. It's also worth pointing out that you have ways of dealing with all of these gimmicks IF you come prepared. If you blindly waltz into a fight with a monster you don't know anything about it's going to be a slogfest at best and you're gonna get your a** handed to you at worst.2. Environment design while a few environments share critters each environment is large beautifully detailed and diverse. They all also contain many nooks and crannies environmental traps you can exploit to harm/capture monsters and tons of various types of wildlife that you can use either in the field or back at home.3. Weapon design you can choose any one of 14 different weapons each one having its own special quirk making them all feel unique. Not only that the game gives you one of each type of weapon for free to start and allows you to try them all out in the training area before you decide which one(s) you want to go with. Progression in the game is tied entirely to your weapon and armor your character has all the skill they'll ever have from the get go so the only way to get stronger is to upgrade your gear. Fortunately the requirements for upgrading each weapon type aren't all that uncommon if you get tired of your original weapon halfway through the game you probably already have most (if not all) of what you need to upgrade a different weapon to the same (or at least a similar) level.4. Palicoes Your Palico is a little sapient cat critter that (optionally) follows you around on missions and helps you out. You can craft weapons and gear for them and they actually turn out to be fairly useful in combat depending on what you have equipped on them. The starting gadget for all Palicoes is a healing gadget and your Palico gets better with their gadgets the more that gadget gets used. As it stands the healing gadget is extremely useful and has saved my butt more than once. It's especially important considering that you do not heal over time on your own and you can only carry up to 10 of a type of healing potions on missions the Palico's healing gadget gives you a way to heal in combat without costing you anything.5. Tons of side quests/things to do while the game is obviously focused around hunting monsters you can go on expeditions which are completely free form enabling you to do things like fish catch small wildlife to keep as pets gather ingredients for crafting consumables look for more palicoes to help you out or just explore the scenery. Expeditions are also good for getting to know the areas and for learning how to track monsters the more you track a particular monster the easier it becomes to track them down in future missions. There are also tons of side quests bounties investigations and arena fights to do.Bad stuff 1. Sharpening system the melee weapons in the game all need to be sharpened frequently in combat even if they are blunt type weapons which obviously makes no sense. This does get easier to deal with as you upgrade your gear (stronger weapons have more sharpness) but it's still frequent enough to be annoying. Your weapon deals less and less damage as it dulls with each hit and on top of that many higher level monsters have a hide ""toughness"" threshold meaning that if your weapon's sharpness is below that threshold it will be frequently deflected by the monster's hide doing minimal damage. As it stands this mechanic is really nothing more than forcing melee users to need to ""reload"" and the game would be far better off if this mechanic were eliminated entirely.2. Combat is slow this one kind of sits in a weird place for me. I understand why combat is slow and it makes sense but I still don't like it. Your character typically wields giant (usually comically oversized) weapons that no real person would be able to effectively use in combat. On the other hand it kind of makes sense because you're hunting giant friggin' monsters you need something big enough to hurt them. This also means however that the vast majority of weapons are slow. They're slow to ready and slow to swing. Again given their size this makes sense but it does also make combat tedious at times (especially coming from a game like Warframe where combat is extremely fast paced). Even using one of the fastest weapons in the game I frequently find myself wishing my character could swing his weapon at least a little faster especially considering that monsters despite their size are almost always much faster than you.3. Not enough keyboard options for the hotbar in case you aren't aware this is a console port. As such it was obviously originally designed to be played with a controller and while they've done an okay job with most keybindings for keyboard and mouse one place where they failed miserably is the hotbar/quickbar system. Put simply when in keyboard mode they're not very quick. You have four hotbars keyed to F1 F4. You cannot change these keybindings which is a problem in and of itself because that means you have to take your hand off of WASD just to access your hotbars. Once you select which hotbar you want you can then press the number that corresponds to the item or action you want in that hotbar. The whole process is slow and clunky. There are plenty of traditional MMOs that do hotbars far better than MHW so I really have to knock the developers for dropping the ball here.4. The armor system unlike your weapon which you pick from the start and then upgrade as you go along you primarily get better armor by forging it from the parts you carve off of monsters. In theory this sounds pretty cool you basically get to wear your trophies. Skills come attached to armor pieces however and this is what ruins the system for me in order to get the best set of skills on your armor you have to wear an ugly hodgepodge of the various critters you've killed. There should be a way to have good stats AND not look like a blind man dressed you.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,First of all I want to say that I love the series from the PSP. Played Freedom Unite and had a blast. Love the type of challening game and mechanic weapons are really awesome and inventive the world and monsters are interesting. And the idea of making an image of my parted kitty Cindy put a smile on my face but..The reason why I refunded the game is because of the combat that seems well clunky and unreposnive for me. Compaing the combat to the Psp game I guess won't really do it justice not sure if comparing it to Dark Souls would be ok either but it's the closest I can get. And the problem is that it's not as sharp..the wepaons do feel storng do feel like have weight but when up agains multiple enemies it just feels like you are fighting agains your weapon and not the creatures. The way you swich hotkey items also seems uncessarily complicated. And the targheting sytem is the worst thing ever made. Really Capcom how hard is it? Dark Souls did it right on their fist try you targhet one mob and untarget and retarget another one...Dunno will actually try Dragons Dogma go back in Dark Souls 2 and hey got DS 3 so why not play that as well..will do both with a controller and maybe will actually re purchase the game.

As my first foray into the MH series I've thoroughly enjoyed myself and it is allowing me to do what I love. Per gameplay wise I love it. It's fantastic. Combat is fun and meaningful and whenever you use a larger than life weapon you can actually FEEL the strikes as they connect with the monster you're hunting. Loving it except when you're either poisoned bleeding or on fire while stunlocked then not so much. Per actually being able to run the game I've had minor issues. None performance wise but online is a little finicky and often goes offline for no apparent reason resulting in me being forced to restart the game. But other than this I've had no major issues. Overall I love this game. I'm suprised it's taken me this long to get into the MH franchise but I'm glad I finally did. I'm going to be playing this for hundreds more hours and it will be fantastic.

A lot of really poorly made games with crazy bugs have received better reviews than this game and I find that concerning. So I have been waiting for this game to come to PC for awhile. I have played the console version before and have checked out several hours of gameplay on console through streams.This game plays exactlly like the console version and the concept and gameplay is an addictive format and extremely fun.

2018-08-15,0,0,109,False,Recommended,After the first patch The connection is stable enough to stay in friend's lobby. Does not disconnect us while playing.But i can't find as many games as before the patch. Matchmaking seems a little wonky.The optimization is bad but it is playable.The Game Deep enough to keep me interested.Before playing the game I thought Combat looked slow and uninteresting. Monsters would get old quickly because they're only a handful. Few Maps so less exploration. Grind would be too unmeaningful and crafting stuff was only a way to waste your time/lock content.Turns out it is not so bad + Combat is slow but trying to land good shots in takes a little practice and weapons generally give you some moves that feel very good when you pull them off.+ Monsters even though simple have their weaknesses and some strong moves that you want to be careful of.+ Monsters have their homes on the maps they have patrols escape routes so you get to learn them with the map. The maps actually turn out to be a place you get used to. You start to know where monsters tend to fight each other where you can find a particular herb or mushroom. It is not a feel you would get from an open world game.+ Grind is a hassle sure but it ties in with rest of the game very well. The weapons or armors you make from the monsters you've slain they look cool and they make you stronger. It does not feel like something you have to do but rather something makes your day a lot of easier. You have a potion? You just need some honey to make it even better. You like your sword? Just wait until you get the next one. TL DR It is a nice chill game. I am NOT saying that the combos you do are wonderful or the map is so interesting you explore for days monsters have amazing AI crafting is always useful and not repetitive at all. But it is a nice blend which kept me engaged enough to see more of it without being either too casual fun or stupidly hard grind.Plus you get a cool cute cat.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,182,False,Recommended,Came back to review this game once again after a few weeks into it's release and I am quite happy with it!Pros With over 100 hours played I have enjoyed the game greatly for what it is and that is a pure ARPG! I was never into action games like this until now. The weapon combat system is top notch played about four of them fully and the combo / specials are pretty cool. The way crafting is implemented in this game is great as well weapons and armor need to be crafted by hunting monster parts. Your progression is only capped on your ability to hunt down and kill/capture monsters. And if you are really good you don't need top tier weapons or armor just need to know how the monsters behaviour works.Cons Game had a rocky start with network issues which are much better now. I rearly get booted from multiplayer at this time so that is a plus but the server matching system some times is not working well and you cannot find anyone even though there are loads of people sos questing. This I hope is fixed soon but it is not a game breaker. Some people have experienced crashing but I have never had this issue on my custom built rig in over 100 hours so take that as it is.My Specs Video Card 1080ti Ram 16GB i7 Asus MB and Vid card...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"i Recomend this game for it's appselut awesome gameplay and ofcource satisfaction.but first off i will tell you some cons from the game. ConsThe intro and torturial that you start whit makes the game look unfinished and really trash.the game sort off dosent let you kill monsters that are considered too high level they just run away from the entire continent by runinng into a bush. (i figured this out by hunting Dragons whilst just being rank 3 but i almost did it B) )And now the Pros Prosthis game recomends playing whit friends and i can understand it as i have played alone so far but that dosent mean you have to play whit friends to win the game or anything it just makes it a little bit easier as alot of things can happen while you try to kill a monster or Capture one.the feeling of winning or slaying a super difficult monster has the super good feeling you get from Dark souls when you kill a boss. (get really mad and really relived when you win.) Mapthe map is really big and has alot of biomes in it and the map can often even feel bigger when you find a certain road.there are a lot of things to harvest and belive me you'll need it. Queststhe game wants to show that its an online game really mutch and there for it always starts by showing you recomended players. you can join others or have people join you on the hunt.there are 3 types of ""Quests"" Main story assignments and investation. they are all awesome.Enjoy the game!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,768,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is one of those games at the beginning does not explain much as far as game play the game starts a new player with little explanation on how things in the game work making the game feel clucky and discouraging as far as the armor and weapon system not to mention the hotbars radials and quick loadouts but if you can get passed that and don t mind being all thumbs or reading a lot of useless text or for that matter clicking like for or five times to get passed it (I mean there is no real dialog in the game its so sad great visual graphics and its ruined because you are reading all this damn text instead of just being in the moment for me this just ruined every encounter I had with a NPC that wanted to talk to me all I could think of was damn I better read all this so I can enjoy the story and not miss anything).Aside from all of that among other nuances that you have to overlook the game is very enjoyable and you are in for a boss battle every time you walk out the base door with great AI (on a set route) that scales with party members great scenery simple weapon combos along with armor and weapon mods cosmetic eye catching with stats that are functional as well as letting you do some theorycrafting during the game to hone your skills and attacks.Im 69 hours into the game and I would call this game a must play if you are not easily discouraged and like PVE MMO s.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,196,False,Recommended,Absolute treasure playing this game.Each monster has their own difficulties and requires the player(s) to understand the monster's capabilities and weaknesses in order to combat it efficiently.Progression is not too slow but you also won't be blazing through the items toward the mid late game.Each item has their own purpose to lead you to great success in the hunts you will embark upon.For me the most upfront positives to this game are + Unique battles literally everywhere+ Abundant types of gameplay with 14 weapons to choose from (Some have their variants aswell)+ Sometimes felt like a god when pulling off some of the amazing combos in this game+ Amazing in both solo and team playHowever there are definitely some negatives Multiplayer is rather tedious to use and sometimes doesn't even function Some controls are rather clunky or not streamlined enough Some cutscenes while really pretty and invokes a feeling of ermagherd are really freaking long(Side Note The devs have definitely addressed the first two issues and are working on solutions at the current time of writing)Overall an astounding game amongst the other grand titles of 2018. There will most likely be future updates as Monster Hunter World on the consoles definitely received some additional content over time.TL DR It's good.

2018-09-01,0,0,98,False,Recommended,I write this review as someone who has played every iteration of Monster Hunter and can say without a doubt this is the best execution of the idea. There has been a plethora of Quality of Life updates to the series that would make going back to one of the old titles feel almost impossible now. The drop in drop out system for hunts works great. The controller integration is seemingly flawless. I've tested both an xbox controller and a PS4 controller and they felt great without having to change any button functions or sensitivity. Overall my experience with the game has been incredible. I have always been reserved about recommending Monster Hunter titles to my friends because they tend to have a very steep learning curve but I feel as though this game has smoothed that curve quite a bit. Tracking monsters has become more intuative A bigger variety of viable weapons allows for players to find their style instead of fitting into one In game research takes some hunting notes for you helping you automatically keep track of weaknesses both elemental and physical The crafting system has been streamlined with an auto craft option for more common items and no more failure rates The inventory system is all around easier to interface with and more organized A few cons With the games improved hit boxes some of the old monsters feel too easy Lack of new monsters/monsters in general Lack of weapon and armor options There is only one giant elder dragon fight in this game and its not very fun (which is unfortunate because with the added power of being on the newest systems and PC there is a lot of space for huge epic hunts like the Jhen Moran) Short compared to Ultimate titles in the seriesI am still holding out hope that eventually they will release a G rank mode or add some more monsters to the game even if those things are paid DLC. The hunting system is fun and the ability to play with friends is simple and rewarding. There just needs to be more end game content or more highly challenging monsters to give you a reason to grind for the late game equipment.Overall in its current state 8.5/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,159,False,Recommended,I adore this game and highly recommend it as it's quickly become one of my favorite releases this year. I never played on console as I'm a PC fan but I eagerly awaited this game and pre ordered almost instantly. The satisfaction of tracking and then fighting the huge roster of monsters never gets old the visceral effects and feel of the fourteen weapons keeping things fresh and interesting. All of this takes place in a fantastic variety of environments filled with incredible and original creatures both large and small. The sense of progression is amazing and very well visually represented in the appearence of your armor and weapons. The story and lore are there and take up as much space and time as you want. Personally I find myself becoming invested in the going ons around me of other Hunters and characters doing side quests and filling orders to improve the world I'm in. However there are several bugs that have become apparent such as the disconnections in multiplayer quests. Nothing game breaking so far but can be frustrating if you're trying to play with a set group of Hunters. While annoying not worth giving this game a negative review as I'm confident such things will be patched and improved upon in the future. Again I highly recommend picking up as there is more than enough bang for your buck.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Disclaimer I am a die hard monster hunter fan since the original on PS2. I've played every monster hunter ranging from the original on PS2 to the wii and 3ds games. Monster hunter world is the next step in revolutionizing the series and it does a good job of it. The game is addicting more so then ever and its truely a beautiful experince that takes something thats usually tedious like grinding and makes it enjoyable. Although the PC port of the game is Meh This is suppose to be Capcom's first attempt at making a pc port and it really shows there's so many missing basic features that PC players are used to. Also there's huge server issues still even a week after launch this same thing happened with the Xbox One and Playstation 4 version of Monster hunter World. All in all despite its issues i highly reccommend Monster Hunter World to fans and new comers a like. You need to experince this game you will well get your moneys worth here.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Ultimately I think it's worth the full price and while it may not be for everyone I certainly do think anyone can have a lot of fun playing it. With more to come in the future and the pros already outweighing the cons not a single penny could be wasted. There was a lot done right if not perfectly and it leaves me with a lot of hope for the future. THE BAD 1) I couldn't get my controller/gamepad to work but that was solved in less than an hour after my friend suggested launching it from Big Picture mode. This isn't so much an issue as it is a warning until (or if) this is changed.2) There are frequent connection issues which is particularly problematic because there is no option to start in offline mode. When joining quests or friends' sessions I feel like I have to cross my fingers more than I'd like it freezes for a minute or more trying to connect and eventually failing. In the first day or two we would sometimes drop out of quests due to connectivity issues but that does seem to have calmed down and I'm sure it'll continue improving over time.3) here is a pretty underwhelming amount of content. Despite distracting myself with parties of four and countless hours of farming rare drops to make full armor and weapon sets I still found it relatively easy to play through without much to enjoy after. Within four days I was already watching the credits roll and to my distaste learned that there is nothing beyond Xeno'Jiiva without farming HR and beating the same old monsters in new combinations through investigations it just feels unfinished. With all the extra under my belt it only took me 60 hours to finish up the main story. Without it I'd say anyone that knows what they're doing could finish in 40 hours. THE GOOD 1) SOS Flares. It sounds like such a small thing to adore but anyone who has played previous Monster Hunter games will appreciate these. Originally you could party with friends and that was that nearby at first then online after a while. But once you loaded in that was that. Anyone that didn't come is left behind til the end and you only have what you brought. Now you can fire flares and your quest will be open to a great deal of players to hop in and help out. Joining late won't give rewards so nobody will be able to take a cut by mooching. My personal favorite part about this though is being the one to help out. People who have issues with high rank quests or who are simply looking to farm elder dragons for rare drops will fire flares by ten seconds in letting you join in to help out and grind faster. This is even better when it comes to limited time quests like Zorah Magdaros and Xeno'Jiiva if you don't have the quest available there's most likely someone else who does and would love help taking it down more quickly.2) This is by far the most immersive Monster Hunter game I've played. The story lacks (very slightly) compared to others my favorite being MH4U but the characters are memorable. There are more NPCs to talk to more interactions in general new crafting mechanics a much much larger city free camera controls within the city I could go on. What it all boils down to is that it doesn't feel rigid or ""stuck"" like the others did Astera isn't just a hub like Kokoto Pokke Val Habar etc. but a bustling town full of energy that you begin to feel more acquainted with and feel more understanding of as you learn about the other fleets. That only covers the town and characters though which brings me to my next point...3) The environment is incredible. An open map without loading screens lets you see monsters traveling across areas hunting and chasing them down. What's more is how interactive they are. Gathering points reflect exactly what you're gathering as opposed to the previous MH games where they would be generic and what you got was based on RNG. You can capture Endemic Life for points and showcase the animals in your house which is upgradable. Very upgradable. Monsters can fight one another in terf wars. Destructable environments allow for clever traps and tools to do massive damage and immobilize large monsters.4) From a veteran's standpoint I see and appreciate what Capcom has done to make the game more inviting to new players without making the game feel like a breeze whetstones are infinite scoutflies eliminate the need for paintballs tracks help locate monsters and points reward you for using them you can refill items from your crate in the press of a button and item crafting recipes have been made significantly more tolerable. 5) There's a LOT of customization. At first I was impressed alone by being able to choose from so many options just for my character's face let alone the starting armors and my Palico but being able to change the armor pigments for yourself and your Palico was a nice plus that I wasn't expecting and adds a nice touch when showing off your high rank armor. Overall the game is stunning and exciting and full of new additions that keep even old school MH players interested and I couldn't advise anyone more to get this game ASAP. I give this game a 9 out of 10 once more content is added though I'd be more than happy to give this game a 10. I might as well too given the anticipated future monsters and locations. Maybe we'll even meet some of the older monsters among the new! I hope this review was helpful as long as it is. To those of you that purchase this game Happy hunting!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,62,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter's debut on Steam has its ups and downs when it comes to the quality of the port but Capcom has crafted an excelent example of how to widen a neiche seriese into the mainstream. When it comes to the game its self AMAZING. Monster Hunter (and the Hunter genre in general) has been largly ignored by the majority of the western gaming community. World is a concise effort to ""westernize"" the series. In almost all ways it succeeds to do that for the better of the game. Things like auto crafting and the changed gathering really work well to not slow the player down as often. The armor system offers a lot of flexibility while not being quite as dense and confusing as the earlier iterations. Where i do feel its update has been a detriment is the overall character of the game. While it still does have tons of character they have toned back a fair ammount of the ""weird"" from earlier games. Now this doesn't ruin the experience but it for sure has lost something there. Technically the port has its ups and downs. I have had maybe 2 or 3 crashes in my 40 hours so far I know others have had that worse. The random disconnects were worse at launch and I haven't experienced them since. The way multiplayer has been setup is unintuitive as hell and makes me wonder what they were thinking. Groups or Clans or whatever they were called has now been linked to Steam groups I dont know how i feel about this yet but it is strange to me. I hope Capcom keeps up the patching of the game and eventually gets us on content parity with the console versions.

2018-08-13,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,"Probably the only review you have to read about this game DO NOT risk buying this game unless there is a deep discount to see if you like it or if your computer can handle it. * Had a crash when looking at my Guild Card Fatal ErrorTo be honest I think the recommended specs for this game are exaggerated. Even though there are bugs in this game Steam with not refund anyone this one with a very restrict 2 hour limit. Even though an RPG like this at 2 hours you barely get anything done especially with all these cutscenes.You just need to watch beginner tips and guides video 1st.No many how detailed is your request is you're wasting your time.You better be sure you want this one and/or it's worth the risk because you will not get your money back if you play over 2 hours.That being said I had about 180 hours on PS4 Pro on this game in a span about a month and a half. So I slightly liked this game and I was excited for this game to come out on PC for 4K.Specs Monitor 3840 x 2160 60HzProcessor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4790K CPU 4.00GHz GPU Titan X (Pascal) Motherboard Gigabyte Z97X Gaming G1Nvidia Driver 388.13Ram 32.0GB DDR3 (31.8 GB usable)So you can see I have a decent PC. Higher specs will most likely have a better time and lower specs may less likely have a good time with the technical aspects. It all depends on the resolution and framerate you are looking for. I enjoy high setting but even on all low settings my GPU was hitting 100% usage. Graphics Very Good But It Will Cost YouTextures are Hit and Miss. The textures in the character creation are absolutely glorious especially if you wear the chain mail and the leather on the other outfit looks realistic. Now some parts look OK to poor due to some textures looking blurry due to a bug of full textures not rendering in.The environments are glorious in 4K sometimes and then you keep looking see blurry textures in some places and 480p plants in other places. I want everyone (while people who bother to read this review) to know that this does not happen all the time but enough for me to notice and question if I should have paid $60 dollars for something that doesn't seem ready.Something for cutscenes sometimes and some close look amazing but other times it looks like they just ripped the cutscenes from the console especially the 1st cutscene in the ship bar.A very shiny game depending the time of day the sun lighting is a bit too intense and can blow out the scene. And whad'ya know the setting for this is locked (this is the part where you play the Seinfeld meme music). Difficulty and Grind Terrifying and Satisfying I can't stress this enough WATCH beginner video tips and guides. Don't worry if they are console beginner video tips and guides it's pretty much the same game from a gameplay sense. This game does tell you how to play but there is a lot to take in and you might not get what they are talking about for a while. You can play it without the guides but there will be a lot of trial and error if you do.When you get into charms element damage limits abilities abilities buffs and decorations (the real META of the game) then the fun begins.I honestly like the grind it's mostly fair. There was only one time that I felt like a drop was impossible and not going to after seven straight hours hunting a monster to craft an armor. But it finally dropped and I felt like I was on the top world (this was on console). If this doesn't sound great for you then this might not be your game.So few more things make sure you have enough items and eat before every hunt you will need it. Also UPGRADE YOUR ARMOR as much as you can don't worry because of doing investigations daily will give you enough sphere. These monster hit very hard you will need a good defense.But to be honest if you have a decent 4 person team you can cheese a lot of the harder monsters at even low level.So no Dark Souls here just a bit learning and patience. Gameplay Very Good Best Part of the GameThis is the biggest plus of the game. Everything that comes with crafting and combat is straight from the console. You will be stuck in the combo animation if you get too greedy so roll maintain distance and watch for monsters movements as they can be predictable if you pay attention. To be honest you can watch beginner tips from the console game on Youtube and you will be set its pretty much the same game in that aspect. If you played the console version then there is nothing new here.Now the gameplay is good unless you are using keyboard and mouse due to bad mouse acceleration which makes no sense on PC.Playing this game is better for me with a controller. Performance Decent (Your PC may get toasty)No 21 9 SupportNo SLI/Crossfire Support(I don't use either so this doesn't affect me)Locked Setting Motion Blur Depth of Field Bloom/Glow EffectsNote If you get weird lines while playing or during cutscenes turn on V Sync. I got lines on my cutscene in my test playthrough then switch the V Sync and it solved my problem.A really detail heavy game so that's why I'm disappointed when my GPU is hitting 99 100% even at menus with one character with simple backgrounds. I don't think this is properly optimized. Other games that I have at near max settings like Battlefield 1 have my GPU calm down when nothing intense is going on the screen and even intense scenes have my GPU barely hit 80%. That was with max players on both sides and vehicles on the field with constant grenade spam.I don't mind my GPU running hot as long as it is worth it and rendering blurry textures sometimes at 100% GPU usage is odd to me. Note 1 (again) I turned all setting low and still getting high GPU usage.To be fair. I think it is because of the locked settings and once we can change those settings then I believe that we can see dramatic improvements in performance until then my GPU will be working overtime.Some settings seem to do absolutely nothing or very little inside or outside Shadows Subsurface Scattering Dynamic Range SH Diffuse Water Reflection Connection GoodI personally never had the ""Error 50382 MW1"" and have been able to actually get good matches. Even went the monsters ran away my multiple player matches still felt like I accomplished. So I personally can't fault Capcom on this one. Co op can be a mess but I don't co op often. So if that's your thing you might have a bad time from what I'm hearing from other people.But mics are very low on this game can barely hear anyone with my headphones turned up. Final Verdict MehTHIS IS NOT A BAD PC PORT.No this is a subpar PC port. Which is even worse.There is POTENTIAL here it looks like they know what they are doing (somewhat) it's just they did not put in the full effort and 60 dollars should not be the prize for this effort and obvious mistakes like locked settings. Not game breaking mistakes just disappointing.Average 6.5 / 10 (just because of these simple mistakes as these mistakes bring down the overall experience for me otherwise it would be a 9 / 10)I feel some of these mistakes defeats some of the advantages of the PC.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,172,False,Recommended,Game is absolutely amazing. Not my favorite in the series but pretty close. Friendly to beginners. My fps does seem to drop when weapons with special effects are used particularly with thunder ammo for some reason but it is manageable. An interesting roster of monsters combined with 14 different weapons each with their own unique play style gives this game tons of content. Highly recommend 9/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,281,False,Recommended,Great game been a fan of the series since the beginning but this installment blew me away. So many quality of life improvements the independence of having your own instance so you don't hold other hunters up while you are still getting ready for the quest at hand. They created a loadout system for everything gear items foods making getting ready a breeze. The food system and cat animation makes getting food at HQ a treat. Speaking of the food system you can setup your favorite dish and get extra bonuses based on if what food is fresh at that time. The improvements to crafting is a much needed upgrade. By having what you need in your inventory while out on a quest or free roam the system will auto create items you selected in the crafting menu at your storage box. So if you are running from a monster and you will do that a lot in this game. You can run by let say... a honey and if you have one potion left and need a big heal the system will craft you a mega potion on the fly saving you from having to open any menus. Which has saved me countless times. The new addition of weapons is a refreshing feel to the game. The beetle glaves mobility and the switchblade shield. The performance and optimization is solid on my nvidia 750 TI. I get no lag no stuttering no drop in frame rate over all making this game for me an enjoyable experience. If you are new to the monster hunter series I recommend starting with Monster Hunter World.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

While the game is fun and the mechanic of the fighting is amazing the constant connection issue is really dissapointing. Getting dropped from a game when you almost kill a monster is really annoying and heartbreaking. CAPCOM needs to build new servers and they should have anticipated the wave of PC players.

2018-08-17,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,"This is apparently the only kind of review I ever end up giving. I bought the game I'm playing the game I will continue to play the game but if I could get my time and money back I would trade the experience in this game in an instant. What holds me right now is the fact that all my friends are playing and I now have sunk cost holding me in place. The series identity has this fixation on sluggishness and clunk that would be fine if it strictly delineated combat experience to put you on even footing with the gargauntuans you square up with big weapons big commitment but it's infiltrated every aspect of the game to the point of tedium. Menus like wasting your time unskippable cutscenes will make you rip your hair out tutorials hang for a few seconds and by good golly will you have saturated the ""I get it"" point by the end of your first story area. Hunts end with lengthy death sequences (which I have been informed are skippable with start and have just found out even that isn't reliable) that eats up a sixth of your arbitrarily triggered minute long timer until you are ejected from the map (during which you are very capable of accidentally jumping off that cliff only to wind up disoriented 2 levels below that Legiana you just spent 30 minutes killing) very likely losing your loot pinata. Not to mention it is very possible for users intent on griefing as I've seen recently to launch you with heavy attacks from bulkier weapons &gt &gt interrupting your looting during those precious 50 seconds&lt &lt . MP is broken the CPU load is ridiculous and all the elements of cultivation story progression item crafting and other minutia reek of clunk that detracts from the short bursts of genuine fun in the combat portions of the gameplay loop. Other than the obnoxious tendency of this game to become Monster Chaser Whirled combat as a whole is frustratingly good and shows the team behind the game is capable of reasonable balance and meaningful choices that all feel GOOD.But the way the game is right now I cannot recommend it. At least the cats are cute.Massive edit there's a game breaking bug on the final boss that has a good chance of corrupting your save.

2018-08-16,0,0,76,False,Recommended,40 hours logged in. Game is visually pleasing combat is smooth (controller haven't bothered on MK) and rewarding. However the game is plagued with terrible disconnections in lobbies. In it's current state if player wants to play with friends be prepared to get disconnected 60 percent of the time. Which means making a whole new lobby (also preparing again) and hoping it doesn't disconnect you mid quest again.

It's also kinda poorly implemented because first you need to watch the cutscenes then leave and then post the quest again to be able to do it in co op.Other than that I have 0 issues with the game it really feels good to play with it it has a ton of content and depth in it so If you are looking forward to play the game with alone then go ahead!

2018-08-16,0,0,58,False,Recommended,"Ok for starters a little background on my experience with MH. I have played games in this series since MH Freedom Unite 2 on PSP. The PSP 1000 the original PSP. Yea been playing it a LONG time. Played over 500+ hours on that a lot solo a lot w/ friends via various methods some legit and many not quite so much. Most of my experience has come from the PSP MH games this is the first non psp MH title I've played. That being said everyone who you read who complains about the issues with MP are correct. Currently there are a lot of connection issues and bugs w/ matchmaking. I haven't yet successfully played a MP match but heres the kicker I and many others spent years playing these games solo w/o complaining. Yea some of the fights are hard. So is Demon/Dark Souls. Just because you can't play MP all the time or at all in some unfortunate cases give them a break. Chill out go hunt some stuff solo and get your rank up and get better gear and learn how to be a good MP teammate anyways. Back in the day people including myself spent a LOT of time playing solo before we met anyone who even had heard of MH let aone played it and kept the game. The controls were hard to get used to. Just google Monster Hunter The Claw. There literally were videos about how to hold the PSP JUST to be able to play the game. The fact you can play with mouse/keyboard or twin joystick controllers is massive.Yes this game will turn the best rig into a toaster with its demanding reqs. So what? Does it mean its less fun? Nope. Dont get so wrapped up in the ""omg my 4k hdr FPS is 59.999999"" or ""why is it 30 fps "". Turn some things down and adjust and the game is still exponentially better looking than its predecessors. Graphics are the end all be all of games never have been. Its gameplay. You can get plenty of that without running on extreme settings. If you somehow got this far and are like ""well tell me about the game what is it about blah blah blah"" its simple (in no particular order of importance)1) You create a character and a catlike companion it is very heavy on japanese gestures and themes so if you dont like that kinda stuff try something else.2)Your ultimate goal is to hunt monsters. You start with small and easy monsters. You kill/capture them to use their parts to make better gear.3)You repeat #2 until you can take on much bigger and badder monsters all the while looking pretty darn amazing in the process.4)In the age of YouTube/Twitch/Insert Streaming Service Here you can take and post crazy videos of crazy monster interactions for the world to enjoy. One of my favorites is when you are hunting a giant Tyrannosaurus style monster and a giant Wyvern swoops down and pushes his face in. You are on the sidelines cheering like ""hahaha oh crap T Rex just had a bad day"". While you screenshot and start screen recording you get pwnt by some random OTHER monster who jumped in and now an even larger turf war just started. 5)The interactions between big monsters you really hunt and the smaller meeker monsters is pretty remarkable. For example a giant lizard monster may eat a docile herbivore type dinosaur monster. As he waddles away fat because hes stuff with the carcass of said docile monster T Rex guy shows up like ""dinner!"". Now they fight until one runs away. Sometimes they do kill each other. Sometimes not. Either way its remarkable to witness nature hunting itself as you hunt in nature. TLDR If you played MH before and aren't super picky about MAX SETTINGS you will generally enjoy this game. If you haven't you can learn to love MH just be patient. Learn to play on your own and don't rush MP. The better you are at killing and surviving solo the better you'll be when MP is fixed. This was the biggest this for CAPCOM on PC since uh yea nothing else mattered for them til this. BE patient learn from your mistakes and please for the love of everything decent don't believe all the negative before trying things out yourself.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,238,False,Recommended,I have 200+ hours on the console and felt it necessary to leave a review. I've played several Monster Hunter games and this one is by far to me at least the best one. They've improved the constrols and made weapons I was unable to master on the DS(the bow) so much easier to use. For people rating this down because the keyboard/mouse controls suck BUY A CONTROLLER. This game works so much better with a controller it's like a new game. I don't understand why you would want to play this game with a keyboard and mouse.For the people listing their high end gaming specs and complaining that the game is not optimized. I play this on a laptop and get 60FPS on medium graphics. I have no idea what you guys are doing wrong but this game runs smooth as butter(well unless it rains. Flashbacks to Friday The 13th). The connection issues are really bad the only reason I won't complain about them is because I can solo just about every monster. And even so the load times on PC are amazing. It takes literally 5 8 minutes on PS4 to load into a game. It's literally seconds on PC so I won't sit here and complain that I may have to back out of a hunt to reconnect with my friends. Because at the end of the day this game is fun and worth the extra minute it takes to reconnect. I highly recommend this game for Veterans of the series and beginners. It's easy to pick up and a lot of fun!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,273,False,Recommended,The game is very fun to play and I'm having a great time being introduced the Monster Hunter Series. I do wonder how bugs and issues that have been known to Capcom since the console realese 8 or so months ago have managed to find their way into MHW PC port. Despite the issues I am having a good time so far.The server issues are maddening and for me are the most frustratiing issue in the game. I can't understand how Capcom is having such connectivity issues STILL at this point in the games lifecyle make sme wonder if they are ACTUALLY commited to finding a solution or are they just cool with taking our money and and moving.With the Special K mod a community member put together I now have raw input in the game which has made the experience quite a bit better but shame on Capcom for not having this option by the time the PC port came out. Did you really thing PC players wanted to play witha controller still? If that was the case I would have just bought this for my Playstation I play PC for the mouse and keyboard. Sort you issues out Capcom because some of this basic should have been taken care way before launch. You know the PC market well enough to know what should be available in game and available to us.

2018-08-13,0,0,27,False,Recommended,I'm a long time fan of the series. Honestly I love this game its really taken everything that makes the MH series great and finally put it onto pc for me.Pro's NO LOOTBOXES PRAISE THE GODS the MH series has always offered new free content with extra quests armour etc being avalible. I suspect it will continue this way. Beautiful world Nice customization Diverse monsters that have attacks you expect them to have with carying movesets that change as play goes on. That thing your looking at has horns? its gonna try ram you. That thing may also use said horn to dive underground and bite you on the butt. A HUGE selection of diverse weapons that have multiple upgrade tree's to meet any hunters need (I personally love hunting horns charge blades bows and the insect glaive but thats really over used because its so much fun!) A nice variety of armour to make and collect. Its all beautiful. Very rewarding game that gives you a nice little happy boost when you finally take a tough monster down.Cons Story is ehhhhhh but lets face it its about the monsters. Can be a bit of a grind (dosn't bother me i like the grind but eh) currently connection issues (the game scales itself for single and multiplayer however and you can beat every monster alone with the knowledge you get from fighting so its not a huge issue for me)Tips Try every weapon. First timers are gonna gravitate towards the fancy weapons but getting the feel for the game with the sword and sheild or bow for an example will set you up for the more complicated weapons. make sure to visit the training area and get a feel of what you like. Watch the monsters look for patterns. This game is all about knowing what your up against. Fill your inventory with more than just stamina and health items. Traps bombs etc are all useful. Make sure you use them. You can head back to your camp to restock or change your weapons/ items. EAT BEFORE YOU LEAVE ON A MISSION it does genuinley help.Once they sort the connection issues out this game will be everything I wanted it to be.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I love this game and I know I'll end up with 300+ hours on it just as I did with the PlayStation version.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,710,False,Recommended,Short version i like this game alot.Long version This game has many good aspects to it and while at the time of writing this there are some server issues that they are working on with valve to resolve. Even with this its a mild annoyance amongst an overall enjoyable experience.Pros Responsive gameplay for an action game i beleive this is a keystone to the whole experience as a game with bad/unresponsive controls can really hamper the experience. Instead it feels like the game is fairly polished in this aspect.Qualify of life menu changes Coming from trying previous monster hunter titles i do feel the menus were very much streamlined for a less aggrivating experience my only gripe being the item wheel which i tend to end up using accidentally more often than not when i usually am just attempting to use the basic item menu.Challenging fights While the story mode is basically a long tutorial this isn't very unusual for a monster hunter game and while you get to the high rank monsters the later fights of even story make for some challenging fights. The Kirin maybe being the most difficult I had dealt with until now being a fight that i could not capture the creature and had to simply fight to the death and any damage i took was potentilaly a fight ender where a paralysis could mean the creature strining more lighting bolts even with my high resistance kadatchi set. High rank then of course adding to these creatures.Decent Net Code I know what you're thinking but the server issue is somewhat detached from this this more means that latency seems to more play into the hunter's interaction with you rather than your interaction with the monster. What i mean is I never ran into a point during a fight where latency was affecting a monster even in multiplayer and even when the servers would destroy/disconnect our session the game very seamlessly transitioned us all into 3 separate instances of the fight with the only hiccup that the monster might get a little confused if their current target was suddenly gone. Otherwise it seems the net code is in the player's favor at all times almost seeming to host local fights and trying its best to synchronize between players but never letting one player's connection/experience dictate moves/hitboxes/ect.. for others. This to me important as i've seen some games where any network interruptions could lead to your death simply because of a disagreement between the player and the server on monster/player placement and if you did/didn't get hit by an attack.Inbetweens(Not pros or cons) Hitboxes I find these to be middle of the road. They aren't Dark Souls 3 impressive where you see the slomo silly dodges that occur in there but they're ok. I found some monsters aren't as well polished as others though with the Diabolos being possibly the worst where i found many attacks that caused it to charge me/wave its head around attempting to hit me with horns or the tail attacks always felt to be a little off their mark but would hit me regardless. I also found times where I would attempt to do a jumping attack on a targer and would either have the game simply ignore the attack down to what seemed like the very pixel of distance or others where i was clearly off the mark but would not only get the damage but then mount the creature to continue attacking.Grind Much less than previous games but i still know people who can't stand the idea of any repeated content you will fight creatures more than once and possibly many times looking for rare drops. This is a simple fact of the game and yet I know some people will get this game and expect to have a very linear progression but instead you will need to realize this game is all about crafting stuff out of monster parts some of which just won't drop on the first few....or more attempts. I don't have a problem with it but others may.Cons Item menu This in combat is probably the biggest annoyance. I find myself desperately searching for items as i fumble with the game's pre defined order of items in it or accidentally opening the item wheel which i found the item wheel to be the greatest annoyance as I have yet found a way to escape it once i've brought it up until i use something from it. Potions antidotes or god forbid jerky/energy drinks are super painful to get to when you have to scroll through it. It makes me generally attempt to get down to bare minimum consumables but even then tranquilizers/traps are a general must on most missions. High CPU usage I hope this is soon corrected but currently this game is sitting at about 80%+ CPU usage. I have a Haswell i5 which is starting to show it's age but I find I need to make a higher level of effort to keep the room i'm playing in cool to counteract the heat this thing is starting to produce or else face the consequences of horrible framerate drops as CPU usage hits 100% as it fights with the 8% usage of the system and 8% of discord/other stuff. Now this is a very busy game and i feel some of this is warrented but i also look forward to some bugfix/performance patches going forward.Somewhat limited monsters This one would've been middle ground but to some degree i feel this also can be attributed to a little bit of asset reuse. Every zone has its varient of the little wyverns or jagra with their own theme thrown onto it. All the raptor esk creatures work similarly Wyverns are all similar with the Rathalos/Rathains being the only real shakeup to the equation just because they do their spin attack to poisen with their tails Tobi Kadatchi also being very similar to the Ordogoran. This somewhat works in the game's favor where you can see certain monster tells and know how to react to them but it also gives monsters a sorta modular feel where there's a base creature with some extra things thrown on with some basic model shapes/animations being utilized and a few unique ones being added on. This isn't to say unique fights don't exist but it does somewhat detract from the overall experience when you're already going to be farming certain creatures.Conclusion Overall i really like the game and I feel even though its not a perfect game as i've seen some sources claim i also feel the current kneejerk negative reviews about the current server issues (which only will impact you in multiplayer) are unfair to the core of the game when the issues are likley fleeting and will be adressed shortly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,"I decided on a ""No"" when recommending this game. Let me lead by stating I played hundreds of hours worth on ps4 and will continue to put in hundreds worth on pc as well. I am biased as hell on this game and it's the only reason i'm gonna keep playing because I ing love Monster Hunter games. After clarifying my bias towards it let's start with the main issue of this game the overwhelming amount of unaddressed bugs it has. There are more codes than I can even start to remember concerning the various connection issues in this game. Every hour it seems I have to google a new ""MHW code error XXXXX"" to try and find out what the hell is going wrong only to be left with ""capcom doesn't release what their codes actually mean so just reset your game and try it again"". All the answers are white knights saying ""It's your IP it's your DNS it's your peanut butter brand idfk"" this is getting ridiculous. We had these problems for MONTHS on ps4 and still continue to see them even now but nowhere near as often. My main problem with this is that I've already waited 6 months and paid 60+ more ing dollars for a port of a game i've already paid 60+ dollars and poured hundreds of hours in to just to be hit with the same problems i've already gone through. After the 8 month wait which is a ridiculous time to begin with (which all the white knights justified with more excuses than I can count with everything from ""be glad it's even coming to pc"" to ""It's because they're going to make sure it's a perfect port"" we're still hit with a rather half port with all the same problems. They need to focus on fixing the connectivity issues ASAP as that is the selling point of MWH. I truly love the game and always will. But Capcom doesn't seem to care that is wonky we bought the game they have our money gg. Overall opinion If MP worked 10/10 as is with unresolved issues that have lasted over 8 months and waiting making us wait over half a year asking people to pay twice for it not being able to reliably partake in MP 6/10.P.S. as stated I love the game and the issues alone are only part of the problem but combined with dealing with them on console waiting a long 8 months hearing t reasons why it's taking that long and promises of a good port only to be heavily let down leaves me with this review. If the issues weren't there and I hadn't spent 120+ on the same game with the same problems we'd had a different story.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,149,False,Recommended,For a first time Monster Hunter player I've instantly fallen in love. Monster Hunter World is what I've wanted for so long ever since seeing the original on Playstation 2. Everything from the deliberate nature of the combat the variety of weapons and play styles available and just the plain wonderful life and exoctic nature of the world. I was instantly pulled in. I can see why there's so much love for this franchise and how people spend hundreds of hours on it. If you're the type of person who enjoys a very measured combat system and enjoys the concept of killing big bad beasties until you're adorned in their bones and claws give this game a go you won't be disappointed. Happy Hunting.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,20,False,Recommended,I've spent nearly 4hrs of gameplay with this game running on my gaming laptop with a gtx 850 which is really outdated and so far I haven't experienced any issues. And for the mouse and keyboard issue and the sensitivity I didn't encounter any problems at all so I don't understand why people are having this issues. I'm running the game on low with 50 60fps and on medium a stable 30fps so personally for me it's well optimized than I'd hope for so I would really recommend this game its a good game.

2018-08-13,0,0,206,False,Recommended,As a long time Monster Hunter fan I recommend this game as it builds upon all previous iterations and delivers extremely updated visuals. Mouse and keyboard works fine though I find it is much more intuitive to play with a controller (all previous MH games were only on consoles mind you).Servers are pretty unstable currently but which online game has worked fine on day 1 or even month one? (it is still week one so I am being hopeful for the future)Overall the single player experience which is how I mostly have played is great and the new mechanics feel natural gone are the days where crossing a door to a new area would make you be in a safe zone now you are always in the same shared world but your hunter is now able to compensate for the lack of a safe zone with the ability to move around while consuming potions and most other items.The gameplay loop is what you would expect for a MH game you kill/capture monsters make new stuff from them to kill/capture more powerful monsters.At the time of writing this review I have just barely started with High Rank quests which are a bump in difficulty just as they have always been.Newcommers to the series should not feel a barrier as the earlier levels are simple enough where you can familiarize yourself with the weapons and environments before you get to a difficult fight. Also some great tutorials are in place replacing the hours of reading you would need to understand how to play in previous games.All in all a great game highly recommended if you are a MH fan and worth a look if you are interested in the prospect of fighting dragons/dinosaurs/etc that are at least twice your size (some monsters are literally mountain size).PS. I did wait until the PC port came along so I cannot compare it to console versions just to other entries in the series.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,158,False,Recommended,I hardly ever make reviews for games but MH is dear to my heart so here we go. Clearly this is all my opinion and you should always see what others have to say as well first.TL DR Monster Hunter World is a great game plagued with bugs. with a total lack of response from the developers at this time. Bugs range from very minor things to very severe ones. I would give it a few months then check to see what state it will be in then.Pros Auto Crafting is the best thing in the world By far the best visual MH game to date. Mouse and Keyboard controls are actually really really good. Gameplay is super nice and clean as always weapons feel like they pack a punch. The monsters actually mimic real world predators very well. It's quite impressive. The lobby size increase is very nice. The environment is very responsive and responses to the monsters moving about. The tracking and highlighting/tracking system is very useful and gets right to the point.Cons Total lack of communication on the developers part on if fixes are inbound or not. Lack of 21 9 support in any way We have the 1.0 build for some strange reason so things like slicing ammo are unerfed or unfixed. Rebalance is needed. Day one DLC DRM Many people have hard crashes on boot up rendering the game unplayable for some. The Steam Friend Toast is beyond annoying currently. Triggers roughly every 2 4 mins over and over again. Servers randomly D/C you quite a bit.Reason for the Review The game itself is really really good and very fun. I would argue the best Monster Hunter made to date however the PC port is just plagued with issues at this time. Normally that is to be expected. bugs happen after all but there has been a total lack of response from the devs in any way on whether or not a fix is being worked on to address them. For that I simply cannot give this a positive review because I just don't know if the game will work if you buy it or not. I understand that they wanted to take the time to get it right for PC and I respect that choice however they had a very long time and launching it in this state is just disheartening for me. It should have been pushed back in my opinion. Core PC support that many other small developer's support just doesn't exist for this currently. A small example of this would be a lack of a FoV slider in any form. I could go on but I will spare you. All of that said I would give them a positive review still however this time around I just can't simply because we just don't know if it's going to get fixed or not. At the time of this post there has been no response from the developers whatsoever on Reddit Twitter Steam Forums or Facebook on if a fix is in the works or not. Due to that I cannot in good conscience recommend it right now. If this chances I will gladly change my review later on. Until then it is a great game with amazing potential that is overshadowed by all the issues and complaints. For now if you are okay with spending retail for a buggy experience you may get your value for it otherwise I would avoid it and wait to see how it fairs in a few months.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,278,False,Recommended,As someone who has been a big fan of the series for several years I love monster hunter World. The game itself is amazing and looks amazing (atleast when I am comparing it to playing on a tiny 3DS screen). Honestly I would give the game an 8 or 9 out of 10.However this game does have many issues at the moment. This is less so with the game itself and moreso with the PC port. Many people are experiencing very poor performance and massive frame drops while playing. Even though the game has been running surprisingly well for me I can definitely understand why many players are unhappy with the current performance. On this note I strongly reccomend that people turn off the volumetric fog setting since it severely lowers your fps and honestly does not improve the visual quality much at all. In addition the severs and multiplayer have been quite wonky for the past while. I have had several issues with disconnecting randomly and having my game suddenly go into windowed mode while i am playing. Thankfully Capcom has stated that they are working on fixing some of these issues.Capcom should also focus on fixing the issues with lighting weapon effects and certain particle effects tanking the games fps in short bursts. This is particularly nightmarish when fighting a monster with multiple lightning bow and dual blade users and should be fixed as soon as possible.Overall if you are not to concerned with connectiong and performance issues I stongly reccomend this amazing game. However if you are concerned about multiplayer or not being able to run the game smoothly it may be better to wait a bit for Capcom to fix the issues. As a final reference I am playing this with AMD R9 390I5 469016 Gigabytes of RAMand while I have not specifically checked by FPS it has been mostly quite smooth with 60 fps and I believe of few dips during heavy combat (although this might usually just be because of lightning weapons) on high settings with volumetric fog turned off.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,161,False,Recommended,It is a really fun game that is a nice brake from nomral MMO formulas I have seen. gear isnt alwase about the next best thing but rather about what is best for the thing you are hunting.Swords feel like they have weight and you have to actully craft ranged ammo.It is a CPU intensive game and you can tell if your haveing isshues becuase cut seans might be a few min slower then the audio for them on higher setings. im runing it on a laptop and using nividias optimizer (even thouhgt i have a lower card then recmoneded it still runs rather well just has some potato quality textures on some things). foliage sway might be one to turn off as well if your haveing isshues.It is also a port and some of the controls are odd for keyboard. I still think mouse is the way to go for ranged but its up to you.I apparently have been palying it more like metal gear solid 5 and just collection all of the endemic life I can. there are rare version of them as well and like MGSV they are all worth points and whatever so its not a side thing as more it is just a thing. gathering also feel nice (and is fast) and they take a lot of things into accont so that its just fun rather then being an itme managment choir. you do have an inventory but most things like monster loot go directly to your larger store chest so you cant miss out on it plus there is auto crafting so if you have the materials you will just make more of somehitng in the field (its good for better healing pots ammo and otherwise).I have never palyed a monster hunter game before but its been a lot of fun. I will say the storie kinda just thorws you into it for better or worse but as I said its fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,376,False,Recommended,As a single player game probably is pretty fun. Definitely worth buying if that is your specific case. Assuming the multiplayer would be fun was pretty much totally wrong. The little it does work it can be enjoyable. Most the time it disconnects or is so picky on what cutscenes each person has or hasnt seen and having the exact same progression in the game that you cant actually play with friends. Shouldnt be selling this as a coop game. That really just isnt the case. Probably the biggest let down for me in recent memory. Would not recommend if wanting to join up with friends and play. One thing to also keep in mind is that some mission at least of now just do not work for coop. This isnt an alpha or beta. Its a full released game with a 60 dollar price tag. Will not fool me again.EDIT Still having major connection issues. Having 41% rating is much to high. Should be around the 25%. Must be people playing solo.Final Edit Put out a patch a little while ago and seems to have fixed the connection issues mostly. Still have been disconnected very rarely but not enough to really bother me. Would definitely recommend the game for solo or coop.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-31,0,0,359,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. First Monster Hunter ever. When it was first announced for PS4 i couldnt be bothered because i was busy with other games. I never even checked out the gameplay till it was announced that we'll be getting a PC version on Steam. I became a fan immediately after checking out the gameplay and graphics on youtube. It was MILES ahead of Dauntless(The game i was busy on at that time). I got this game on pre order thru a friend. He got it for me and another friend because he was too hyped for it. Which made us all go into this crazy hype mode. The day it got released on PC i was dissapointed. Not because of the graphics or how intense of a system you need to run this thing on the Highest Settings but on the fact that me and my friends kept disconnecting during a hunt. We figured that a big company like Capcom would have seen this coming and would have prepared the servers for launch day. However that didnt stop me and my friends. Eventhough we got disconnected probably 8/10 times during a hunt we never stopped playing because it was super enjoyable. Fast forward a week later the disconnect issues still goes on but 30% less than before(which is still annoying). It was extremely disappointing knowing that Capcom handled the situation very poorly. Two weeks after launch is when Capcom announced they are working on an update with Valve to fix the disconnecting issues and soon enough an update came and we disconnected only 10% of the time. WHICH IS AMAZING. Now that the major issues have been ""addressed"" should you buy this game? YES. It is an extremely good game and even more enjoyable when playing with friends. The only issue i have rightnow is content for the game. Me and many other players have essentially reach end game with multiple sets for multiple builds. Im at HR123 and there's nothing more to do besides grinding for jewels. PC version is still waiting on Lunastra Deviljho Kulve Taroth and Behemoth atm. I hope that Capcom will release those updates sooner than when they released it on PS4 just so we can catch up to the console players( I read an article which said that Capcom plans to release these updates on a faster pace compared to when console got it). Conclusion is I would definitely recommend MHW to anyone. The open world is extremely beautiful the gameplay is solid and the fun is out of this world. 7/10",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,195,False,Recommended,A great game behind some patchable problems. In time it'll be perfect. Already dumped in 37 hours of play since release. Yes. There are connection issues. With that said most of that 37 hours of play has been with them. You can get around the errors if you're patient. The game is beautiful and it runs well otherwise. There's not a mass of bugs and glitches either. WORLD has streamlined a lot of features from previous Monster Hunter games to eliminate some of the grind and help you focus on your goal each mission. It makes it easy to get items you need in expeditions and rewarding if you decide to spend some extra time and capture a monster. Monster battles are epic. Each weapon class feels great in the sense you have to pick between pros/cons of each one. You are picking a class and you have to consider how you want to battle and support your team as well. You also will witness plenty of monster vs. monster fights. If you don't let yourself become too frustated with another monster moving in on your fight you can use it to your advantage or just watch the spectacle. Friends and I witnessed a monster vs. monster vs. monster in the Rotting Vale and it was purely amazing.Controls can be clunky but some rebinding can do wonders. Or just toss in a 360 controller and you'll be good with a bit of practice. The game does have it's problems. But when you consider every game has a rocky start with servers/multiplayer and that it will be patched it's hard to really downvote it because of that. you'd have to downvote every other multiplayer game at release if you did that. There's a TON of content here. If you're patient and up for a challanging game it's looking like you'll get about 70 100 hours clocked in just going for a full sweep of the story and sub quests. That's a lot of game time for 60$ these days especially since some games just have a one and done of 8 hours sometimes *glares at every FPS game ever*. Honestly it's been painful for me to write this review because those are about 10 minutes I could have spent in this completely amazing game. Okay. I'm gonna go now.

2018-08-13,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"First impressions... This is the worst UI experience I've had since the original release of FFXIV.As a mouse user character creation was beyond frustrating. It was grueling. Simple intuitive concepts like point and click are context sensitive. You can point and click some things at times but not others. Pointing and NOT clicking can still result in a configuration change so moving the mouse pointer to the confirm button appears to change your configuration depending on the path it took.Furthermore simple actions like adjusting a slider bar require multiple steps (e.g. click the pane containing the slider bar click the slider bar to select it and then click and drag the slider bar and hope it doesn't release it unexpectedly). Why couldn't this be one action?Once you get through this torture a dialog box tells you to enter your name but you can't. The keyboard doesn't do anything at this point. With much effort invested in my chracter settings I'm wary of clicking confirm without entering a name. You have to click confirm and another dialog box comes up in its place that contains the actual text box. Why couldn't this be one step?On to the tutorial.The first thing is the camera control settings are hidden. They are not under controls or settings in the main menu. You have to enter the tutorial and they can be found under a separate and up to this point entirely inaccessble options menu.I'm not sure what the tutorial was trying to teach me besides that this game apparently wrests control away from the player for cut scenes more aften than it doesn't. Can't we tell the story without doing that?Once I had enough I found the ""Quit Game"" option and was told that I couldn't during the tutorial. Um you are mistaken game. Alt F4. Hmm they didn't implement that or have it disabled. Task Manager... End Task. Huh I can Quit Game afterall. Now watch as I test the Uninstall option.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,72,False,Recommended,Having played Monster Hunter since it's release on the PS2 I'm glad this game finally came to PC and I don't have to buy into whatever consolse the game is usually exclusive to.

2018-08-13,0,0,72,False,Recommended,"Nvidia GTX9608.00 GB RAMIntel (R) Core (TM) i7 2600 CPUthe game runs great after disabling the in game fog and I'm getting a consistently good fps. Since I don't own a ps4 this is my first go with the game. Relatively low amount of memory usage consistently. It's a really cool title and offers a ton of hours of gameplay. I was worried that I'd need to play with a controller but after cranking mouse sensitivity up to 70 or 80 and playing for a few hours I quickly got used to the mouse acceleration though supposedly the devs have noted they're working on a fix. It really isn't that big of a deal once you get used to it. I have an xbox controller with wireless adapter but choose to play with mouse and keyboard because it genuinely doesn't feel bad.If you're actually worried about it xbox 360 wireless adapters with controllers aren't an expensive fix and will help you out on many other titles. Just make sure you're buying legitimate as there are knock off adapters that'll have less in the way of quality. It's basically plug and play out of the box.Network connectivity is a bit quirky but I kind of expect it given the release. As far as I'm aware it's peer to peer but I've never had people get disconnected mid hunt when I host an SOS. Generally when I can't connect to the online and get that 83 MW1 error I back out and select ""host own game"" and from there it works. After hosting the initial game I can then connect to other players.Although multiplayer is definitely something I like I actually think this game is stronger as a solo game. It gives you the freedom to explore the environments while collecting bugs / fish / birds without feeling rushed to complete the hunt objective. One big criticism that I have is that this doesn't seem to have as many areas as past titles. But I guess quality is a lot more interesting than quantity in examples like this and that's really noticeable when you start inspecting the sheer amount of creatures in each ecosystem. It's a really cool experience with many hours of content.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I do have varible resolution on and to be frank I barely notice it. The only time is when i come back to town right after a hunt and it looks a little jaggy for a split second til i move the camera around and it orients itself. The multiplayer is convuluted there are design choices that dont make sense as far as not being able to start assignments in groups. (just make everyone watch the cutscene brah) or how if you disconnect from a session that is a friends session the game hides that sessions existance. But if you port forward for steam Peer 2 peer and take the hour two figure out its backwards logic. it functions im not saying its a wonderful multiplayer platform but it also isn't so horrendous as to keep me and my friends from the awesome experince contained within. Is this the most hardcore monster hunter experince? No. Is it better than I expected. Yeah by a lot. Largely these connection issues you see in the review are unproperly forwarded ports which is more an issue of steamworks peer 2 peer than the game itself. something i hope valve will take notice to after this.

2018-08-13,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR Great game horrendous PC port....First off The game IS indeed fun. As a MH fan ""World"" it is probably everything you ever wanted (just missing G rank).But the port? Oh boy did they mess that one up...On the technical side At times extreme CPU stress at over 90% (with a Ryzen 2700X...). Weird texture bugs where sometimes low res textures are loaded at max settings. Random disconnects which mess up multiplayer sessions.Regarding the controls No raw mouse input which makes the camera feel extremely sluggish (you'll get used to it eventually but it's still noticeable). The KB/M control scheme is a MESS since it just lazily emulates the gamepad control scheme and there's no support for fully customizable keybinds... The keyboard version of the radial menu is only accessible through the F keys and like already mentioned you cannot re bind them to other keys to increase ease of access to the menus. Why not give KB/M players the option to directly keybind items to keys instead of having to juggle through an emulated controller menu mess?!?Besides the technical issues the worst thing regarding the port to me is the absolutely messy KB/M control scheme where instead of building a new KB/M specific scheme from ground up they went the easy and lazy route by just emulating the gamepad control scheme with the keyboard and mouse without giving full customization options... I hope these issues get addressed by Capcom soon because the game itself is great! It's just a lazy half arsed port... /",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,73,False,Recommended,"I want to love it. But I never loved it. It has too many annoying nagging ""features."" Unskippable cutscenes and a ton of useless smaller cutscenes that drove me up the gd wall. I also want a different handler than the cliche ""I'm an overeater XD"" bioware dwarf. It's still a good game if you can ignore that stuff which for a long time I did and I still do mostly.But then the port started on my nerves. Frame dips in certain areas that weren't explainable with graphical settings. I've bluescreened once. Alt tabbing doesn't function properly in full screen. Windowed fullscreen runs like diarrhea in the summer. No Ultrawide support just 1920 with black borders. The final area has a microstutter that I simply can't get rid of. Volumetric may as well not have been in the game it causes so much strain. Lip syncing is awful on 60 FPS. Foliage sway has no options and is completely over the top.I still like the game. I still recommend it on console I recommend it here as long as you know your rig can run it at 60 frames. But this port needs work. Most importantly use my damn GPU.

2018-08-12,0,0,71,False,Recommended,"I should note first that I have been a monster hunter fan for about 5 or 6 years so it's hard for me to not recommend the genre as a whole. Coming from a non pro PS4 this game is fantastic. I've a GTX 1060 and a i5 7600k. The first two things I notice are the 2x FPS I'm receiving from 30 to 60 FPS from ps4 to PC. The second being the incredibly short load times I do have this game installed on an SSD but seeing streams of the game being run on non SSD I would say it's still an improvement. The load times to the game I would say have gone from 5 6 second to 1 2 seconds for me. Returning to the main hub from the hunting world has also gone from 3 4 seconds to maybe a second? These two things are more than enough for me to warrant it a purchase. Now that being said there are issues that I'm sure will be fixed. The multiplayer connectivity can be touchy I haven't had problems with it but it is for sure common enough among PC players. As for performance you can look up some tweaks to help if you're running anything at or above a GTX 970 you should be getting at least 50 60 FPS with a decent processor at medium high settings. I switched the graphics settings to low and honestly I can live with it. It's not like you're going from current gen graphics down to Monster Hunter on PS2. The other issues are those that I don't expect to ever be fixed at least not within this game. Maybe in a sequel. The multiplayer handling is blah. Requiring two or more people to see a cutscene before joining each other's game it's' stupid but it's there to stay imo. It's there. To stay. But if you play hundreds of hours past the story mode it becomes not too big of an issue BUUUT that's a stupid statement too. ""Only 30 of 300 hours you play are a hassle."" That's still 30 hours.

A lot of improvements have been added from the previous titles the gameplay is as solid and as enticing as ever the mechanics and the crafting system is interesting. The only problem right now is the connectivity problem and the lack of some basic graphic options such as motion blur. The reason there are many negative reviews in the steam is because of this trivial matters while the gameplay itself is really fun interesting and addictive. Additionally the graphics are also beautiful and the atmosphere just hits the pleasure spot for the eyes. &gt If you're a solo gamer someone who would like to play this kind of game alone and enjoying it feel free to buy it at the current state. &gt If you want to play this with your friends I can't recommend it for now because of the connectivity issues and problem.

2018-08-13,0,0,85,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is more accessible than it's ever been before.As of release a lot of people are having some connection errors but that's likely the fact that Capcom wasn't prepared for the load of people playing. They have stated that they're working on the network issue. I've been able to play a significant ammount of time with randoms and my friend so I haven't encountered many problems but that's just my experience.Monster Hunter has always been a niche game in the west so you really can't blame capcom for this.I love love love Monster Hunter. I've been a fan since Unite on the PSP and I keep coming back to it. The Monster fights are challenging and I can't get enough of all of the different weapon types. This game is oldschool in the way that you commit to your attacks. You can't just roll out of mistakes you deal with the consequences. Some people will say that this is a bad thing but I think that type of gameplay is core to the Monster Hunter experience. You have to look before you leap and think before you swing.Know that this Monster Hunter is more inclusive and easier than any that have released and some still find it difficult. I chalk that up to what's stated above and that the control scheme (while brilliant with a controller plugged in) can be confusing to new players. The difficulty does ramp up in some places but those I think become essential learning experiences for the player. I for instance didn't personally have much problem with Anjanath but I can see why newcomers would be especially daunted. The feeling of smashing parts on a monster and the eventual victory is enough to keep anyone going. I really do subscribe to the belief that EVERYONE is a Monster Hunter fan it just hasn't clicked for you yet. MHW proves that it really does appeal to more than just a niche audience.Please give this game a chance.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,25,False,Recommended,"I don't normally bother to write reviews but with the mass of negative reviews that don't match my experience with the game in anyway way I thought I'd put my opinion and experience out there.My PC is good but my CPU is becoming a bottleneck with recent games. When I saw the minimum requirements I was worried because my CPU is below the minimum. To my surprise with a bit of adjustment to the graphics settings I was able to play the game on medium high graphics and it runs very smooth. I have had no crashes in the 15+ hours I've played so far and have enjoyed every minute. So far my experience has vastly surpassed my expectations of the port quality.The only problems I've had were Tweaking the graphics took a bit of time but wasn't difficult. The ""twitch now"" chrome extension popups (when someone starts streaming) cause the game to change to windowed mode until you go back to the MHW window. Mid battle that can be very dangerous. I don't know if other popups also cause this problem but it hasn't been annoying enough to ruin the game for me. And the keyboard and mouse controls worked but didn't feel quite right. Controller has worked great though (XBox 360) and feels good.The last thing I'll say is that I've been waiting for Monster Hunter to come to PC for years (What's the point of killing monsters and making cool armor and weapons out of them if the graphics are too terrible to appreciate the way they look?) and the port is so much better than I had expected and the game has been as fun as I hoped. If you are unsure about getting it just buy it and see if it runs okay on your machine (and refund it if it doesn't) but also mess with the graphics some that could make all the difference.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a fantastic gem I would recommend to anyone looking for an action packed challenge! TLDR is that this is an action game where you use one of many different types of weapons to defeat large monsters that plague the locals and use the parts you get from those monsters to make better gear and fight stronger monsters. I put many hours into the PS4 version and am planning on putting just as many if not more into this version.Pros Visually Stunning Challening but rewarding gameplay loop that can go on almost forever Awesome range of customization in gear and weapons New content being adding in over time (And for free!) in the form of new monsters gear quests and seasonal events Runs really well on my machine (1080p on a 980Ti and older AMD CPU) Really friggin cute cats that fight by your sideCons Currently there are some server connetion issues that are pretty common. I found a communty fix in the forums for it and it seems to be working for our group but it most likely has to do with the servers being super populated at the moment. Console servers had the same issues so once the game popularity cools off and goes to a normal level the servers will stabilize and have less issues. Denuvo. As others have stated it's a thing on this title. I have had 0 issues with it so far however I understand how it can be a deal breaker. That's all I can think of for now Ive gotta get back to hunting. Seriously if you're on the fence I would get this game. It's really awsome and the community is super amazing as well!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,123,False,Recommended,Firstly let me say that this is my first Monster Hunter game. So this review is based purely on what I've seen in Monster Hunter World. Also I'm running this on an i5 7400 with 12GB of RAM and and AMD RX470 4GB graphics card.Pros Gameplay is pretty fun Many weapon types which makes for nice variation The soundtrack is good It's on PCCons Connection issues expect alot of disconnection errors Very high CPU usage and CPU temps (Probably Denuvo) No 21 9 support The handler is annoying I know there's a story quest available I don't need to be pestered about it. Unskippable cutscenes.Edit I'm now 70 hours into the game following the past weekend being plagued with network errors I have decided to change my review to not recommended. As someone new to the Monster Hunter franchise I would like to say that the game itself doesn't explain a lot to you by the time you reach the quest to hunt Diablos you kind of hit a wall playing solo. I believe this game was marketed as a multiplayer game so it that regard it falls short. I understand that Capcom is addressing the multiplayer issues and until these issues are fixed I would say buy it at your discretion. That being said this is an awesome game just disappointed that the delay getting it to PC so that would get it right was all for naught.TL DRBuy the game if you want to play solo a lot if like me you want to play with friends then wait for the issues to be resolved.EditSeems the connection issues are fixed.

2018-08-16,0,0,231,False,Recommended,Multiplayer seems to be fixed so I am changing my review to positive as I promised! This is my first Monster Hunter game but I've become quickly addicted to it. For a newcomer like me I'd essentially describe it as a souls game but with more giant dragons and complex weapon move sets. Also just like a souls game there can be some extremely frusterating moments where I felt cheated by mechanic hitbox stun etc. but ultimately I've found that practicing and learning about each monster has made things much easier. My biggest gripe since I like to play Fashion Souls is the lack of customization when combing various sets of armor for a build but other than a few hideous frankenarmor sets I've made it hasn't been too bad. Multiplayer is where I have the most fun by far especially when finding a team of competent players to hunt with. This is why I initially gave a negative review because I had such a hard time playing online due to sever issues. I think the graphics are fine although I had to do some adjusting to achieve stable FPS. There are moments when everything seems a bit washed out but I think it has to do with specific lighting in certain environments and it isn't a major issue.Finally as a cat lover Palicos are pretty much the greatest thing ever! .,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,254,False,Not Recommended,Currently a buggy terribly optimized half baked port.Recommended waiting for confirmed patches if you want to enjoy anything other than single player.Gameplay is decent. Feels like a very unresponsive dark souls clone with awkwardly mapped controls and 3x the item management. Reminds me of The Surge's slower gameplay but somehow even slower than that. If you can get used to feeling like the buttons are reversed from every kind of action game ever (almost like you're playing southpaw with normal sticks) then you'll find enjoyment in the fighting though.The combat is very deliberate and every button press can either be very satisfying or usually lead to instant death.The main draw is that almost every fight is a boss fight. You'll feel accomplished after every engagement. However certain enemies are definitely very recycled... The 4 rathian rathalos variants... Water fish and fire fish... Dodogama and great jagras.. diablos and black diablos... all use the same animations from their class or have almost exactly cloned moves and basically have the same model. A lot of people say to ignore it... But if you choose to pay attention it gets really noticable.Armor customization looks HORRIBLE and for being a relatively late game unlock it's super disappointing unless you want to look like a fruit yogurt with spikes.As a first timer to the series I would give it a 9 10 overall at full functionality simply because i love boss fights. However in its current state of broken BS... I think it deserves nothing more than a 5 or 6.I'll update when patched.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,This is not a multiplayer / coop / mmo as you expect. Its more single player with being able to get someone to help you beat a monster. You cannot party up with friends and complete the story as a team or at least it dont look like it as the menu system is a bigger joke.You can join a session with friends but you do not see them in the game. You run around the town always alone. Any mission that has a cutscene (which is most of them) cannot be done coop.

2018-08-22,0,0,185,False,Recommended,I started my love for MH when I picked up Freedom 2 on the PSP honestly one of the best game experiences I had as a kid played tri on the DS a few years ago so I'm basing my review for a solo player as I never had any friends that played MH games and was never botheered about playing online.I've been riding the hype train since this got announced a year ago and can safely say this game has been one of the few (if not the only) games that has not been a let down or gotten worse than its prequals it still feels like the OG MH's but I'm able to play it at incredible beautiful graphics. I don't have anything against hand held consoles but their controls aree a bit naff so Capcom bringing this to my PC it's a dream come true.But obviously I understand the servers are horrific and will reccomend if you are getting this game purely for co op wait until Capcom get their together and sort them out even the LP2 servers are more stable than this.But if you're able to play solo for now this gives the full MH experience as any other before it and would hate to see Capcom feel driven away from publishing anymore MH games or content for the PC just because of their own server issues I can name alot of other games with this issue such as GTA 5 but it's only been 2 weeks so heres to hoping they do salvage them because this community is amazing and makes the game a bunch moree fun when playing together.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

THe game has a slighy smaller roster than I would like but Capcom appears to be supporting the game quiet well based on the PS4 event quests I've heard about. Online play issues are a minor inconvinience but the game can be played solo and doing so is the best way to learn new weapons or get better at fighting monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,304,False,Recommended,Pros Rewarding and Highly Varied Skill Based Combat Noob Friendly But Depth For Advanced Players Grind is Rewarding and Fun Badass Moments are Frequent Story Quests Make You Feel Cool You Get To Mount Monsters and Stab The ers In the Eye Huge Fun With Friends and Skilled GroupsCons Connecitivity Issues (which are significantly less now) Game Doesn't Explain Everything so Research Required Story Isn't Very Compelling NarrativelyMHW is basically the RPG I've been waiting for. Each monster has a unique enough move set to remain interesting despite killing them more than 20 times. Grinding for gear feels rewarding and meaningful so much so that I wouldn't really call it a grind because I was having fun the whole time. The story is fun and feels cool to progress through (but it's hardly a compelling narrative). The variety of combat styles gives you enough options to find what really resonates with you and gives those who like to change things up plenty to do. The skill system is also very interesting and lets you play anything from tank (in the sense of taking damage better aggro control doesn't exist really) to support to dps.I love the game despite the HUGE issues with connectivity that existed at launch. They are still present to a very minor degree now but its not completely resolved. Regardless these issues are infrequent enough that you won't be anywhere near as as those who were playing on opening weekend.The game has huge amounts of depth to explore especially for theory crafters as much of the game is left unexplained. Despite this no theorycrafting or seriously elite skill is necessary to play the game. The depth just makes you stronger and kill monsters faster its not a requirement. That being said there are a lot of things I wish I knew before I started so look up some videos on begginner tips before starting to play. To list a few off the top of my head Capturing monsters gets you more materials (look it up) progress through the story is more important than grinding for gear until you get high rank (11) complete optional quests to unlock better facilities around base everyone weapon has a lot more moves and mechanics than the training area will tell you always have bounties up always do an investigation over an optional quest if you are grinding for gearI can't recommend this game enough and hope to see you out there!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,327,False,Recommended,With having 203 hours on PS4 right after it first released then putting it down until it came to PC and already having 123 hours put into it I can't recommend this game enough. Of course this game is not for everyone no game is. And it has it's obvious flaws such as no way to turn of motion blur constant disconnects and errors and big frame drops when fighting certain monsters like the Teostra (all of which I hope are fixed in the near future) Despite all that I have still enjoyed most if not all the many hours I have put into this game. And with more content and fixes on the horizon I can't wait to play this game for many more hours to come. If you've ever been on the fence about monster hunter I would higly recommend this game however I would also recommend you go and search for videos on both the positives and negatives about this game to see more in depth about it and decide for yourself if it's really for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Want to help your friends advance in a story quest? Enjoy waiting 10 15 minutes while they wander around enough to watch all cutscenes. Then you get smacked with a ""Failed To Join Quest"" bug that can only be fixed by reposting the quest which can't be done for story quests. There is also a fairly common disconnect problem with players who are in your game where everyone is instantly dropped from the session but all are left with a monster that has it's stats boosted from the fact it became a ""multiplayer monster."" Unlike games like Diablo the stats for the monster are not reset back to normal and you are left with something that now takes far longer to kill by yourself than if you had just done the quest solo. The game is also extremely unoptimized it seems to run like crap and puts far too much workload on the CPU rather than the GPU. Effects from monster elements like lightning and fire cause extreme FPS dips.

2018-08-14,0,0,107,False,Recommended,I'm a Monster Hunter fan and this game does satisfied my need and wants from this game.Summary Bad Connection is bad!Lack of some graphic options (motion blur screen shaking FOV)Middle Ground Story is blahFrame drops but not so badItem management (Item wheel to be exact)Good Monster Hunting! Hunt them down!14 Weapons Many ways to fight!Exploration!Starting from the bad Connection is terrible! It's either my friends who get disconnected or I do. It definetly brings the fun out of this game whenever you disconnect from your fellow hunters.The lack of graphics option that goes beyond what they already presented. For example the motion blur the shaking of the screen the field of vision and a bit of other stuff. Note that the game is still playable but for others like myself who likes motion blur to be off or my partner who gets motion sickness from the shaking of the screen this game can give you small stomach churn.Things in the middle Story sucks but this game was never meant about the story although I wish we can skip some cutscene...Frame drops happens here and there. We all wanted to play this game at 60 fps with high graphics but when fighting 2 or 3 monsters it's a bit crucial to have atleast a constant frame rate.Item management seems a bit of a pain when you want to do crafting or grab things for your next hunt. Most notable the item wheels it does not save for me at all and even then it does not work the way i like it too. Of course you can turn this off and use it like the old monster hunter. Other than that setting up your loadout for each weapon you have it's a lot easier than the old game.The good Hunting Monster of course! Almost every monster has a different way of fighting them even with the same weapon the monster can go a bit unpredictable and one wrong move can cause you a cart (Lives)14 Weapons many ways to kill a monster! I love the variety of ways you can play this game! For me I play the lance and the heavy bow gun. For the lance i like to evade everything and jump and mount the monster but other times i can play as a tank and take everything from the front! For the heavy bow gun i can pierce through monster from long range and play like a sniper or i play like a maniac and shotgun it all the way through. Those are some example on how you can play with the weapons but different ways.Exploration is incredible! You pick things up so much quicker and have an infinite amount of time to explore and see everythings. Great times to relax and find the materials you need.Overall I really love this game and I do enjoy this game solo or with others (mostly solo). At this time (because of the connection problems) soloing is my main way of playing this game. If you're okay playing a game that is difficult and willing to learn this game can be great! Keep in mind this game isn't for everyone if you hate boss fight or grinding this isn't for you.

2018-08-14,0,0,112,False,Recommended,I understand why people don't like this game Requires a good pc to play for only decent visuals you need to have stable internet for multiplayer because there is no reconnect button there are a decent amount of bugs and it's hard to get into if you expected this to be an easy AAA game.But for all those who played early MH games that are used to gameplay &gt visuals and have a stable internet connection this is a must buy. It made everything that was annoying before easier they lowered the grind by a decent amount for the rare stuff and the weapons are really fun to play (especially the ranged ones). The monsters are fun as always.For people who didn't play previous iterations while the barrier of entry definitely lowered it will be still hard to get into. This game mostly focuses on bossfights (which are easier than darksouls in the beginning but get harder than it later) has weapons where you need to watch a youtube video to understand and their tutorial is still weak. A friend who played monster hunter will definitely help. Should you buy it? If you played the previous iterations yes you should. If you have a friend who will help you understand most mechanics yes you should.

2018-08-14,0,0,98,False,Recommended,I have been playing monster hunter for a long time now and have always wanted a PC version of the game. However a western release of Frontier seemed like it was never going to be too happen so eventually I shrugged this off as a dream. When they announced world I was excited to see I was wrong!This game is absolutely amazing and the quality of life changes mean it's now more accessible than ever to new comers (past games were a bit tougher to get into). I played through it on PS4 and still jump on there now and again and it was a blast! The feel of the weapons the community everything was right. On the PC I found a technically better version with more freedom to customize my experience as well as impressively instant loading times when compared the console version. I am immensely excited to play through this game again with people who haven't been able to experience it before and so far I'm loving it! I'm disappointed at the community however.. Lots of whining and complaining about crap. I'm glad to see there are still people who are mature enough to focus on the positive instead of complaining about minor issues that aren't even affecting everyone. Personally I have had no problems whatsoever in my 7 hours of game play so far. On the contrary even with a not very exactly top of the line gaming laptop and Mid graphics the game looks and feels amazing and noticeably different from the console version. It runs smoothly and at near 60 fps all the time. Thank you for the amazing port Capcom I am sure the issues people are having will be addressed quickly and you will continue to provide us with amazing content!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game if your intentions are to mainly play with friends.

All this for a 10 minute fight with a monster rinse and repeat. I understand that I only have 9 hours played but my intentions were to play with friends and more than 50% of that time is spent playing solo while I'm in discord with my friends trying to get in each others sessions.Besides that the game is very fun for solo players and people who dont mind shooting SOS flares to play with strangers.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Surpassed all of my expecations. The weapons are all incredibly deep and very different (excluding light/heavy bowguns. Still a different feel but most of the same actual attacks.) The monsters are fun boss fights and I love how they get more dangerous and creative at the end of the hunt when they know their life is on the line. Honestly cannot recommend this game enough and apparently all of the dlc coming with new content will be free which is just fantastic. Yes multiplayer disconnects alot at the moment but obviously that will be fixed. It's downright criminal to see so many people giving this game a negative review over issues like this that have a 0% chance of being unresolved.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,44,False,Recommended,I've been a fan of this series since the first game in 2004 and it's a dream to be able to play it on PC. The benefit of playing at a smooth 60 FPS (seriously lower settings until you can get to 60FPS) over the 30/sub30 on PS2/PSP/3DS is so huge. Game feels so much more responsive.If you've never played one before I should say beforehand that the game has a very specific style that is so satisfying to me but can be a bit of a learning curve to get into for complete newbies. This entry into the series is by far the best however as they go through all of the aspects of hunting in good detail in the storyline quests. I actually recommend you play the story missions solo so you don't miss out on utlizing specific game mechanics as they're introduced.I will say that the servers right now suck horribly they drop connection within an hour of play each time I've played. Once this is fixed though then the game should be great. The multiplayer coop is super satisfying however I really do caution learning through the story before jumping into MP as relying on other players to do certain parts of the hunt for you too many times may cause you to not understand all of the game mechanics.Combat is the best its ever been from my perspective. Each weapon is varied and unique and all of them recieved some new moves or updates from previous games. The combat is similar to but not exactly the same as non locked on Dark Souls. While there is lock on in this game I recommend switching it to the lockon type that resets camera on the monster on button press rather than the follow camera the follow camera makes the game much harder to control your character. Basically you have specific movesets that flow into eachother (and there are button prompts in the top right corner so you can always check what moves you can do next) and they go off exactly as you press the buttons in the direction you are facing. So positioning your hunter is very important not just to avoid enemy attacks but to successfully connect your own. This is a bit of a difference from many other games but lets you have complete control over your character and let's you fell so cool when you dodge an attack and follow it up with one of your own.This game is a polished ideal of its design. If you're not interested in fighting monsters to get more gear to fight bigger monsters then you should probably look elsewhere. But if you are interested in really refined combat then boy you can't do better. This is a game where the core gameplay is grinding monster battles and you love it because fighting the monsters is so much fun.They really REALLY need to fix the servers so the MP works properly and doesn't drop constantly it's the only reservation I have about the game. I should also note that I play using a PS4 controller and a mod to show PS button prompts. I have too much muscle memory from PS2/PSP and 3DS to switch to M/K. I have briefly toyed with M/K and there's some mouse acceleration issues (can't disable) but otherwise the control scheme is fairly intuitive if you don't have access to a controller.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,61,False,Recommended,"There are far far too many negative reviews for this title even in its current state. I'm going to use this review in order to address some of the issues.My computer was built a couple years ago with hardware that was a year or two old. Not cutting edge by any means at this point and I can run the game pretty darn well. The performance issues I've had appear to be a bit of lag every now and then unconnected to any elemental weapons (which many negative reviews report) and a couple instances of what seemed to be memory leaks wrapping up the mission and restarting the client fixed it. Don't expect to be able to run the game on a potato or a toaster (or worse a Macbook) though.Aside from issues on the topic of graphical features the volumetric fog is pretty bad. Disabling it not only improves your FPS but makes the game look far crisper. Also while the FPS rate is unlocked distant creatures clearly have a locked lower FPS rate to their animations. This is most noticeable in open areas where you can see flying creatures sufficiently far away. However as soon as you're anywhere close enough to actually engage the animations match the FPS rate of the game itself. There might be a setting to change this but I haven't seen it. Beyond that the game world and the denizens within it is gorgeous.The gameplay itself is very fun and the game hands you an instance of every starting weapon so you can feel free to try different things. Monsters have different parts that have different damage resistances and weaknesses whether that's slash/blunt/pierce or elemental in nature. Melee weapons need to be sharpened every now and then and ranged weapons need to keep track of reloading and ammo. Certain weapons (Kinesect &amp bowguns) can be given mods to adjust different parameters. Everything can be upgraded with materials gathered from monsters and the environment and you can have multiple instances of types of weapons and gear so at any given time your closet can be full of whatever you need for the task at hand. Meals can be eaten and some consumables and buffs used in order to influence any given fight as well.The controls are not great. They're not awful but they could use some improvements. It's difficult to expect too much though because taking advantage of what the keyboard can offer means changing the game far away from the console version which is somewhat unreasonable to expect from a developer on their first port. I recommend playing melee with a Controller rebinding whatever controls don't seem intuitive to you and only resort to KB&amp M if you're ranged. However it's definitely possible to get used to even the KB&amp M controls even if some of them are clunky.Also pro tip 'C' by default toggles the aiming reticle. You don't have to hold down V. That's another (IMO ridiculous) major source of negative reception I've seen online.Now here's the big thing co op. Missions are divided into Assigned Optional Events and Investigations. There are also Expeditions which is just going to a place and exploring and gathering with no goals. Assigned missions involve the ""Main Quest"" and the storyline the game tries to tell. These quests can contain some bits such at cutscenes that the game forces you to experience solo. Once you get past those bits you can fire an SOS Flare and continue the mission co op. All other missions etc. can be done co op from the get go. This has caused a lot of frustration and confusion as to how the game is played and is a source of a lot of the negative reviews. Just play the Assigned missions solo join SOS Flares to help your friends after you've beaten those missions yourself and play everything else co op.The biggest existing issue is the Networking. Players can start Online Sessions which is a kind of closed server/hosted server deal that 16 people can join. Any given mission can have a maximum of four players. Big monsters are scaled based on the number of players on a given mission. Players can join any SOS Flare mission from any Online Session not just the one that they're in. If anyone on that mission disconnects their slot remains reserved the monsters stay scaled and the rewards are still divided. The disconnected player can't rejoin the game if there are no unreserved slots left. This is a major misstep in my opinion and is magnified as an issue given all of the connection issues most people have been experiencing.On the connection issues it appears that while MHW has some back end issues going on for sure MHW is also possibly a victim of some of the new changes to Steam. There are some Launch Settings in Steam that has solved the connection issues for a lot of players all having to do with the new Friends GUI Big Picture and connection protocal (tcp/udp). I've played pretty often since release and some days my friends and I disconnected every single mission and on other days there was not a single disconnection in hours of gameplay. It's very random. We're still waiting to see how the launch settings go for us but it's looking positive so far.Overall the game is definitely worth it. There are issues that need to be addressed certainly but the developer has been both responsive and receptive. The majority of negative reception is overly critical of the overall game experience and a lot of common issues can be addressed with some additional information. This game absolutely does not deserve a (at the time of writing) 42% positive rating it deserves far higher. It's a genuinely enjoyable game even with the frustrating issues at this time and it will only become more enjoyable once those things are ironed out.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,/// Barely 65 FPS (with 4 players) with a GTX 1070 and a I5 7600K ///I have been a fan of Monster Hunter since it release on PSP. MHW does a great job at introducing you at new features amazing maps and great looking new monsters however it's hard to reccomend. I did the math and 12 out of 25 online quest I would get DC/ed and that's not fair. I am aware that you can rejoin a session after you DC/ed but still would bug you and won't allow you to join again after two times. It is extremely frutrating being disconnected from a Story Quest if you try to rush the story mode you will be undergeared and it is extremely hard to make good gear against strong monsters when you keep getting disconnected and are undergeared. Plus the fact that when someone joins the mission the difficulty gets adjusted to the number of players (the monster gets a Maximum HP increase) and then you will have to solo than monster after being disconnected with a really high HP. My solution was to brute force the arena quest (short quests in an attempt to finish the quest ASAP before getting disconnected) then soloing all my Story Quest after making gear. If you solo you would easily take 30 minutes or more vs a monster if you go with 4 people it would take around 15 minutes.

2018-09-06,0,0,209,False,Recommended,I've played this game for just under 80 hours so far at this point in time I give this game a thumbs up. Having played Monster Hunter games since Monster Hunter Freedom Unite I have seen the game change and evolve through the follow up games that came after that. This is NOT the Monster Hunter of old but it is what I wanted in a PC port of a Monster Hunter game on the PC. New mechanics new gather systems new and old monsters with more to come makes me excited. I look forward to seeing more content added and I hope the developers continue to do a splendid job addressing any issues that come along. My top highlights that this game offers This game is approachable for everyone. While I breezed through the monsters like a hot knife through butter I chalk that up to experience in the Monster Hunter genre in general. Any new player that would pick up the game would not have an overly hard time getting into the game. (I.E. They won't have the experience I had in MHFU when I couldn't get past the first Khezu without hammering my head through a ton of trial and error fighting.) This game offers experienced players to feel acomplished with their in depth knowledge of how the game works to make it easier for them overall. This game allows you to in most cases go into a mission and come out of it using only the barest minimum of resources. Some may think this is a bad thing that it is too 'hand holding' for new players but I like to think of it as putting my experience to good use and having good results. Group hunts are challenging yet satisfying. So far every group hunt I have had has been a success and I truly appreciate being able to play with my friends from around the world. While the connection issues were bothersom for one of my many missions it was a very minor impact on my overall experience. My top dislikes for the game There are a lot of things you have to remember to do before and during a hunt. This is probably the only part that isn't very approachable for a new player. I've gotten used to it but I still find myself forgetting one or two things sometimes before leaving for a hunt. Sometimes I experience FPS drops while fighting the Kushala and Teostra. It has never caused me significant frustration having grown up with a potato computer in the past but I feel like now that I have a fairly decent gaming PC I should not be having such issues. This game runs my CPU hotter than any other games I have though that is more likely because I am air cooling my CPU so this is subject to that fact.

There's a lot to take in and get used to but I'm having a blast (Wyvernfires especially) and I expect to sink hundreds of hours into this game maybe even thousands. For newbies Monster Hunter has a steep learning curve. It's unlike any other games out there. But once you get the hang on things this game is VERY rewarding and frequently has you jumping out of your chair and fistpumping the air. Excellent game. Absolutely recommend to anyone.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,161,False,Recommended,This game is a blast to play with friends and is easily a time sink. Grinding out monster parts with your bros and trying out different crazy weapons is crazy fun. There are so many kinds of varied weapons it's like playing whole new games when you swap them out. The thrill of hunting a huge beast through the wilderness to then stalk and kill it like its a boss straight out of Dark Souls is sure to give you a rush.The downside of the game is that it isnt well optimised and frame rates are incredibly inconsistant even with a beefy rig. The connectivity issues are a constant worry in the back of your head (unless you're playing solo but why would you want to do that?). The grind is intense but since there are so many materials to gather and so many things to do with them not to mention all the quests and bounties to keep you occupied. It will come down to your tolerancefor such things.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,164,False,Recommended,"SO with seeing that the overall score or review is mixed I'd like to give my two cents as someone who played this game on the PS4 for 430+ hours.Monster Hunter is pretty much ""the"" game that defined the hunter genre alongside God Eater with MHW being the newest addition and streamlined. With its release on Xbox and PS the game showed how popular the series is in the West and now its addition and modding support on PC the series will have incredible room to grow. Banter on this topic done its best to start talking about the elephant in the room and address this games Cons and Pros espcially the PC version.Pros to this game is that unlike its console variants load times are nearly none existant. Accept a quest loaded in 5 10 secs load into a map done in moments traveling to the gathering hub or workshop via chain...instant. This is a huge plus since the load times on console is pretty damn long all things considered hell you could make a cup of tea in the time it takes to load it all. The FPS and video quality. Its by far better then console especially our FPS. The FPS can generally be so damn smooth that it just looks and feel amazing but not all machines will have this nor are the settings perfect. Getting the right video settings to attain this ideal state might take some time but once you find them its a beautiful game. When it works multiplayer is fun as hell. Lastly Capcom already has and will deliver new content via monsters and event quests. These are all free btw ""FREE"" the first Mon to grace us will be Deviljho our great Pickle then Kulve Tarroth then Lunastra and finally Behemoth. Events too will be cross game collabs to give us Ryu/Sakura armor Devil May Cry Mega Man and FF14. These are what are currently out that I remember and keep in mind more will come and be added as the PC version catches up to the console Event/Monster release rotation (PC will be on an accelrated rotation till it syncs up). The only paid content thus far have been cosmetics and stickers and even those are amazing.So the Cons lets get this out of the way. The game is not perfectly optimized yet its not bad but its not great. My rig has decent parts two 980s sli'd and at med high my computer sees 90 95% CPU usage. This to me is a bit of an alarm because nothing has brought my rig past 60% CPU capacity from just one program or game. The video setting are not really ideal in seeing how it will affect and change how the game will look and playout till after finalizing the changes and being in the middle of an Expedition or mission some changes requiring a restart. So definite room for improvement here. Next multiplayer currently its a pain in the for some if not most. As with most new releases multiplayer via the servers are flooded and unstable thus disconnets. Its frustrating and annoying but these things generally get fixed and sorted out in a week or so we all know this so why complain. Yeah we know these problems happen so why do they keep happening? Its because of cost and projected overall server load for long term the other potential here is a coding issue on Denuvo or Steam to at which point again will be solved in a week or two. Its not perfect but these issues get worked out with clear communication and patience. Lastly that some my consider a Con the grind. The first point on this is unlike previous MH titles the grind for materials for armor and weapons is pretty damn generous and not as painful. The costs are generally low and armor upgrades only use armor spheres instead of spheres and materials. The material grind then comes down to rare materials like plates and gems but guess what that grind is reduced by investigations and the melder. Investigations makes getting materials faster and easier plus by completing the weekly bounties we get a ""Gold Wyverian Print"" we can use this to trade 1 to 1 for any Gem in the game. The true grind for this game is its End Game via streamstones and Decorations. By doing tempered investigations and some events our goal is to farm Warrior or Hero Streamstones to Augment our weapons for extra bonuses or to get rare decorations. This part is the real grind and yes it can be a pain in the but by this point your either done or just having fun with the game.Overall Monster Hunter World is a success in the eyes of many and even though there are some bumps in the PC release there is still promise and potential in the long run. With success on the console and new content around the corner MHW is a game that will continue to get better and grow over time. Once the kinks are ironed out the game will be fantastic as it was on the console. Leaving me more then willing to dump another 400+ hours into this game here on PC with my friends.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Ofcourse it far from open world design like in title such as Skyrim or Witcher 3 but still maps are huge and enviroments are interesting and well crafted. But the biggest stars here are Monsteres and awesome combat system!Sadly for me there are that many big monsters compared to previous entries about 33 but quote me on that.but still they are wery unique and fun to fight DI can recomend this game to all gamers who like challenging and fast action fantasy games.There is one big gripe game now have some issues with connection problems (but for me it wasn't that often) and some people have some performance issues nothing that patches couldnt fix but be aware!Also I must mention that I'm currently playing on custom mid low and some high settings onGTX 750 TIAMd Athlon X4 860K Quad Core 3 70 GHZ8 Gig RamAnd I have great fun with some drops here and there but game looks gorgeous so I dont want to switch to low settingsI hope that this will help You and Happy Hunting to All!!! xD",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,101,False,Recommended,I recommend this game as long as before you buy the game that you run the can you run it for your computer on this game so that you know for sure that your pc/laptop can run the game. I also want to let all the Nvidia graphic card people out there that if they are getting high CPU usage and are stuttering/freezing in game to rollback their driver to 398.32. I know they came out with a 'Game Ready' driver update known as 398.82 but it is bugged and causes massive CPU usage up in the 90s and even 100 at times. I was trying to solve this problem ever since I got the game when it came out and in one of my researching attempts to figure out how to make my game stop stuttering I came across a thread that told me to do this. It really works and I recommend anyone with a Nvidia graphics card that has the latest and 'greatest' 398.82 update to rollback to 398.32. I recommend uninstalling the driver with ddu then installing the 398.32 afterwards. Here is the thread that I found.

Honestly all the people complaining about the port either have less than an hour play time or (by history) have potato PC's. If you have a reasonably modern ""GAMING"" pc (no core i3/integrated graphics crap) and take care of what is running on your computer then you should be able to play this fine.

2018-08-13,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,Vastly overrated for what it is especially considering the comparisons to Dark Souls (which I really enjoy). I think a lot of it is the PC version falls very flat.1.) There is no real plot. It's basically just gameplay. The gameplay breaks down at roughly 40% running around clicking one button to gather and 60% boss fights which I ll describe below.2.) The environments look fine. I had read reviews raving about the world and was expecting significantly more. Frankly I think there is a serious disconnect between people who primarily game on consoles and people who primarily game on PC. I could see how on the first generation PS4 this would probably be an impressive game but it s just OK on pc. I own both that isn t console hate.3.) The control scheme is just awful on PC. Ranged weapons are literally unusable by default. Melee weapons are better but not great.4.) Nothing feels responsive. The weapons animations are extremely slow and lock you with little effort into long movements with no ability to cancel. As a Dark Souls player this drives me insane. The safe way to play the game is to swing once maybe twice then run away and regroup. Which makes boss fights take forever. Play it faster than that and you ll be OK about 70% of the time provided you went in with max health via items/meals. The other 30% you ll get wiped by a random series of fast boss super moves combined with a really obnoxious stun mechanic that is present in every fight. The mechanics don t seem to be well or consistently telegraphed (from a dark souls veteran) so the whole thing ends up feeling sluggish and random.5.) If the extremely slow pace of combat wasn t enough the monsters run away several times in each encounter. That s right if you fight any generic monster expect it to run several times (and you ll get to chase it around for a few minutes). I guess this is to give you a chance to sharpen your weapon and heal but all it really does is drag things on.6.) The best rewards don t come from killing monsters they come from capturing them. Which you would think would be some cool involved mechanic. It isn t. You beat on them like you re going to kill them then when they start to limp you follow them to their cave. They go to literal sleep. You run up to their face and throw a couple of tranquilizer bombs straight down like a crappy magician then press a button to drop a trap which does a nonsensical animation and immediate captures the monster. TA DA. You get more rewards for literally less effort than killing the monster in the most immersion breaking series of mechanics I have seen recently in a game. It s a joke. 7.) Online play is currently extremely broken from my experience but even when it works it kind of sucks. Fights that are challenging but doable become trivial with other people taking the difficult but broken combat and making it trivial but broken combat. It just isn t very good.Honestly I could go on but it isn t worth the effort. I rarely write reviews (I own way too many games) but this game is so overhyped I thought it warranted one. It might be worth a buy on sale at $10 $20 but having played it I wouldn t have even bought it at that price. It isn t even remotely worth $60. I think people are addicted to that feeling of beating a monster which actually is a good feeling partly because it s such a slog to get there. All that said I m not going to say it s some new level of bad maybe a 5 6/10. But having bought it reading that it was a 9.5 out of 10 I m just shocked. It isn t anywhere near that good and certainly doesn t hold a candle to any of the Dark Souls franchise.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,43,False,Recommended,Solid game easy to get into great storyline can feel grindy at times but that is to be expected of a game such as this. The story is great (I haven't completed it yet but have enjoyed it so far). Graphics are great and there are variable settings which optimize it depending on your preference (fluctuate graphics to improve framerate and also a setting to improve resolution). The weapon choices are plentiful and there is always something to do in this game.Is it worth the 60 dollar price tag? Yes. It is difficult to find a game like this with such a sizeable fanbase for anything less than a $60 price tag. I would gladly pay $60 dollars for hours of fun with this game rather than a game like Call of Duty.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,292,False,Recommended,"Painfully honest review I have been playing Monster Hunter games for the past 12 years including mainly PSP and Nintendo Wii iterations. Monster Hunter as a game explanationOverall Monster Hunter is a game in which you hunt creatures of various kinds in boss like fights. This creates the core gameplay of the entire game. In order to hunt these monsters you can pick up to three friends (four players in total) to hunt monstrous creatures amongst which you will find similarities to Dinosours Dragons and lizards but also huge monsters like a vulcano! To fight these monsters you pick one out of 14 weapon classes which you can switch out at any time. There are no classes per say in this game but only weapon types you choose before starting a hunt at the main hub (Astera the city). Fights happen in instances with usually 50 minutes time. The hunts take place in astonishingly beautiful maps that are rich of ambient life! However this game does not feature an open world. Clearly the stars of this game are its monsters and the incredibly atmospheric hunts as each hunt plays differently. Killing and carving monsters allows you to gather materials like shells or claws in order to craft both armor and new weapons (within these 14 weapon types). The grind spiral in this game is a lot more interesting and rewarding in comparison to many other games.DifficultyMonster Hunter World is a very accessible game with a lot of depth to it. Overall your game time will usually range from 100 2000 hours depending on whether or not you adore the game. At first the game guides you really well through its world and its mechanics. Even I as a veteran enjoyed getting a reintroduction to the mechanics. While you progress through the story and the game I never felt like the game is leaving me behind. There are indeed some secrets the game doesn't tell me but that's really part of the magic behind the game. If you dear reader remember the times when one would use a ""walkthrough magazine"" for games like Pokemon to crack all the secrets this game is definitely for you! Nevertheless Monster Hunter turns out to be very challenging the further you get!I was personally afraid of getting a dumbed down game. Monster Hunter used to be a mainly Japanese IP for the past decade with imports of Nintendo iterations coming to the west. Monster Hunter World however has been optimized to target a western player base. My fears derived from the general game developers' assumption that European / American players would prefer a more casual easy and accessible game but I was wrong! I can't pinpoint it but the game does not feel easier to me than Monster Hunter Freedom Unite (PSP) for example. Surely this is my own personal opinion and others have voiced there opinion about this iteration being too easy which I definitely cannot confirm. StoryI keep this very short. The game does not feature an immense story like Witcher 3 or Life is Strange or Detroit Become Human etc. This game really doesn't have potential for an overly great story. The monsters are the stars in this game and they get highlighted in an appropriat manner which is why the story focuses around them and does not go into any detail with charcters. However if you can live with a story not featuring a lot of human character development the story overall is very well done in my opinion. Overall the game does have a bigger story and plays in a universe for itself in which all the previous Monster Hunter titles also have taken place in. This title intensively focuses on ""the migration of monsters to the new world every 10 years"" solving the secrets of this phenomenon. I do believe this sounds really intersting and the implementation of this is very well done.The story in general does pose a supportive role to make the gameplay look and feel more authentic.PerformanceNow this topic is juicy. What is a well running game and what is an optimized game? To me optimization in regards to performance means to bring a game up to current hardware standards which means that a game is runnable on most hardware on current FPS / resolution standards. On August 14 2018 (the day I am writting this review) what I consider a solid standard would be this ""A singleplayer / COOP game like Monster Hunter World should run with at least 60 FPS on a GeForce GTX 1050ti on acceptable graphics settings that still make the game look alright while eSports titles should run on 150+ FPS on mentioned hardware taken the resolution is set to 1080p (1920x1080)."" That is my personal opinion on current tech standards. Does the game comply with these standards? Well I believe it does. Using a 1050ti (and a comparable CPU) the game does run with 60+ FPS on low medium settings which still make the game look stunning. Overall there have been many complains about the game's performance. To be fair to those people complaining the requirements are potentially higher than expected. However are the justified? I believe so. During hunts there are a lot of effects going on due to the very vivid environent. Now what do I consider well running? This to me means that a game runs smooth given that proper hardware is used. Since I am using an Intel Core i7 8700K 4.7Ghz and an Asus Strix GTX 1080ti (from Nvidia) along with 16GB of 3200DDR4 RAM I am able to run the game at 80 130FPS on maximum settings. Now according to my definition does the game run smooth? Hell yes it does! My FPS never tank and I never have stutters or anything. Given that you have proper hardware for this game and you have optimized your graphics settings you won't have any issues with the game. To those having issues with the game crashing a potential solution might be a driver update as Nvidia and AMD both released a new driver version optimizing Monster Hunter World's performanceControlsLet's cut to the chase Using a controller for this game is just an amazing experience. I am a PC gamer used to mouse &amp keyboard but I had an old controller flying around so I grabbed it and voilá. Controller works so well for this game that it is just a pleasure to sit back in the chair possibly use my TV as an output device and just sit back and play. What about mouse &amp keyboard? I can't neglect the fact that the game is using a technique to this day that makes mouse movement just emulating a controller. However feedback has been passed on to the developers and I am pretty sure there are plans for direct mouse input in the works. Nonetheless I was forced to play with mouse &amp keyboard for the past 48 hours and it is really playable. I don't think anybody should be overly concerned just because he / she doesn't own a controller. The game is very playable with ordinary computer peripherals. I personally can't rely to those who refunded this game and gave negative reviews because of its mouse &amp keyboard implementation. Monster Hunter World is not a competitive eSports title neither does it feature any PvP which is why even mouse smoothing is tolerable I would dare to say (Keep in mind there might be a solution for this sole issue anyways). ConclusionWould I consider Monster Hunter World to be a bad console port? Not at all clearly not at all. Controls are very acceptable! I believe one should not worry about a smoothed mouse movement (although a fix might be in the works). If you have a controller at hand feel free to make use of it! Fortunately for me my old USB Controller worked pretty well even when I plugged it in and out mid game. I would rate this game with a 10/10 as there are hardly any other games on the market that really give you the feeling that you just purchased a fully developed game worth every penny / cent. As far as it goes the developers plan on realeasing regular free content updates over the course of the next months / years.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,69,False,Recommended,I'll keep this short It's monster hunter. If you've never played before wlecome to the ultimate grindfest where the only goal is to get to the next grind fest (but with better gear!). Sounds boring right? That couldn't be further truth. It's hella fun and totally worth it if you've been itching to for a game you sink your teeth into for a couple hundred hours or so. Additionally content patches roll in fairly often and the support of this game is absolutely phenomenal. My personal biggest complaint however would be that multiplayer does not feel nearly as tight knit as it did in previous series entries.Additionally as of writing (8/13/18) there are some networking issues though they seem fairly dependent on the user's network configuration (as they do on ps4/xbone). Additionally there seems to be a couple bugs lying around some of which the current recourse is to wait for a patch.On the port itself its quite solid. Though I know there are complaints going around about poor performance the worst I had encountered was some stuttering which was fixed by a graphics driver update. (i7 6700k (non working ram channel b) (stock clocks) 16gb ddr4 3000mhz gtx 760 4gb vram (overclocked)) Additionally though this game runs at around 30fps on my machine this is by far the smoothest 30fps I have ever seen on any pc game and aside from the few hiccups here or there this is the genuine console expeirence on the personal computer.8/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,45,False,Recommended,Every once in awhile there are quality triple A epic games that release and this game is one of them. I waited almost a year to play this on PC even though I have a PS4. The game has so much content and I am still in the beginning parts but with what I've played the gameplay graphics and systems are highly engaging and thrilling.It is a great time to go on hunts quests and manage your gear. The gameplay is different almost on every quest because the monsters in this game are all so unique and their attacks/movements are so varied. Going in I know I will be playing this game for months to come. The graphics are amazing but I do think you need a high end Rig to fully enjoy the game. The only minor problems I had with the game are the slight input lag and the system to make parties. The session are small only 12 people that can join and the only way it so start the quest yourself send out an SOS flare and just HOPE that other people join your quest to help you. All in all a fantastic triple A title that we have been waiting for.For those of you with input lag TURN OFF VOLUME RENDERING QUALITY in Display Settings. I have a high end GTX 1080 and it still lags with that setting on. It will be smooth when you turn it off.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,117,False,Not Recommended,The game is very fun and pretty to play. However it is hampered by some pretty severe performance issues at the moment. Even with a 1080 i struggle to maintain 60 fps.The UI is clunky and the co op system need's a compelte overhaul. Getting team mates together is a chore unto itself then you better pray to RNGesus that they al stay connected long enough to finish a mission. And forget about co op campaign. You will be constantly stopped because the game doesn't know how to handle cutscenes with multiple players in it. It's solution? Disable people from joining your mission until all cutscenes have been watched.In it's current state it's a frustrating experience. I haven't experienced the game crashing when playing on PC. Btut if i stream to to the steamlink and try to tab out it'll crash (but this is clearly a bit of a fringe case scenario).It wouldn't be to bad if you intend to play solo but if you're in it for the co op i'd wait for a few patches first.If they fix some of these glaring issues (particularly the co op) i'll probably change my review to a positive one,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,I LOVE THIS GAME. The gameplay is top notch and the world is astounding. I spend hours just getting ammo for my light/heavy bowgun and I love doing it I love the gring of picking plants and killing an occasional monster. The fact this game can make me content running around the first zone for 10 hours is quite the achievement. Anothing thing to note is me and my friends have such great fun together... when it works. The servers are beyond garbage and even though it says you can invite friends to private sessions it won't let you. Those two things on their own make this review negative. Its a real shame the game is great but setting up passwords/lobbys just to have one guy dc abd him dcing fu**s the whole lobby is so so annoying.

I am able to complete 70% of quests with my co op buddy but at least once a session we have an error and disconnect mid mission. At least we can finish the mission solo.

This happened with the console version as well and I'm 90% positive this is the first time a Monster Hunter has come to PC so I didn't expect multiplayer to be perfect right away.Supposedly there are issues with performance as well but I've only had the game crash once and that's it. There's bound to be growing pains for any game upon release and overall this port has knocked it out of the park in my book. Even by myself the game is highly enjoyable and still worth $60.

No Mouse raw input (I still play with mouse and keyboard it works ok i pretty much got used to it)I'am pretty sure Capcom is alrdy working on a patch so hold your horses if you don't like thoses issues or just buy the game and have fun !,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,18,False,Recommended,As of right now MonHun has some of the worst online I've ever seen half way through a quest all your friends will DC. You can actually count the game dropping your connection. Other than terrible online stability the game is great. Kill monsters and make weapons out of their bodies to hunt more monsters. Nice little fun and simple gameplay loop. Fix your network though wtf lmfao,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,692,False,Recommended,I've played through the PS4 version for roughly 400 hours and I still do go back to it if there are any interesting events going on. But for right now my focus is on the PC one.I've read about all the horrors going on with this version loss of FPS horrible multiplayer save data being corrupt/lost crashes on booting up the game and so on. So far I've been fortunate enough to not really have any of those issues and with the save data worries I've simply learned how to back it up myself. I have had maybe 3 disconnects over the last several days but I don't really care about that since I'm actually a solo player.This go around I'm trying a new weapon and I want to say that I'm quite pleased with what I got. In my eyes the game is quite stable and yes the graphics may be a little wonky sometimes and not as clean as the PS4 one feels at times but I have not felt upset or disappointed at this version. My only worry is when making sure I don't miss any important events and if we'll get the costumes from the Spring/Summer festivals.For me this version has turned out great so far. I have not gotten to certain areas or bosses that have been said to be problematic for graphics or data issues but I will worry about it when that time comes and I will find a solution. I've been with this series for years I loved every game I've played from it and I'm not gonna let these minor issues ruin this one.I know some people don't like how long it takes for the game to finally give you some freedom to do what you want but to anyone that's wondering if the gameplay will ever open up more and get better I'll say this It will change before you know it and it will be great!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,13,False,Recommended,I think most people who buy this game's because they like the combat mechanic the way we deal with monster. To me the mechanic of this game's like a turn based game. Because we're playing PVE so every monsters have their own repetitive way of fighting you. Yes you have to figure it out try to dodge and fight back but the hard task is that it takes lots of time to deal with a big monster. It can even be 2 hours so think about it before purchasing. There're 14 main weapons in this game. Sound awesome but it took me bout 1hrs to learn the combo of 1 weapon on youtube (of course because im totally new to this game). But keep it in mind you will have to learn a lot in order to enjoy a weapon this is not a hack and slash games. This game's ported from console so there're several bugs and lack of customization. Luckily i havent ran into any sort of bugs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,23,False,Recommended,Overall Monter Hunter World is a really fantastic game with good gameplay storymode and combat features. I have really enjoying played it every minute of it. However! The multiplayer systems really sucks big time. 3 out of 5 times i cant join my friends quest for some reason and its really frustrating. We have to go back out to the menu to make another session that we both can join just to find out that we cant play the quest together again which is really frustrating cause most of the munsters are nearly impossible to hunt down by yourself.So if you buy this game to play multiplayer with your friends i wont recommend it until they have fixed the multiplayer system however if you just wanna play solo its worth the coins. (I'm giving this a thumps up anyways cause its such a great game if you look away from the multiplayer),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,242,False,Recommended,*****EDIT If you are having this crashing issue I found out what worked for me was changing the game from fullscreen to borderless window mode.Since that was literally my only complaint about the game (the multiplayer issue where you have to play the missions twice in my opinion arent that bad espicially since its a free pas to play the mission again and get more monster parts) I would HIGHLY recommend this game especially for newcommers to the Monster Hunter series. I have a few people that i know that THIS is their favorite monster hunter game and theyve played them all and i would probabbly have to agree with them.I love this game to death but i cant recommend it to anyone right now. Every 5 15 minutes sometimes after 3 hours if im lucky the game crashes saying the video device crashed. That isnt the case because it can play any other game i have perfectly fine. I really wish this gets fixed soon so I can continue playing but its extremely frustrating going for armor or weapon parts and the game crashes before you can even kill a monster.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I think this game rocks and the negative reviews are undeserved.I've always wanted a Monster Hunter game on PC. Previous entries in the series either didn't have the network support or control support for me to feel like I could fully engage the game. This is the first entry in the series where I felt I could do everything. I can go solo or not because PC networking doesn't suck (I'm looking at you Nintendo). I can play all the weapons with reasonable proficiency because I have as proper system and a full controller. (Because the old 3DS lagged and the new 3DS mouse nipple made playing ranged weapons impossible.) No aspect of the game is denied to me on this platform.World delivers on the core Monster Hunter experience while automating simplifying or making generally more accessible some of the more tedious parts of the game. The tutorials are still a little obtuse but any google search generally sets you straight. I think anyone with any interest in the genere or serious should give strong consideration to trying this game.I wish to share the opinion that I think most of the reviews are just biased or misleading. This game doesn't deserve the negative reviews it is getting. I have not experienced any of the technical issues that have been reported so it is my belief that most of those are issues to drivers or shoddy hardware. My game runs flawlessly on two different systems. As to the connectivity issues provided you have a current Router with modern uPNP the connectivity issues are infrequent and completely on CAPCOM's side. The Port Forwarding advice is a sham.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,302,False,Recommended,"Good game for veterans of MH franchise and for new players (who like to grind tons of your lifetime) that meet series only for now.You're starting by monster hunter coming to ""new world"" to hunt monsters and have lots of ""fun"". For first time we see new story flow (on previous games it's given like tons of dialog windows without any connection between quests (for my opinion) for now it's lot of cutsceens).As old veteran of MonHun franchise played a lot of time on PSP i found a lot of good features that i wanted to see already in game a long time ago.Pros + now without any loading screens between hunter grounds locations.+ good graphics and a lot of animations of all objects.+ ecosystem on every location that live on it's own laws. Just go and see how big monsters go rampage on each other for struggle for territory. + lots of interesting moves of your weapons and it's uniq playstile.+++ for first time in series expeditions. I waited it's for loooong time. You don't like completing tons of same quests? Just go to hunting grounds and hunt every monster/dragon/wyvern as you like without time limitations and fail penalties. Find your way to beat every single monster oooor just go and collect all you want and can.+ kitchen chef. That big cat is too gorgeous. And he prepares delicious meals.+/ new coop system names SOS signals. Interesting system that gives you chance to invite other players in midle of mission.+ new ways of hunting. More traps hidden on locations. Flew of your target by landslide (that wyvern don't know it's live on so dangerous area hehe) smash them against the walls in coral forests or find out some grimalkins (aborigines hunter cats) and ask them for some help and many others.Cons really bad optimization and even considering that this port from consoles. Graphics is kinda normal for me. why they got rid of uniq style of weapons that was in previous games? Why there not so many visual styles of weapons (where is my ""revolver"" hummer?) /+ if you're don't like to grind that game really not for you. not very big variations for customization of your palico visual style (yeah i know that it will be in armor for most of time but still).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-19,0,0,103,False,Recommended,I've never played a Monster Hunter game before. At first I felt very mixed about this one. It was beautiful to look at but the combat was very different from anything else I've played and not in a good way at first. Being locked into animations during attacks where I can't break the movement to dodge an attack was challenging and it took time to get used to that. After a couple of hours with my big heavy weapons it felt normal enough and dodging wasn't a big deal. Without too much extra grinding to complete weapon or armor sets I finished this game after defeating the last boss monster at about 67 hours. I feel I've certainly got my moneys worth. The monsters mostly act different from one another most are unique to one another. Each kill feels rewarding. Downsides for me Loot feels mostly RNG. You need 3 claws? Well too bad you got 1 claw and 2 hides. Incentive to collect and kill more than your main targets I suppose.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If the monster hunt quest has a cut scene you cant group up on that part even if you are both on the same quest...makes no sense. I should not have to que by myself watch the cutscene then leave quest so i can start it again so my friend can join.

2018-08-14,0,0,150,False,Recommended,*TL DR It's a good game and playable if you didn't buy it for PS4 and wanted to get it this is great too. Some minor connection issues.*This is my first real experience of MonHun with my first being the 3ds version and let's just say it disappointed me and turned me off from any console version. I had really wanted to get into it though so after watching friends play it on playstation 4 and it had been announced for PC later down the road I was excited. Combats smooth I enjoy the graphics (when my fps and connection doens't suddenly drop and it loods in chunks with steam connection flipping on and off) and I truly plan to play this game for awhile. I have Odogarron/Rath gear on right now and aiming to beat Diablos. I main SwS thinking of dual blades or insect or bow. Listen it's a port some PS4 friends have noted some differences but it's overall a good game. So if you are a PC player mainly like I am it should be wonderful. Catcihng gecko's and cute stuff is great I love the fishing big thumbs up from me.Cons are the steam connection issues sometimes there are errors when trying to join friends online sessions and EVERYONE has to exit and re open to rejoin and party up properly. (Minor issue we solve in 5 10mins and generally we take water/snack/bio breaks whilst doing) Some special main story quests are locked behind having to do it yourself but a lot of games have this feature. It is multiplayer but you gotta do some main story yourself! We also wish we could have an 'effects' detail slider and I wish we had a bit more camera options but no biggie. They're working on the issues I'll be sticking around regardless because it's minor inconviences. Im also unsure if the scoutflies are bugged? When tracking the big creatures it seems to glitch out and not follow a trail and I have to keep clicking in the map on and off to get them to appear.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The port while certainly not perfect is very well made all things considered and quite frankly the game runs great (I use a 1060 6GB and an Intel I7 6700 3.4ghz) never dropping below 60 fps on high settings which is followed by its beautiful aesthetics.The gameplay is great ive heard controller support is wonky but never seen my friends with issues. I personally play with Keyboard and mouse and it controls great. The mouse certainly feels a little floaty in comparison to other pc games but this actually works in the games favor considering the way you explore the world and the sheer size of the monsters. I would honestly hate it if i could move my camera with as little restriction as in a game like CS GO it just doesn't fit this game.As my first ever introduction to monster hunter this game is already in my top 5 must haves for PC.

2018-08-13,0,0,394,False,Recommended,Pros Difficulty has been preserved. This wasn't dumbed down for the West. Environments look great. New monsters are really cool. You can craft charms now. Charm stats are pre set at the time of crafting and you have limited types to choose from but you can really easily choose exactly the stat you want which is really nice especially for early game. Capcom standardized points for levels of skills. 1 point is one level of a skill now. Farming items in your base was made more interractive and you can improve growth times and yield with fertilizer you can apply after quests. You can catch small creatures like birds and bugs and stuff and decorate your room with them. You can now change equipmemt and drop off items to your box in your tent at camp during quests. You can eat in quests. Your palico can recruit certain small monsters to aid you after certain quests are done. Don't have to play the others to like this one. Story and gathering hall quests are now shared. Cons Story and gathering hall quests are now shared. You can't have others join a quest with you until after you havw viewed the cutscene for that quest if it's a main story quest. At the time of writing this multiplayer is a bit buggy. If someone has started a story quest and viewed the cutscene other players will be unable to join the quest until the hoat ends the quest and relaunches it. Continuing on multiplayer bugs if your session has been up for a while and no one has joined it bugs and doesn't allow anyone to join until you reinstance. There seems to be no Invite Only setting that I can find. Just Private and Open. Joining a multiplayer session by invite is pretty bad. Your friend has to invite through the game you accept through Steam then go back to the game go to the quest board go to Online Sessions and then click Join Invited Session. CPU hog.

2018-08-12,0,0,135,False,Recommended,I requested refund after purchase it for a day. For me personally the fighting system is boring af I tried many varieties of weapons and still it feels like those cranky late 90's or early 2000's weird fighting games it's missing a lot of the flow of swinging the weapon and movements to really enjoy fighting the monsters. The story is corny af the dialogue is really really freaking lame. This game is really very much like those cheap online Korean games. BUT strangely after I got the refund I'm keep thinking about this ing game every ing day and I'm thinking about re purchase it again to really try to get into the fun part everybody experiencing it might be just me that not gives this game the time to really completely understand it myself.

It is by far the best MH game to date! If you've not played any of the Monster hunter games before this is probably the best one to start with. Once you get your head past the progression model and how the system works it's magic*(I'll get back to this...) you are in for loads of fun and hours of content!*Steam seems to have networking issues with this game. My friends list spams online/offline when playing MH W and it's 50/50 if I can invite/join a steam friend while playing.

2018-08-11,0,0,143,False,Recommended,"(Review below warning)Forewarning to potato CPUs TURN BACK OR UPGRADE! This game is heavily CPU bound (for whatever reason) and sometimes struggles to maintain 60 FPS on an 8600k at 4.9ghz. 90% CPU usage while GPU (1080 Ti) stays around 50% depending on what's going on.This game turns my room into a sauna can't wait to play it during winter with the window open!This is an incredibly fun ""kill bigger and badder monsters with up to 3 other people with 14 different weapons and massive amounts of gear customization in beautiful environments for hours on end with a boatload of free content updates rivaled only by games like Warframe.""I've played for about 30 hours while the game has only been out for around 40. It's extremely stable if your CPU and GPU clocks are stable the online play is a little finnicky probably due to their servers being hammered and this is probably the best MH in the series in my opinion. I've been playing MH since the first on PS2 and nearly every other after that so I may have a little bit of a bias.What don't I like?Some hitboxes could use some tightening up.My computer is a damned furnace when MH W is running.Some textures are much lower resolution than what you'd expect from a game of this year.And WHY IS IT SO CPU BOUND?!9.5/10 bagelgeese.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,102,False,Recommended,"I haven't put a ton of hours into it yet but I feel I have a good enough experience with the game so far to have an opinion.Frankly I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews. Seems like today games can't even get a pass if there's even a little bit wrong with them.At this point you've probably already heard a lot about what the game actually is so I won't bother writing an explanation of what Monster Hunter is about. And if you haven't heard well there's plenty of full reviews around. As player since the days of Freedom on the PSP I'm pretty familiar with the series so when I heard we were getting a new game that not only drastically upgraded the general system for combat movement maps and so on I was pretty excited even more so when I learned it would be on PC. Then the wait began.Oh the wait.Since it's finally here I've been dabbling in it and I can confirm it's pretty good. Don't let the surprising amount of negative reviews trick you this game is well worth it's price. Good graphics fun gameplay lots of different monsters to fight and turn into various armours and weapons you get the gist. The game does have a few small faults regarding it's PC port. There's some issues at the moment with how the online works occasional disconnects that kind of thing but I haven't personally had too much trouble with it other than the first day I tried playing multiplayer. That said multiplayer is only important if you directly really WANT to play with others. Personally I find hunting with random players somewhat frustrating and the game despite still I suppose being ""Challenging"" in the scheme of modern games is by far the easiest Monster Hunter game I've ever played. Hunting with friends is fun but not a neccessity so hopefully they get the online smoothed out soon.The game also doesn't have some settings you would expect out of a PC port for example there doesn't seem to be a button to turn off motion blur but that hardly hurts the game itself.Overall it's a perfectly playable game that's quite fun with a few online issues right now. The percentage of negative reviews isn't really justified but that said if you are thinking of getting it be aware it can be quite demanding to run if you don't tone down the settings.Side note though why on earth did they remove the Gathering Hall having seperate quests to the main village? Now there's basically no reason to actually go in the Gathering Hall since you can connect with people for multiplayer in the main village sooo... What's the point?",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Honest Review from someone who has played basically all monster hunter games The game is GREAT. It really is. However this PC port needs work. There are constant disconnects from the online sessions and the optimization is terrible. I have a GTX 980 and an i7 7700k with 16 gb RAM DDR4. Most of my settings are set to mid to low save for my textures which I will need to tweak again. Its basically all the little effect details that are added. If there are two or more ranged users my game starts stuttering because of the effects. Do I recommend this game? Yes I do. It truely is something great. BUT IT DOES NEED WORK!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,13,False,Recommended,"Not a huge fan of the series and there are issues plaguing the PC version. Being unable to use push to talk voice chat is ridiculous and has had me refusing to turn voice on after listening to people's random noises.The reason I felt compelled to review the game this early on is mainly because it seems to be getting a lot of flack over things that could be expected. The controls do suck which was to be expected and I quickly resorted to a controller. In spite of what half a year delay beyond the consoler versions of the game the UI and aforementioned controls all don't feel very well thought out. These are things that I imagine could (and should) be fixed as it currently feels like a ""PC is just an afterthought"" kinda port. Optimization however seems pretty spot on from what I can tell. I've been running this on a Surface Book 1 (with dedicated GPU mind) which is about the furthest thing from a gaming laptop and it works okay ish. Low resolution and settings all around but at least it's playable at around 20 30fps with the occasional drop below 20 though rarely during fights. My point is most of you are probably playing on something much closer to a gaming rig than I am so I'm guessing it should run alright and honestly don't get what all the optimization fuss is about.Asides from that the game has been out for a while go read a review. Just take all the moaning about poor performance with a grain of salt.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,20,False,Recommended,"Gameplay If you like Monster Hunter then here you go. Monster Hunter on a grander scale.As far as the PC port goes the only major issue I had after my first ten hours of play was a crash due to a graphics error.Otherwise it plays just fine. I do not notice any impact by denuvo. I recommend disregarding that gripe if seen in other reviews. (If you want to pirate the game to some children in zimbabwe go for it matey. That's not my intention so I'm perfectly fine with denuvo being shipped with a game.)Performance on hardware I run a superclocked 1060 3gb card as well as an i5 4460 quad core. The game defaults to ""high"". The only issue is the volumetric rendering which would have to be lowered or disabled on any system to get a spicy framerate. I get a semi normal fps between 50 60 it seems. Moral of the story is that you do not need a mammoth of a machine to have something that will not make you barf.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,442,False,Recommended,"Let me preface this by saying that I have been waiting for this for a long time and the wait was worth it. TLDR World has taken MH from a niche and relatively hardcore game series and revamped it into the modern day changing many of the archaic systems and design implementations that made previous entries more difficult to play than they actually were. The world design the zones the monsters the city everything is more beautiful than it has ever been thanks to the transition to main line consoles and PC. Combat is also the best in the series with each of the 14 unique weapons getting new additions to their movesets that make them feel better than ever. Aside from the connectivity issues with multiplayer sessions the game runs flawlessly on my 1070 and 6 year old i7 3820 with a constant 60+ at 1440p usually closer to 70 with all settings maxed except volume rendering foliage sway and AA. Don't be fooled by the mixed Steam reviews many of which are PC master race folks complaining because of minor issues. This is a great game and it will be well worth your time. If I absolutely had to give it a score it would be a 9.5/10.Review Multiple huge zones with intricately designed areas and multiple ways to traverse them are the base for this game. Taking time to explore them and figure out the best ways to traverse and where the best resource gathering points are is a great journey and they're just as fun to traverse the 100th time as they are the first time. These areas are populated by large quantities of both hostile and passive wildlife with multiple large monsters smaller beasts and little capturable animals reacting in realistic ways to the big fellows and to your hunter. The zones are packed full of activity and things to fight catch fish or gather and it's safe to say I never thought MH would ever look like this. Combat is the best it's ever been. There are 14 weapon types each with completely unique traits and movesets. Every person will find something in those 14 weapons that will grab their attention and keep it so try all of them! There's a great training area which you can use to get a feel for each weapon that also shows you some of its most useful combos so take them all in there to get a feel for them. Do you want to be attacking super fast and being hyper aggressive? Dual blades are for you. Do you like a methodical playstyle that rewards good positioning and deals huge hits? Greatsword. Do you like buffing yourself and teammates while beating the crap out of a monster? Hunting horn. Do you like staying at range and blasting the monsters with all sorts of different types of ammo and then turning into the Heavy from Team Fortress 2? Heavy Bowgun. That's just four of the 14 weapons. Combat is combo based and obtaining mastery over your weapon of choice and taking down a monster with ease that used to cause you problems is one of the most satisfying feelings in any game I've played. From the first monster to the Elder Dragons every fight offers its own unique challenges and rewards and the game does an excellent job at introducing new monsters that teach you how to approach different types of challenges later on.The story has never been a focus of any MH game but it is far more prevalent here. In past games multiplayer and single player were completely separate with the multiplayer called Guild Quests single player called Caravan Quests. You had separate Hunter Ranks and progression for Guild and Caravan Quests and the only time you could play with friends is through guild quests which had no story and just threw you out into the zone to hunt a monster. The story in World is much more cohesive and provided each person has seen the cutscene in the respective quest they can be played multiplayer as well. It is not a great system and I would prefer being able to just party up and view the cutscene at the same time but I'll talk about multiplayer later as there are some issues at the moment as there are some other issues as well.Now addressing the ""grind."" Monster Hunter as a series has always been renowned for its grind. A lot of times however it felt grindy more because of archaic design systems. This is the type of game where you only need to grind if you really want to. Do you want to complete a full set of armor from a certain monster? Then you'll probably need to fight that monster multiple times to get all the resources you need especially the rare ones like Gems. The same thing applies to weapons which at various points will require resources not only from the monster the weapon is crafted from or styled after but other monsters as well. There are also research levels for each monster which require gathering tracks gashes mucus or other signs the monster has left behind or by killing or capturing it and to max these out can be a grind as well. However the research points you accrue can be used for a range of things so it is well worth doing. Make sure you are registering your bounties and managing investigations as they will be your best ways of obtaining research points and rarer monster parts respectively. Performance as I mentioned I'm using a 1070 and an i7 3820 3.60GHz. The i7 is the original CPU from when I built my PC back in 2012 so it's the older architecture. I'm also running the game on an Samsung 860 EVO SSD so load times are very fast. I get a constant 60+ FPS running at 1440p and I'm generally closer to 70. I have turned off only two settings volume rendering and foliage sway and using FXAA but otherwise running at max. I get the odd drop during fights like Kushala Daora (and Teostra I'm sure) but it's a generally flawless and smooth experience. We have the luxury as PC gamers to modify a game's graphics and settings to improve our performance. Just because you cannot run it maxed doesn't mean that it's bad. Modify a few settings here and there as any good PC user should and the game will run just fine.Now the only real issue for me is the multiplayer connectivity. I generally have no issues staying online and I can respond to SOS flares all the time. However when I play with my friends in Texas or Canada (I'm on the East Coast) disconnections happen a lot. I'm not sure if it's the distance between us or what but two friends of mine live together and they disconnect from each other as well but only during quests it seems. They can do expeditions with no problems at all but quests are an issue for some reason. It's something Capcom has addressed and hopefully they fix it soon. One of the main draws to MH has always been its multiplayer and if they can't fix it it's going to be a huge issue going forward even more than it already is. When it comes to the reviews there have been over 200k people (usually 250k) playing at almost all times since launch and only 17k people have left reviews. That should be a good indicator that it's an incredibly vocal negative minority leaving their reviews while the vast majority of people like myself have been simply enjoying the game. Remember that it is far more common for someone with a negative viewpoint to express it than someone with a positive viewpoint. Some of the reviews have been fair criticisms of the connectivity issues and certain very specific performance problems but the vast majority that I've seen have been whining about ""we waited 6 months for this crap port"" when it is far from a crap port and they're trying to play maxed on outdated systems. When it comes to M&amp K controls too provided you rebind the somewhat dumb default keys they feel good. I'm the only one of my friends using a controller and that's mostly because I played the previous games so muscle memory is easier with a controller than with M&amp K and they all say it's absolutely fine other than a bit of sluggish mouse control. An absolute must buy 9.5/10 without connectivity issues 8.5/10 due to said issues.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I get about 30 40fps on average at low settings and its plenty for me. The gameplay is fun despite the fact I chose possibly the most boring weapon to use which is nice.

2018-08-16,0,0,134,False,Recommended,"I am a long time die hard Monster Hunter fan with close to 1000 hours played amongst the various titles (MH1 MH3 &amp MHP3rd). I have wanted a North American PC Monster Hunter title ever since I first heard of the China exclusive Monster Hunter Online (NA release please Capcom!) and there was a long period of time when I thought that would never happen. The announcement of Monster Hunter World was like Christmas had come early. After jealously watching my console friends play for months it's finally here I put at least 6 hours in on release day. While I'm sure I could drone on for a while about my love for the series I'll spare you the tale and bullet point my critique.PROS + Graphically this game looks amazing.Many of my friends even those who just weren't a fan of the games play style consider this to be one of the most visually stunning games to date.+ No locked playable content (as of this review).All the quests are available through normal game progression and multiplayer play is never required. The entire game can be played without a single additional purchase or ever playing co op if you so chose.+ Many fun different weapon types that all feel unique.Monster Hunter World features all available weapon types from the MH series. I'll take a moment here to list them out Great Sword Long Sword Sword and Shield Hammer Lance Gunlance Hunting Horn Dual Blades Charge Blade Switch Axe Insect Glaive Bowgun (Light or Heavy) &amp Bow. Each one has it's own interesting move set and purpose and none of them make you feel like you aren't contributing to the fight.+ Easy to play with other people.My initial note about connectivity issues aside when you can play with others the game makes it easier than any other previous MH title. Veterans of the series will remember that online play meant joining a room that held 4 8 people and that was who you could quest with. If no one wanted to play your quest and visa versa that meant spending time finding another unfilled server and hoping those people were interested. While this game still features 16 person hubs the quests you have available to choose from include a large group of other players (I doubt it's all online players as there never seems to be a ridiculous number of quests available). You can even join in with players mid quest something previously unavailable in the MH series. You can make private rooms and specify what kind of quests or monsters you want to take on which makes finding similar players simple.+ Interesting story.I like many kids I'm sure was always interested in what it would be like to live in a medievil era fantasy world with giant dragons and world creating/destroying beasts. If that interests you at all Monster Hunter is your game. Come to the New World where Elder Dragons seemingly go to die and discover what their pilgrimage truly means. During your journey you'll come accross many allies from the four fleets before you who will ask for your assistance in researching these powerful creatures. What will you uncover as you track the monsters through their habitats?+ Large quest areas.While the game was touted as being ""open world"" I find that a little misleading. They quests are still restricted to a single map outside of the main hub. That being said there are no loading screens once on a quest and the maps are the largest of any game in the series. There are 5 very different areas each with there own ecology monsters and items to collect.+/ No boring grinding.I'll make this bullet point both a pro and con as it depends on how you view grinding. Players of the previous games will remember what a chore it was to farm the items necessary for difficult quests/armor. Specifically I mean picking quests simply to gather items and no monster hunting involved. While you may have to fight the same monster a few times to get the appropriate items for your gear this installment largely removes the need to farm anything else. If you are not interested in fighting the same monsters multiple times then I would wager that this game isn't for you.CONS This is a console port.This is not a game that was designed for the PC. There's a reason it came out 6 months after the console release. Console has always been Capcom's platform of choice. While I can't say I really notice anything that screams ""unfinished game"" the mouse and keyboard controls are the clearest example that this game wasn't originally inteded for PC. Again I don't feel like the game itself is incomplete but some may not like the fact that this is a port and I feel they should know. Mouse and keyboard controls aren't good.If you don't intend to play with a controller than good luck.The Monster Hunter series has always felt like one where you either liked it or did not. I don't tend to find anyone who feels middle of the road about it. I really recommend that you watch some gameplay both of early game and late game before you make a decision. There is so much about this game and series that I don't know how to put into words. This is by far the most accessable Monster Hunter and I highly recommend it if it even looks remotely interesting.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-09,0,0,235,False,Recommended,"Mediocre port. Good video game. Most recurrent connection issues seems to have been fixed in my end (don't take it for granted though). The game is still badly optimized and I doubt it will ever be ""fixed"" as the optimization issues are deeply tied to the game's architecture the majority of performance issues are related to CPU bottlenecks due to the way the game handles its assets.Game design wise there are some poor design choices in multiplayer when handling disconnections and matchmaking/lobby but you can overlook it as the fights are usually long and mostly entertaining. You will have plenty of options to fight monsters with every single big weapon you can choose from is very unique and have its own movesets and techniques that can keep you hooked for a long time until you learn it completely or get tired of it.As you advance through the game you will be able to craft/upgrade diferent weapons and armors and adapt them to your playstyle/build. In other words there will be grinding. However not so much grind that will get you tired because the gameplay is motly skill based and the arguably complex fights with unique monsters will usually make you forget about the items you are looking for.With all of that said the bottom line of playing or not playing this game is simple if you don't have a 10k PC but you are able to ignore inconsistent FPS and stutters the gameplay will pay off.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

You get between 100 200 hp while the monsters have thousands can one shot you combo you to death etc. Once you learn how to fight and what weapons/items to use you can take down monsters in 5 minutes or less without getting hit.Capcom is also releasing regular free content updates with new monsters maps and difficulty levels.

2018-08-18,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend this game because it does not respect people's time. To start with the UI is one of the worst I have ever seen in any game it seems there was no thought at all given to affordances consistency efficiency etc.Another problem with the game is all the cinematics and dialogs in which one is forced to spam click ""Ok"" though incredibly boring walls of text so one can actually play the game. This happen every time one talks to NPCs like the Blacksmith too you can't quickly access the crafting menu you have to spam click ""Ok"" while he spews dumb text at your screen.As far as the actual gameplay I found it to be incredibly slow paced frustrating and boring. It is sometimes hard but in a tedious way not an interesting one. An example of what I'm talking about is beating on a monster for 20 minutes having to run for minutes around little dungeons/mazes as the monster just flies across the map several times when you hit monster HP milestones (or whathever the trigger is).I'll acknowledge that the art in the game was quite good especially the monsters and animations but for me it was not enough to make for the drudgery.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Inventory crafting starting any activity ammo upgrading switching weapons shooting ranged weapons aiming multiplayer ... may be good enough for console but on PC it is extremely cumbersome counter intuitive and badly designed and frankly behind the times. It really sucks to start the game and get it to accept your friends joining without problems. Buyer beware!If the knowledge that everything around the actual basic hunt itself is crap is not a deal breaker for you enjoy the hunt!P.S. did I mention that you can only play with your friends after you all soloed the mission up to the last cutszene left the mission and started anew this time with your friends joining? If you dont do this you will get really frustrated with missmatching progress bugs and non functioning multiplayer. smh absolutely pathetic.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The hub town is just empty except for 1 area but that one area has none of the things you need to prepare for a mission. Going out on quests has some specific requirements which are nonsensical causing people in your group having to wait to play because of ""cutscenes"". Joining expeditions causes you to wade through a massive list of SOS calls as if it's not even a thought of part of the game.Overall just a horrible Coop experience which after 9 hours of trying my hardest to fiddle with it has put this game on my permanent uninstall list.Why is simple out of the box Coop that works for every mission so difficult to accomplish?",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,194,False,Recommended,A few things to note about this game.... first of all if you are expecting some larger scale MMO then you are in the wrong place. This game creates online sessions that you can play with random people or to create sessions that you can play with others that you know on your friendslist that has MHW. You can also attempt to solo most of the content(which is doable but can be challenging.... and possibly boring if you don't like playing alone)If you have a microphone or a headpeice you can readily talk to randoms as well as friends once you join an online session.Parties are usually in groups of 2 4 players and usually you will need to join a post that a player has accepted in order to join. However if you are in trouble and need some help you can usually send out an SOS flare and someone can usually join up in your location.The party mechanism is basically like Phantasy Star Online. You get into the game session with others start your quest see if others will want to join get out and complete quests and story.The gameplay itself can be somewhat clunky at times. Things that I would assume have quicker reaction times usually take a half second (like shielding) and that can easily translate to getting hit by a monster. It is possible that I've been spoiled by MMOs with more fluid movements like TERA and FFXIV when it comes to moving in different directions. I believe this is the first Monster Hunter to actually hit the PC so I suppose I can give it that. TERA also has a Lancer the pressing to defend usually takes less than half a second compared to what feels like a long time for MHW.You can choose upon 14 different weapons (a few of them have similar playstyles.) A few are more fluid than others when it comes to moving around (which is reasonable given the weapons. You can progress the story with all weapons it is really up to your playstyle and how well you do with them that counts.The Graphics of the game is awesome so much so that I decided to buy a new readeon GPU just to be able to handle the game.Graphics 9/10Fluidity of movement 7/10Connectivity with other players 7/10Gameplay against large Monsters 10/10Music 10/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,96,False,Recommended,As a veteran of the series I was worried that bringing the series into mainstream would negatively impact some of the things that I most liked about the series that frequently drove new players away (learning curve grinding simplicity etc).

2018-08-13,0,0,13,False,Recommended,EDIT I am changing my review to a positive despite the server issues. This game is great fun. Initially I played with a controller but I just couldn't get past a certain point solo because I'm generally a KB/M user.On a wim I decided to launch MH to try it with KB/M. With a little adjusting of the mouse sensitivity I find it takes this game from ok to amazing. For some reason with a controller I have a tendency to button mash so I was getting hit instead of dodging and I also find movement a little clumsy on controller. With KB/M I am much for thoughtful and strategical in my gameplay for some reason I pay more attention to the monsters movesets and find the movement to be tighter and easier to position. Most importantly I don't spam attacks.If you generally prefer KB/M I really suggest you give it a try if you haven't and for those wondering it's viable.Game itself is top notch other reviews cover all that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,99,False,Recommended,This is an otherwise amazing game mired by issues that should never have made it to release. The gameplay itself is 10/10 but the port job is a 5/10 at best.I'm not including networking issues as those are actively being addressed by Capcom. However actual game performance is concerning. Lightning element particle effects(from weapons monsters areas) cause microstuttering behavior on the level that a single player with a fast hitting lightning element weapon can chunk your framerate in half by themselves. Any map that features lightning strike effects or distant lightning in the sky(Elder's Recess) will produce a stutter every 3 4 seconds regardless of whether you're actively looking at the effect. Blast particle effects also suffer from this turning those weapons and monsters like Teostra into a slideshow. This is not driver or hardware specific as it is reproducible for anyone and everyone. There are no settings available to edit that reduce or remove these particle effects meaning you are stuck with it until it is(hopefully) patched.Textures are muddy and low quality. I normally wouldn't complain about things like textures but having played the BASE PS4 VERSION the highest textures available on PC are lower resolution than on consoles. This is mind boggling and makes cutscenes play out looking like something from last gen.CPU usage is through the roof for some players. The game attempts to run 32 tasks regardless of the number of physical/logical cores your CPU has resulting in high temperatures and questionable performance for many especially those with older CPUs(and even those that meet the recommended specs). 4 core CPUs simply can't handle that sort of load efficiently and while this means the game scales well on multiple cores there are no concessions made to optimize the game for weaker hardware. For newer hardware this can still mean that running the game at higher framerates for you display junkies out there(targeting 144FPS+) can really REALLY heat things up.All in all this game gets a positive review from me solely because it is still Monster Hunter and Monster Hunter is amazing. But be aware of the issues with this port.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,83,False,Recommended,This game is definitely worth picking upWhile it is grindy to collect materials for a new weapon or piece of armour. It does it at least well compared to other games since every monster hunt is a boss fight which is very satisfying to fight as you learn their attack paterns for opportunities to strike at them. Or create opportunities on your own based on your weapon and gadgets to mount it knock it trap it or paralyze it to the ground.There pretty much only two issues i had problems with and thats the stupid design choice behind co op campaing. Even if you progress it with your friend at same missions you cannot join the other until both have went in solo and watched the cutscenes leading to the monster encounter then almost everyone backs out and joins in that one friend or everyone backs out and starts the mission all over again.The second issue is the unstable server connections as you might suddenly drop middle of a boss fight and left there forced to finish the boss off alone. Or whole day you can't join any sessions but can still play offline.When it does work you can have pretty awesome moments fighting monsters both solo and in a party as you begin mastering different kinds of weapons.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,131,False,Recommended,Currently some high cpu usage and some network problems but I have no doubt that those (or at least the network problems) will be fixed soon. The game also has a painfully long and boring tutorial thing in the first hour which is really out of place in a Monster Hunter game but other than the problems listed here the game is absolutely fantastic.If you're the kind of person that buys a game on launch and whines endlessly about technical issues maybe you should consider playing on console.

It was on consoles too and they got a fix which we were EXPLICITY IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS told would not be fixed on launch. We were also told it WILL be fixed. They couldn't figure out a reasonable way to separate the server side issues from the patch. Just play single player and challenge yourself a little. As far as the controls go I've had 0 issues playing a Light Bowgun with Keyboard/Mouse (KB/M) Seeing very few complaints about them for melee. I also haven't exprienced ANY input lag on my mouse whatsoever. This is likely a hardware issue for others. I think this is simply people who just can't adapt. The game has translated very well and it's made a LOT of quality of life changes over previous entries in the series. If you're new to Monster Hunter this is the game for you. If you're a diehard fan you'll probably love this entry as well. I think nearly all of the complaints so far are from people who played it on console. Seriously just adapt.

2018-08-15,0,0,233,False,Not Recommended,"I want to recommend this game I really do. The gameplay itself is very fun the mechanics are really enjoyable and they've removed a lot of the tedium that was found in the previous games. The maps and worlds are nice to explore the way the monsters interact with the environment can be very compelling. The combat is fun the monster vs monster fights are very cool to be a part of but that's what's good about this game. I can't recommend it however in its current state.The optimization in this game is rather awful the textures are low quality (Nice from far but don't look too close and the textures look like .Then there's this whole steam connection/disconnection bug you've probably seen happen to other friends. The game isn't crashing but you're losing connection to steam whether it's the archaic DRM they have in place or some steam API bug it causes a noticeable impact inside the game. Just have your friend list open on a second monitor and you'll see every time you disconnect from steam you get a 10 15 fps drop in game an in game stutter and this likely results in the monster getting a free hit on you despite you not being in range.The coop for the main mission is so broken and unfun to play with friends. You can't join half the missions with friends and when you do let them go and do the mission and shoot a SOS flare you can't ever join them just keeps saying ""Failed to join""So as much as I am enjoying playing solo and going through the story this is hard sell to recommend it's got so many issues the mass of negative reviews are warranted.Great gameplay everything else not so much.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,100,False,Recommended,This is not a game for everyone in fact i had doubt when I played for the first hour or so but after getting through the initial story driven opening stage I found myslef in the comfortable embrace of Dragon's Dogma. This was a great turn for me as previous Hunter games I had struggled to stick with them despite the appeal of setting and setup but to me they lacked the fuidity that is here in World.Now if little to none of that above made sense my advice is try to stick with it for about 4 hours...maybe more depending on your aptitude and then decide if it's the game for you. I personally found it more helpful to operate solo it allowed me to pick up the pace of the game however that also limited my choice of weapons.Also I've had little to no issue with graphics or otherwise network I can't reliably inform on as I live in a far of land with poor internet as is so it's hard to determine if it's my fault or not. I have had it crash only 1 time out of 40 hours not bad at all and it was in a very climactic situation filled with monsters and explosions.Honestly i had been craving a DD like game in recent history and this scratches the itch for me. At some point I imagine I'll grow bored after I've collected all the armour and weapons I want hunted all I want and....something else I'm sure. However I give it a full 9.75 out of 10 could there be more sure there can always be more but for what it is it's pretty fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game is great Graphically its amazing Creatures Characters and Enviroment are beautiful and gives you a good feeling.I never played Monster Hunter Before but this game has made me a fan. (That should tell you a lot already)There are lots to do in this game and its fun if you farming a particular monster for gear there is always different variables given in the mission. The only issues are Sometimes servers go in offline mode you dont lose anything only your party however you can rejoin them after restarting the game. Capcom is fixing this.Sometimes there are frame drops but capcom is fixing this as well.I hope this review will help you you cannot go wrong in buying this game You will love it despite the early issues which is not as big of a problem as many make it to seem.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,Definitely a good game but the experience is dampened by multiplayer issues. And being a multiplayer game I'll have to not recommend it for now. So far my experience has been mostly positive other than a few items which has been repeated again and again. It truly is a gorgeous game which is plagued by some issues Capcom really need to fix RIGHT NOW. Multiplayer is a mess Story missions often require each player to go it alone until a certain cutscene before allowing group play then players 2 4 have to all abandon their quests and join player 1's ongoing quest. Even then my friend has trouble finding my SOS Flare to join in my ongoing quest almost 100% of the time. I've only ONCE had random players respond to my SOS flare but my session disconnected not 5 minutes after.Which brings us to the MULTIPLAYER aspect of it. Constant disconnects happen FREQUENTLY and this becomes extremely infuriating when you're in the middle of taking down a large boss and your friends disconnect leaving each player to defeat it themselves. Having the hunt disrupted by a random disconnect after 20 30 minutes of teamplay is ridiculous and as long as this issue prevails I cannot properly recommend this game. As of this moment even hunting down the Anjanath has seen disconnects happen to me and my teammates 5/5 times.Simply put if you're looking for a multiplayer experience MHW at it's current state will only frustrate you more than you'll spend enjoying it. If you're playing solo this game is gorgeous and definitely worth taking a look.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But at it's core this is an amazing game I've been a fan since 3 and this game has some of the greatest polish the series has seen.

2018-08-12,0,0,25,False,Recommended,This is by far one of the best games of 2018. Tbh the servers have been poor but i think its going to get fixed soon so it's nothing to worry about. The unskipable cutscences are a pain in the to watch especially when one of the characters is annoying (The handler) but i hope this gets fixed when the modding community gets ahold of the game. The multiplayer in this is not has bad as people say it is besides the servers the mutiplayer is A one and the whole thing about you haveing to watch the story cutscene before you can play with a friend is tedious but i think it dosent stop the multiplayer being enjoyable. 9/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,104,False,Recommended,NOTE Coming back after 25ish hours of play to update this changing it to a Recommend overall but with some caveats. Previously I did not recommend this game.Pros It's Monster Hunter and it's finally on PC It's made many small improvements to old MH mechanics such as not having long gather animation to pick up a bug or plant (carves still have an animation) being able to walk slowly while using consumables or more monsters having a lot of breakables making fights more dynamic World looks pretty damn good even on lower setttingsCons FOV is low and can't be changed Motion blur can't be turned off DoF can't be turned off Mouse control very poorly emulates a control stick causing huge input lag and a set camera speed. This can be remedied with .ini edits (lower the base mouse speed in the ini and then raise the in game sensitivity) but it's still not as good as actual mouse controls High quality textures seem to be bugged game uses some low quality textures regardless of settings. There is a similar problem with water reflections. Poorly optimized but I've seen worseHonestly the mouse problem is by far the biggest detriment to this game. If you're as big a MH fan as I am you should still give it a shot. The 2 hour refund window is long enough to see if you can deal with the mouse controls after editing the .ini. It works well enough for me especially with melee weapons. The game itself is great so if you can deal with the technical issues I highly recommend you get this game. But if you can't I totally understand. Luckily the devs are aware of the issues so hopefully we'll have a fix soon.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,224,False,Recommended,Amazing game first game ive bought off steam sale for a long time and I can honestly say well worth it. It's much much more fun with friends and messing around with friends. Network sessions things a bit frustrating but they seem to have stabled a bit for me now. I'd love for them to be completley stable though. I love the feeling of tracking the monsters running sliding down slopes mounting monsters. I love the graphics..absolutely amazing. Some of the armors are really gorgeous too. I played generations before this and watched a lets play of Tri and i can honestly say this one is my favorite one by far. They did a lot of small improvements from generations especially like how you can switch equipment mid quest and store items to go out and collect some more. And if you run out of potions you can go grab some more or craft some more from your boxes. The palicoes are also so much more useful in Generations in my opinion they weren't very useful at all now I always want my palico around. Wish you could have them around for more then 3+ members tho. The combat (for dual blades at least cause thats what I play atm) Is amazing. Its a bit frustrating with some of the animation locks but you kinda learn what animation lock moves to avoid during certain times. I love collecting pets exploring the ares finding little cool nooks in certain areas (lke the treetop camp in Ancient forest &lt 3 &lt 3 love that area). And the palico sidequests! Also i love the little extra details like when you capture a monster it shows up in the hub. I love the poogie and finding costumes for it (of course) and the cute Handler lady along with the hilarious Meowsuclar chief.) I love the fact you actually dont end up with that shabby room the entire game and get upgrades and you can place the wiggly guys you get from Coral Highlands into the pots of your 2nd upgrade house. Just little things like that really make the experience much more fun. I love hunting the large monsters themselves of course too prefer to capture them but its really fun moutning and chasing them grabbing materials to make flashpods bombs traps etc. All in all I extremely enjoy this game. Some parts can be very frustrating (the animation locks on certain moves and the network sessions ESPECIALLY) but when your settled in it gets fun. And i feel like I just find new fun things as I go on. Also the arm wrestling at gathering hub is great and being able to sit at pretty much any canteen and do the gestures of falling on your,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,82,False,Recommended,"This is my first time really playing and committing to a Monster Hunter game. I tried on the Wii and DS but could never get into it.GRAPHICS Stunning. I have a 1080 i7 and 16gb of RAM and I get easily over 60fps. The detail is amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about not being able to turn off motion blur but I guess that is something for the purists to worry about.GAMEPLAY Okay. At first I was like ""what the hell am I doing"". Please don't get discouraged.. Eventually I was hitting buttons with muscle memory and knocking the $#% out of anything that dared cross my path. Yes there is a lot to learn. After 10.5 hours I am STILL learning. I have barely scratched the surface of the content and possibilities of this game. If you've never played Monster Hunter you basically get a quest to hunt a monster and then you hunt that monster. You use the parts of said monster to craft new gear and weapons so that you can hunt bigger cooler monsters. I'm obviously oversimplifying. COMBAT I've only used the dual blades so far but everything about the combat feels gratifying smooth punishing but fair. DIFFICULTY If you've played Dark Souls you should know how games like this roll. This isn't as difficult as Dark Souls IMO. The fights are difficult but this game isn't designed for you to die repeatedly until you learn every last mechanic (like Dark Souls). Instead this game punishes you for making stupid mistakes. Think like unloading on a monster and getting yourself stuck in a combo so you can't move out of the way while the monster starts to attack.A lot of people are giving bad reviews because the online play is currently wonky.. But all new releases struggle with online play when they're first released so w/e.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-22,0,0,54,False,Recommended,I know theres a big blue thumbs up icon for this review but I was very reluctant to give it.MHW is a game that could be so much better. Better story better enemy/locale design but most of all better combat. If you're considering buying this game its likely you've played a Souls game. And if you're like me you may have forgotten that Dark Souls spoiled you to all other 3rd person combat. It's especially apparent here where the developers seemed unable to create a truly fluid movement/combat synergy. It's finnicky and at times not very responsive. Monster Hunter World is like Dark Souls stuck in mud. Imagine Dark Souls but you can only fat roll From Software never came up with another rolling animation and thats all there was. Thats MWH in a nutshell.This is my first foray into the series but I'm sorry to say I'm unimpressed by its pedigree. Not only is lore non existent but I think the fact that the developers may have had to stick to whatever traditional formula they had may have even held it back. Oh and even though there are like 60+ bosses half of them are either literally reskinned (pink rathian? black diablos? azure rathalos? rathadabadingdong?) or they're a not so subtle copy of another boss (lavasioth is a ing jyuratodus with fire on it.) Almost the exact same moveset and look the same. Salamander flying lizard spiky lizard dog lizard and bird. there ya go thats all of them.HOWEVER. Smashing a massive sword into a t rex in the boughs of a giant tree is kinda fun even if you have to jump through hurdles to get there.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,164,False,Recommended,Writing this just before the end of the first week.While there are some glaring PC issues kb+m scheme slightly unstable multiplayer some video options you wish you could turn off as a whole I would definitly recommend the game. I do believe these issues will be hammered out in short order since this is Capcoms flagship game making its debute on PC.Core gameplay loop is fun and engaging. There are 14 very unique weapons to choose from and all of them seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. They range from standard sword and board to crazy artillary cannons.Right now I am in low rank and am told the game gets much more difficult in high rank. As it is right now monsters do go down and I have only died a few times but combat keeps you on your toes and I am looking forward to the increased challange. There seems to be a multitude of ways to enage the enemy including enviromental traps and special launcher ammo that can help strip armor or stun.Wandering around in an expedition and collecting all the unique flora and fauna to keep around your house is very fun. This is certainly a game for people who like to take time smell the roses take in the scenery and just collect stuff.In short a great game that needs to hammer out some port issues to become and absolutely stunning game but even now I would recommend it. You just might want to use a controller for the time being (they have said they are looking to fix the mouse issues).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,122,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Gameplay? It's fun(most of the time). It's MHW as it has been for the previous 8 months on console. That's why its so popular and selling so well currently.The networking? It is nigh impossible to play this game. The networking issues are endless 90% of missions I have tried to play have been plagued with connection issues regardless of whether playing alone or with a group. The 25 hours I've logged so far have been a cycle of watching cutscenes then immediately backing out of the hunt then going back in with friends then trying to defeat the monster without a connection issue. If you all get through the hunt awesome! its a gamble to try and get through the next one. For a ranged user(HBG) each connection failure means a hunt that needs to be backed out of which means money lost buying more ammo especially if you are the one who loses connection. It would be one thing if it threw you out of the hunt if you had a connection issue but instead it plops you in your own instance with a strenghtened monster setting you up for failureThe cherry on the cake? You can get connection errors while trying to play by yourself. You can get kicked out of your own session then be unable to join it. You have to actively fight the game just to play it.Maybe wait a few months for stable networking (or player rates to die off) before buying to play this game proper.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Perhaps all these bad reviews are from console people because I can't find any negative about the graphics controls or server issues.

2018-08-15,0,0,107,False,Recommended,The game is great in my opinion best monster hunter out yet The online is reported to be spotty(haven't tried it too much but there has been many complaints to the point they took it off on Tencent) Story can be done purely by yourself which is great (as far as I know but even then there's the SOS system if you ever run into trouble) People complain about how they didn't fix how to set up lobbies that it's a straight port and it is but I don't know what they were really expecting. It's the same as console when it comes down to it and that isn't that bad a thing So many options for graphics making it very easy for a not so great PC able to run it enough (at min specs it pretty much looks like an early ps3 game so it really isn't that bad. Veterns from 4U and Gen will be fine with it we played on a 3ds screen for hours on end after all) Controller support is great (Big picture mode lots of options) Keyboard is still viable if you're worried about how to set up a comfortable scheme just look at an Arekkz video my dude The game is just so much fun (but if you're new I'd reccomend to wait for the next patch but don't just disregard it because of these issues at launch Capcom stated that they're aware and will fix it),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Older games seemed to be very ridged and bulky if that makes sense. Not having to carry around axes nets and bait helps the game feel smoother. The drinking potion and eating animations are so much better now not just a cheesy flex. Loading is virtually gone and being able to hop into other friends hunts is awesome. Something older monster hunters lacked and what now feels like something I couldn't live without. The attention to detail in the world and diversity makes this game a lot of fun as well.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

As I only had a pc I had to wait on the sidelines until the pc release many months later. Even with all the anticipation I had up into this game it still exceeded my expectations. The game is not perfact but I love it. The only major issue I had is the unreliable online servers but hopefully that will be remedied soon. The game is beautiful and I have not had a singe crash as of writing this. I measure a game on how much it has me thinking about it and to an extent fantasizing when I'm not playing such as with Skyrim and Farcry.

2018-08-23,0,0,96,False,Recommended,A few points of the game you should to know if you want to play. The whole game is hunting monsters obviously. If you don't like killing monster's over and over this will get very grindy. Fights feel sorta long even when they take just over 10 mins. Lacks any pausing feature in offline mode so if your in the middle of a fight and wanna leave the COMP for some reason. You will have to run away and hide in a camp. I would compare it to Dark Souls bosses in the way your ment to play. It's trial and error just a bit easier than some Dark Souls bosses. (Note i don't think it ever took more than 10 mins to kill a DS Boss). But fights take 10 30 mins to kill the first time on some of them. Groups of people that are good and don't die can down even the hardest bosses around 10 mins. I enjoy the game a lot but my only concern is the time it takes to do things. I want to craft new Armor i have to kill the boss 3 or 4+ times in later it seems to take around 10 ish times. But if your lucky with loot drops maybe slightly less. Overall fun game IMO just a bit grindy but that's ok no real new releases tell OCT NOV. So it will help fill time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Now I can say what I really think.I think this game is fantastic with friends. Solo its very grindy and gets rather stale if you can't manage to keep yourself entertained by it. With friends however it's always fun and there's a huge boost in variety and entertainment. Like I keep saying I think this game is an absolute ton of diamonds that just happens to be wrapped up in a box comprised of soggy cardboard smeared with feces to keep it together. the menus are terrible the UI is unfriendly the tutorials don't often teach you EXTREMELY VITAL THINGS you NEED to know about it and a small mountain of other extremely tiny nitpicks that don't quite equate to actual problems as much as the things I listed do.But past those minor inconvinences is a ing treasure trove of exheilerating gameplay and a combat system with beasts that you just can't get anywhere else. remember your first time playing Dark Souls or Bloodborne and you pull off something just extraordinary and you leapt up in your chair and screamed a little bit because you were so entranced by it?Imagine that exact feeling but most fights have a moment like that. It's a in awesome game with a few decisions and bad menu programming bogging it down but never enough that I don't wanna wrangle up a few friends and get pounded to death by a giant dragon for a few hours.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

MHW is easy to pick up and has enough gameplay depth to keep even the most experienced hunter captivated well after the main campaign is finished. There are lots of things to do in MHW whether it's grinding out levels farming for materials or researching monster types there's plenty to keep even the most thorough player busy for quite some time.The story portion is rather generic but serviceable with kill x monster get a cutscene repeat. There are lots of quests but only a few areas to explore you'll be investing all of your game time in about 7 locations. Although unlockable areas are limited monster types are varied enough to not feel repetitive bosses are numerous with unique move sets and there are plenty of ways to handle given quests. If you get tired of killing monsters you could always bait them with meat go fishing or search for some of the games many secrets.Combat is where MHW really shines. With many different weapon types all with unique move sets and abilities it really opens up possibilities for different play styles. The action has a trinity of sorts with emphasis on either damage defense mobility or healing. It's entirely dependent on how the player would like to build their character. There's also flourishes like charms and armor decorations to accent abilities to balance out builds.In regards to combat everything feels precise and well thought out the fights never feel cheap. When you make a mistake or fail in combat it's from lack of experience not the game using cheap gimmicks to artificially make things harder. The combat in MHW feels much different than other action role playing games. There is no weapon swapping in combat and actions have a lot of weight to them.Now for the negative aspects of MHWSometimes while playing with a controller the radial menu is unresponsive. I find myself having to activate an item with several tries sometimes. It's an annoyance for sure but nothing game breaking. Currently there are 4 menus of 10 items and an extra menu that cycles through one item at a time which are activated by holding left bumper pressing a direction on the dpad then using the right thumbstick to select and then pressing the A or X button. The default hotkey menus on a controller are cumbersome. I would much rather have different sets of hotkey items that activate from the dpad instead of the current set up.The target lock system is without a doubt the worst part of the combat in MHW. Instead of locking onto what's being looked at it cycles through choosen targets throughout the map. It really breaks the dynamics of an auto lock system and because of this in the middle of a fight I find myself fighting more with the targeting system than paying attention to whatever it is that I'm hunting.Currently there are lots of issues with online multiplayer random drops players not being able to connect effectively rendering MHW a single player experience for lots of people. This is a recent issue for me but while the multiplayer was working there were no desync problems in terms of frame skipping or deaths due to disconnects. However the servers do disconnect groups in the middle of missions rather frequently and that has been going for since launch for me.Some folks are experiencing performance issues with older rigs and frame drops under heavy load. Personally I've not had these issues but there are lots of reports in the discussions.There are already third party mods and tools to change everything in the game. With no anti cheat implemented there isn't anyway to stop this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Mouse and keyboard controls are incredibly awful. I played on PS4 for over 500 hours. And holy For a company that took extra time to release the Pc version the Mouse+Keyboard controls are awful. The camera controls don't have a sensitivity slider and the mouse seems to be moving in a.....corrected manner? It doesn't move acurately where you want it to.Not to mention how poorly optimized this game runs on low graphics. I'm running better on medium graphics than on low.That being said this game loads much faster than it did on PS4 and if you play with a controler you can bypass most of the issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Like many games on launch it has a few quirks (the connection issues at the time of this review are annoying but will eventually get resolved) but don't let it deter you from a very polished game in just about every other way.

2018-08-12,0,0,103,False,Recommended,"There are two problematic kinds of negative reviews at this moment 1) ""I'm new to the series and this doesn't feel like Assassins Creed at all. The controls must be complete t I'm getting hit all the time. I better write some bad review before understanding the basic mechanics of this game and go get my refund.""2) ""The only mode is not working at all. I'll show them and give a negative review until they fix it.""The second one is totally understandable if that's their game experience so far and they only want to play online mode. Still I personally didn't have lot's of problems playing with friends. Although there defenitely are problems which may or may not be just because of the huge amount of players trying to play the game on a saturday after release.But the first category really makes me angry. Monster Hunter World is pure gold for me so far. Yes I played MH Games before. This doesn't mean that I'm a fanboy that can't have any other opinion. It just means that I already went through the process of learning how to play this game before. And I can tell you that it's worth giving MHW a try. The game is a lot of fun if you get deeper into it. There are fascinating Monsters and techniques to hunt them. Also I don't care about people who think a PC game should look better than a PS4 one. The scenery looks georgeous especially the later territories I don't want to spoil you about.TLDR Git gud or enjoy the games you like instead of giving negative reviews to games you didn't really get to play truly",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,29,False,Recommended,So much nostalgia I remember playing MonHon on the psp for many hours Now everyone can play it on the PC! Only problem with the first week of launch is the servers sometime acting up for some people. Somtimes server disconects or you can't join friends So far no problems on my side but its still an issue that needs to be fixed even for the first week of its launch,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,41,False,Recommended,Right firstly i have this on 2 different platforms and can honestly say this is an awesome game but that being said i can understand why its taking some flak over a few of the issues which is understandable theres a few options that are missing that shouldnt be which odds are they will intergrate into the game after a few updates. Porting a game of monster hunter worlds size was never going to be easy and was never going to be perfect from the get go i will admit that the server issues trying to get into a multiplayer session from the main menu is a right ball ache but try searching for one once in a private lobby and odds are after a few attempts you will finally get into one. Now for some of the graphical issues i cant really comment on as i guess ive been rather lucky and not really had any of those issues occur same with the game crashing ive only had that happen once since the release. The ones i do feel for though are the people who have brought the game and not even able to get the game to even start that is a issue that should not even exist for any game that is being released thats a quick fire way to pouring petrol over you're own franchise and setting it on fire. On a whole though the game can be a lot of fun even running solo till the server issues are fixed just stick to a private lobby and if you get stuck look for the sos flares that people have sent out for help on any mission you are stuck on or start up the mission and fire one out and ope for the best that someone can join. This game i do recommend for those that are patient enough to deal with the issues that this game has right now if you are not a patient person then i would suggest that give it a try but i would recommend you to wait till the issues are fixed as this is a fantastic game and would suck if you allowed these issues ruin what is a great game for you in the long run only hope we can all have is that they sort these problems out.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Please don't judge this game on the connection issues alone. Sure it's quite annoying to drop connection but this is a complete blast to play even offline. I know this is game is geared towards multiplayer but it is quite the achievement even solo. I purchased this game after buying the ps4 one at launch and I do not regret it. I run an i7700 Nvidia Gefore 1060 6g32g ramThe game runs nearly flawlessly on highest settings.REMOVE THE VOLUMETRIC FOG though.I love this game.

And I'm in love!It is a true RPG that is overwhelming at first but gets better the more you play it!There is 100s of hours to be had and even more with future DLC.Perfomance wise I'm running 1080ti 1700X 3.9 ghz16gb 3200 CL14 ram Played at 1440p max settings I get between 80 100 fps the frame times/pacing is excellent and 80 fps feels great! I've not had a single hitch or random FPS drop yet!I highly advise having a 4770k or above as the game is CPU heavy. It uses all 16 threads on my CPU ) at around 30 50% cpu usage.

2018-08-23,0,0,244,False,Recommended,First off.It is absolutely understandable that alot of players are angry about the connection Issues. And i get that. BUT!AND THERE IS THE BIG BUT.The game itself works perfectly fine even with older peripherals. And that's the moment i don't understand why all of you little whining kids are rating this Game so low. Of course i can say with over 200hrs ps4 experience *in where the game even ran waaay more worse than it does now*The Controls are a mess but nothing you can't handle if you sit the fk down and figure things out a bit.The Soundtrack the effects the small details they're all well done. Don't negatively judge the game for those small discrepancies that's what patches are for. Considering that this is just a port it works pretty damn well. And with a bit of patience and some Solo Quests you can now actively play Online with your Friends and have a Grand ol'time!Don't always hate Games so much with your self proclaimed wisdom of nothing essentially.

2018-08-18,0,0,26,False,Recommended,EDIT They have rolled out a patch to fix the connection issues. Since this in no way fixes all the online issues it will allow users to have a much more stable connection during hunts and will allow much more reliable hunts with friends. Have personally not experienced a disconnect after the update and would now recomment the game since hunting monsters with randos is enjoyable for me.This game would have been so good. Just imagine hunting monsters with your friends.This is not that game however. Multiplayer simply does not work. And the multiplayer tag on this game is a flatout LIE.If you like hunting monsters in Single Player games this is the game for you. It is NOT however a multiplayer game as advertised...

2018-08-16,0,0,199,False,Recommended,With nearly 150 hours on the clock i must say that the game does have its fair share of problems and is not a game for everyone. With that said i would say at the moment the game isn't entirely worth what it is once some of the issues have been fixed especially the connectivity ones i would reccomend giving it a go once the main problems have been resolved first though.But if you're fine with going through and completing the game solo by all means go for it and once you get a feel for the game it gets a lot more enjoyable.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This is a great entry point into the series and while there still is a learning curve this game has by far the best QoL improvements in the series. Essentially the game is a grindfest. You hunt monsters to get better gear so you can hunt bigger monsters to get better gear rinse and repeat. I'm a big fan of ARPGs like Diablo Grim Dawn etc. and the Soulsborne series and Monster Hunter plays almost like a hybrid of the two game types.I highly recommend this game once you get passed the learning curve found which weapon you enjoy and everything starts to click MHW will most likely become your new addiction.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Seems like a lot of folks are having problems with this game... I myself am of the lucky few that has almost none.As such I can recommend the game.Now At firs Monster Hunter World might look a little daunting there is a lot to absorb And the tutorials aren't the best.Just a wall of text with maybe a picture or vid and that's it you might face some difficulties if you just ignore them so I'd recommend reading them because there is a lot. But when you learn the basics and core mechanics everything comes naturally.Now the story is kinda interesting but It's not well presented as it is not the main focus... and in all honesty shouldn't be. Main focus and gameplay loop for that matter of this game is simple kill monsters &gt make gear &gt kill stronger monsters &gt make even better gear and so on.That's what you should expect nothing more nothing less... It's a grind it's a farm though not as bad as in some other games but it is still a lot of fun thanks to monsters feeling unique amount of weapons and builds to play with and breath taking views to see.The combat is good now it could feel better... like Dark souls with which there are some similarities. But it still is really good.My only few gripe as of now is that game sometimes crashes on startup but runs very well otherwise .And that game very often gets connection errors when in online session which is very bad as a multiplayer is also big part of the game.All and all I'd call this solid 8/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,53,False,Recommended,I bought this on PS4 and loved it so much that I decided to wait until the PC release so I could have even better graphics and FPS. Capcom did not disappoint! I ve been able to maintain a steady 50 FPS on 1440 with a 1070ti. Everyone has been experiencing server issues but that s kind of expected at launch for most online multiplayer games. The console release had those issues to but they ironed it out pretty quickly there and I know they will here to. They waited this long to release the PC version specifically because they wanted to make it as good as possible for us instead of rushing it s release to coincide with the console releases. This game is a labor of love for the fans and newcomers alike! I hope you like it as much as I do,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,219,False,Recommended,My dream come true. A true next gen monster hunter for pc. As a long time monster hunter fan I can say that this game is perfect. It is the best monster hunter game ever. However the issue arrise from the port. It's not a complete write off. but it does have some issues. I hope they can fix them. But they aren't that severe to be honest. There are way worse ports and releases. This is not a bad port. It's just a little buggy and less optimized than I would have hoped. Just a bit of advice turn off Volume Rendering Quality. You'll get a huge perfomance gain and the game looks better in my opinion.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,136,False,Recommended,The Monster Hunter World PC version is a good port of the PS4 version. At launch you get higher frame rates higher resolution faster load times and the ability to play online for free. Right now the servers are having some trouble so online play is a bit tough at the moment but there is enough solo content to get through that can take a week. This game will be a grind fest so expect that going in.Controls on the PC are playable I'm used to using the PS4 controller which it can support.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-14,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Incredible. I am one of those Gamers that have a very short fuse when it comes to having patience in myself. Because of this I have a tendency to rage at games that are themed around big boss battles. Needless to say I can't play Dark Souls. It wasn't until I came across Monster Hunter worlds I realized how incredible these kinds of games are and how satisfying it feels to finally kick something's that has been holding you back for a long time.The game is absolutely beautiful even on the lowest settings the game is possible to play by yourself or with friends all the way up until the end and the differences between each of the weapons you are able to choose from it basically changes the entire way the game is played when you swap out your weapon. 150 (PC) 230 (PS4) hours in there's still a lot to do and more loot to get. The characters are lovable as are the companions. Part of me wishes the story was a little bit longer. If you are like me and you have never played Monster Hunter before this is a great one to start at. The control scheme is different than all the other monster hunter games but this makes the game easier for those who have yet to play the other games this one is also by far the easiest one in the series yet. 10/10 tails will play lots.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,146,False,Recommended,"UPDATE the Devs fixed the majority of issues but still no 21 9 support. Other than that amazing game!!! This game is fun HOWEVER there are so many issues with this game that it really takes away from the fun factor. First The disconnects from the game. This has been the most annoying issue of the game. Unable to stay connected and getting a communication error. These network issues makes the game frusting and it becomes such a nuisance having to go threw the menus and re establish online connectivity then re join/re create the session then finally rejoin the quest. Also when questing it is dissapointing when you have ""lost communication"" with other players and still have the amount of lives set to 1 because of other players wiping out and it still being saved as you only have one life left to defeat the monster. This sucks less money to do stuff with and harder since now you only have one life with no one able to help because of these communication errors. I only recommend this game if you are going to be playing by yourself or if you are okay with communication errors and just use your imagination. otherwise wait until patch comes out.I'm excited to change this review as when the a patch comes out fixing the communication errors.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-14,0,0,192,False,Not Recommended,ive played old monster hunter games ( freedom untie on the psp) so its been a long ride with this series for me.This game is enjoyable untill you beat the main end game boss. after that its just turns into an endless grinding simulator that ultimately has no meaning at the end. no matter what gear you get or what you grind its always going to be the same fights and same formula pick up this capture these guys kill that guy. it becomes very bland and meaning less very quickly.They delayed the game about 7 months to make sure the game was a good port on PC which it is not. there are bugs in the game that havent been fixed since it came out and in general performance is abysmal. and dont even get me started on frame rates when you are fighting monsters with lots of effects. It blows my mind how they delayed the game half a year to make it run well and still it up.They are also setteling for a content over time thing. instead of releasing it all at once now people have to wait for several bosses and events with absolutely nothing to do because they decided to give a full price 60 dollar game missing content.id love to know what capcom did those 6 months because it looks like they did all. Would not recommend atleast not at the 60 dollar price tag.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,155,False,Recommended,This game is insanely fun. It cuts down all the crap from previous games that made hunting monsters annoying. Instead of paintballs that wear off mid fight for you to reapply miss then the monster going to off somewhere for you to find it instead has scoutflies who point you to your next trail to find then to the monster. It implements it extremely well and finding the monster now is actually kind of fun instead of insanely tedious if you didn't know spawn locations.The weapons are all revamped and have different movesets and fun ways to play Insect glaive can stay in the air almost indefinitely charge blade has a nice little sliding dodge move etc.Single player progress is tied to MP meaning you can get to high rank in singleplayer then go into multiplayer and join your friends in end game content. However this does have the drawback of forcing singleplayer due to not being able to join a new player's fight if you are new to that mission as well if it contains cutscenes which could ahve been worked better in my opinion.All these make the game more fun... Solo that is.The online is so ing insanely broken right now that I can't in good faith recommend this game for a fun consistent multiplayer experience with friends. Lobbies will bug after a certain amount of time and you can't join friends in them. Sometimes quests can't be accepted if a friend posts them. Othertimes your connection just straight up ends and you end up fighting a beefed up monster solo then if you do finish it you get reduced rewards from the people who disconnected.If they fix the online this game would be a 9 / 10. But as of right now because i'd like to play with friends it is only a 5 / 10. I do not recommend this game in it's current buggy multiplayer state.That being said if you play this game purely for Singleplayer then you will find no flaws other than the mouse aiming which isn't a huge issues imo after you start playing it and getting used to it.UPDATE 8/26/2018 They seemed to at least fix the multiplayer and it's working perfectly fine for me. However I have heard of it breaking matchmaking for other people. Also frame drops and Denuvo are still a thing which make this game almost unplayable on certain monsters.UPDATE 10/14/2018 They fixed the multiplayer as well as the particle effects of teostra and Kushala so now they don't like like hell for no reason.However Rotten Vale still lags very badly even with low settings and a 1080 GPU. Even with that fps problem the game is now a recommend to friends in my opinion/,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,182,False,Recommended,The Game is Great totally deserve a thumbs up even with the problems on game launch. With my 20+ years of gaming experience in my opinion there isn't a game that has no problem but that doesn't mean it's not a good game we should give credit where credit is due this is a great game It's not like the game has problem 90% of the time it is played on a scale of 10 I'd give this game a 9.5 if there were no problem with the game but since the game was released with connectivity issues and optimization issues(with a game of this level it will be fixed soon) it's still deserved an 8 rating because we can still play 90% of the game with no problem(unless you have a low power pc) which brings me to another point some of the gamers are complaining because the game is not functioning as they expect on their pc and give it a bad rating. Game should not be judged by the old or lesser powered system a person might be using but should be viewed on how the game is performing on a current generation computers. I'd give a thumbs down only If an expensive game crashes 50% of the time on a current generation pc with up to date driver and excellent internet connection has garbage content and gameplay.Should you buy the game? think about this I know some people in RL who complains like hell on this game but I see them play the game everyday like 5 6hrs a day. SO if they think the game is garbage and they say you shouldn't buy it then why are they still playing the game?For me I'm enjoying the game even with some current problems. I still feel it's worth what I pay for and I know it's only going to get better as time past and patch for fixes and improvements are released.Let's just focus on the good part of the game have fun and enjoy what we have and just wait for the fixes.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,72,False,Recommended,This game is quite frankly amazing. I've been expecting the PC release to come and now that its out I'm ecstatic. I've played a bit of the game knowing what to do as I couldn't wait to play MHW that I bought it on ps4 when it came out in February and am not disappointed. The only thing that seems a bit offsetting is it's very difficult to play in 60 fps with even medium settings if you aren't running with a decent i7. This game does use a lot of gpu but the difference in performance really shines while switching from an i5 to an i7. Other than what it takes to run the game at 60 it still feels like good old monster hunter with a nice twist. I would highly recommend this game if you are here for the core gameplay and mechanics but if you feel this is unplayable below 60 fps then steer away or wait for some optimization patches to come out that may do the trick. ***Also for reference I am using an i5 3570k overclocked to 3.6GHz along with a GTX 970 4GB. On High is settings I get around 50fps or a little higher in most areas but can expect drops to the mid 40's and even very high 30's (very rarely) whilst fighting several monsters in heavy foliage filled areas with lots in the background.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"This is my first MH game and I have 100 or so hours in the PS4 version before starting on this one. Once you get beyond the steep learning curve the game is pretty great and very addictive. The community (see Reddit) seem very open to teaching those willing to learn.I've been fortunate enough to avoid any issues with CPU/graphics (I'm on i7 4770k Zotac GTX 1080 for reference) and multiplayer so I can't really speak to those but my hope is that these are addressed for what seem to be a pretty large segment of the user base.A few tips don't be afraid to experiment! Over 100 hours and I just figured out that using slinger ammo will make the bird drop his damn rock... gather EVERYTHING at first. You can ease up on this later on but if you make farming a part of your hunting routine you'll always have a steady supply of healing pots and material for weapons/armor/traps/ammo. pick the weapon you like the most and learn to use it properly. In the right hands any one of the 14 weapon types can be useful on a hunt. Tons of videos out there that go through the move sets and strategy for each weapon. Try them all and you're bound to like at least 1 or 2 of them enough to stick with. SOS flares (once the multiplayer issues are worked out!!) are your friend. I don't really have friends who play this but (at least on PS4) if you SOS flare at the start of a mission I almost always got a few hunters join in and help. Just be aware that monster health scales with how many hunters are present. Quick money! Investigations involving small creatures (looking at you Vespoids and Shamos') are very quick to do and can yield a decent amount of money in ""High Rank"" (6 diffictulty stars or more).That's it for now.

2018-08-09,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Despite what the game timer says here rest assured I have well north of 120 hours in this game it's just on the PS4 version.Disclaimer the first hour or two of this game does NOT accurately represent what the rest of the experience is like those two hours are laden with tutorials and hand holding but you're pretty much let off the leash immediately afterwards free to enjoy the rest of the content in the game. I encourage people that are turned off by their first impressions to watch a few streams or the like to check out what the *real* game is like. I don't know what Capcom was thinking when they made the introduction but it's a very small hurdle to jump over in exchange for what follows. Now that that's out of the way let's tackle the quality of the port. It's pretty okay. As far as PC ports go in general it's average or slightly below thereabouts but coming from Japan and Capcom in particular this was way better than I expected. The most glaring issues I've encountered are the lack of plug and play controller support (you need to enable it in Steam's settings beforehand) and a bizarre graphical bug that causes everything to load in blurry and gradually sharpen up. Other than that the graphical options are actually quite well thought out and the ability to adjust the game to prioritize resolution or framerate is wonderful and very very appreciated. As for the game itself I honestly don't think I can phrase it any better than this I spent 120 hours getting through the game on the PS4 and I've had an absolute blast starting from the ground up on the PC. It's the most fun I have fighting large beasts in a video game easily surpassing the relatively grounded style of the Soulsborne games in favor of a more high octane action vibe while actually gaining tons more control. The variety in both weapons and monsters is nothing short of astounding and the steady stream of armor unlocks ensures that grinding always has rewards coming in. If you don't mind having the same fights a few times over to grind out a cool set of armor this is an easy recommendation if you do this comes a little less easily but I recommend you give it a chance anyway. Grinding is NOT required until you approach endgame it just helps you get there. This is easily my favorite game to be released in 2018 and one of my all time favorites. It's even better with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,126,False,Recommended,It's been a few years since I last played a Monster Hunter franchise MH3 on 3DS. I remember enjoying every bit of grinding back then and I'm sure I would love it now as well especially with online sessions. The PC port is also pretty decent albeit needing a beefy PC for it run on its best performance. Luckily my 5 year old PC can still run it in medium settings with 40fps. I guess it's time to upgrade haha.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game is pretty but me is the extended tutorial actually the worst intro to a game I have ever played. The game is pretty but I came home for a lunch to have a little taste test of the game and the entire time has been taken up with some of the worst lip syncing boring scripted events and needlessly long videos I have ever seen. Also devs that think forcing the player to walk behind an npc is fun I don't give a about your exposition FF this is not.I will never understand why devs (especially Asian ones) refuse to add a skip feature for cinematics. It is some really QoL stuff that helps a lot when people are short on time. Chat sequences can only be partially skipped as every last line of a character will play in full causing nauseating amounts of useless dialogue.Whoever thought ESC was a good choice for renaming your build is a nutter.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

How do you up a port so badly with the controls that it is almost unenjoyable to play and considering this is Monster Hunter. thats saying something.

Only thing that required a keyboard was the name entry at the beginning. Using a DS3 with Blutooth on Steam Link and it works perfectly as an XBONE controller.Which is good because the Steam Link was literally made for this game. If you can't play this on your TV you're missing out.All the over hyped performance problems have been fixed. I run silky smooth 60 FPS 1080p with a 1070 TI and i7 8700(not a low end rig but a reasonable expectation for high resolution gaming nowadays). Have not tried 1440p yet nor do I really care that much. 0 crashes or performance glitches or hitches experienced in my gameplay time.Other than that it's Monster Hunter with everything improved. No longer have to worry about keeping a stash of pickaces and bugnets which is the biggest improvement to quality of life IMO outside of generally quickened gathering. I will easily give this the hundreds of hours I've been investing into every title since the PSP era and much more given how fluid and downright sexy this game is.Highly accessible for beginners the 1 3 star quests introduce monsters slowly and slowly ramp up the challenge. Still has a steep learning curve but you have to go in expecting that to enjoy the game.Only bad thing is some of the early quests are very tedious but all of them end in an actual hunt and the slow parts go away quickly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,221,False,Recommended,"Pretty good port from what i've seen so far pretty decent performance. Great game if you like grinding stuff for a little bit fun collecting all the loot and crafting/upgrading all the armors/weapons. Doesn't really hold your hand tutorial wise have to figure out which weapon type you'd like to use how to pull off combos on your own and class mechanics (like resource bar and things pertaining to that). As for downsides the server seems to disconnect some people once in a while and put them in a offline instance but kinda to be expected from a super popular game at launch. Matchmaking in general also is kinda janky. For example doing story quests with friends is weird because sometimes it gives the ""You cannot join the quest because you have not progressed enough in the story"" which is bypassed by each person watching the beginning cutscene leaving and remaking the party after. Also joining friend's expeditions is really weird and buried in menus very hard to find. But at the end of the day the game is pretty fun at its core if you're into games like this that it would be easy ish to overlook these downsides and enjoy )",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Short summary there are some port problems but the game is very fun.It's sad to see so many negative reviews of this game when it is fun and got an amazing reception on console. Most of these negative reviews are not even talking about the main game itself but only leaving negative reviews bc of some usual settings missing and minor network problems. I find it funny to see so many ppl reacting heavily to the network issues when I find it to be expected that there will be issues surrounding the launch of a game. Hopefully these issues will be fixed but even if they aren't it's a matter of a few min to get reconnected to your friends again. Regarding the fps problems I've had no problems running this game on high settings with a 1060 3gb and i5 6600k at stock speeds. Sure I have not been getting 60 fps but more around 40 during moments with a lot of particle effects. But I have yet to experience huge framerate drops.The game itself is a very enjoyable experience and I find the combat to be rewarding. It works very well as a game to play with friends but is also fun if you wanna play it solo. I do find it a bit annoying that we can't play the main story line with each other without one of us having completed the quest but otherwise I have no qualms about the game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a grindy the game such as warframe or PoE and finds the combat of monster hunter to be enjoyable.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,491,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter is the series that quietly kept Capcom in business over the years. The world is absolutely packed with things to do ways to do it.The core gameplay loop is entering a Session ""What you're in until you quit the game or go back to the title screen"" and play in ""Matches"" as you select jobs investigations Arena fights etc. This can initally cause some confusion until you recognize the difference between them when trying to join friends. I've played nearly 20 hours and the first map STILL feels fresh every time I enter it even as I'm starting to recognize areas and find them familiar. And the combat system is something it feel's I'm getting a hold of but I'm sure I'm only just scratching the surface. 20 Hours and I'm still unlocking core features and it feels like a good thing! The combat itself is something like Dark Souls meets a Fighting game where you're fighting gargantuan enemies that can easily crush you if you leave yourself open so you need to be careful when and how you commit to attacks. The fighting game aspect is in how you have (At least) 3 different types of attacks to include with directional input and ways of comboing them into different series of attacks. The end result is combat feels weighty signifigant and honestly there's not much out there like it. It looks how it feels and it feels like you're some superhuman badass swinging around a pointy thing on a stick that's bigger than you are to whack colorful dinosaurs. BUGS There are currently SOME network issues people have reported but I've only encountered one crash on my end (Tabbing in and out quite a bit then it happened) and 2 network drops where we just had to make a new session and we were golden.

2018-08-16,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,"In the game's current condition I wont recommend people to buy it in full price or even 50% off original. It is definitely not worth what youre paying for. If on sale for more than 50% then I would completely recommend this game then because only then do I feel like youre getting your money's worth. IT IS A TERRIBLY PORTED CONSOLE TO PC GAME. With a basically non existent super buggy and unreliable Online Play. I want to love this game but I cant.Online play is basically non existent right now because of how frequently you get disconnected from servers while in the middle of quests/hunts/etc. This leaves you with loads of wasted time if you and your friends have been hunting a strong monster for over half an hour yet cant finish him off just because your friends disconnect from teh server for the millionth time. This is a super frequent experience (expect 2 5 times per 50min gameplay) that just completely kills the online function of this game. And I bought this game for the option to play online wioth friends so HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and outrage and frustration from that area. If this gets fixed (which it really should coming from a Triple AAA game title with a Triple AAA price tag that comes with it) then I will change my review on this aspect. However there are also other improvements that needed to be done too This port to pc is lacking serious love and attention from its creators and is in need of serious development for its PC game counterpart. The controls for the menu and even the annoying extra quick select dial are OBVIOUSLY just badly planned lazy copy pasted code from their console counterparts. There is so much unnecessary excess clicking or button clicking steps just to change one thing. You cant even click and drag the character in character creation to rotate him/her because they didnt bother adding any more keyboard&amp mouse accessibility improvements to the pc version of their game. So if the console controls didnt have it dont expect it in this platform either. This leads to some very clunky awkward and time consuming menu navigation and selection as well as some ""quick select dial on top of another quick select scrolling"" that just gets layered on top of each other making the quick select dial redundant. ...Did I mention that that quick select dial also gets in the way for when youre trying to move with WASD while pressing Q to scroll through your items and drink pots? That's what happens when you port a game badly.I also feel like youre just overly underpowered against the big monsters and not enough equipment are available for crafting. Hunting with friends helps keep the hunt for the tougher monsters a lot more enjoyable and fun and a lot less frustrating (and to be honest I just feel like this is a type of game that was MADE to be played with friends but with the way their online is right now it's loking like it's not). I know I'm only saying my main negative points here but that's because I want to put focus and highlight on the problems of this game first so as to get the much needed patches/updates to fix these very dire problems while there is still time and while developers are (hopefully) still seeking to correct and perfect their product for sales money or love or whatever is the reason they do what they do. I do recommend buying this on a sale of 50% or over as it is defintely worth the price for that but not morea s of this moment.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,93,False,Recommended,This game is just amazing. I bought and played the ps4 version when it came out and I loved it. When the pc release was announced I took a break from the game. Now I come back and it's even more breath taking than ever. For anyone wondering if you should buy this game I highly recomend it. It is the most beginer friendly in the series and is super enjoyable for long periods of time. Make sure you check that you can run the game before you buy it and then leave a nasty review because you simply couldn't read the specs. I have only had minor connectivity issues and thats based on the massive ammount of players all trying to play the game at once. The pc port was extremely solid in my eyes and the keyboard controls while not the best are certainly far from terrible and you could legitamitly play the game on them. A serious contender for game of the year in my book.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,Such a wreck of a release. Maybe buy it in a month if they get their act together. The multiplayer is worse than any other online game I've played. One of the main aspects of this game does not work as intended and should not have been released as is. The fact that you can't join a friend's game until a certain cutscene is completed is a complete hinderance to any sort of progression in the game with friends. If you are wanting to play with friends it slows the entire pace of the game down to a grind unless you go solo while your friends are waiting to get to a cutscene.The new game play is fine if you do single player but of all the Monster Hunters this is the worst I've ever played while trying to play with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

HOWEVER connecting to randoms is a lot rougher and harder espcially for SOSs with me 9/10 times it'll say ""Failed to join quest"" for SOS flares but when it is just my friends and I there is not problem at all.getting that out of the way It's a monster hunter game you fight in what is the best combat system i've ever played you kill big monster you craft his armor/weapons..you kill bigger monster and you repeat. the story was crap but monster hunter never even had a story till now so meh.

2018-08-17,0,0,106,False,Recommended,I've spent around 15h in the game so far but the game keeps the formula of MH series intact. If you are looking for a game where you can spend quite a hefty amount of time smashing brains and cutting tails then this game is perfect for you. The core is pure Kill the monster Craft armor/weapon from his remainings and kill other monster and so on. You can smash brains with three other players which makes the game much more fun. The world is beautiful full of details and it's effortless to get lost in time while gathering supplies and materials. Graphics are top notch the game is well optimized. Definitely the best entry of the series. As a long time fan of the Monster Hunter series I was expecting only improvements which I got. PC version has two major issues one being the keyboard layout and controls without a gamepad second being disconnects and other connection issues. Fortunately a lot of content is in this game and it is at its best when played with friends. Unfortunately this series (no game in particular) is not for everyone and most of the reviews are negative because of this.Verdict Personally I can only recommend this game Best played with friends It is hard but satisfying Nice graphics Fun,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,183,False,Recommended,I have a 5 year old PC with what I'm assuming isnt exactly top of the line hardware. I have 8gbs of RAM. The game plays with most of the settings on high looks beautiful and plays smooth. The load times are vastly improved over PS4. I have no complaints. Top notch port as far as I'm concerned.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,90,False,Recommended,I have spent way too much time on this game just going around learning all the different ways i can beat monsters in the 2 and a bit days its been out personally decided on twin swords since I'm not very smart and there are very few long sequence combos to know unlike some weapons. While there has been problems with online connections its only ever really upset me once when my friend was kicked moments before finishing a diablos hunt we had sunk a fair amount of efort into but I mean compared to many games Ive played at launch its quite good. I don't care much for the technical details but my rig is in the top 30 percent at least having purchased it early this year and it runs the game smoothly and quickly. Its a good game but if you're not a fan of the series already maybe wait till a sale or watch some videos to see if you like the playstyle as it might not be the game you are expecting.However I can't agree with the DLC cash grab scheme they have running don't buy the cosmetic dlc so they release free content instead of commercialising what should have been in the game originally,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,144,False,Recommended,I've been playing Monster Hunter games since Freedom Unite on the PSP and I've always wanted a Monster Hunter game on PC. This game has been perhaps one of the most user friendly monster hunters I've played with a wonderful control scheme (although the keyboard and mouse controls are lacking I've always played with a controller and probably always will but that's just my prefered method of playing). A lot of people are complaining about the server load and constantly being kicked but in my experience this happens with almost any major release of a game with online multiplayer. Even on PS4 and XBox my friends had the smae issues at launch. I think it is such a shame to see the reviews of the game being mostly negative but to each their own. I recognize this isn't a game series for everyone. I know I at least will play this game probably until the end of its life cycle and I hope others can get the same joy out of this game that I already have.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,122,False,Recommended,the game constantly causes steam to disconnect the controls on keyboard and mouse are good in my opinion coming from games like BDO.optimization is good on an I7 6700k 4.2Ghz + Nvidia 980Ti 1.3ghz. the game stays a solid 60 at max everything bar volumetric effects.tho i have noticed that when steam disconnects it coincides with a stutter ingame.overall i would still recommend this game. it is has its flaws in places but none are terrible enough for me not to enjoy it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,389,False,Recommended,A decent port of an incredible game. I don't get the people complaining about this being a bad port it works fines for me an my rig is only slightly above average (i5 8400 8GB Ram GTX 1060 6GB.),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Although the game has some technical issues right now don't let the mostly negative reviews put you off.The game is amazingly fun and the 60+ fps makes it much more enjoyable than the PS4 version personally. The buttery smooth gameplay just makes the game feel better overall especially in combat. Sure the network d/c from time to time but that's a type of minor issue that will obviously get fixed in a later patch. Also if you play mostly solo like me the network issue won't affect you at all. People are just way too sensitive these days the game deserves a much higher rating overall!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Well it works on my machine.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,46,False,Recommended,Easily my favorite game this generation. I've put over 700 hours into the PS4 version thanks to the constant free updates and DLC. This game is very rewarding. Each monster is basically a boss battle. Once slain you can use what you carve to make weapons and armor from that monster. Which goes for all the monsters in the game. Each armor has it's own skills attached (along with set bonuses) and with decoration (any RPG with a gem socket system) slots for more customization. You can play as harcore or as casual as you'd like. However your wallet isn't going to give you any advantages. All DLC is cosmetic Outfits for handler stickers gestures etc.The best part is co op. While the entire game can be done solo (actually easier since it's scales) it's much more entertaining with a group of friends. You will easily lose hours upon hours playing. If you played previous MH games you'll feel right at home with the combat. The big changes come from QoL improvements. Such as gathering no longer has you stuck in an animation heal and move eat before and during a quest restock items at camp during a quest and many other changes for the better. This is the perfect game to get into MH or even if you played old games but it just never clicked. It does a very good job at pacing for new players while verterns of the series like myself will blow right through (Low Rank). Performance wise I've had a flawless experience. Not a single crash frame dip or bugs. Seeing how I double dipped I couldn't be happier with the PC version. If you've played on PS4/Xbox and are curious about the PC version the load times alone are worth it if you don't mind starting over. On PS4 it will take me around 45 55 seconds to load into a quest (after it's done preparing). On PC I'm done prepading the quest and loaded into the game in less than 15 seconds. That's a lot of time spent waiting during my PS4 time. Capcom. G Rank Please?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,125,False,Recommended,I waited forever to get this on PC since I don't play console. I'm happy. I have an i5 6500 and an R9 390. I'm playing at 60 fps with my controller plugged in and this game was worth waiting for to play on PC.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Multiplayer's been patch but there's still hiccups I personally haven't disconnected mid quest since the patch.In any case this game's story is a Godzilla movie a step up from previous installments storyline. However I didn't play it for the story. The encounters with every new monsters is what hooked me during the early gameplay. What kept me interested in putting in more hours is the grind for equipment and the joy of doing missions with others.The scaling of difficulty as you progress is balanced with all the tools the game gives you to the point that it makes the game too easy. Although with human nature specially when it comes to greediness and RNG of the game an easy fight will turn into your worst nightmare.Overall fun game grindy social and many friendlies.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Being able to finall play one of these games on PC is a dream come true. Keyboard and mouse controls are great game runs at a constant 45 frames for me. Sure the disconnect bug is a little annoying currently but not worth throwing a baby fit over it and giving a negative review. I can still play solo and have a fun time. So definitely recommend this game. Naturally when you bring a great series to PC kids are going to cry that it's too tough because they're used to minecraft and fortnite holding their hand. Boo hoo.

So I can't really fault it for that because it is a standard with which the entire industry complies.If you want a lot of game for your money you can't go wrong with Monster Hunter World.

2018-08-12,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Tons of issues with this game right now. #1 Issue is network connection. Although this was present in the console version it's even worse here. Some sound files get glitched and just continue to play through out the quest. There's a horrible screen tear at the bottom that sticks for a moment if you get out of the menu too quickly. This game is simplfied from the previous Monster Hunter games to get new players into the series (I find this okay however if you're looking for G Rank and more challenge. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is coming soon.) Good things to note Looks gorgeous Runs at 1080p60fps or better with a decent PC Lots of fun I personally love this game but if someone was on the fence about this game... I would wait for a sale unless these issues get fixed. In the meantime I suppose I'll enjoy solo hunting.

2018-08-09,0,0,40,False,Recommended,"EDIT I am a moron. There is a setting to make the item select wheel work with the keyboard (I'm not entirely sure why this needs to be an option you select but that's beside the point). I change this to a positive review. Leaving the original review text below in case anybody is curiousEND EDITIt kills me to write this review. This is the first game I ever pre ordered and I was super excited. It turns out the controls are fairly horribly ported for keyboards. The worst example is the item radial menu. You can only actually select 4 of the 8 quick presets and selecting them moves your character at the same time since WASD (individually not pressed together because that does nothing) seem to be the only way to operate it. The real slap in the face though is that the quick wheel still shows a ""right stick"" prompt in the middle of it. You would think someone would have noticed and fixed that at some point... I thought it might be a problem with how the controls were set up so I opened the control options only to find that half of the options were never changed and still reference controller buttons that I don't have (seriously ""swap left trigger/right trigger"" is still a selectable option. I don't even have a controller plugged in!). There's just a ""keyboard options"" selector at the bottom that takes me to a keybind control. Last problem and this one is a minor one that I'm sure I could get used to the menus feel really clunky. I can't really describe it but it's obvious that mouse support was pasted on fairly minimally.This isn't necessarily a huge problem since I'm guessing most people will play this with a controller anyway and I'm probably overreacting since the game is playable but after spending over 6 months trying to ""ensure the best PC experience"" I would expect all aspects of the interface to at least be functional. Sure I emulate an analog stick using my numpad or whatever and make the radial menu work but when you have to use a third party program to emulate parts of a controller you know something is wrong.I'm going to wait a week and see if any of this gets fixed. I hope I can revise this review at a later time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Ecellent. Despite fears that Denuvo would cause issues with older processors it seems Capcom got everything sorted out before release. Game runs 60hz on max graphics (i5 3570k GTX1080) with zero stutter and leaves plenty processing power overhead to not hinder streaming to my steam link. Graphics look great. Controller works with no adjustments however the on screen prompts display ABXY even though im using a DS4 a minor inconvenience Gameplay is a huge improvement over previous MH games. Plenty of QoL improvements and the player movement is very fluid compared to previous titles while still maintaining the classic MH feel.

Yes it's got Denuvo but meh what can you do.As for the game... it's Monster Hunter. You either get it or you don't. I have to laugh at the one review coming from a Souls background who basically gave up after 2 hours. You either invest your time and reap the rewards of this great game or you just fall at the first hurdle and that's your loss.As an aside this game does go to at the endgame and they will ruin it for solo players once the multiplayer focused DLC comes out.

2018-08-09,0,0,33,False,Recommended,"I'm kinda new to MH. Played a couple handheld titles heard this one would be more accessible since those ones tend to assume you know a lot of the games' mechanics already and mostly gloss over anything not new or unique to the exact title you're playing.Apparently the devs over there were either insulted by the idea of new players joining into their fanbase with this title or just think non Japanese people have severe mental handicaps. This game doesn't so much hold your hand through the first chunks I've gone through so much as string you up like a mannequin hands you a giant glowing swarm of ""go here don't be distracted by exploration or curiosity"" and makes sure someone has installed some kind of listening device in your ear so your in game companions Annoying Girl and Huge Guy can talk over information you need with information you figured out five minutes ago via experimentation. The fact that I had to go into the settings and disable tutorials just so I could see my screen mid combat without some kind of popup dialogue and have the peace and quiet to learn something for myself is indicative of a complete lack of faith in my ability to perform basic cognitive functions by the developers.Once you can get around or away from all that change your visual settings to make sure the game stops molesting your GPU for wanting to play it and avoid anything even vaguely resembling guidance long enough to see the game is mechanically rather simple it's a good game.

2018-08-12,0,0,326,False,Recommended,Overall a very fun game but the online is unstable (though this is likely just release week issues).The way cutscenes interact with the co op is a really strange design decision (I'm guessing this has to be down to some form of technical debt as otherwise this would probably have been fixed on the console releases by now). I've not run into any performance issues (gtx 980ti) outside of the occasional stutter when using the water charge blade on high settings 1080p with volumetric rendering off.

2018-08-11,0,0,96,False,Recommended,For many years I have dreamt of playing Monhunt on PC and finally this release has made it possible. Gonna go through the negative aspects of the game first Multiplayer is by far my biggest complaint. Disconnects happen frequently and not just in sessions but also while on quests. Monhunt isn't just about single player experiences but also the experience of playing with your friends and facing gigantic bosses with some team play involved especially with some new mechanics introduced in World. Its just a shame that even though my friends and I could literally just disappear from the session even with good internet speeds This is just a minor problem but tracking takes a large part in this game as its the basis of the game. You track monsters and hunt them down. There are some missions towards the end of the story mode where you have to search for prints and clues in order to fight 3 small bosses which lead to the final boss later on. The tracking for those 3 small bosses required you to go to the specified area return to base and immediately return to the same area for the prints to spawn back at relatively similar locations. I feel like this is a bit repetitive because the map is small enough so it feels as if you're just turning the same corners every 5 seconds.Positive aspects of the game Always been a huge fan of the design used in Monhunt games and for World its probably not going to change either. The design is great. I love each location that I've visited and I'm pretty sure most people will not find it boring either until you've played the maps over and over again. Theres also a decent amount of variety in gear but weapon trees are on the limited side of things. Gameplay is great! Bosses are easier than the ones in Dark Soul but they also provide a bit of a challenge in order not to feel like a hack and slash. If you've played previous Monhunt games this will feel no different. Grappling and climbing different areas is also okay. Sometimes it might feel a bit slow but overall it opens up new ways to traverse across areas. The different spawn locations are also pretty convenient which allows you to be closer to objectives depending on which missions you take. Sound in this game is above decent. Not the best I preferred the BGMs in Monhunt 2g more but this isn't bad either. The SFX in this game is well made monsters can give you a scare if they start screaming behind you the ambient sound is fantastic makes you feel immersed into the game. Overall good sound.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,30,False,Recommended,I currently have 170hrs on record for the PS4 pro version of MHW.The PC version of MHW is a pretty barebones port of the console game that launched earlier this year. Controls are finnicky and lack the ability to turn off mouse acceleration graphics settings are confusing and don't offer high res textures or more powerful anti alaising and optimisation is poor to the extent that 1080p 144fps feels like a pipe dream even with a 1080ti. (If you're struggling with fps try turning off volumetric fog)But this is still Monster Hunter World an exceptional action RPG with an amazing core gameplay loop engaging co op and a ton of progression to keep you busy up to the 100hr mark and beyond. And despite its flaws the PC version is superior to console with 60fps easily acheivable with a powerful rig a more crisp resolution and faster load times across the board. The problems I've mentioned are annoying but minor and easily fixed in the future If you have a powerful rig I wholeheartedly reccomend the game to new and returning players alike.If your PC isn't so hot or the problems I've listed are deal breakers for you I'd suggest holding off for now and keeping an eye on future updates before you buy.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,125,False,Recommended,So I've got 250 hours clocked on PS4 slim. I'm mostly going to comment on the port. Tl dr runs great on my system your mileage may vary.Specs EVGA NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 FTW 8GBIntel i5 8600k factory clock (3.6GHz)16GB 3000MHz DDR4 RAMCrucial MX100 SSDGame runs perfectly for me. No drops below 60fps. Particularly striking coming from console are the near instant load times. Personally I got everything I wanted from the port. The Denuvo system is pointless as far as I can tell but at least on my system it's not posing a problem. This is a great first outing for the main Monster Hunter team on PC. As for the game it's Monster Hunter at its most accessible and quite possibly the best game in the franchise. As I stated I clocked 250 hours on PS4 and could have gotten hundreds more if not for the PC launch. As far as I'm concerned this is a must buy game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I am a die hard MH Fan I have played like 3000h across the whole franchise and since January of this year I have been counting down the days till PC release. It is just sad to see the whole PC community is treated like trash with this mess of a ""Port"". The connection issues and performance problems are a damn joke and with every Teostra Supernova I am asking myself ""what has CAPCOM done within the 7 months since console release"" I wish I could just drop this game and start over again when the issues are fixed but I just cant... THE GAMEPLAY IS JUST TOO DAMN GOOD!!! So... I'm begging you CAPCOM please safe this game for me and the PC community...

So I edited my review.Big fan of Monster Hunter series i was waiting for this PC version for a long time.Now that I have it I can say that for the most part it lived up to my expectations they added many features that I hoped for. Good variety of monsters to hunt old as much as new ones (some are a dissapointment but hey it's my opinion). The maps are gorgeous and dynamic you can use the field to your advantage. Since the patch the Online mode is a pleasure works fine plenty of hunters to play with. Good feature your lobby can support up to 16 players helps alot if you have more than 3 friends (old games were limited to 4) playing with you.The game is not perfect and I still think 8 months was alot of wait for a mere port.Some issues are still there like the Fullscreen mode taxing on your system (90 99% of CPU/GPU usage and I tried many ""fixes"") or the full keyboard keys support.But still for the amount of fun I can now RECOMMEND it !",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,101,False,Recommended,I've played other Monster Hunter games before and I was looking forward to playing this on PC even if I had to wait. I may not be the best or most expereinced player but I know that MH games can be fun if grindy compelling if tedious and crazy even if set in its complex ways. It is good looks gorgeous and is a good challenge... but unfortunately I wanted to play with others... this matchmaking system is plain horrid but I could deal with it if it WORKED. All I can do to appear online is make a session nobody can join I MIGHT be able to take a SOS to join someone but that quest MIGHT drop me in the middle of a battle with a still scaled monster. I cant make a working SOS request I cant join others reliably you are limited to your session for immediate joint ventures on quests and whatnot until the connection issues are resolved avoid buying it. If youre like me and in to deep guess I'll either push solo or go back to something else for a while. Edit It's fun with friends and quite compelling though it can seem a bit desolate at times and you are often punished QUICKLY if you are under geared or under prepared. It's gorgeous and bombastic and you should try it with friends IF the connection issues are FULLY resolved.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-06,0,0,186,False,Recommended,A fun Monster Hunter experience with plenty of quality of life changes. Monster interactions are super interesting and the fluid nature of the maps really helps. PC load times are also lightning fast compared to the PS4 in addition to the higher framerate capabilities. The only thing really holding it back is the relatively low amount of monsters and maps but PC is on an accelerated content schedule to catch up to PS4. Most launch issues have been fixed but that won't stop tons of people leaving their negative reviews despite most of their issues having been fixed (lobby connectivity frame drops from some effects Deviljho dropping this early). At launch the game might have deserved the mixed reviews but at this point the game is at a really good state to be playing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-06,0,0,71,False,Recommended,Been playing with friends for a while now. Can be difficult at times to group up because of the way they decided to design the multiplayer.

2018-08-29,0,0,61,False,Recommended,I very much enjoyed my experience with this game each weapon feels different and every monster has some unique behaviour you must learn to overcome if you're to be successful. For me this was a quick to learn and master as you go sort of game you'll learn the intricacies with experience. Repeat hunts in the later game to get crafting materials do become tiresome I found but thankfully you don't have too many and I still found myself engrossed in the action. Solo play is entirely feasible but multiplayer is where it shines. Unfortunately this game has been marred by connection issues as many reviews point out. Personally I only had issues on one night close to launch. Since then I have had no such problem with connecting to my friend to hunt together on a private session. Sadly a lot of people will not change their reviews as they'll forget so I would ignore those that cite connection problems as the cause for a negative review.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,122,False,Recommended,"This game is one patch away from Game of the Year material.Let's get the bad out of the way first Right now the Steam reviews are mixed. There are some legitimate frustrations to be sure the servers haven't been terribly stable. The co op for the storyline is a minefield that splits up your team every time there's a cutscene. And it uses some cludgy built in matchmaking with codes instead of Steam. Also Denuvo. There's no 21 9/ultrawide support. The mouse implementation is janky. There are some texture quality issues. Now let's compare it to the console version the PC load times are an order of magnitude faster. A mid range PC will run this at higher resolution and higher framerate than a console. The janky cutscene multiplayer issue? Yeah the consoles have had that since launch too. We just need better party management (i.e. use Steam) and it'll be superior to the console release in every way.Now the good it's basically ""boss fights the video game."" Smashing fire breathing dinosaurs in the face with a hammer is awesome! It's challenging. It's exciting. There's plenty of room for skill. Basically this game is all about grinding and that's okay because the grinding is a ton of fun! And you can do it with your friends!

2018-08-15,0,0,179,False,Recommended,I've been playing Monster Hunter since it was first released on the PS2 and since then I've played every title they have put out. So when it comes to MHW I'm obviously bias towards the game. As far as the gameplay and game itself this game is top notch. There is great satisfaction when it comes to overcoming challenging monster fights and teaming up with your friends to farm different armor sets and weapons. The weight behind weapons and feel of all the weapons is something to get use to but once you learn the weapons it feels great. Monster Hunter is a game that requires you learn from your mistakes and improve your gameplay to overcome the challenges. You will face many monsters that have different move sets and you will learn how to avoid and how to plan your attacks.With that being said there are some very huge issues that the game is currently facing. The changes to the multiplayer lobby make the lobbies feel empty new to MHW is a SOS system that allows hunters to call for aid during missions. Only issue that this completely negates the lobbies. The multiplayer feel suffers from this. Along with that the issues that came along with the PC port the port of this game is mediocre at best. Current issues the port is facing is a Texture bug that regardless of your settings forces your textures on low. A issue with Lightning Weapons that tanks your fps whenever anyone in your party is using them and the biggest issues is the disconnecting. The servers haven't been stable since launch and I know many people have had issues with the server I can say that I'm one of the few people that have had this happen to be rarely but it has occurred.Overall the game is solid the gameplay is great and the challenge and rewarding feeling you get when you play is there. You can play with your friends and joining a friends lobby or game is an easy task. I would recommend this game to anyone that has a group of friends to play with as the disconnect issues are still present. I have faith that Capcom will address this issues quickly since this game has quickly become one of their largest titles if these issues are to much for you I would suggest waiting for a fix.TLDRPros Gameplay is top notch. Lots of QoL additions from previous Monster Hunters. Combat is very rewarding. New monster design is great. Decent customization options if that is your thing.Cons Changes to multiplayer make the lobbies feel empty. Weapon design is lackluster compare to previous titles. Low Res texture bug. Frequent Disconnects from public lobbies. Frame rate issues related to Lightning Weapons.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Graphicswise it is pretty much ok looks a bit sharper than ps4 / xbox versions yet I hope there will be a high rez texture pack. Other than that it's Monster Hunter World. Locked the game at 60 fps (which is already nicer than the console versions) and it runs super smooth and steady.PSA Turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS. ) (and it looks nicer except when it rains if it is turned off it looks not good while raining),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Game is running well in my ROG laptop (i7 7700HQ + 16GB + GTX1070 + 1.25T SSD) I used the highest settings and it mostly worked at 60 FPS under 1080P the only thing I turned off was the volumetric lighting which was told to dramatically decrease your FPS and somehow it makes the whole world look very pale so turning it off can actually increase the color contrast and the graphics look more comfortable and it helps with the FPS.I haven't mannaged to go deep to the story yet just finished the opening scene and here's what I think so far + Beautifully built world large vivid and colorful.+ Character creation provides abundant choices for customization.+ You got to own a cat as companion and you can even customize its fur length thickness and color patterns etc.+ Very well optimized graphic performance not demanding at all and the game looks really gorgeous. Textures aren't really good tho I hope they can provide HD textures someday as an optional patch. Typical mediocre JRPG music. You are not allowed to adjust the height of your character and they somehow decided to make the character's body proportion (including NPCs) really weird like... midget? Everyone seems just so short. Pardon me if this is what it was supposed to be but personally I don't like it at all. Some dialogue audios are missing in the opening scene? No skip for the cutscene and conversations so if I wanna recreate my character and start at base I have to go through a 30 mintues opening chapter.Okay that's what I got so far. Feel free to throw you opinions.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Pros +60+fps is real nice it does have a no limit option as well +Near non existent quest loading times +Good screen loading times+Overall runs better than on console(depending on your PC of course) +Not a terrible M&amp K layout but there are keybindings to make your experience better tailored to you. There is also controller support but have been hearing mixed things if it works or not+Not a terrible PC portCons Why is the mouse trying to emulate a stick? Just a strange and overall bad design decision at least give an option for us to turn it off No option to disable motion blur bloom or small annoying things that could push this from an okay port to a great port Not a great PC portThere are other pros and cons each individual could come up with but these are the huge ones that stuck out to me. Yes it uses Denuvo that doesn't actually stop well seasoned hackers but I feel that has been beat into the ground of whether its actually fine or not. I only recommend this because it is not a bad PC port but I do advise caution if any of the cons disuade you including other things people have put.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Finally the way it was meant to be playedYEA! Looks Amazing and runs quite well Tons of content to be had Controls are a stepup from what the other entries in the series offered on consoles/handheldsMEH! Takes a bit to get going through all the tutorials/begining missions. This easily passes the 2 hour refund window that could give you a true taste of the game if your conerned about that You might need to do some option setting changes to get the feeling where you want it.(Radial menu camera style)as default is pretty bad IMO It will be a grind/repetive but thats nothing new to the series and what the series has always been aboutBLEH! UI can bet quite confusing on how to do certain things at first and throws lots of text info at you in the begining when all you want to do is go out and hunt Weapon practice room doesnt have a live monster to practice against to get a feeling on how the weapons work I could be wrong but did not see this option. So you will have to go out into the field for real world useage Control must be enabled via steam to work but IMO use the kmbm it feels way betterHow it Runs The game runs great for me at 1440p with some setting adjustments that do not really effect graphics quality all that much I maintain 60fps easily with very few drops below 50. Changing shadows to medium AA off(this is a personal pref on it still averaged high 60s) and turning off volumic rendering(biggest framerate saver atm). Everything else stayed at highquick specs i7 7700k 16gb ram 980ti ssdThe Gist Looks amazing plays amazing with kbm after some tweaks and has tons of content to be found.

2018-08-09,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"First off I haven't played a MH game since the Wii and before that it was the original on PS2 way back when it first came out. Anyway I've never played the console version of this so I cannot compare them in that way.System i7 7700k oc to 4.6ghzGTX 108016GB RamInstalled on C SSDIt seems to be a fairly well done port. I'm running at 1440p 144hz with everything maxed and I'm keeping a steady 60fps or more. I may try fiddling with the settings to see what I can do about a few more fps'. Generally I'm finding most things to be pretty low res other than the monsters and some environments. If it pulls in close on most anything outside of a monster you'll think you're looking at an early PS3 game. Your armor logs and trees... most anything that gives a close up shot (in cutscenes especially.) Not that I mind I just thought it'd be a bit more... ""modern "" I guess.Audio and sound design is well done. I'm gonna try my headphones later and see how 7.1 sounds.I'm using K+M which works pretty good. I have a controller but I'd rather not use it so I can't say how well it works. Keybinds are well placed. Everything is very responsive.The first nearly two hours or so are for most intents and purposes tutorials. I felt like it did a great job explaining things. Even as you go along further in the game you get quick little ""pop up"" tutorials that explain things you're doing for the first time. Even when you fight there are little ""move sets"" that show in the top right to remind you.I think my only complaint is there aren't enough wide open areas. Granted I'm only four hours in so there may be later but for now it feels like I'm running around on a Final Fantasy X or later overworld map with realtime combat instead of random and turn based. It's not a huge deal I'm sure there's a lot I haven't seen yet so I'm not gonna judge too much.I never pay full price for a PC game. I bought this because I got it for like 22% off on a GMG preorder sale. The ended up being like $46.70. That's a fair price. I wouldn't have gotten it if I had to pay $60 and I passed on the ""Deluxe Edition"" because it doesn't have anything useful.I guess in the end if you like the MH games you'll very much like this one (provided you have a computer that will run it well.)

2018-08-12,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,Buy but not right now...(Buggy Game Alert) Only writing this to allow players to know that the initial opinion about this game was that it was a beautiful game with huge potential. I have spent my time mainly playing single player (not by choice) since the multiplayer function is truly horrible. You may be able to get away with a few missions with your friends or others but sooner than later you'll run into several network errors. Aside from network issues you'll probably encounter problems such as.. game will not load at a decent timeframe (Black screen when loading in the game.) If you play with a controller and it so happens to disconnect you'll probably have issues with it freezing up your game or just not being able to overall reconnect it untill you reload your game. I don't wanna complain about the controls with keyboard simply because they are just odd to get used to but it's do able. I've tried a ton of suggestions that others have given to try and fix my issues such as updating driver (then completely reinstalling them ) i have tried clicking ALT+Enter to send the game into windowed mode at the begining and then hitting it again to make it full screen.. worked once after that...NOPE. My computer specs i would say arent bad so I'm at a complete loss as to why this is suffering this much after all the time they took to make this PC port better.GTX Turbo 1080tii7 7700K8Gbs of DDR4 RAM (only thing that i feel could hold it back) Aside from the game not being able to run correctly for a large base of people.. The game is actually fun to play it feels like they would create a huge immersion if they could fix these problems but everytime you go to get into the rythm of the gameplay you are reminded by game how you could just get kicked out of a lobby and lose all your rewards after doing a lengthy fight.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

YESRegarding my specs (if you are interested) i am playing with an i7 4770k overclocked to 4.3GHz a GTX 1070 FE 8GB overclocked +120 clock speed and +180 memory clock speed. I have 32GB of dual channel DDR3 RAM overclocked from 1600 MHz to 2000 MHz. I have 2 monitors also the game runs on my primary 2560x1440 75Hz while everything else i do including but not limited to discord youtube google steam and the occasional assist on warframe (side by side with MHW mind you) on my 1920x1080 65Hz (overclocked from 60Hz). Also the game is running on a Samsung 850 Evo 1TB while my os runs on a smaller SSD from a knock off brand. I also have another 5TB of HDD space but thats a seperate thing.Anyway on to the review!Graphics Top Notch i have been playing Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter Freedom on PSP. Every generation of MH games has been beautiful in its own right and World does not stray from that. The water grass clothing monster animations weapons and effects they are all beautiful! Sure they arent the best in the world and i know PC players can be extremely spoiled but its undeniable that they are still amazing.Control Personally being a veteran across multiple platforms my default way to play is with a controller. Honestly the controls fell right in for me almost mimicing the old PSP games with just a few minor changes. Playing with a controller the game feels very responsive and smooth. However i'm not a big fan of the KBM controls. Sure there are people who are new to the title that used KBM and learned to like it but spend some time with a controller and you'll prefer that after a short time.Gameplay Monster hunter through and through. Fast yet slow and methodical. It's a real treat taking down a monster especially now that monsters have much better visual clues about when they are weakening (drooling limping panting sleeping and the heart rate monitor under their icon at the bottom). It's even more fun when you have to grind for special parts that only come from particular sections of a monster that you need to cut off. You might get lucky and take it off or you might not. Depends how good of a hunter you are and how willing the monster is to let you take its precious tail.Performance Great all things considered. Being Capcoms first Monster Hunter title on PC i'm impressed with how well the game runs. Albeit my system is quite powerful but i still expected some poor porting from that. Overall though i can run near max settings only volumetric lighting is off and i turned shadows down a bit too. Other then that im getting over 60FPS. I wish i could keep a stable 75 to reach my monitors refresh rate but that will come in time.Multiplayer This ones a bit odd. First the multiplayer is actually VERY well done. When you can get a group of people and just go ham on some monsters exploring and planning together the game is so much fun! I havnt had this much fun with MH Multiplayer since Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii. And the server idea is really neat servers of 16 hunters but the ability to help anyone with an SOS beacon? Count me in!However the multiplayer stability is total crap at the moment. Disconnects mid session mid hunt sometimes you cant connect ever. However i'm willing to give Capcom and Valve the change to fix that up (its both of their faults in this case) so i'll give them another week or two to work something out. Even if its not perfect if its improved then i'll be happy.OVERALL THOUGHTS What most people dont realize is that nobody expected World to take off like it did with 300k people maxed and 230k people average atm. Also this is Capcoms first attempt at MH on PC. Anyone who has played Monster Hunter should have expected this while anyone who hasnt well i cant blame you for being disappointed. I'm sorry that this has to be your first impression of the game. But trust me and all of us MH players Capcom will deliver. You just have to give them time.The game itself is amazing beautiful and a GREAT time especially if you get to play with friends. I know i will be dumping a lot of time into this game and that makes me happy overall. Once the multiplayer is fixed i probably will quit my job just for MH (not really but i wish i could). But i highly recommend to anyone on the fence pick this game up! Multiplayer will be a bit of time before its working right but once it is you're in for a treat!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,235,False,Recommended,I have been playing the game series since monster hunter freedom on the PSP and I loved it ever since. Even tho i have the game on xbox one and i have been playing it alot on there and I have been enjoying it on PC too the fresh start is something that does not faze me at all. The controls are so different and fun to learn while I have only used one type of weapon so far I can not wait to try out the other weapons and see if the PC gets me back to my favourite weapon the sword and sheild. This game for me and my friends of the series love it and higher recommend that if you like game style of monster hunter or have played other like it before you should get the game. you will not look back.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Believe all the bad stuff you hear about Monster Hunter on PC. The online is sporadic and worse it's nearly impossible to maintain a decent and stable framerate even on a contemporary rig.Which isn't great in a game full of giant monsters who will combo the hell out of you if you aren't quick and precise when you fight 'em! The Rathalos will be eating well thanks to all those framedrops.But goddamn me I still love being a Monster Hunter. It makes me feel like David Attenborough except I'm not trying to describe animals and teach people so much as I'm trying to murder them so I can make a fancy coat and a rockin' steak for myself.I haven't enjoyed a game world this much since Dragons Dogma and while Monster Hunter isn't as good of a game it's still loaded with charm and things that make me smile. Like cats paddling around on rubber dingies. Or potbelly pigs who ruthlessly headbutt me when I try to pet 'em.There's so much wrong with this port and I wish I had gotten it on console instead but even under these wretched circumstances I'm afraid I still find the game impossible to hate.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,156,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game. The different zones each have their own charme and are carefully crafted in every corner. The Monsters seem to have their own personality each with their own attack patterns and territorial behaviors. There is also a large variety of peaceful animals which fill the world with life.Since I played a little bit of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite before I kind of knew what to expect. Monster Hunter World exceeded my expectations because it is a lot more polished and convenient to play than Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.Still Monster Hunter World is a very complex game with a lot of different mechanics. So there are a lot of written tutorials which can get a little overwhelming sometimes. But I personally really enjoyed learning bit by bit about all of the aspects of Monster Hunter World.I have had some connectivity issues when playing with friends but it wasn't much of a bother. If you have some friends to play with and the computer to support this hardware hungry game and and a gamepad it is the best game of 2018 in my opinion.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,226,False,Not Recommended,If you want to buy and play this game prepare to play alone first. Poor server probably caused by Denuvo?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Awkward controls at first especially for devoted PC gamers. The game may be better with a controller however after a couple hours of gameplay you shoud have it down. Whilst the story may be a bit short averaging around 6 hours or so it its a game thats worth buying if you wanna get carried away doing sidemissions and upgrading armour. Its a fun game based around loot and the good ol hack n slash. A variety of sidequests to do but it does leave you wanting a bit more. On the con side of things with the amount of time put into development and the large gap between console release and PC release it was expected that this game was better optimized for performance. I ran a GTX1070FE with a Ryzen2600x processor averaging at 45 50 frames per second on the highest settings where as it would drop down to 30FPS in some areas. Optimal 60FPS on 1080p screen had to be run on Mid High settings. There was also a bunch of networking issues that needed to be addressed. Consistent dropouts and inability to choose servers etc. Theres a whole bunch of things that could be improved upon. Regardless of these minor downsides the game was relatively fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,72,False,Recommended,Not a Review simply some notes that I took while playing the PC version that I feel could improve the player experience.1) Connection Issues These must be resolved as soon as possible. The entire player experience is based off of playing with the community and with friends. Playing solo or being disconnected while playing with other MHW players ruins the experience.2) Optimization The game does look incredible BUT the way the game runs is also priority. Try to find ways to smooth out the game on as many systems as possible. 3) Graphic &amp UI Settings Graphic Settings are lacking some options that would improve FPS for lower end systems or people who prefer FPS over GFX. Motion Blur should definitely be an option. Particle Effects should either be able to render at lower quality or turned off entirely. FOV and UI Scaling would be a nice option to add to the game (I prefer the UI smaller than usual).4) SKIPPABLE CUTSCENES You get the point. Majority of us are returning from consoles and want to rush through the story.5) Discord Integration Streamers play the HELL out of this game. Majority of streamers and players use Discord to communicate with friends. Discord Integration would allow players to join lobby's directly from the Server or DMs. Just some input after playing the PC version and coming from the PS4 version. This is a great game but it will be much better once some networking bugs have been addressed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,206,False,Recommended,Waited for the superior PC version of this game to released and I'm glad that I did. Plays fantastically on my machine.Graphics are the best in the series and its great to see Monster Hunter back on consoles. I used to play this on PSP (Monster Hunter Freedom 1/2) and 3DS (Monster Hunter 3U/4U) and find the Guildhall (Gathering Hub/Matchingmaking) to be fantastic additions to Monster Hunter that were missed from the original Monster Hunter on PS2. No friend codes and added matchmaking makes finding friends a breeze.Those who are longtime fans and players of Monster Hunter like myself will find getting back into your groove/playstyle to be easy and a refreshing experience. Newer players will find difficulty adjusting as is the course for Monster Hunter games but Monster Hunter has never been for casual gaming and is demanding of the player to be on point at all times and to know what you are doing when fighting monsters.Great game and most modern in the series. QOL improvements help speed up gameplay and keep hunting on your toes from the beginning of battle to the end. I would recommend this game to all of my friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,164,False,Recommended,I don't know why people are giving a thumbs down it's basically the exact same game as the PS4 version. It is a GREAT game that is very difficult to learn with gorgeous visuals compared to the other Monster Hunter games. Controls will take some time getting used to.

2018-08-12,0,0,313,False,Recommended,Game is great I like it been playing MH games since the first one on ps2 only have missed the Wii ones and I can say this is on the top 3 favorites. Right now the servers are a bit unstable idk if it's on steam or Capcom side but the game is good you'll have lots of fun playing it either solo or multiplayer when it let's you. If you are having frame rate issues check the requirements and check if you have same or better but no one I know so far is having frame rate issues or crashes,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,139,False,Recommended,A lot of mixed reviews here but I wanted to write my experience about the game.This is my first Monster Hunter game and honestly it has been a blast. I ve heard Monster Hunter can be a grind but MHW does such a great job with unpredictable monster fights and smart game mechanics you won t care if you have to fight that monster 100 000 more times. 40 hours into the game and I m still discovering and being amazed. I ve been playing with 3 other friends and I haven t experienced any network issues. I was very confused at the start of the game when I was trying to play with friends. Although I soon realized i had to complete a few missions first to get the multi player option. You still have to watch the cut scene first before trying to play with others which can be annoying but it always worked without a hitch. Performance wise It s a very demanding game. My rig is basically stuck in 2012 with a FX 6100 (OC 4.0GHZ) 8GB DDR3 GTX 770 MSI Lightning. I run everything low and get 50 40 FPS. Some maps and depending on the monsters 30 15 FPS. Horrible but honestly I m having so much fun beating the out of monsters I don t mind. Hopefully in the future they will optimize the game but the port is decent.I really think the developers tried their best here. It s a addictive and fun. Hopefully they will continue to improve this awesome game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,121,False,Recommended,Big fan of the entire series since ps2. The game looks beautiful and is what I have been waiting for in a monster hunter game for 14 years since the original release. So many quality of life changes added to make the game more appealing and easier to get into while keeping a lot of challenging elements that have stuck around since the release. The coop experience is weird and unintuitive for the story missions forcing you to watch a cut scene and exit the mission before you can play with friends if they are on the same mission. I don't excuse that issue but I understand that perhaps it was made this way since after you watch the cinematic you can SOS flare people into the game world. Still this makes the whole experience awkward for playing it with someone over online. There are a myriad of graphics options for you to choose from and the game is well optimized enough that the framerate stays for me in the 40's 60's even on an older intel 3570k paired with a gtx 1060 even if the textures can be rather low it is expected to get a higher res texture pack sometime in the future. Perhaps the connection issues will be addressed in the upcoming patches since I hear a lot of people having a problem connecting to other player's sessions. Thank you for reading my opinion and have a nice day!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,41,False,Recommended,If you like killing things and wearing their skin this game is for you.Mobsters are cool.Keyboard controls need some work. They just mapped gamepad controls to keybinds which don't always make sense.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,227,False,Recommended,I'm coming to this after finishing the original PS4 Pro version of MonHun up to all monsters including High Rank. And initially it didn't look great despite having superior hardware in my laptop to the PS4 Pro I wasn't seeing better performance aside from loading times. There was also network connection problems that prevented nearly all online play. However all those can be fixed if you look around the discussions and reddit. Does it excuse the game's poor opening? Perhaps not but I won't let something that petty stop me from enjoying this great game. Besides that's like an hour or two spent doing fixes to my problems to the hundreds of hours I'll spend playing this masterpiece. If you look to any PS4 or Xbox 1 review its pretty much the same as before except with better weapon balance due to all the updates and probably better performance depending on your PC's relative strength to the consoles. Monster Hunter is a game where you do exactly that. There's a large amount of weapons you can bring to the fight and each requires different playstyles and approaches to use their abilities to their maximum potential. Armor both protects you when you screw up (Generally the aim is NOT to get hit at all) and provides statistical bonuses to your abilities like better attack less stamina usage or increased invincibility frames in dodges. Its a joy to configure your armor sets to minmax your way to victory or just because there's a look you wanna go for. Rounding it all up are items and tools you can prepare beforehand and even during a hunt as you pick up items (bugs shells rocks etc) on site to augment your arsenal. All in all it makes for a game thats easy to master but rewards the patient player that meticulously prepares for the hunt. The hunt itself is also quite fun but be aware that this isn't a mindless hack n' slash. Aside from monsters usually needing only 2 5 hits to kill you (and 2 3 successive hits to knock you out for an easy killing blow) weapons have a momentum and weight that may shock newcomers. That great sword feels as heavy as it looks and smaller weapons are similarly weighty you will commit to each attack and most take more time before you can cancel out of it with a dodge or end before the monsters has already hit/killed you. This was the intention it isn't like a spectacle fighter like Bayonetta Devil May Cry nore is it like more realistic ARPGs like the Witcher or Skyrim. Aside from the lightest of melee weapons most weapons will slow you down so much that players do need to predict several seconds in advance because of how each attack will lock them in to that attack animation for so long. It makes for very thoughtful gameplay you cannot blindly button mash or have any ease of dodging here like in Warframe God of War or Dark Souls.Graphically the game is amazing if you've got the PC hardware for it. Again this will take tweaks but its not anything a good PC player shouldn't be aware of. There are graphics options like FOV that are missing but well thats that. Volumetric fog is also buggy as of this writing and eats up massive GPU resources but it can be kept at 'low' and still have 60FPS with all else maxed with something at the level of a NVIDIA GTX 1060 6Gb. Denuvo also keeps CPU requirements high but thats a thing nowadays.Network problems are rampant! But with a few fixes (literally you can find it just by googling it) nothing else should bother you. Look up your error code and there's a plethora of options and helpers to fix what ails you. Overall the game's current state requires some player work to get the game running at 100%. But thats actually something I consider fitting to the franchise. MonHun has always been a really hard game to get into because of how different its mechanics run the closest analogue is the Dark Souls series but even that has an easier learning curve than Monster Hunter. The player has to earn their fun and unfortunately for the PC port that extends to the installation of the game. But if you get past that if you show enough competence and will to fix these issues a whole new world of gaming awaits.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Youll probably buy it if you were already interested.As a straight port it work wonderfully and the pc controls are as intuitive as the could have made them considering.ATM there are weird server issues but it never super impacted my experience (I mean its one of the fastest selling games on steam in japan so network issues are kinda expected) Despite the awkward way to do coop the game works just as it did on the console.

I was getting 45fps beforeThe pros It has a good crafting and upgrade system for weapons and armor. As far as graphics go the environment looks nice but requires a pretty good build to run at high settings with decent fps. The fights are really fun but could be more challenging in my opinion You have the option to do hunts with up to 3 other people online. You start off with every weapon type so it suits any play style. Abililty to upgrade armor and weaponsThe cons The game starts off really slow but give it a chance and you will like it if you enjoy adventure games. Not a big deal but on some enemies you can walk through certain parts of the models. If you are using M&amp K it feels a little weird at first and the camera feels off in some fights. Atleast for me It feels like I wont want to play anymore after I beat the story. Unless updates are frequentOverall I highly recommend this game and I am having a lot of fun playing it.If you played on console I wouldnt pay $60 again the port could still use some work.

2018-08-12,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Latest and the most accessible (easiest) Monster Hunter game now officially available for PC. It's awesome and regardless of the mentally challenged reviews the game's great plays well and runs well. Even though there are some minor technical setbacks like making your cpu really really hot and lacking support for artibtrary resolutions.Game is Capcom's MH team's first PC port and they wanted to delay the release because of this. Giving bad reviews etc just because the game doesn't run in 21 9 is something what I don't understand.Great game and offers tons of hours of content even though it lacks G rank. Read guides and learn how to play before going online. Finish the single player portion before going online this way you will benefit the community and don't be a burden to other players. Some small advice already here Team should be tactically spreading around the monster not just blindly slashing the same spot and trip other players at the same time. Hammer users should ONLY attack head while weapons with longest reach should try to cut the tail. Lance users should be poking hard to reach weak spotst. Hunting horn is a support weapon and should be constantly dish out buffs for the team (even though this is a high rank game and as such it lacks difficult monsters so in this sense buffs are not even needed... but this is the original purpose of hunting horn anyway).There are tons of guides for the game and I wonder why it is so hard for people to read/watch them? Don't go online until you know the basics of the game and you are confident with your chosen weapon. Game's easiest one in the series and yet people are complaining about the difficulty but I guess this tells us a story about the instant gratification culture and the lack of attention span most people these days have. It takes around about 25 hours (not scientifically proven) to learn how to play the game properly and at that point you will also realize how easy the game actually is.The online was perfectly executed in Monster Hunter 3u and even in 4u but this time Capcom has completely messed up everything. It is impossible to chat with other people and playing with friends is difficult. Most reliable way to grind monsters you need is to answer other people's SOS requests instead of joining other hubs and communicating with other peple. The always online b.s. also needs to end as well. It is impossible to pause the game even when playing 'offline'.Do yourself a favor and get a proper controller. Altough keyboard + mouse controls work well game's been designed to be played with controller.Capcom will surely patch the game in the future as the PC version has already sold millions of copies. Get it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,43,False,Recommended,I've wanted to get into the Monster Hunter franchise for a very long time. Until this point they had come onto game devices that I didn't have or that I didn't play. When I heard that it would be coming to PC I was ecstatic! This game is so much fun I can play for hours with friends or by myself and I feel like there is always something to do. The customization is creative and I can spend just as much time designing a character as I can hunting for monsters. I've been playing with keyboard and haven't had any problems. Movements are smooth hot keys are easy to assign. Everyone should try this game and not be turned away by the low reviews.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,Ok so i really have to change my review to thumbs down. I try'd to defend it against the hordes of bad reviews over technical issues but now even I can't get past them anymore.First of all the disconnect issues are terrible! At the moment its quite hard to play a game online and most of the time you cant find other players or it disconnects while in a quest. Another major issue for me right now is is that i'm a mouse and keyboard guy and this game got some serious mouse input lag. I got an xbox controller but when i'm on the PC i just hate playing with the controller. I'm so used to alt tabbing chatting up with mates or googling up some info etc. Putting my controller down everytime picking up my mouse etc.. NO! I don't play on the PC for this. When i'm gaming on my PC I want to play like i've always been playing since 1990 and thats with KB+M... the XBOX controller. If I want to play with a controller i will sit on a comfortable couch with a ps4! Nobody sits behind a desk on a desk chair to play with a ing controller nobody! In fact I don't get any of these developers?Since when was there anyone who said hey I really love me some mouse lag and input smoothing??? Never! Why do developers keep putting thjese in?? And while i'm on the subject of developers putting useless in their games. What about motion blur? Why the hell is that in every single game since 2001 turned on by default? Every single PC gamer on this planet will turn that off first thing. No one has ever liked motion blur! Why is it coming back every single game? Do you developers even play your own games? Its For any developers reading this for all your future gamesRAW mouse input only (no smoothing and No motion blur options just delete it. No one cares!Really this alone will make your game 2 times better right off the bat! So as of now i'm going to stop playing. I just can't get over these 2 points. I don't want to play solo offline and I don't want to play with a controller. MHW dev's fix this! and i'll give this game a thumbs up. But for now this game is its absolutely,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,80,False,Recommended,I love this game! I genuinely thought I would not be that interested when I got it but my boyfriend really wanted me to play. I am glad he convinced me to because this is my top game at the moment. It is a ton of fun and allows you to run around and explore by yourself or take down a beast in a team. I seriously recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Owerall this game is rly good and there is content to worth of the price. There still is very big bugs and some of them makes game rly frustraiting.Pros Nice compat and not any fps drops.Various playstyles you can choose from.Story is ok and maybe even good.Good responce time for controller.Cons Mouse is absolutely terrible in this game. Its same that you would use the stick from controller wich means no velocity and rly slow.Annoying bugs with sounds Sliding sounds sometimes stays on until you leave quest (fast travel doesn't help)Diablos burrowing sound stacks all the time making sound rly loud and annoying. (i know part of it is suppose to be but still)Absolute horrible Online playing servers crash (hope fix for soon) but the hole idea is rly bad. You cant go on any quest with friends if there is cutscene unless they go look for it. then return back. Being in same session doesnt let you see your friend unless you are both in Gathering hub.Thats all. But if you rly like this types of games and the price is affordable. Go for it and enjoy the hunt.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I've played every single Monster Hunter game and now they force cutscenes with their awesome plot? This game is about hunting monsters not some revolutionary storyline. These cutscenes are a slap in the face to all veterans. Please let me skip every cutscene and every tutorial like thing please?Also seeing the handler hearing her voice or seeing one of her useless popups during a quest makes me want to kill myself.This game is awesome once you get past the story so you can stop watching those cutscenes.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,89,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World is the wind of change. At last MH is getting the attention of Westerners...It was about time because Monster Hunter is an amazing franchise!That's why I will cut my review in two.For newcomers If you haven't played Monster Hunter before you have to know that his game is all about studying tracking and fighting/ capturing massive creatures. With the help of 15 different weapons with their own play style and practicing method. You will experience the feat realized by Capcom. This subtle sensation of achievement not only when you beat a monster without taking too much hits but also when you land all your attacks properly with your weapon. After a while you will feel like a true weapon master especially when you had farmed for few hours this bad armor set or this weapon you've dreamed of. I almost forgot your Palico a cute courageous cat who fights alongside you. A funny addition that has been following fans since Monster hunter 4 (a great game on Nintendo DS btw). You can also call other players or friends to join you in your missions. Playing with 4 other hunters ( 1 with a hunting horn is great!) is where the game shines even if you can progress in solo for a tier of the game the rest must be played with others. You won't find all the good stuff without the multiplayer experience. If you are looking for a pleasant intelligent and gorgeous action game then MHW is a must buy for you.Be warned this game can be hard you must learn the ropes before advancing (like for capturing and damage resistances). But MH World is a fair game as all MH before.For veterans of the franchise MH WORLD IS HERE ! Like you it was the ""Grail"" I was waiting for. I know a bit of MH I started last year on MH3 with 50 hours MH4 with 500h and MH Gen with 140 h. I felt really pleased especially considering the side taken during the main quest line where you must understand what makes this new continent ""World"" so important to monsters and where Wyverians Humans and Palicos will sit in the food chain. Making fighting capturing and tracking much more lore related. As a hunter you are not only a killer you are here to balance an ecosystem where your place is at stake. I wish they dig into this aspect in the next Monster Hunters where monsters might be assets instead of permanent targets to kill.However even if me too I confess that MH World is a bit more ""casual"" about the game play no more talismans and gems crafting. Most of the new improvements justify its purchase GRAPHICS Just amazing Monster Hunter is one of the most beautiful game I've ever played. At last you feel like inside an ecosystem with hundreds of details. Weather wind grass trees insects birds fishes... there so many things to look at I was just absorbed with the scenery in almost every hunts I've done so farm. Even hitting monsters feels much more satisfying and impressive. Also maps are huge and full of different species scoutflies disturbs at first but seriously they are necessary and looks amazing. Also NPC are now following you during some quests making cut scenes and some missions way more enjoyable. The design of the Hub is extraordinary with this pirate looking town built with ships tied to a cliff. MH World is the most beautiful game in the franchise if not the most beautiful in the genre. GAME PLAY Old timers will rant in front of the scoutflies and the gathering system. But tracking a monster now is way more realistic and funny than before. The scoutflies serves as ""bloodhounds"" who collects stuff around and spot footprints and other leftovers from monsters for tracking purpose. So in general when you look for a monster in particular you have to collect ""information"" and then you will be able to find them faster. This aspect of the game is brilliant and serves as a counter measure of the skill Psychic and Expeditions. The more info your collect the better the quests you will get. Making monster hunting an interesting apprenticeship meanwhile you discover the 3 massive maps available. Also being able to collect on the run or keeping the key pushed to keep gathering (same as MH Gen) is still pleasant.Weapons are great and MH World will be the renewal of the Gunlance Hunting Horn and Ranged Weapons. What they did is truly smart and gives a lot of flavor to some weapons I'm sure many of us never used before (except Hunting Horn in my case). Just admiring a Gunlancer shelling and nailing explosive blades a Hornblower chaining encores in the middle of a fight or a Gunner delivering a massive payload is a joy. Weapons packs quite a punch now especially coupled with the new effects on hits. Scales liquids fur and feathers with explosions and damage values... you feel like a bad !No hunting arts from Mh Gen here but honestly it's alright.Now you can eat cooked food and launch missions during quests without leaving the area. Gathering locations are marked and saved for your later hunts. You can fast travel between camps you have previously unlocked. Armors serves for both ranged and close combat. Crafting is easier because you can read a compendium with all the info you need to know about monsters item drops and locations. You can upgrade weapons just like in MH Gen and even degrade them to recover some components. New skills are available and related most of the time to many new movements as an example you can get a buff of + 30 % affinity when sliding making acrobatics much more interesting !It's quite the top of the iceberg in MH World because you have so much interactions with your environment you always find new tricks to gain the upper hand. You can use a grappling hook to move faster and also serves as crossbow to replace the old ""Flash Poison Smoke"" Bomb system. Destroy some walls rocks and other trees/ vines to create big traps or decoys. This related to the new ecosystem game play where monsters can attack each others is really fun.Godzilla looking fights with explosions in a ""Michael Bay"" style you can do it !The Palico is way more helpful than before and even if you can only bring one with you you can still find another one while exploring the maps. They stay only during the mission but it's still a nice addition. Also Palicos knows how to play safe ! Skills have been replaced by utility items. Less deep but more efficient.For monsters. The first ""big"" monster of the game the Great Jagras is a mix between a Great Jaggi and a Zamtrios. Or the Tobi Kadachi a mix between aDalamadur Zinogre and a Kecha Wacha. Weird at first I have to say that they have mixed quite a lot of old monsters to make new ones and it's actually funny to see new game play mechanics coupled with how amazing monsters look like now. The progression feels a bit slower because I'm not used to new game mechanics and armor resistances are much more important now. Getting 1 shot by the fourth monster of the game when playing solo... quite new for me. Some old big boys such as the Rathian or Teostra are back but only the half of the 34 monsters of the game are new. There's even a season related even that players on PS4 enjoyed with a unique Monster that spawns. And this might my upgraded in the future.TO CONCLUDE It would take hours to speak about all the things I like in MH World. Less brutal but more clever. More beautiful and opened than ever. Don't get fooled by mixed overall rating graphics will be fixed. CAPCOM have been making great sequels for years. This one is like Resident Evil 4 back in the days. An evolution and an entry for a new audience. And if you miss good challenge just keep playing multiplayer missions like in MH Gen there's something for everyone in this game.And seriously it's the first Monster Hunter where all weapons are fine.A must buy !N.B I won't down vote this game for graphics issues. It worked well for me. They will fix this anyway. Btw only 1 disconnection in 6 hours.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,6,False,Recommended,I highly reccomend this game. I noticed a lot of the reviews on this game have been negative. Due to technical issues with the port. One of the chief complaints has been on gamepad support. I use an Xbox One gamepad for my PC gaming needs. It is fully mapped for this game. This game supports it full on. No need to do any keybindings with it. I'm not sure what hardware the other reviewers are using so I can only speak from my experience. I don't have motion blur when I play this game and a lot of the technical issues I'm just not seeing or don't have a problem with. Maybe I'm fortunate.Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Music 10/10Gameplay 9/10 Controls 8/10This is a game I jumped into it and then suddenly 3 hours have gone. I made the mistake of doing an arena quest as a newbie. But I am glad I did. It got me use to my weapon of choice and play style. It also forced me to actually think about how I was going to defeat it. Apparently you're not suppose to really solo in arena quests but I was never able to go into online mode and connect with other players. I think this is where the game has its main issue on the PC port. Connection is constantly lost. And it isn't on my end as I'm still able to chat with people on my Steam's friends list. I think once they fix their server issues this game will pretty much be solid. I did end up winning in the arena quest but only after I adopted a mindset that I'm the hunter and that monster is my prey. Once I started thinking this way. It made setting traps and exploiting the mob's movements a lot easier. It took time but I took it down got a huge bonus for beating an arena quest. I mean I did it after I did the very very first quest. Not recommended unless you learn well through trial by fire. Overall the game gets a 8/10 For me the server connection was an issue that could break this game because there are some benefits with teaming up with people online. This seems to be a game that favors co op mode.There are negative reviews most of them are technical. If you run into any issues like it. I highly encourage you to go ahead and close the client by any means necessary and get your full refund. That's my go to when I can't get a game to work. I also don't bother reviewing at that point. It is usually because of hardware issues on my end and compatibility. FOr instance in other games they don't play well with Nvidia sooo I learned to just leave it alone get the refund and move on with life. It is disappointing but if you can make changes to your machine go for it. If you don't want to be bothered with that. I don't blame you. I think overall this has to be the response from the community when a PC port isn't universally friendly to PC gamers. Keep on going everyone and good hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'd like to play with my friends but it seems like our lobby dies after about 15 minutes. MW1 errors this and failed to join the quest that. Being kicked from lobbies is more of a norm than getting into them. What's more insulting is you'll wait upwards a minute to get a failure with no option of canceling the matchmaking. In addition to this you can't join a private match via invite and several times I've typed in the ID for the match and was told it didn't exist.

Otherwise I've only had 3 communication errors and most of the time it was towards the end of a hunt anyways so it was finishable for all parties involved. The FPS is pretty good and I see a lot of hardware complaints but I've had very little issues after disabling volumetric rendering. Its a monster hunter game and you'll see a lot of complaints from people who've never played one this one is honestly one of the easiest ones within the franchise and is considerably less grindy than previous renditions. The combat is slow and clunky depending on what weapons you're choosing and can honestly feel confusing at times if you aren't well versed in how the game plays.Do your homework and watch some guides before you pick this game up if its your first MH game.

2018-08-16,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"The game by all standards looks to be quite well made runs well and is probably great... unfortunately I can't play it. The game is virtually unplayable if you have vision problems particularly color blindness of any kind. Both the environment and UI is more often than not green brown on top of green brown on top of green brown. And there doesn't appear to be any options to alter the behavior of the scout flies or the color they show up in your only means of pointing to what you have to find.This isn't the only issue the game has several other not ""bad"" but ""clunky"" elements. A perfect example being cutscenes they cannot be skipped and it is actually impossible to join a friend for co op until after you've seen the cutscene for a mission. This is a very weird choice in my mind as it actively hinders one of the most fun elements of the game.Voice acting versus dialogue text is also very strange... in that some lines are fully voice acted and others are not. Indeed sometimes a line will trigger a VO line but what is said doesn't match what's actually written in the subtitles.Once you get past the ""clunky"" elements the game looks incredible and is probably quite fun but I'll never know. I got stuck on the very first mission and allow me to relate that in full I was told to hunt down and kill 7 of a given type of creature simple enough I followed the trail I was given to an open field where in the game wanted me to interact with a bush but that wasn't immediately evident so I putsed around the field for a while before figuring that out After that I finally found a few of the monsters I was supposed to kill got 3 of them where upon the others scarpered I was then given these two completely contradictory instructions ""Hurry! Don't let them get away!"" and ""Make sure to pick up all the monster materials! You can use them at the Smithy."" I then wandered for quite some time searching for the rest of the creatures but to no avail I decided I ought to call it a night and try again later possibly... where upon I found that the game had actually disabled the option to quit.

2018-08-16,0,0,78,False,Recommended,"Does the game has it's problems right now?Yes undeniably.Does this take away from the core gameplay of the game?Not for me it doesn't. And it shouldn't for you.I won't call myself a ""Monster Hunter Veteran"" as some people would.I once tried MH Tri on the Wii and didn't quite get it. It was slow and tiresome and felt more like a menu simulator.Then I was able to pick a free game from a store and the only one in the selection that spoke to me was MH4U for the 3DS. Since it was free I didn't play it immediatelly but once I got into it I started to understand. And let me explain the formula.First thing you've got to accept when starting a Monster Hunter game is... You absolutely suck at it. You'll want to blame the seemingly slow and arduous attack animations or the unresponsiveness of control inputs during these animations. You'll want to put it down after just 1 or 2 hunts saying the controls are just bad. But if you stick with it you'll discover that what at first was a slow animation is actually a deliberate pattern and that the unresponsiveness that follows can be mitigated with dodges and rolls to reposition. The game definitely doesn't explain this to you in any way. There's only 2 ways to find these out. You either go through a long process of trial and error to find these for every single weapon type or you can watch some youtube tutorials (might I recommend ""Gaijin Hunter"" and ""ArekzGaming"" for these they helped me a ton). Neither way is the wrong way but the tutorial videos will definitely reveal some nuances for certain weapons you'd never have found otherwise.Now that you got the basics a bit down the hunts seem to get easier and you take down a few of the mosnters you thought were impossible before. You move up a rank and get a new area with new monsters. Each and every one as interesting as the last! But more importantly As challenging as the last. Each monster has their own patterns behaviour and attacks to learn and play into. And each time you defeat one you gain the experience. And I'm not talking about a bar on your screen that will occasionally fill up and yell ""Level UP!"". What you'll feel is a true ""Sense of Pride and Accomplishment"". You the player will actually gain this experience.This is by far one of the most rewarding feelings I have ever gotten out of any game. This alone should be enough basis to reccomend this game on. (Or any monster hunter game for that matter).But Monster Hunter World has definitely made some improvements over the earlier games. So much so that it is by far the most accesible to new players while staying as challenging to even the veterans. The whole process has been streamlined by better menu navigation and management. Better ways to farm certain materials and rewards. Interesting new ""Siege"" style quests. And the new updated graphics after being stuck on handhelds for a good few generations.But as said before it is now without some problems. Some bigger than other.The ones you've come across in many other reviews. Poor Optimization especially on older systems Lackluster Keyboard and Mouse controls Many network and connection problems plagueing everyone Denuvo negatively impacting performance or even keeping the game from launcing on certain systems.These are all undeniably true. The game certainly needs some more to work to be ""Playable"" to some players.I will not drone on about these problems there are many other reviews that deal with this.To me personally these aren't great enough to deter me from playing or even reccomending this game.I've played a good couple hundred hours of MHW on the PS4 since launch. And even then I bought this game again on PC.Mainly because I refuse to pay an online subscription on consoles.The optimization is bad yes. But I have no doubt they'll get better with time. If your system is too weak to play it I certainly won't reccomend it. Even with my beefier system I run into some texture and rendering issues.But personally I never felt the need to play Monster Hunter with anything other than a controller. I used the PS4 controller on PS4 and am using the Steam Controller on PC. Camera movement could use a little tweaking on it but it is more than playable with any controller.I personally have played monster hunter ""Solo"" a lot. I've done a few hunts on the 3DS with my girlfriend and her brother and that was TONS of fun and wish I could do it more often. I would like to have less connection errors in MHW but I am perfectly content playing it solo. I recommend it to most new players so you don't get ""Carried"" by better players and really learn the finesse of monster hunter. But I won't deny that online play can be lots of fun and wish to participate in it more!All in All the game definitely needs some work. It's hard to recommend to everyone especially considering the full price you pay for it. But it's an experience you don't want to miss out on and one that is certainly amazing enough to get you hooked and will certainly drag you into other Monster Hunter games old and new!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,63,False,Recommended,I have been playing Monster Hunter since it came out on PS2 about 15 years ago. It was the first online game I played. I bought this game the day it came out on the ps4 and played it on a standard ps4 upgraded to a ps4 pro and can still say this is the best version of the game. I also do not have top of the line specs when running and I have seen very minor framerate issues/stutters only a couple times and no longer then a second also never in moments that I was in battle or it would affect the game against me. A lot of people are complaining about the server issues which yes there are a lot of problems with it right now but you can still play single player and if you never played before that is a good time to get used to the gameplay. There were issues when it first came out on consols as well and they were worked out in a few days. This is one of the biggest launches on PC I don't think they were expecting this and that is ok as well knowing that they will fix them.People are upset about the devono DRM that is with the game but I have not had a problem with it or seen any issues that it affects anything. The game is still playabale and enjoyable.If you have never played a Monster Hunter game before this is a perfect entry to start at. A lot of issues from past games have been updated or fixed and there are tons of quality of life gameplay mechanics they added or improved on to make the game a lot more fluid and fun. There is still a lot of difficulty in mastering the game. It is still a very balanced game with power and force behind every single weapon. The monsters come fomr other games or are new to this one and are a perfect blend for vetrans to be familiar and also experiance a whole new game. One of the biggest things I love about Monster Hunter is when you get good at it there is a huge sence of accomplishment and you can feel that you are good at it (if that makes sences to people). It can get to be a bit of a grid once you really get into the game (high rank missions) but I am so used to it it no longer feels like a grind. There are many different weapons that change up how you can tackal each mission and to keep you learning more and more and keep things fresh for you. All and all this is a fantastic game and if anything numbers do not lie. It if wasn't a good game it would not have sold as much as it did becoming the highest selling game Capcom has ever done. If you never played it before this is a perfect entry to anyone wanting to try something new out. If you have played it before it is a perfect mix of new and old that you will be happy with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game itself is huge and has so much content it is gonna take me weeks or even months in order to expierience everything it has to offer.The only thing that Monster Hunter World lacks are well made keyboard controlls and because of that I really recommend using a controller. Despite this little oversight the game is absolutely perfect and it will surprise you with its brilliant mechanics many times through your gameplay.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-08,0,0,197,False,Recommended,I've clocked in 260 hours on the PS4 version and got the PC version because a lot of my friends wanted to get into the series and they only game on PC. The game itself is excellent and I found myself getting addicted all over again. This play through chose to use weapons that I normally don't play and as with any monster hunter game that experience makes the game feel very fresh. Overall the PC version of the game is the best version in terms of performance. There were some early growing pains but those seemed to have mostly been ironed out. PS4 version of the game is the best in terms of communicty because MH is cross region and it is exclusive to the PS4 in Japan. Its a great game to play with friends. I hope they keep ironing out the bugs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,189,False,Recommended,This game is really fun with lots to do and lots to just mess around with. Sure decoration farming is horrible and it makes up a large unnecessarily large portion of endgame but... no there's no good side to that. Customization is nice though could be better. Armors range from dull to slightly less dull. Same applies to a lot of the weapons as well. But as for gameplay wonky hitboxes aside it's so much fun. If you're a fashionista first this game definitely not for you. If you're a grind loving nerd with too much time on your hands welcome to the fifth fleet.Disclaimer This port has HEAVY issues with connectivity and graphics. If at all possible I highly recommend the console version if you have the console over this port.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Avoid until release issues are resolved A disappointing start to what could still be a promising game. There are a number of issues on launch chief of which are crashes to the desktop after the opening splash screen. I fixed these by forcing the game to run in borderless rather than full screen.Once in game textures aren't up to par even at max settings they're noticeably blurred in places even when I'm able to switch back to fullscreen. Motion blur is poorly implemented as is depth of field. There are no options to disable blur or DOF. Optimisation seems to run well on a top end machine but turn off volumetric rendering it significantly reduces frame rate for what appeared to be little noticeable benefit.Ultrawide 21 9 resolution isn't supported. Why? It's standard place in new releases nowadays and it's just lazy to not implement it here. As of a few hours post release community members are producing first drafts of an Ultrawide work around with demos available on YouTube though they're not ready for use yet. Regardless it shouldn't be up to the community to build mods and workarounds for something that the developer should provide as standard. Finally you'll struggle to play this using a mouse and keyboard at the moment. Camera movement in the mouse introduces significant input lag even with VSync disabled. The camera doesn't use raw input it's still using the same modifiers applicable to a controller camera such as a deadzone and negative acceleration. Again there's no way to turn these off.So (unsurprisingly) you should avoid this port in its current state on release day. These are easy fixes Capcom and they all should have been caught and tested before launch.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a third person action game about dominating the food chain and looking good doing it. It's renowned for its endgame grind where you go on ever more complex and challenging hunts across diverse tangled open worlds in search of rare items needed to craft an armor set that ll no doubt crown you the min max champion of the world. But Monster Hunter s essence and greatest strength are its tense desperate and tragic fights with beautiful beasts that can go on for the better part of an hour.It is also about the gleeful colonization 'new' lands and the slaughter of native species. Monster Hunter is a grotesque fantasy but if you can stomach the merciless repeated slaughter of god's beautiful dragon children you'll find an excellent endless action game that tests reflex and intellect in equal measure.It can be frustrating and slow especially after the breezy hunts of the story campaign. And yet every challenge is a natural extension of the combat system. Grinding out the best gear for a tough hunt is a smart often necessary idea but if you know when to swing and when to run you'll be alright. High rank missions read like an artificial way to extend interest in Monster Hunter World but the series has always been preoccupied with grinding for obscure components to make a hat or sword with a difficult hunt in mind. It is Min Maxing The Game. Grindy yes but the grind is good. With so many modern games competing for time as much as money Monster Hunter World avoids feeling like an insatiable black hole by automating the usual busywork. Bounties small collection missions you can often complete during hunts grant you items and upgrade materials. A greenhouse in the hub area allows you to cultivate herbs between missions eliminating the need to collect them at all eventually. The Tailrider Safari is a group of three adventurous palicos you send on missions to retrieve a random assortment of items from specific biomes softening the need to grind out lower level hunts. And every armor set is unique pulling in recognizable elements from the monsters they're made of arranged in eccentric stylish extremely anime designs. They are worth the effort. Like your character Monster Hunter World dresses its breathless combat in every assortment of the most arbitrarily complicated garb all in the name of variety. It is an abyss of 'replayabilty an exercise in patience and observation for the ultimate payoff an infinite black sea of invigorating dragon murder. And a new hat.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you haven't then welcome! This is the latest in a game series over 14 years old and is actually the 5th main installment in the series after Monster Hunter Monster Hunter 2 Monster Hunter Tri and Monster Hunter 4.

No idea why.Below is my original review in its entirety for archival's sake and so people can see what happened.It crashes at the end of the tutorial quest. I know that most people don't have this issue but it seems this game was poorly optimized even after the months they put into it following the delay of the PC release. If you buy this game you might want to rush to the end of the tutorial to make sure that it actually works and don't spend 2 hours in the character creation like I did so you can't get a refund.Also Denuvo DRM but even though that's usually an automatic ""not recommended"" from me I'm not sure yet if this is what's causing the crashing.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,283,False,Recommended,So I got this game after waiting for a port since January. I watched alot of videos and hyped myself up for it. So far it lives up to my expectations. I rolled back my driver turned off Volume Rendering and I'm running a stable 60FPS unless it's a 4 man hunt with lots of particle effects. It's a shame that we can't turn off mouse accelerations but i have adjusted the sensitivity enough so that I never need to jerk my mouse fast enough for the virtual joystick to kick in. I could care less about DoF and bloom. The textures are what I expected from Capcom considering Dragon's Dogma had the same problems yet it's a good game. I rebinded my keys and fiddled with the settings enough where I'm just having fun and not sweating the little things.

2018-08-09,0,0,212,False,Recommended,FIRST A PRO TIP. TURN OF VOLUMETRIC RENDERING TO MAKE THE GAME LOOK AND RUN BETTER. (It's an ugly blue blurry performance killer)I'm not gonna tell you if the game is good or not to me because i already like it im a big a fan of the series so my opinion is not objective.But i will coment on the games performance on my PC. The port is not perfect but its better in evry way than the PS4 version.Even at its less than perfect state the game is still the definitive experience on PC.Specs are I5 6600 GTX970 16 gb of ram ddr4 and i use a regular 1 TB HDD no SSD.The game runs better looks better and has loading times several times lower than on PS4 pro.On high settings the game runs at 55 50 fps and may drop to 45 in the most intense scenes. However if i set the presets to medium settings the game jumps to 60 and never drops fps even in fev intense scenes it barely goes below 60 but these are rare the game is 60 fps 95% of the time.From here i can increase specific aspects such as Load or shadows or AA to values hier than mid and still maintain 60 fps. The bigest frame killer is volume rendering it makes the game look like you are playing thru a camera lens that has a blue plastic wrap over it on so i just recommend you turn it off and the game will probably run at 60fps even if you set almost everything to high.So in short despite the port not bing as good at it culd have bean its till the best version of the game currently available.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,2,False,Recommended,"I've played this pretty constantly on PS4 playing with either Insect Glaive or Hunting Horn and dominating those fields with gusto. Today I decided to step out of my comfort zone with those two and play something with a bit more speed on PC Dual Blades.To start the game is BEAUTIFUL. A significant upgrade in performance and graphics that consoles can't replicate the closest I've gotten to this is on a 65"" screen that's designed for PC use being used for the PS4.Gameplay wise it's very solid. While I could stick to what I know I figured that Dual Blades is something I wanted to try and the PC port was the perfect place to start. Turns out it was the right call while KB/M leaves something to be desired it can be tweaked a bit so I can make it a bit smoother for myself. Reminds me of PC FURI to be honest but with far more content to play around with.The default keybindings are odd to say the least (NITPICK). It can be adjusted sure but that will require a lot of rebinding on standard menu melee and ranged on the keys. The depth of them is excellent but with that you'll probably want to spend a good amount of time testing and binding keys to get the desired setup you would want.NOTE THIS GAME ISN'T FOR EVERYONE. If you're thinking about playing it take your time with it. Don't rush through the story because you're going to get stuck rage and talk about how Dark Souls is easy.

2018-08-16,0,0,53,False,Recommended,I recommend this game but it does have a few critical issues at the moment that keep it from being amazing.First the game automatically attempts to create 32 worker threads regardless of what processor you have tanking performance. The only fix at the moment is to install Special K to have it limit the cores the game is allowed to use. Secondly the game automatically renders volumetric fog which DESTROYS performance. Turn that off to get a huge boost. Third resolution selection is hit and miss if you have multiple monitors. Sometimes it'll select a random monitor on resolution selection. The only fix I found was to window it drag it back to the monitor I want and set the resolution the put it back to fullscreen or borderless. Problem is that resolution change requires a restart every time making it super tedious.Forth the mouse acts like a controller at the moment with no way to turn off mouse acceleration. The Devs are working on it but no ETA at the moment.Lastly occasionally the sessions bug out and you can't join in progress quests after the cutscene plays. Also being worked on but no ETA.If you can get over these things the game is still just as fun as it was on PS4/XBONE.

2018-08-13,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,Won't really recommend this game to anyone that is looking to play online with friends. Mostly Single player as connection keeps having error. When everyone complaints on the Error Code 50352 MW1 CAPCOM did what a good company will do. They solved / fixed it fast (Roughly about 2 days or so I might be wrong). How they fixed it you asked? They created another Error Code 5028f MW1 to take over the old Error Code.Seriously I was having high hopes for the PC version as it's launch later than PS4 and XBOX but if you do a search online you will realized this are the same problem PS4 and XBOX player face when it first launch. Seems like CAPCOM didn't really do anything to it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,I was excited when Monster Hunter World is released for the PC. However there are still many problems with the game such as the camera casual frame drop and the slow response time for the character. The lock on doesnt really help you and the controls for the bow guns are more difficult compared to the ps4 version which I liked using those weapons. Capcom should improve the game more from now on like the ps4 also. I also wished they will bring back the old events such as the Rockmand and the streetfighter collaboration event that they did with the PS4. Do I recommend? Yes it is a beautiful game and fun to play with three other friends or random person on the web. However all of those players should know what they should be doing or it will be impossible to finish the quest that is given to you. That was my first one WHEN WILL YOU FIX THE GODDAMN SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 7months of pc release and you guys at capcom did nothing except sit on your fat on the chair duplicating the game exactly! Really poor optimization of the game. I have a 1070 and the frame drops to 20 on some boss fights. Another trash game for a triple a title that cost 69.99 bucks.

2018-08-09,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"First Impressions Review I'm new to the Monster Hunter series. I tried one game on my old PS2 more than a decade ago and decided it was garbage after 30 mins. I so glad that since then I've gone through the Dark Souls series and learned how amazing the hack and slash genre can be.Pros I love the feeling of exploration and discovery. This game does a great job of making it feel like every small thing you do is important and working towards something. Having lots of things to complete deeply satisfies my neurotype. The combat is great. Like Dark Souls you don't just run in a mash a button until things die. You have to be careful. You have to plan. You have to learn your enemy and only strike when the moment is right.I've just down the 3rd big monster and so far the difficulty has been very low. Maybe that's just because I'm used to Dark Souls but from what I've heard about the series it's going to step up big time so at the moment I won't say this is an official complaint.Cons The characters are annoying. I could tell just from the trailer and the hack job on the facial animations that good characters were probably not going to be the highlight of the game. But this game is not about that so I don't really care. There was an NPC constantly yelling ""Over here!"" at one point. Hope that stops. Maybe make an option to push a button for navigation help instead of that. Also and I'm just comparing this to Souls since that's my only hack n slash reference the combat mechanics seem a little bit clunky but so did Souls at first. As it turned out they were extremely refined and only had to be mastered. I'll assume for now this is the case. Overall I'm absolutely loving it. This is the first game in a while where immediately I can feel that it's special. I'm really looking forward to spending many hours on carefully planned hunts and heart pounding and hopefully much more difficult monsters. 10/10Edit Noticing almost all of the bad reviews are due to technical reasons. Runs like butter on my 2 year old pc. Gameplay seems to be top notch.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,105,False,Recommended,"So I'm writing this review (which I honestly have never done so bare with me) because I feel this game does not deserve the mixed response it currently has. I have played a few of the Monster Hunter games in the past and was excited to see it finally get it's PC debut. I waited with bated breath for the game to finally arrive and when it did I wasn't disappointed. Have I beaten the game? Have I gotten every weapon? Fought every monster? Or done everything there is to do? Happily I reply not yet. Up to this point my time with the game has been entirly in single player and since getting the game last Sunday 8/12/18 I have been unable to put it down. Granted single player is the only realistic way to play the game right now. The key phrase in that sentence being ""right now"". The main complaint I see with the game over and over in the reviews is the server issues on a $60 full priced game. Capcom has released a statment saying they are working to resolve this issue. Not only that but for a $60 game I've had no crashes upwards of 100+ hours of gameplay Tons of weapons Visually stunning and distinct areas varried gameplay and unique encounters. Can the gameplay be repetative and grindy? You bet it can be but even so I kept finding myself just saying ""Just one more hunt"". That drive for that sweet new weapon piece of armor or that feeling of excitment from finding a monster and learning the fight. So I ask you do you enjoy games with challengeing and rewarding combat? Do you enjoy games with extremely varried weapon types? How about games with a deep crafting system that rewards exploration and doesn't make you feel like you're collecting things just to check a box? Then this game may be for you just like it certainly was for me. Zretton",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Yet to encounter issues running the game I capped my FPS at 30FPS and it's maintained that almost perfectly the entire time on the highest settings. Playing with an Xbox controller everything feels just as smooth as it should.The game is alot more fun if you have a friend or friends to play with though the multiplayer allows for randoms to help you and talk to you .I would gladly give this game a 8/10 for what it is but Capcaom needs to have a look in the optimization part ASAP.PSA Turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS.

2018-08-15,0,0,45,False,Recommended,As a fan of Monster Hunter 4 Ulltimate this is a game I've always wanted to play but had no means to for lacking a modern console.After playing it on PC for almost 20 hours I can gladly say that the game is indeed worth it. It may have a rating of 42% at the time I'm typing this but to me it sits around 90% but that could be because I had not run into many of the common issues some of the players had.These issues include a slight FPS drop that I easily got fixed with a GPU driver rollback the inability of connecting with friends which did happen to me (though only once) during my time playing and the difficulty of playing with a mouse and keyboard which I can't judge for the fact I'm using a controller.The other complaints I've noticed were much minor in comparison such as the lack of options to configure for the display. There are a lot of options but perhaps not enough to appeal to everyone such as being able to remove the blur effects. There are some who claims that there are texture issues as well when there seemingly aren't. I may be wrong with that one since I'm not comparing the textures to the PS4 or XBOX versions but so far the game has been gorgeous.The only real issue I have with the game is the story mode players must be alone in a mission to watch cutscenes before being able to play with friends in that same mission so it's impossible to play through the story all the way through as a group and that annoyance is also present in the original unported version of the game. It was intended to be that way but it would be nice to have both players be at the area of execution for a scene to play to allow quest embarkations as a group on those who have reached the same quest in the story.Right now I'm just glad Capcom is working on improving game especially the networking of the PC version based on the latest news https //steamstore a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2444779293764491315The game is definitely worth a buy.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,8,False,Recommended,PROS You can take down awesome monsters You can choose from a varity of play styles via weapon selection. The graphics are pretty cool It gives you non lethal options to taking down a monster. (capture is very hard) Teritory battles between monsters are just the best thing when fighting them. You can hunt with friends (sort of see cons for more details) A very satisfying crafting system for MMO fans that is simple yet has a little depth to it. SOS flares can save your life. The more you team up against the monster the more rewards you get. Great sound Solid mechanics of the game.Impressive A.I.CONS To play a mission together you need to both watch the cutscene. It tries to put MMO mechanics in it but really forces that single player side which is annoying. Too many network issues.CONCLUSION I have played about 22 hours on the Xbox One and a few hours here. The issues that were present six months ago are still present now and that is just messed up and wrong. My number one issue is that I get kicked from the server all the time because of a network issue on the server side. This is the only game that gives me issues like that and I am on a wired connection. I bought the PC version because the Xbox had issues with framing and networking but with my PC the networking issues are still present so it is upsetting. The game is fun it is awesome at its root core design (although that cutscene thing is stupid) its sound and music are great it even does a brilliant job with the A.I. on the monsters but the network failures and multiplayer issues are hurting it big time. 8.5/10 if they fix the network issues I would go as high as 9.5/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,44,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World as a PC port is an absolute mess. While none of these directly affected me a number of people reported issues with framerate in certain areas stuttering during intense fights and driver incompatabilities. Worst of all there seems to currently be a bug wherein the final boss fight ends in your 40+ hour save being corrupted. When players have to edit .ini files rollback graphics drivers and backup save files to get the game to function it's insulting. Even more so when we've already been waiting six months for this port quote ""to get things right.""However as an experience Monster Hunter World is perhapse the greatest PC game since Bioshock. It's truly amazing what Capcom has acomplished here. There's a real feeling of tension in every fight and true progression that can only be described as climbing a mountain. Unlike other games the main progression is not in player stats (there are none) nor eqipment upgrades (although they have a role) but in the player's raw skill. It's truly David versus Golliath in many of these fights. Every monster feels like at any moment it could kill you if you aren't careful. The combat is smooth responsive and unique to most other combat experiences. Most fights are not reactive but predictive. Monsters follow predictable attack patterns rather than long telegraphs rewarding the player's knowledge again making you feel like more of a Hunter than any other game in the series.With only five maps and thirty monsters one would naturally assume that fights would eventually get stale but nothing could be further from the truth. These five zones are packed with small monsters and gathering spots it seems every nook and cranny has something in it. Not only this but I still find myself in a spot I don't recognize even after watching the credits roll. These areas truly feel like living breathing ecosystems. The circle of life is prevalent and large monsters wil get in turf wars if they spot each other under the right conditions. Sometimes it's just as fun to study a monster's behavior in the ecosystem as it is to fight it.Each monster (barring a few varriant monsters) feels unique. Many of the monsters in World are new to the series and all are welcome additions. You could easily find yourself emplyoing drastically different strategies depending on the fight or even the immediate surroundings. As you fight a monster more and more you learn more and become better at the hunt. It becomes faster and more fluid and much much more rewarding. Your first hunt of a monster is gruling twenty to thirty minutes of back and forth but your fifth hunt? Tenth hunt? You know the monster like the back of your hand and yet it's just as fun. The fact that you can go do the same fight five times in a row and still have a blast is a testimate to how great of a game Monster Hunter World truly is. When grinding for rare materials is the core gameplay loop and you pull it off this well it almost makes up for bad pc ports.At the end of the day bugs are patched. Capcom has already stated that they are working on fixing the connection and save issues right now. If you like Monster Hunter you'll love World. If you've never played a Monster Hunter game this is a bit of a tough one. The tutorial takes far too long for Steam's refund timer to give you the real experience and it's really a game like no other. If you're not a fan of loot based games like Diablo then this is absolutely not for you. If you're at least okay with grinding you'll soon find that Monster Hunter World is one of the best games you've ever played.tl dr Bugs get fixed it's good",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,To start off I have only 2h in the game but the experience is so buggy and unpleasant I couldn't endure more. Here are the main issues Mouse acceleration makes controls a torture and there is no option to disable it. For some reason Video and Audio for cutscenes are not synced (audio is ahead by a second). This might be an optimization issue. The game optimization is horrible. I have a good PC with 1070 I've not had problems with any games and this one runs terribly. Menu navigation is extremely unintuitive and a torture by itself.I have many other complaints but these are the main ones.

2018-08-10,0,0,179,False,Recommended,I first owned this on PS4 and put about 500 hours into it just before finishing the Behemoth/Final Fantasy update I'm happy to say that as least in my case it runs great on PC.i7 6700kGTX 1080Like launch day on console it was a little rough staying connected at times but that quickly got patched up on PS4 so hopefully that's the case here as I did have some connection issues with friends but for the most part I was able to play with folks to exnteded periods of time with little inconvenience. Only big caveat I can think of is the choice to make players watch the cutscenes in the main story missions before you're able to join your friends' missions or before they can join you in addition to needing to be on the same level of story progress. I wasn't a fan of that design choice on console and it's translated over to here as well. Thankfully literally everything else in the game that has multiplayer as an option (investigations expeditions events arena etc) runs fine with the excpection of the occasional DC. As far as I'm concerned for launch on a new platform I think it's a solid start. If the mentioning DCs has you on the fence however maybe hold out for a week or so for them to start implimenting PC specific fixes. For folks who suffer from motion sickness there are no options for FOV or to turn off Motion Blur as of writing this however I will mention that on console they were relatively quick to add additional options based on community feedback for things like the camera and some quality of life improvements for the UI so hopefully they'll do so for their PC folks who have more specific needs.And while I haven't had any problems turning off Volumetric Rendering should improve perfomance quite a bit if you're experiencing jitteryness and random large drops in frames.Keeping all that in mind for most folks it seems to play and operate very well so I'm confortable recommending this port. Hopefully the folks in the minority get the patches they need very soon. The MH team has been very quick about patching up the console release. I'm confident they'll do the same on PC in the coming days.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,113,False,Recommended,While I got into Monster Hunter just recently I've been very excited for this release. The creature design is fantastic as is the play style. I was concerned the difficulty of working their first PC release of the game would put a damper on quality and cut down all the dynamic action scenes that happen in battle I was pleasantly surprized. However that isn't to say there aren't any downfalls there are issues with major FPS drops in the middle of fighting large monsters no matter how low the graphics settings are. Other than that the action lag meaning the delay between hitting a button to vault/dodge/etc following a chain of attacks that's always been present in the games would be my only issue. All in all though MH World is a very worth while title and considering it's their first attempt at a PC release for this IP I think they've done rather well.

2018-08-10,0,0,127,False,Recommended,My first MH title and I'm a convert. More relaxed than a traditional mmorpg and more exciting at the same time. Plays best with friends. Game runs amazingly considering what I'd been hearing (c'mon people playing on an old rig isn't Capcoms fault). Few day 1 issues I'm sure will be resolved soon but can't let those affect the review. Few graphic options I wish were present/more controllable (notably motion blur) and I really wish ps4 button prompts were included and detected but perhaps Capcom will add them over time with demand.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,73,False,Recommended,I've been playing Monster Hunter since the first one came out on ps2 in 2004. I got Mh Freedom on the psp and freedom 2 and freedom unite. I even went out of my way to get a wii and even a 2DS(3D's a money grab gimmick even if the 2DS looks like a door wedge.) My only wish was that I could escape the need to buy another console for the next game. And that day has come.. I'm honestly so dissapointed... That I don't have more time in the day to play Monster Hunter World! Sleeping and eating are such inconveniences when there are so many Beasts to be slain. Monster Hunter world has taken the best parts of the old games and made them better. And its taken the more tiresome parts and made them more manageable. Gathering is faster crafting is faster tracking is faster but the hunts are still just as fun and challenging. The weapons still feel amazing and the armors are as fashionable as ever. This game has exceeded my expectations and also flawless pc launch unlike most ports. Its like there is a god and he works at capcom. I must away for I have giant beasts who's faces need mashing with an oversized hammer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Good game played 140 hours on ps4 and I appreciate the instant loadings on PC. Would be a 10/10 with more monster variety and G rank this can be contested by the fact that you can easily dump 300 hours in the game which I did on MH4 ultimate but my 300 hours on ultimate result in a lot of different monsters beaten new concepts in climbing the ranks and NEW monsters when climbing up ( I didn't finish the old game at all ! ). I would say that this lack of diversity is only a minor letdown as a LOT of gameplay mechanics were improved. In my opinion having Infinite whetstones Walking while drinking pots Auto crafting setting for items is suuuch a relief. Combos with weapons are satisfying replayability is still a good point of this game I played 140 hours of insect glaives on ps4 and had no idea that I would have to manage my ammos with a bowgun as it didn't fit my reality at all ! I think that MH Worlds is the first step to a good rework of the franchise. Please give this game some love and let's hope for more monsters for this game and/or the next one !

2018-08-13,0,0,108,False,Recommended,I've waited years for this game and I can say that they delivered ! Don't listen to the angry reviews the games might have connexion issues right now but capcom and steam are looking into it and other than this the game itself is just perfect. And even if you're new to this kind of game don't be discouraged by the people who gave negative reviews because of the difficulty after all Dark Souls was inspired by Monster Hunter so there's a reason as to why it isn't for people who just want to roflstomp everything with no gear and no training. You're gonna need to learn the ropes be it how to utilize the environment (slingshotting rocks suspended will make them fall so with the right timing it can deal massive damage to what you're hunting and you have tons of other environmental hazards you can use to your advantage even wildlife ) craft useful potions/buffs/bombs/traps mount monsters learn their patterns ( how they fight what other monsters they can have turf wars with where their nests/resting places are etc.. ) team up with friends adapt your gear to what you're hunting etc.. And don't get me wrong learning all this is fun but the real fun begins once you're done with the tutorial ( story mode + until HR49 ) and can finally fully enjoy the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,The Coop part is really bad in order to be able to play a mission in MP you first have to have seen every cut scene in that mission... This means that it is really annoying to keep playing missions with your friends because you have to constantly wait for every to have seen the cut scenes leave their mission and join the other players Also there are a lot of random connection issues making you drop out of the MP lobby or meaning that you cannot join your friends.Then there s Denuvo by now everyone should know about the disadvantages that Denuvo has on games (has quite an impact on the fps as well as the loading times ) and it makes it impossible to tweak the ini to disable motion blur etc It is running quite smoothly although the performance is really bad compared to what it looks like. For those console like graphics it should require way less potent hardware.No patch in sight to fix any of the existing problems.All in all a PC port of the worst kind however the game is good but has some strange design decisions. Do not buy except if you are a big fan of the game!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,40,False,Recommended,This game is by far and away the best entry in the Monster Hunter series. The only complaints below that I thought had any merit were mouse and keyboard controls (Which they said they're working on) that can be circumvented entirely with a gamepad (how monster hunter has been played since it's creation) and online connectivity issues. The monsters are amazing the environment is amazing the gameplay is amazing you feel more in control of your hunter than in any of the past games.If you're a fan of the series don't even hesitate. If you have ever wondered what the craze about monster hunter has been in the past this is the best entry to give it a try on.Cut scene fights to progress the story can't be STARTED with friends but they can come help with an SOS flare. I can see how people would think that is tedious. But if we take a step back and realize that in all past entries urgent quests to progress the story had to be done offline solo with no option to call in help I'd rather have a tedious work around than no option to have friends help at all.The ports great don't be dissuaded by the negativity.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Beautiful port runs very smoothly looks great at max settings combat is as fluid as ever even on K&amp M. My only small gripe is that aiming is locked into this weird slow inaccurate speed that doesn't reflect your mouse movements which kind of sucks when trying to quick aim at a monster behind you but really it's not that big of a deal. All said and done this is absolutely the definitive way to play Monster Hunter World. PLEASE buy this so Capcom understands WE WANT MORE MONSTER HUNTER ON PC!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,121,False,Recommended,This is my first Monster Hunter game (and my first Steam review) and I love it! It's beautiful even on low graphics. It's single player! BUT it is single player like Diablo is single player and that's the best kind. I love games tuned for 1 that can scale for 4. The fights are challenging and engaging even with my pretty uninteractive lance. Love combat. The items you can use and elements you can take advantage of really encourages many ways to play! All the weapons seem viable (except the hunting horn in single player but maybe I don't know lance is love lance is life). Many skills and armor sets are all valid and useful. Gathering isn't stupid and gear doesn't take too many materials to make. There is a compelling and engaging story. The voice acting and writing is really good. Everything about the game is fantastic to me!The reason why this is getting such bad reviews is because the multiplayer is all kinds of messed up. I personally don't care about the multiplayer. However when my friends wanted me to play we played. It was fun! But there were 3 disconnects in 3 hours. Session reseting was necessary. Otherwise it was a smooth run. We didn't have nearly the problems others seem to be having.Rating this game for its multiplayer shortcoming is fallacy I think. This game is too good to be reviewed so poorly because of Capcom's networks not being able to support 300 000 players. I do very much recommend the game. Just be careful when trying multiplayer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I've played the Monster Hunter games since 2008 and this is easily the best one yet. I bought my PC last December specifically so I could play this with my friends. Imagine my disappointment when I had to wait until the following August to actually download and play it. And it came out just two days before I go on a two week vacation across the US. Perfect timing. Still I'm so glad I waited and I can't wait to see what's in store. My partner and I took a minute to figure out the multiplayer and it's an absolute blast. It might have a learning curve for people just getting into MH but it is seriously worth it. Take the time to learn and play. You'll have a ton of fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,80,False,Recommended,While this game had a very rocky start especially with multiplayer of recent the problems appear to have been resolved.Overall I find this game to be quite fun and it makes it among one of the few games I've managed to complete (though I haven't finished all the post game stuff and new post game stuff seems to be released for free every month or two). It can be hard at times and even a little rage inducing but even someone like me with second rate reflexes can make it to the end game. As you learn their patterns and improve your gear you eventually gain mastery over the monsters to the point that it goes from them toying with you to you toying with them.The selection of weapons also help add variety to the play style so even if you find yourself not satisfied with some of the weapons you should find one which suits you.The end game does get a bit grindy with a lack of progression and having to work to hard for what little progression there is but that is only after dozens of hours of well paced progression and somethign I hope will be fixed with G rank (though I suspect it won't be included for free).I currently plan to buy any expansions that will hopefully be coming out.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,302,False,Recommended,"TL DR I'm not surprised that this game has mixed reviews Monster Hunter is not for everyone.And for the veterans out there change isn't a bad thing.As someone who got into the series back in 2nd gen I will say that MHW here is probably the easiest one to get into. Monster Hunter is known for having clunky UI and confusing weapons statistics but a great deal of that has been simplified in World. I know some of the MonHun community looks down on ""casualization"" when it comes to Monster Hunter a game that focuses on fair but challenging fights and mechanics but some of the things that have been switched out in World make sense. As large and complex as the new areas are the scoutflies for example actually make navigation much simpler. I'm not talking about locking onto and following them to a monster although that certainly does help when first learning the maps the scoutflies locate material deposits monster tracks (an addition that I love) and even environmental tools to help you traverse and explore.However at the end of the day Monster Hunter is still Monster Hunter. The learning curve is steep but the effort is worth it. Let me drop a quote that sticks with me to this day ""...Monster Hunter is a martial art.The first year of any half decent non americanized martial art will have you be doing nothing but exercises and chores. This isn't done out of cruelty but to make sure you have the three things necessary for real training which is a good foundation diligence and patience. No martial art works without all three of those things combined.The opening quests of all Monster Hunters are super boring but necessary. You go through gather quests to get a good foundation of supplies. You exercise your diligence by practicing attacking those minor monsters like the _pray or the Jaggi practicing hitting on small moving targets with your weapon to find the one you like and the patience immediately disqualifies anyone who pulls a Yahtzee and isn't worthy for it.After a year of this the master will finally take you aside and teach you how to do a single kick. He will expect you to master this before moving on. This kick is the first large monster. Like a Great Jaggi. You'll probably spend about 20 30 minutes on this guy your first time hunting ever because you'll have no real idea what you're doing and what to expect. However once you master this kick you'll learn how to ing kick and how to use it on everything ever. And that feeling is ing amazing.Then you get to learn how to punch AND kick at the same time (Qurupeco and R.Luddy).&gt First time against RathianNow I never said Monster Hunter was a kind master. At this point in your training your master will ask ""Hey remember that tornado triple kick you wanted to learn?"" then throw you into a 10'x10' pit with a starved lion in it with absolutely no instructions laughing at you the whole way.And you'll love it."" But I digress it appears most of the negative complaints are regarding the system requirements and interconnectivity issues. The only negative thing I can say regarding these is that I do not understand the decision to lock certain cutscenes to a single player effectively making it impossible to party up through certain missions without quitting out and rejoining each other post cutscene. Other than that the game has run like a breeze with minimal to no connection issues. It is certainly taxing and the system requirements are steep but it runs fine. I'm sure the 14 people who run this game in 21 9 will develop a workaround or get a patch for their wierdly specific issue but I personally have had no trouble.I have been playing this game on both controller and k+m with no issue even hotswapping mid expedition when switching weapons.I don't mean for this to be a ""lol it works for me"" post and I understand that hardware issues can really destroy a game for individuals but no one in my hunting party has an issue. In fact one of them is running this on a 760ti the madman.So yeah it's Monster Hunter. For PC finally.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing for a few hours since yesterday and all I can resume this in 2 phrases. Good Game seems to be pretty good graphics are great and the few monster I've been able to see looked freaking awesome. Bad Not cool console to pc port dudes. You can play with your keyboard yes. And you can use your mouse sure. But the whole playability is clearly thought and designed to be used with a game pad. I expected FAR more than this because playing the game turns out to be really frustrating (at least to me e.g you cannot even use Escape key to get out of menues you have to use right click!!!!) I mean I don't get it guys. Even the combat focus system sucks tbh. This really show off how little you cared about this Steam release and PC based fanbase. Even in some menues there are Gamepad button references but even that is nothing compared to how bad the whole experience is by giving the PC version the expected playability for a console. You have to understand that this is not minor thing this is actually the most important thing right after having cool monsters to hunt.Anyway will give it a few more tries to see if I can improve or default the situation to the fact that they should improve not me. I expected excellent playability for the price.I think it can be worthy to have if they work hard on that to solve it ASAP. Otherwise I cannot recommend it. The graphics being great and monsters being really awesome just makes it worse to realize playability sucks and you'll not be able to be comfortable using your character and enjoy the whole universe.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,108,False,Recommended,An amazing core game made slightly less awesome by some poor design choices around its multi player components.At its heart Mhw takes the core game play that we have known from previous entries streamlines it and moves it to an open world. The new interactions and small touches on monsters make them feel more alive than ever. Although I know for some veteran players this will not make up for the much smaller roster of monsters than in previous entries like 4U or GU. (Personally I think if they were to add a monster every 1 2 months the roster would be perfect in 1 2 years.)Now for the problems. Network connectivity is iffy the fact that you cannot watch cutscenes in a group is really really stupid the lack of ps4 button prompts when using a ps4 controller is mildly annoying and Denuvo blows in general.If you plan on playing mostly solo most of this won't be a problem so have at.

2018-08-10,0,0,109,False,Recommended,From Freedom Unite to a Western Monster Hunter game on PC. It's been a long journey for this franchise and Monster Hunter veterans everywhere.Pro It's a Monster Hunter game. If you don't know what that means you will hunt large monsters from dragons to birds to unicorns. You will slay these monsters with your choice of weapons (of which they are over a dozen). Every weapon and armor can be crafted from these monsters. Resource management galore is streamlined to make it easy and less cumbersome. You can walk and gather herbs now. Each weapon is EXTREMELY unique (except maybe a couple) and they are free to try. The difficulty curve is real later on in the game and once you get to tempered monsters be ready to die a lot. Free content updates. First WESTERN PC Monster Hunter release!Con Controller optimization is a little wonky. Some options are missing like motion blur sliders or raw mouse accelaration which can be frustrating. Tutorial is a bit annoying to slog through if you are familar with Monster Hunter. End game is a little lacking without G rank.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,362,False,Recommended,I'm one of those people who played on console before nabbing the PC version. On PS4 I played over 250 hours and explored every inch of the game. I love Monster Hunter and the PC port is the best version yet so long as you have the hardware. Monster Hunter World is a cooperative RPG where you hunt huge monsters basically dinosaurs and dragons then use their skins and parts to craft better armor and weapons to hunt higher tier monsters. Each of the weapon types has their own play style and completely unique combos and mechanics meaning there is a lot of replayablility when learning new weapons and a lot of depth behind the systems. This is a skill based game. If you lose it's because of your own mistakes moreso than your equipment. And you know what? There's no loot boxes at all. The only in game purchases are the emotes so you can't buy weapons or armor. It's a long game with a lot of depth but a very enjoyable one with a lot of personality as well. Monster Hunter is one of those games you start playing until you suddenly realize six hours have passed and you've got to go to work. It's addictive and fun. My major complaint about this entry is how hard it can be for players to play the story mode together since the have to watch the cutscenes before joining the other players game. But otherwise the progression is fantastic.But console owners should know this version doesn't have all the updates yet. The PC port is behind on several features like new monsters or events (Tulve Lunastra). We'll undoubtedly get them eventually but you should know what your getting into. Hardware wise this game requires a beast to get running. Thankfully you can turn down a lot of setttings to get the game running well (tip disable volumetric fog) but you should check the machine can handle it. I personally lower settings to get higher framerates but the game has a lot of options available for everyone. Is Monster Hunter for you? Well if it is then World is the place to start. It is by far the best MH to date with quality of life improvements that cannot be understated. I say this as someone who has played MH games on 3DS hell even in Japanese. World is the best Monster Hunter ever made even if the endgame isn't quite at the level of previous titles. So yeah I recommend the game (if you can't tell). Just know what your getting into. If you're double dipping you'll have to make your own choice about what matters to you but I can say without a doubt I recommend this to everyone who has never played MHW. Get it. NOW!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

CO OP in this game works just like any other game except you're joining two servers instead of just one. (Online session then into quest.)You should probably want to play this game with atleast a GTX 1060 / RX 480. I also hear this game is quite CPU intensive aswell so make sure your PC is up to date.Overall i'd give this game a 9/10. Really ing fun game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,149,False,Recommended,"I have i5 processor GTX 1080. The game has ran on max settings 60 FPS the whole time I've played. The K&amp M controls are good except for moving the camera with the mouse is limited like your mouse is actually a control stick. It's not a dealbreaker but a little annoying and takes some getting used to.The story is meh the characters are a little obnoxious but it's not really why I'm playing the game. I'm fairly new to the series only played one MH game before just briefly and I have fell in love with this game. The combat is fantastic with real weight behind the larger weapons and takes careful use of them to be any good in battle. And MAN there are so many kinds of weapons to choose from and so many upgrades to make using loot that you get from hunting monsters. I could see myself killing monsters for hours and ENJOYING the grind to get the stuff needed to craft the outfits/weapons I want.Multiplayer is also great if it worked consistently. It's a little convoluted to get a game going with friends. You have to talk to a certain NPC to open up a lobby and if the lobby's private a simple Steam invite doesn't seem to work because it doesn't actually ""invite"" you even though a window pops up that you can accept. It took some fiddling but manually entering the room ID will let you join a friend's lobby. From there however you have to then create an assignment to determine what hunt you want to do then everyone needs to join that group or maybe not if not everyone's caught up in ""cutscenes."" Usually not a problem for the side quest assignments as pretty much anyone can join those. Or if you want to do an expedition I guess one person goes in solo and then has to SOS signal the friends in order for them to join? Oh and then hope your friends don't D/C for no reason once they're all in.Yeah so the Multiplayer aspect as far as just getting a game GOING with everyone in it is needlessly complicated. But when it works it's so fantastic to coordinate with your team to track down monsters and take them down. It's extremely satisfying and really want the kinks ironed out so that it can just be done seamlessly.These complaints alone absolutely cannot warrant a No Recommendation from me. These things (hopefully) will be fixed in the near future and without them there is still a TON of game here that is very much so worth playing.

If you've got a top spec computer you'll be hitting 60 most of the time but dipping well into the 20's and 30's during heated moments.The keyboard and mouse controls are not good. You really need a controller for this.The multiplayer implementation has numerous incredibly questionable design decisions which make it confusing to play with friends.But the game ends up being a ton of fun despite all of these issues. I've barely scratched the surface but I've had a ton of fun with singleplayer content and have put in many hours of co op with some friends and it's certainly the most fun I've had in co op since dying light.Hopefully they will patch out the aforementioned issues though I would not hold my breath.

2018-08-11,0,0,47,False,Recommended,The best Monster Hunter game yet but also the most broken. After playing the series for about 10 years this is the conclusion I reached after my first 15 hours in. Gameplay wise I haven't had a single complaint. Everything from previous games is improved movement and weapons have all been overhauled for the better. Things that mostly wasted time (always bringing pickaxes to mine going through lengthy gathering animations) have all been either improved or removed entirely. Monsters feel smarter more interesting and they use the environment well.Unfortunately this amazing experience can have technical issues that hold it back. Music cutting out poor performance and optimization disconnects and freezes at odd times. Having played with a group of 4 players for nearly 100 missions we've had near hunt ending issues in 10 of them. A failure rate over 10% for a game like Monster Hunter is unacceptable. I'll still recommend it as Capcom has a good history with patching games and it IS one of the best games I've played in the past decade. Approach this game as you would approach one of its monsters.

Come on people not every game that comes out on PC is gonna run as smooth like melted butter right out of the box give them a chance.So far I can say the game handles ok and I was worried about it not running fast with graphics set to high. Had issues with trying to connect to SOS flares figures since the servers aren't up to what they should be but what game doesn't have connectivity issues on release day?My only true complaint so far is theres no native PS4 button graphics in game had to mod it in. Seriously it's 2018 just put the damn buttons there...My other minor complaints would follow along the lines of No way to skip cutscenes having to view cutscenes of stuff so you can take the quests with other players the need of an expansion of the advanced graphics options for more of the things we'd like to turn up/down no option to toggle/press and hold for voice chat etc...All in all a few issues can be solved if people go check reddit like I did. Other serious issues like connectivity and the like are probably going to take time till they start tossing updates out.Either way ya get what you payed for the game is great it has flaws here and there but you can deal with it.So far as I can see it seems using controllers are actually the better option in playing this.

Also take note that the Option ""Volumetric Fog"" eats up to 20 FPS while activated Tip if you have problems with motion sickness or extremly over the Top Motion blur disable antialaising it seems to be interlocked with motion blur. Would I recommend this game? Yes I would definetally but only if you bring the minimum hardware if not just below recommendet. If you PC is bad / CPU old / GPU Old then just not try it you will just get frustradet.Thanks everyone",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-26,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,Warning Spoilers Here do not reveal if you do not want to ruin parts of the game.So I have played the game for 60+ hours now and have finished it from start to finish and defeated the gratuitously lackluster boss despite that fact I have enjoyed the game I honestly cannot recommend it until some major issues have been patched out.Yes the game looks very pretty even on medium to low settings but its missing options which should be present in any PC game one shouldn't require to google fu how to disable motion blur and create .ini files to disable it or even go into option files to change settings which should be available in game mouse acceleration. The game also have issues running on latest nVidia drivers causing stuttering and lag requiring returning to an older driver for normal function.The gameplay is great fun if the controls would work fine. This being a PC game you should strongly expect to be able to use the game with K+M and not require a controller. Its recommended to use a controller and thats unacceptable a game should play incredibly fine with K+M if you expect to sell on PC. I have been fiddling with key bindings and still have yet to find a suitable layout that works flawlessly for both ranged and melee seeing as you can bind different key sets whether you use melee or ranged weapons. The game also has an issue with prioritizing interactions with the world sometimes bringing up an interaction for an item meters away while you are stood exactly on top of another item.The game also has issues with crashing for no reason having ran the game regulaly with task manager running so I can monitor what might be causing these I can only assume its something to do with graphics card memory or the game as I have yet to see it fully utilize the 12GB of RAM I have the most I have seen it ever use is like 5GB at any one time. People also state the game thrashes their CPU this is something I have yet to experience as my i5 6500 (3.2) sits around 70 80% utilization while my graphics card GTX 1050 2GB maintains almost 100% usage during gameplay. I haven't monitored my card's usage and memory utilization yet which I really should to see if these random CTD's that I am having and the occasional textures showing up in neon pink green red and blue it could be that myt VRAM was full at the time but when you randomly crash during an expedition and lose a lot of loot it can be pretty enraging.The game itself is very pretty with each area quite very clearly defined with its own style. I was very plesantly disgusted by how incredible Rotten Vale looked and certainly made me want to nope out because it was really grossing me out. I think its the first time a level in a game has really triggered such an impulse in me to just NOT want to play that map how grotesque and rotten everything looks for a monsters graveyard. Its a massive change to how amazingly lush and beautiful Ancient Forest looks so you get to visit some very great variation of places each with their own environment and monsters to fight and resources to gather very big props to how much attention to detail and how well crafted these maps are.BIG BIG BIG SPOILER ALERT Final Boss Because I have a gripe!!I asked a friend to help me with the last boss because I thought it would be hard. He agreed and then told me to do nothing at all except mine outcrops. And I completed the mission. By standing around. Doing nothing. My friend was laughing so hard at the fact I was finding it so difficult to find the words for what a travesty the final 'battle' was. They must have run out of ideas.Despite the issues I still do find it okay to play I have been eagerly waiting for a Monster Hunter to come to PC after last playing it on 3DS years ago. But I wish they would have waited a bit longer to iron out some issues...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,86,False,Recommended,Overall I'd say this game is a 75/100. The game itself is quite good and a breath of fresh air from all the watered down ideas that turn into games these days however there are a couple major flaws I'd like to address.Flaw #1. Denuvo. Denuvo is a form of DRM that encrypts all the files of a game. When playing the game your computer needs to decrypt all these files on the fly which leads to higher load times stuttering on hard drives and some SSDs and higher CPU requirements. If/when they remove Denuvo I'd rate this game as a 85/100 but those technical issues can really break the game on some set ups. (If you are having issues try reinstalling the game or moving it to another drive as Denuvo can be really broken sometimes but fix itself with a reinstall).Flaw #2. Bugs/meh port issues. The PC port of this game is decent but not what I was expecting with the 8 month wait. Some textures are very low res online can be VERY tempermental (had 10 different people help me on one hunt because they keps getting timed out) and there are just some standard day #1 bugs that I would have hoped the 8 months would have addresed.Personally given the issued the game has vs the just insane amount of content and how fun the game is I'd say it is worth the $60 they're asking but just barely. If they remove Denuvo and patch some of the issues I'd say it would be work well abovce $60.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Keep in mind the below is assuming you know what Monster Hunter games are like.Pros (so far) I can tell they tried to make the world feel alive and for a video game they succeeded. The combat seems shallow at first but further research and practice reveals many options for engaging monsters and the environment.

2018-08-11,0,0,90,False,Recommended,"Day 3TLDRAn hour long unskippable tutorial with cutscenes is probably the worst aspect of the game right now. The real cons for the game are small and connecting to friends through steam needs to be fixed (fine ingame).My friends game didn t work until he updated his graphics driver (AMD).Unskippable TutorialThe introduction is far too long &amp many of the core mechanics for the game aren t introduced until you complete quests that are tacked on with tutorials. Couple this with the early clunkyness of keyboard controls makes for a slow and confusing start. You will quickly learn the controls but specifically changing potions isnt ideal. SOS battles SOS battles are kind of a gimmick in this game. They work as intended but if you wanted to just explore with your friends it might be difficult since the SOS callout is public to all servers &amp you have to find it on a board with many other people. Nobody uses them since you re better off collecting resources while doing quests and investigations. It can be useful if you want to do a quest for the first time since you cant invite others until you watch the cutscene.Hub AreaIts a really good and cool area but you cant see anyone. You can only see your friends at the top floor of the hub which is a small and secluded portion of the area. It has almost all of the resources you need to prepare for a battle though. Bosses too easy?Not kidding Right now it feels like a game of roll out of aggro &amp then hit when your cat takes aggro. Bosses will occasionally attack you when your using potions or even right after you ve been stunned but thats only a little annoying. Its also really easy to just do most of the main quests without farming for equipment beforehand. Some bosses are strong due to their natures and abilities but even though you can get combo'd and one shot most of the time you ll spam the roll button and live.Online. Most people are giving up when trying to create private lobbies right now since they just dont work. Creating a public allows my friends to join &amp in the past three days no randoms have joined. I have however been disconnected three times near the end of a hunt but the game does allow both of you to continue on your own and collect the rewards. However I have bad internet so those disconnects could have been my fault.Steam Connection""Has launched the game Has launched the game Has launched the game"" I was in multiplayer the entire time with my friend and we both kept getting this. The game is fine but it messes with steam friends for some reason. Right now I just put my account on invisible to stop being annoying but this definitely needs to be fixed even if its not a gameplay issue.Small Details.I cant see much of a difference between the texture settings. Armor Upgrade paths should be visible before doing more quests (I thought it was dlc at first) . Actual farming is bad especially early game since you get little rewards. Pathing with fireflies is only good 99% of the time 1% its elevation cancer. Traps should be unlocked at the start of the game. Tracking quickly became finding one footprint for a map indicator. Using the locked on camera mode is completely unplayable. The origin bonuses are too strong at the start of the game since you get a charm. Sometimes a boss with get stuck for 5 seconds in a wall. I wanted an under water area ( also the game looks bright and washed out a bit Real talk from a returning playerInventoryThank god for the inventory item chest and crafting system. I honestly don t have any complaints for that other than progression for resource areas. Its PerfectThe GameNo loading zones fast travel to camps micro quests beautiful landscapes lots of forgeable decent boss pacing understandable upgrades &amp effects pelicos (cats) are cute new &amp old bosses investigations are common and help grind time limits are fairly lax the map is easy to navigate and shows all creatures and resources once unlocked gathering resources isn t too difficult unless you only want one type. The UI is good in general. You still don t feel overpowered when going back to help friends. Small monsters usually don t attack you during boss battles. The slinger is useful for traps and effects. the gathering net is neat. autolock is terrible but the aim assist useful. fireflies are amazing and usually give you the best path. Ranged still feels good/bad with limited ammo and annoying crafting. Traps still feel strong and its easier to tell when the boss is weak. Unknown materials are still a pain for upgrading but the wiki works.The community wiki looks ugly but it still has the information youre looking for. PerformanceEarly reviews said that the game had terrible optimization but I cant confirm with my hardware. My friends game crashed when he first installed it but he then updated his graphics driver and it workedCPU r5 1600GPU gtx 1060 6gbHDD WD Blue 1tbRAM 16gb 2993 mhzMonitor 1920x1080 60hz internet 2mb/s (I got stable 60fps using medium settings then turned it to high and only noticed lows of 40 fps. (similar to store page)I wouldnt suggest turning the texture quality up too high since I actually can t notice the difference and neither can a lot of my friends. The Audio quality also doesn t seem to matter. Tabbing out of fullscreen did crash me once but I ve done it 100 times. I also doubt putting the game on an ssd would have changed much since task manager didn t show my hard drive getting slammed. The actual gameplay is good they just need to add a skip button to all cutscenes &amp tune the servers.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

(radial menu wishlist auto crafting and many more).I recommed for beginners. Veterans might complain of the lack of G rank but overall it's a great monster hunter experience that is worth playing.ps Ah actually one thing I do need to complain is not having armor skin customization (They did have it in gen/XX). The full armor sets are really looking good but most of the people won't use it because they min/max with mixed set.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-20,0,0,168,False,Recommended,Fantastic game.I remember playing monster hunter on the PS2 and PSP back when I was a teenager and I loved the games back then but I haven't been a console or handheld player in over a decade so I had to go without. When Capcom announced they would be porting MHW over to PC I was overjoyed. This isn't exactly the same as the Monster Hunter games I remember most of the encounters are easier the camera is more reliable there's a lot of QOL additions that veterans may like or dislike and you get your very own palico to follow you around. But at its roots it's still a solid Monster Hunter game! That means hundreds of hours of exploring fighting learning looting smithing and overcoming. Now there are some connection problems. My friends and I have had it lucky and have only disconnected from eachother once or twice in around 50 hours of gameplay and never during a fight but to my knowledge some other people aren't so lucky. There are also a lot of complaints about performance but I will say that my CPU barely meets the minimum requirements (pentium G4560) and I can still choose to play at 1080p on low at a consistent 30fps or at variable 720p at 45 60fps with the former being exactly the way it plays on consoles. For specs reference I also have 8GB of ram and a 1050TI 4G but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the game runs on my PC given the complaints about performance. Overall I would dissuade people from letting the negative reviews stop them from buying the game if they think they'll enjoy it currently there are 26 521 reviews but MHW on Steam has an average daily player peak of over 350 000 players. I think most of those are just way too busy having fun to write a positive review.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-04,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is the first game in the series that makes its way to PC and it does a pretty good job while retaining most of the original Monster Hunter mechanics.It's mostly still the same Monster Hunter as all of the others in the series with some new features and quality of life improvements. It's significant y more accessible than previous Monster Hunter games which is both good and bad. Veteran hunters will probably sigh and groan most new hutners will still feel the challenge. PC graphics look amazing and I didn't have to sacrifice quality for performance too much (with a GTX 1080). Multiplayer is fairly simple send a signal and people join up or create a session with friends and hunt together. There's is also a fairly wide variety of monsters to hunt from along with the promise of more in the future and most are new and several of them are unique in both behaviors and atack patterns.There are several issues as well including lots of server errors although the most recent patch fixed a lot of those issues for me. It is a bit frustrating to suddenly disconnect in the middle of a hard hunt and have to slug out the rest of it solo. Also some of the new mechanics really take away from the hardcore Monster Hunter experience most people are familiar with like scoutflies and other things. The interface for the game is also fairly confusing and the game doesn't always explain everything clearly although that's a persistent Monster Hunter problem across multiple games.In conclusion Monster Hunter World brings a lot of loved mechanics to PC and delivers a pretty good cooperative experience but it's flawed by interface and server issues and for some people it's easier than normal which can ruin the hardcore Monster Hunter experience.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,193,False,Recommended,I've only played MH4U on 3DS and while it was fun I did struggle quite a bit. But MHW is a lot easier allowing for new people to learn the game and have fun. I do thoroughly enjoy this game and I personally have no qualms with it. I do strongly recommend it if you've been looking to get in to MH this is the best way to wet your feet. I don't have the best hardware i5 4590 and a 2nd hand Fury X I can with a mix of med and high setting run 1440p at 60FPS and the load times are SO much faster than they are on console it's a joke. I have not had the issues plaguing others my internet disconnects are due to my powerline adapter but even then I rarely DC and it's never happened during multiplayer only solo. I hate paying $80 CAD for games as there is always other BS DLC to add on but with MHW I don't mind the price. In today's age where you need a season pass or other crap to get a full game MHW is a full fledged game with Capcom constantly pushing updates and events without asking for an extra penny. I strongly recommend MHW.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-22,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Waiting for this game to come out has been rough. Now that I have time into it I can say with confidence that the time I waited was well worth it. The bad reviews are all based on small things and not even about the game itself. The tunnel visioning on the bad things and not acknowledging all the good things is staining the review page and it makes me upset. All of the bad reviews are based on the fact they didn't perfect the Keyboard/Mouse controls (I've used it just fine this whole time) and the fact it doesn't support Ultra Wide monitors. (That reason is invalid because if you have an ultra wide monitor you are an animal.) It seems when it comes to PC releases no matter what company it is everyone always has problems. That is troubling and also this games multiplayer is very restrictive. You can only interact with people at the gathering hub outside of missions and you have to wait to join games until they have watched all of the videos involved with that mission. But that hasn't stopped me and my buddies either getting our butts kicked or kicking some butts.The overall game itself other than the disconnecting at times (which is currently being worked on) it is a grind fest that they manage to make fun just like all of the other monster hunter games. It looks amazing feels amazing runs pretty decent (Until tornado boi) and it is worth giving it a shot.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I now have real hope that this can be a thumbs up.Update 2 No trace of disconnects to be found. While the mouse movement missing textures 21 9 support are still negative the game experience is no longer consistently interrupted so I moved it to thumbs up. Already some of the DLC is hitting the PC community yisss.Update 3 Mouse fix is in! Still no ultrawide but I'm not sure that's actually a dealbreaker for anybody.I love Monster Hunter started on Tri. This game is very good the port is trash and the servers are absolutely helpless during launch weekend. Obvious missteps abound Pitiful mouse implementation means controller or bust. Ranged weapon players were so hype for this too.Graphics settings are bare minimum for a port and no 21 9. This doesn't affect me but ysk.Multiplayer party formation is goofy and archaic clinging to the bad parts of previous games while abandoning the good. (Also they straight don't work too many players and not official statement ofc) Not being able to freely name your room is janky on PC they had that in Tri back in 2010? I mean they don't even have an option for ""turns "" have they ever played a MH game? The classic feel of having a party of 4 is mostly gone but sessions are OK. Co op during story is a no go unlike previous games where one player gets ""story credit"" for an urgent quest now other players can't even join unless they already did it. And there are a lot more ""assigned"" than urgents used to be so it's much more restricting.Capcom doesn't need your money they already got mine.

Adapted console navigation not too fun (to put it mildly) since you have to memorize different behavior of the same buttons on different screens (Esc may summon pop up windows RMB close them). Combos are just non existent without controller since one of your arms is chained to the mouse with minimal set of buttons and restrained movement (since you click it non stop).

2018-08-10,0,0,70,False,Recommended,So far the game has been somewhat hit and miss. The controls feel clunky and sluggish i have gotten used to them but still have problems every now and then. having in game voice chat is nice until you realise that is broken as all get out quiet and hell and no push to talk option is disgraceful. The matchmaking needs a complete overhaul what's the reasoning of making my mate and i start 2 seperate hunts get to the boss watch its introduction then 1 of us leave and join the other so that we can hunt the boss together. trying to find a match with other people is more or less impossible steam charts tells me there is 221 500+ people online and i can't find a single group outside of my mates please explain. the navi glow beetles have a tendency to block your vision.Servers so far i have had 12 fatal errors and more disconnects then i can count personally i got this game to be able to play with friends and getting disconnected every 4 5 Minutes is not what i would call fun the time it takes to navigate into the hunt is longer than your connected to the hunt.Today i spent an excessive amount of time playing around 14 hours. In that time i managed to complete 2 hunts without someone or all of us getting disconnected at some point through the hunt.Now i think thats the ing out of the way now for what i like. the combat is fun even more some when they allow you to play online the town is not a nuence to navigate unlike some games past most systems are streamlined (i can't speak for other games online as i have always played them solo) being able to gather by just running past nodes and auto crafting is a nice touch along with the endless gathering tools and whetstones.for the first 2 3 hours when the game was running smoothly it was a blast. when/if they do something about the servers and provide more options for voice comms it will be a very solid game but as it stands it's a average game if you expect to play with others.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,216,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter finally came to PC as I long dreamed for years ago. I even saved and bought a new (low/mid end) PC just exactly for this (well this and witcher 3 anyway) and the game turned out how I hoped it would be. If you've been long pining for a monster hunter game on PC like me (esp. since I mostly played it on a borrowed Visa years ago and loved it after that short time) it was well worth the wait.Granted some reviews speak of PC port specific issues but it hardly affects me when I'm mostly running on LOW ish settings (using a GTX 1050 on a 1440 x 900 monitor and I'm entirely used to 30 fps so I can hardly relate to those issues it still looks good enough for me). Perhaps my main concern is multiplayer since I frequently get disconnected then again not really a problem for me too since I'm mostly a solo gamer (shiity PH DSL speeds turns you into one). I'm usually too lazy to write a review but here's to hoping I can contribute a little to counter balance the MIXED reviews due to the entitiled PC master race complaining of a less than stellar port.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-11,0,0,117,False,Recommended,Product received for free. How to Multiplayer with friends.Monster Hunter World is a fun game. The multiplayer is poorly explained and they could have done a much better job on it but once you understand how to connect and play with friends it's not as bad. The problem is just that it's extremely poorly explained. Here's what you need to know if you want to play with friends. You can not join a friend's expedition without them shooting an SOS flare. That being said you are able to be in an expedition with a friend after finishing a quest. You will be given the option to return to camp with current party and that puts you back into expedition mode. This only works if you choose the same camp to spawn at.Now here is how you join friend's quests. First you must make sure you are in the same online session. Then one member posts a quest at the quest board or handler. Here's the pain about doing assigned (story) quests with each other. You must all make sure that you have watched the cutscene in the mission before you are able to join their quest. Once given the notification that you can fire your SOS flare you will be able to join others or have them join you. Just return from quest post the quest again and now your friends can join. Really there is no issue with joining optional quests seeing as they don't usually have cutscenes.Great. Now you are ready to play MHW with friends. Enjoy and have fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I hope they will release a patch there's more flexibility in settings.Second the Controls on pc is not good Good thing i played MHW with a controller Mouse / KB is horrible maybe its just me. not all option can be enable / disable . Mouse acceleration and other stuff but i can live with it. another thing for those people complaining about the cut scene i'm sure this is the first MH that you played other MH has no story or a cutscene introduction of the monster if it's first time encountering it. Monster hunter is starting to evolve its genre adding some innovative mechanics for the game. i'll add more on my review after finishing the main story. (Finished Low rank Mission)WEAPONS PROS AND CONS I'm dissapointed about the variations of the weapons almost of the starting weapons looks the same bone with a colored fur depending on the element. expect for the raipers. I already look at the wiki MHW its just dissapointing when there is little variations for the weapon's look but the armor is well made even in the low ranks u will feel badass because of your armor.Update 300+ Hrs in and HR 170The game has a lot of online problem but the main cause of it is my ISP im sure of it because when I'm the only one using our internet i rarely get DC Deviljho is strong i can't wait for tempered version i switch to bow but the good mix set is limited im just waiting for the upcoming content of the game so i can complete my OP Build for bow,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-10,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Game was absolutely unplayable at launch due to lots of network and crashing issues. I got err12 which was related to my GPU. However it is completely fixed now for me at least. Some may dislike keyboard and mouse gameplay however personally prefer it. Another issue with this game is how terribly optimized it is. It takes a damn NASA super computer to run it on max settings which thankfully they let me have one but I realize that not everyone can afford it. As a game though if you can run it it is fantastic. The gameplay is fluid it actually provides me some challenge and satisfaction of winning and is great with friends. From this point on I would recommend it at full price however if you have only an average PC and a console I would have to recommend getting it on console.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,159,False,Recommended,"It took a little while but the PC port for Monster Hunter World is finally here and as someone who's been playing since 4U I was very excited to give this a try. For anyone new to the series this is a very good place to begin. There were many QOL changes form the old games that make this one much more accessible to newcomers. Though some veterans have deemed this game ""too easy"" compared to the old games that's not entirely true. I for one felt that all the fights be it with old or newer monsters felt quite challenging at the times you had to face them and sometimes had to come up with newer strategies to take them on.If you've never played a Monster Hunter game before and love the idea of fighting large creatures with big heavy weapons while collecting their parts to make even better stuff this is your game!

2018-08-18,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Its Monster Hunter... the game is challenging... the game is hard... the game is going to make you hate yourself. The appeal of the game is how unforgiving it is. There are fights you are going to lose a lot like A LOT. You are going to get 1 shot by bosses. Nothing is really explained thoroughly lots of trial and error. Gear is going to be overwhelming there are many different combinations and almost everything is viable. Most people are going to think these reasosn are all negatives but the feeling of accomplisment that will wash over you after you kill that one giant boss thats been kicking your teeth down your throat for 3 hrs is going to be amazing. Then just rinse and repeat a few dozen times make some armor from the bones of your enemies 10/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,game need help with the online part every other game i have works perfectly fine but this one me and my friends have problems with the servers,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,81,False,Recommended,OVERVIEWGreat game still has some connection issues in multiplayer but nothing nearly as bad as people are saying and it by no means makes the game unplayable. If you like monster hunter you are going to love this game but if you're new to the series then the best way to explain it is cooperative 1 4 player bloodborne esque combat against a variety of huge monsters. the game itself is a loop of hunt monsters gather items craft better gear with what you gain from hunting and then repeat. Improvements on past iterationsThe biggest improvement on the previous games in my opinion is the world. The entire thing is one continous level (no loading zones like the previous games) and everything feels like a part of the world. The monsters themselves really do feel like part of a real ecosystem within each of the 5 major maps nothing feels out of place. the monsters also interact with each other now they will attack each other and not just gangbang you like in previous games (a very welcome change). Sometimes the monsters will go into something called a turf war an event where the monsters will attack each other dealing free damage to your target. Crafting is more streamlined but in a good way. It is much easier to craft weapons you actually want with the new tree system as opposed to either just praying that the weapon line you picked was good or browsing the wiki for half an hour like in the previous games the showing the element of the weapon is also quite helpful. you can also grow plants which is nice.Things worse than the previous gamesone major thing. Bazelgeuse the flying deviljho with the ability to carpet bomb you. this thing will intrude on your quest all the time (it goes to any monster on the map that roars) and while its not impossible to drive off or kill by any means I find it more annoying that its intruding brother the big t rex pickle monster deviljho.Another thing the gathering hall. the gathering hall is a complete ghost town thanks to arena quests being horrible (as always) and the map design of the hub area being too rich in resources to not be in all the time.Connection issuesYes there are connection issues but they don't really impede your ability to play the game or play with others. if you can't get into a lobby with matchmake then you can always do filter search or make your own and then do sos quests. if you really want to play the game there isn't much stopping you. As long as you are okay with reconnecting every couple hours then there is no need to whine about the multiplayer. The issues themselves seem to be with the steam friends UI and the game should be fixed soon until then It shouldn't be too hard for us to just deal with it for a while.Control issuesfor context I play on keyboard and not controller. Quite honestly the default controls are not great but you can rebind everything in the options menu so it isn't really a problem what annoys me is that the radial menu is completely worthless until you change it in the menu's because its set for controllers. Like capcom could it really be that hard to have it autodetect which type of controller is being used and then have the radial menu work from there its a stupid design oversight.OverallGreat game definitely the best in the mh series. if you're looking for a challenging (not unfair) game that you are willing to sink some hours into then this game is for you. Note this game is definitely not for everyone if you don't like the core gameplay loop of killing and using the parts to upgrade then you will not like this game. Its also good to remember that there are 16 different weapon types if you don't like one then try another. most of the weapons in the game will grow on you but you need to take the time to learn their strengths are controls.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Plenty of content subpar plot but it makes up for it with amazing gameplay. The different weapons you can use suits almost every kind of player. online needs some polishing but at the core of it it's fine. Best game I've played in a while,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Pros This game carries over all the good parts of the Monster Hunter series and conveniently smoothens or eases the parts that were at times frustrating.All the little things like gathering herbs while walking instead of a 3s animation swapping weapons on the hunt crafting wishlists make this game by far the most enjoyable of the series.And the graphics are amazing! The world feels alive now and the monsters feel so much more monster y as well.Cons I have not had issues with it myself but lots of players mention server connection issues sometimes even in singleplayer(which is still an online session but a private one).These issues have plagued the console release as well where they were fixed shortly after launch.There are also lots of mentions about mouse acceleration although this is a game like Dark Souls. Mouse works but it is not really intended for it. This game is meant to be played with a gamepad.Overall I would say this game is definitely enjoyable right now.If you planned to play with some buddies and don't want to deal with potential multiplayer issues give it a week or two and the issues should be fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If not there's a learning curve and don't expect DMC speed action but it's a rewarding and now gorgeous (after playing on the 3DS for years) experience that's even better on PC.

2018-08-12,0,0,207,False,Recommended,Would highly recommend this game. It is absolutly fantastic and something you get lost in for hours. There are some issues but a lot of people also do little to no research you can fix the biggest issue which is the connection issure by simply opening the ports on your router. Type it into google not that difficult to follow step by step instructions. It will get fixed eventually anyway honestly I'm shocked the game has handled the intial release this well all things considered I'd say it's pretty damn good. There are a couple graphic bugs and someother things I'm 100% positive CapCom is going to address in the future as it is. Being as it is a Port it really is done pretty damn well and runs fine for myself after doing the port fix for the connectivity issues. Don't let these bs not recommended reviews based solely on the connection and simple issues that really don't affect the game sway you from trying this game. I promise once you start playing it you'll love every minute of it. I run this game at 1440p at basically the highiest settings except the typical things I'd disable anyway. I turned off the Volumetric fog detail I hate how that looks on any game period. Shadows to low like always. V Sync off and turned off SH detail or w/e never really saw a difference with that on high low or off besides some fps. The only place so far I've noticed any noticable fps drops are where everyone does at Rotten Vale. Keep it mind the game only came out 3 days ago it's going to vastly improve in the next few months as it is. CapCom isn't going to just ignore the issues it has right now and move on. The main issue is the connectivity issue which until CapCom patches it has a simple fix that can be done within 10 15minutes max sure it's annoying to have to do it but well worth it. I've had no issues connectivity wise since I've done it.My Build MSI Optix MPG27CQ 1440p 144hz 1ms monitor.

All this aside this game is really amazing for both Monster Hunter veterans and newcomers. That being said this game is very repetitive but in a good way (so beware if you don't enjoy modest grind). Hunting HUGE! monsters is what this game is all about and what you will be doing 97% of the time and it is fun. You are going to need to learn the monsters moves and avoid them learn their weak spots for big damage learn their background and more! From these hunts you get materials that you use for making and upgrading your gear... and yeah that is the core gameplay!

2018-08-09,0,0,337,False,Recommended,First impressions The game looks good runs smooth and has not had any bugs/crashes so far. I use a 1050Ti and an i5.Edit1 (after 40 hrs of gameplay) I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME. Just started my second character who will be using a completely different playstyle from my first. Can't wait to see what DLC gets launched in the future. This game was definitely worth my money. I mostly play single player (I don't really need help to kill any monster). So I do not experience any of the multiplayer issues that people are complaining about.Edit2 90 hrs in and i have just started getting to the best parts of the game (end game). So....much........content......Can't wait for more paid dlc cuz i really wanna give these devs more moneyEdit3 I should also mention my main negative point for this game....the keyboard bindings are awful and you cannot rebind some of the important buttons (like F1). If you have a controller use it. I don't have one but I am somehow managing with a keyboard and mouse.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-12,0,0,282,False,Recommended,if this game looks interesting to you and you have a beefy enough computer to run it then definetly check it out and at worst just refund it after 2 hours if you dont like it. mh world is an amazing game especialy for new people to get into the series (liek me D) tons of unique monsters to fight and things to do will keep you playing for ages. controler is strongly recomended. i havent been able to test out multiplayer with friends so i cannot comment on what that is like but from what i have seen this game is 10/10 and is a serious contender for my goty,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,49,False,Recommended,Many people are commenting about the game s poor performance and terrible controls with the mouse and keyboard. While I agree that this is a problem I think the larger issue at hand is that Capcom ported a multiplayer co op game to PC and the connectivity is completely broken. For this reason alone the game deserves a negative review.I ll update this review if Capcom ever decides to roll out an update to fix the connectivity problems.EDIT Per 23/08/2018 it seems they've released a patch that fixed the connection issues. I've updated my review accordingly. If for some reason the patch doesn't work as suggested this review will be changed back to negative.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Combat system is clunky at best. The game is nothing but grinding and is very repetitive with no real progression other than your weapons doing slightly more damage and your armor being a little bit better. If thats what you're into then this is a great game but I personally find it very boring. I have played a lot of other games that people would consider nothing but grinding such as MMORPGs but at least in MMORPGs your character changes and what you can do in the game changes as you progress through the game but this game stays the pretty much the same you just deal more damage and fight different things.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Fantastic game. end game mechanics are extremly satisfying. The grind for better gear different builds and experimentation is very fun. Learning how to combat counter and approach each fight ads a fantastic variable to the gameplay to prevent anything from ""getting old"". The port is well done. However the massive CPU drain is pretty annoying. However that can be countered by lowering the settings. this is where i feel ike it isnt a big deal. lowering the settings really doesnt seem to impact visuals but will greatly help your FPS things like shadow and Volume Rendering seem to have zero impact on visuals but greatly improve visuals.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,184,False,Recommended,Changing my review to positive most of the issues have been fixed after some patches I don't haven't had the game crash in over 40h if you get it do backup your saves just in case.Old Cannot recommend until the random crashes are fixed worked fine for 6 7h since then game crashes every 20 45 min when it gets past the title card screen ( the one at the beginning after the capcom logo ) this also means that most crashes will happen before the game saves because this happens at the beginning and end of missions so not only do you not play each time you launch the game but you might crash while playing and losing all progress,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-13,0,0,197,False,Recommended,As an avid fan of the MH series I'm glad to say that this has been one of the best to play thus far. TLDR I recommend this game to anyone with a computer that can actually run it (see elaborations below).No Issues Running It operates smoothly on my rig and doesn't have any issues running via internet. Honestly I've heard bad reviews based on in game performance which just makes me wonder what these people are running. If you're not paying attention to the minimum specs all I have to say is if your PC/laptop is or not up to date then that's your own fault for thinking the game would run on it. If you don't exceed the minimum specs of course it's going to be a bother having the game run even at base settings. It's meant to be a lavish and immersive game environment that has beautiful graphics (quasi )intelligent AI and a good RT tracking system of each and every entity in the world. So rather than recommend this game to anybody and their cousin I suggest carefully making sure that your rig or laptop is suited for a graphics and process intensive game.Controls Honestly this comes down to what you prefer. As someone who avidly believes in mouse and keyboard I'm actually really enjoying using my logitech controller with this. The controls are best suited for controllers imo but that's not to say the mouse&amp keyboard controls are lacking. I found that both are exceptionally suited for this style of gameplay so pick and choose.Variability I would say that this game offers a wide amount of variability and replay value based on the 14 weapon types and multitude of monsters. Additionally the difficulty of the AI scales nicely as you gain more momentum. The main draw for me is that there is always a bit of a challenge to working with the monster environment weapon and armour pro's and con's and logistical planning that goes into each hunt. It's always been the centerpiece of MH since it's creation since allowing players the freedom to mix and match playstyles against monsters makes the game interesting and inventive. If you master one weapon you can pick up another. If you are bored with one type of monster or environment choose another. If it's not challenging enough go up in rank/leave your companions behind (including el gato)/scale back your armour or weapons (not recommended but that's up to you).Community There's an excellent community for this game which means that (1) you're never short on teammates necessarily (2) if you don't understand something or want to explore your options there are several publishers for decent guides etc (3) the community doesn't punish you per se for being new or having an off game. On top of that Capcom's invested a lot into this game for it's fans so you're treated fairly well with the game in terms of deserving it's A Rating and continual development and release of content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,MONSTER HUNTER WORLD (PORT) Right now at release date August 10th 2018 MHW launch seems rough around the edges. Far from perfect and also far from gamebreaking (the game DO work!) but the no ultrawide screen monitor support is really irritating to this modern gaming times. While the game got such a great launch on consoles back in January 2018. I was awaiting this game pretty much and it was the main reason I skipped the console version because the PC version was confirmed. Now that this PORT is out I'm disappointed on how it turned out to be.Not gamebreaking but MHW has a few irritating weaknesses Frame rate drops Loss of sound during some scenes 'Floating' Mouse look AND MOST ANNOYING lack of support for ultrawide PC monitors (No Ultrawide 3440 x 1440 21 9 support).It was also reported that the gamepad is barely supported (if at all).OVERALL I'll put this game on 'HOLD' for the time being. I cannot get refund 'cause GMG so I'm willing to give this another shot once the game is fixed... especially the mouse look and ultrawide support.I'd suggest you wait before buying Monster Hunter World!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-06,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Great MH game bad port.Any fan of the franchise is definitely going to enjoy this game it has a lot of incredible things going for it and the battles are as exciting and fun as they have always been.I'm not very far into this game yet but I feel a great urge to express something that has been bugging me since minute one The port is in my opinion very poor to be specific what annoys me so much is that pretty much every menu in the game was translated 1 1 from the console version apparently optimizing the game for keyboard and mouse has been completely disregarded by the porters there are many menus which I feel are very unintuitive and unnecessarily complicated to use which is a very frustrating experience also the default button mappings are very questionable and initially irritating. I almost feel as though the developers are constantly flipping me off for not using a controller.So if you play this game you will definitely enjoy it a lot more with a game pad. Considering you are paying 60 bucks for a game that was released for the PC platform there has not been much thought put into the port at all and to me the quality of the port is a disappointment even if I am just singling out the aspect of interface/usability. It really does sadden me as I do want to like the game.Well I'm not a big enough to not recommend the game just for the reasons mentioned. It's still probably the best MH game to date. If you are stubborn enough and willing to deal with the BS UX this game provides for keyboard/mouse players you will have a great time playing this game. Maybe get it on a sale or something.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Great game. New to the franchise but I played this for 250+ hours on PS4 and enjoying starting from scratch on PC. Only complaints are the lack of updates and connectivity fixes present in the console versions not being implemented for PC release and the lack of PS4 controller support (at least for button prompts being in PS4 layout and some of the controls being swapped).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Where can I start with Monster Hunter World this is something I've been waiting for ever since I was introduced to the series.The game runs well for the most part on PC sure there's some graphical problems that cause slow downs but even for a five year old system I've been getting a good solid frame rate which is appealing for me at the very least and definitely playable. I can't agree with the negative reviews saying not to purchase as I've had a far greater experience so far. I've just about made it to High Rank quests at 30 Hours and I can't see myself stopping for a while whether I'm hunting on my own or alongside friends. Negatives are of course part of every launch and I'd expect that they'll be polished out after a few weeks the biggest to plague my experience as of right now is an Error 12 which causes the game to temporarily lock up before crashing I believe this is related to Graphical errors. A couple times I've had disconnection problems whilst playing with friends but honestly I'd still very much recommend buying as it is absolutely playable.Ignore the Mixed Reviews pick this game up if you've enjoyed the rest of the series or even if you're a newcomer you won't be disappointed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The PC Port has some inherent Issues but that should improve with some patches. Sometimes the game crashes randomly. The mouse input is strange they have not implemented raw mouse input. You eventually get used to the mouse input and the random crashes are rare for me so im satisfied.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But I'm new to Monster Hunter so I didn't have many expectations. Still having a great time playing with friends or solo. I don't see myself putting this game down any time soon.Cons Randomly disconnecting from sessions is a big issue right now. If you disconnect in the middle of a quest it won't let you rejoin it with your friends again. I feel like it would be a more manageable issue if it at least let you do that.The menus are VERY awkward on mouse and keyboard. It's just lazily remapped controller buttons.

2018-08-25,0,0,298,False,Recommended,My first foray into Monster Hunter games and I'm hooked! I don't normally play anything close to this nor have I ever gotten into Dark Souls but I can't get enough of MHW.There's a lot of content so many weapons to diversify in and the gameplay is satisfying. A lot of grinding however the actual gameplay and taking down monsters is what keeps everything interesting. Learning monsters their habits and movesets is quite rewarding and the grinding comes naturally. Not only that there's a considerable amount of depth to the weapons and building your armor around your playstyle.Myself and my friends encountered multiple semi sporadic issues with the online connection problems that are so widely known but the latest patch has fixed what few issues/disconnects we encountered. Some people are still having issues for some reason possibly of no fault of their own so beware!Simply put I love this game and I warmly embrace the idea of more MH games coming to PC and overseas.NOTE The typical 2 hour trial/refund time on Steam is not going to accurately portray the game as there are a lot of unskippable cutscenes near the beginning. I would recommend reading up a little on the game and watching monster fights then going ahead with the 2 hour refund policy to try it if it sounds fun while trying to squeeze in whatever gameplay you can. Pros Short load times (at least on a PCI E SSD though a friend with only a regular SSD has good times as well)So many weapon types and they're all unique with branching crafting trees!A lot to do many quests side quests exploration gathering/mining/collecting creature collecting melding augmenting jewels... the list goes on.Some of the fights feel pretty epic. Lava spewing up/splashing crystals crashing into the ground monsters fighting each other for dominance...Even on low settings a pretty game. And it runs surprisingly well on my FX 6350 + 4GB 970 with a constant 60 FPS at all times at 1080p with mid high settings. (Use Nvidia drivers 398.36 if you have an older computer and FPS issues!)If you must soloing everything (at least thus far) isn't that big of a hurdle. Even easier than playing with others depending on your group. I came into the game expecting it to demand 4 player groups but I solo'd many monsters before I even got into a group.Cons Semi awkward and clunky KB/M controls at times (only primarily with bows/ranged weapons)NPCs always talk (and you can skip this but you have to mash mouse/controller buttons) before you can access interactions/menus with them even if you just talked to them.Monsters tend to hit you just by moving and bumping into you and it's frustrating. Not entirely unfair given their size just annoying at times given how much damage it can cause.MP lobbies are a little clunky but it also has benefits like re queueing into a new quest without leaving a zone and being able to swap gear/items while out of town.Some textures are inexplicably low quality like (I think only male?) male armor. I'm sure this will be rectified by the devs but there's also an unofficial mod that fixes this. Only noticed when really peering at armors though.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,154,False,Recommended,I very highly recommend playing this game if you are a fan of action rpgs or hack and slash games.Ignore what the negative reviews are saying it hasn't even been out for a week yet. Once some time passes I'm sure the majority of people's complaints will be addressed. There are issues with this PC port however this PC port was done by a team that has never done a PC port of a game before. So keep that in mind before jumping on the bandwagon and review bombing it.There are some issues like I said. Not being able to edit things like field of view and motion blur is a justifiable complaint. Giving the game a negative review over bad servers isn't justifiable yet. Give it another week or two and see how the servers end up then. There *is* a fix out on the MHW reddit that apparently fixes the DCing problem so if you do problems with disconnecting look into that fix.Out of my hours I've spent so far I've had almost no lag and ran at a solid 60 FPS.

2018-09-09,0,0,189,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World Rating 5/5 Favorite game Monster Hunter World not quite perfect but playable and fun nonetheless as long as your computer can handle it.GameplayI absolutely love the gameplay in Monster Hunter World.I've played a couple of the other games in the series on 3DS MH Generations and MH 4 Ultimate. MH World is like the other games I've played but the main selling point for me is that it's available on a platform that is popular among my friends therefore making it easy for me to play with them. The multiplayer in the other games I've played was pretty bad. You had to physically be next to the person you wanted to play with and connect to their game locally which doesn't really work that well when almost none of my friends had a 3DS.MH World lets you connect to people over the internet simple as that.The part I enjoy the most in any Monster Hunter game has been the gearing. Crafting new weapons and armor from monster materials to be able to face even stronger monsters to get stronger materials to craft better weapons and armor and so on. Getting your hands on the highest ranked armors and weapons is a very satisfying goal to try reaching.Technical DifficultiesI haven't had to make any adjustments to my computer settings for this game to work properly I played as it was after launching it the first time.My experiences with Monster Hunter World on PC have mostly been positive. From time to time I've had connection issues that seem to happen because of alt tabbing which puts the game out of focus and from time to time this disconnects me from the session. I've managed to play through the entire game with a friend with no apparent connection issues except for this.I've had some slight fps drops during graphics heavy sections of the game but this have not ruined the experience for me.SummaryAll in all Monster Hunter World is a game I highly recommend!If you've enjoyed the Dark Souls series I think you'll find a lot of similarites in this game especially in controls and fighting.Also a high tolerance for grinding is something I think you'd need to fully enjoy the experience since you might start feeling like the rarer materials don't actually exist.The technical problems this game has aren't as bad as they were on release. Playing this game day one had me and my friend constantly disconnect from eachother whereas today this only happens when our computers act up. The problems this game has are constantly being fixed to the point where playing this game today with friends should work without any problems as long as your computer can handle the game itself.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Alas I'm just a peasant but honestly it runs fine with medium high setting with 900p on my AMD A8 6600 with gtx660 and 8GB of ram. No issue but yeah rendering is somewhat as expected from old rig is not with the speed of light.I agree with multiplayer issue. It's hard to join multiplayer session though the other way around is that you can create your own multiplayer session but with no one join you can only help those who send out sos flare. I would really like dev team to fix this ASAP.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,62,False,Recommended,MH has been a niche game ever since it became popular with MHFU in the PSP veterans will know that having the series penetrate the console and PC market will greatly expose the niche and make it a respectable category/style of game. I do admit that it is not for the casual gamer and it doesn't cater to every individual that likes to play games. But if it hooks you you'll get hooked real good.If you love playing raid boss type experiences especially in MMORPGames you'll surely love this if you're new to the series. The game's core concept is simple prepare hunt loot repeat. It seems repetitive at first but every hunt is not the same and that what keeps MH players coming back. The game can be played solo but it is recommended as a co op experience and the series have made the experience immersive and extremely enjoyable (especially with friends).It is EXTREMELY recommended to play with a controller the M&amp KB controls are a bit unomptimized for the genre.**at the time of this review the multiplayer service is a bit iffy connectivity is very unstable and this may be due to unoptimized servers at Capcom I am hoping that it would be better eventually it has only been 2 days since the release.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you are a huge fan of this game or a huge fan of PVM games then this is the game you have dreamed of! and it is absolutely worth to spend 60 bucks for this game since it is awsome even its contents are awsome too! ENJOY!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,269,False,Recommended,From what I've already seen its the usual standard for a new Monster Hunter installment even if it is a bit of a 'do over' for the series. Beyond the much larger and open maps and the fancy new animations for things here and there there's new monsters the weapons' moveset has been increased a majority of quality of life improvements like faster gathering and more infomation on various aspects in game instead of in a wiki just the sort of things that always helps to bring MH to a more accessable to people who may have been turned off before if they haven't already been turned off the series entirely.Port is...okay the hub and cutscenes are significantly more intensive FPS wise than the actual gameplay on the quests themselves most likely due to the increased amount of NPCs though I think I'am just under the minimum requirements and can get fluctuate a bit between 20 30 FPS on 800x640/w lowest settings so take that as you will. Resolution can go even lower then that though all to 640x480 but you also have to deal with letterboxing and unreadable text for most things.Also CAPCOM give us the ability to turn off that motion blur the depth effects and the bloom if you're gonna keep that Denuvo DRM its the least you could do.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-20,0,0,161,False,Recommended,Firstly this game is incredible. The graphics are amazing even on low settings the maps are huge and vibrant the game's monsters have excellent AI and even have premade interactions when they see each other (they might fight each other instead of just targetting you like it was in previous games this is really cool to see!) combat is tight and every one of the weapons I've tried are unique and viable in their own way. If you're not liking the combat I urge you to try a different weapon it completely changes how hunts go down!I will say that the optimisation isn't the best but it's not as bad as people are making it out to be. I for one have the same specs as the recommended ones for this game and I hover around 50 60fps at close to max settings. This isn't just a PC issue the PS4 Pro/Xbox One X also struggle to hit 60fps even at performance settings. I would like to see Capcom update this game to add some extra optimisation though especially in some late game fights in which monsters have the ability to decrease your framerate to 30fps (a deadly attack!).The online issues have been mostly fixed since launch but I haven't had a completely smooth experience. In general I don't particularly like the online features in this game compared to previous ones in the series while it's quick to get in a quest with people there's almost no social interaction at all. Maybe this is for the best though considering toxicity in modern gaming lol.Overall I highly recommend you try this game. It has a bunch of both added and streamlined features which make game better for both veterans and newcomers alike. At last a Monster Hunter game for PC!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,87,False,Recommended,I played over 500 hours on PS4 and got this on PC too because I'm mainly a PC gamer and most of my friends play on PC.I'd like to list some of the common issues as well as my view on them. Mouse acceleration The game seems to emulate controler input when using a mouse while this is not the same as mouse acceleration it's still a little bit jarring to people who have only played on PC however since this is not a competitive FPS game and most people will be playing melee weapons I don't think it's nearly as big a deal as many reviews claim. Having said that I expect to see this fixed in the near future. Denuvo While I agree DRM like Denuvo is bad for users and hurts the relationship between game studios and their paying customers many of the issues people claim are caused by denuvo are highly exagerated if not entirely false. Lack of graphics options It would be nice to have DOF and motion blur options in the game but they're both very subtle in this game compared to many console ports. If you weren't looking for problems to point out you wouldn't notice. Ultra wide support Would be nice to see this in a 2018 release game but it's something that can be patched in with relative ease. FPS issues If you're unable or unwilling to read recommended specs or adjust in game settings why are you playing on PC in the first place? Connection issues This is very bad right now. On average one or more of my friends will DC every 3 4 missions. We think there's a loose correlation between DCing and alt tabbing but are unsure of it's actually real. There are some things that are very good about this version compared to console unlocked FPS mouse control (especially for guns) extremely fast load times even on a HDD much easier to find others to play with due to steam group integration and Discord workshop support PC is a very easy platform to patch games on and add content to Can use your preferred control method instead of just the controller that works with your console and switch around seemlessly.Overall I think this game is good in it's current state and with a few patches and changes could have very minimal issues. I played this game almost every day on my PS4 and the port is good enough that I probably won't be playing it on PS4 anymore unless there are more exclusives such as the DMC stuff.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Game is absolutely amazing. However there are ALOT of issues pertaining to the PC port which include random Multiplayer Connection issues and a poorly build UI for non controller players.

2018-08-12,0,0,50,False,Recommended,This game has been so awesome so far. The port isn't perfect (mostly network issues) but it is so much fun and sounds like it runs better than the console versions. I'm playing on a Nvidia GTX 1060 6gb with an i5 4590 and it's running at a stable 60 fps for me with minor adjustments to the settings. If you're a fan of games with a ton of replay value can enjoy possibly replaying different things or trying to hunt down specific monsters for particular upgrades that you really want and limitless co op options along with the pace of this games combat and preparation systems this is fantastic. There is nothing else that comes close to this for me on PC. Toukiden and Dark Souls kind of scratch a similar itch but there's something different about Monster Hunter that those games have never been able to reach for me.It's got a pretty interesting story so far and the game looks absolutely beautiful to me. The changes that have been made to make the game more accessible are really neat too. Things like no longer having to equip a map not having to worry about using paintballs to tag monsters so you can track them between zones the fact that each zone is one big world and even the concept of these larger online lobbies is awesome. They've put a lot of work into making this game and this port great and I think it shows. I'm only using a 16 9 monitor so I can't speak for ultra widescreen or super high refresh rates but I really do think this is truly special and worth a look if it sounds interesting.I am a gigantic Monster Hunter fan but the only current gen console I have is a Switch. I bought the japanese version of MHXX on Switch thinking it was the only new Monster Hunter game that was going to happen. Shortly afterwards they announced MHW with a PS4 Xbox One and later PC release date. I've been waiting all year for this moment constantly checking the release date and I am so happy this game is on PC running as well as it is and even though it currently has a mixed score there are consistently over 200 000 players online. That is insane and it's like I'm watching my baby go out into the wild and getting the opportunity to see how well it's being embraced by old players and newcomers alike.I'm looking forward to see what kinds of patches they do in the future but besides the network issues this is so cool.

Fingers crossed this continues as the game is truly great fun.EDIT After a couple of days' testing it seems that the disconnection errors are a thing of the past I have yet to suffer a disconnection during a multiplayer hunt and can now play this awesome game without worrying about having a multiplayer upscaled monster to fight solo.There are still issues regarding mouse and keyboard but these are being addressed and now that the multiplayer issues have been addressed I am confident that other issues Capcom have taken note of will be fixed in the fullness of time.

Plug in a Dualshock 4 or an Xbox One controller without needing 3rd party applications is a huge plus. Very nice. The console community has had issues with content because it has been pretty slow. Hopefully PC doesn't get drip fed too slowly.All in all the game is very nice. The port is standard and functional and until Denouvo is cracked some computers will have preformance issues.Edit After ""finishing"" the game and defeating the main boss as shown from the beginning of the game.This game is relatively quick minus the optional quests. This is an issue because older titles built hours because optional quests used to be mandatory and you would progress through the quest. Scaling feels off. Monsters seem to easy and can be killed fairly quickly. A hunt with whatever you just slap onto yourself takes about 5 10 minutes at best if you account for collecting items here and there and not using buffs to make it even quicker. Tempered monsters bring close to nothing to the table but bring in the end game decorations system. Interesting but hopefully G rank will come soon during the Winter or content will be very dry very fast.Edit 2 High rank. Killed the other bosses and finished the story fun game. Game was patched 8/22 for connection issues so its nice to see that capcom hasn't abandoned us with a meh port until their next dlc release. Content is now starting to shorten up and the endgame bosses are fairly easy. A few performance drops with but all in all fun game. I await for more updates.The Game? 10/10 Feels great to play on controller. Haven't bothered with KBM but after playing DS3 on KBM I don't feel bothered to do it.The story? 6/10 I personally feel it detracts from what made the series fun but I suppose it makes it more approachableThe monsters? 7/10 They feel very simple. I never carted the whole game. In fact I've failed only one missions and thats because I killed something too fast for a capture mission. The game is just so much easier compared to previous titles so its not a hard game to get into. Even with HR there are very few variants between them and the only variant is . The turf wars are very fun but hopefully G rank ramps up the games difficultyPerformance issues? I've had 5 crashes and a few performance hits in the span of 60 hours which isnt terrible. It mainly was because I was messing around with settings and the one time it affected my gameplay I had saved anyway. Sadly enough it was enough to make me paranoid and save at every moment I get. Not good.Overall? I still recommend the game. If the issues get fixed I'll greatly recommend you try the game. Until the game has more content then I'll highly commend this game for being one of the best games I've played in a while which isn't very high praise as the games industry has really soured out but eh. Gotta take what you can.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-24,0,0,91,False,Recommended,Coming from a series veteran since the days of using the right analog stick for attacks World is definitely a game that takes the series and flips it on its head while keeping certain series staples and mechanics intact. Some are good some are eh a couple are garbage but overall it's overall one of the best in the series.People coming from games such as Vindictus PSO2 Dark Souls will feel right at home in this style of game. Attacking dodging blocking are all standard and in World are much more fluid and snappier than previous games. You have a choice between 14 weapons 11 melee and 3 ranged. All the weapons build upon the typical attack/dodge mechanics in different ways that almost feel like an entirely new game when you swap to another. GameplayThe core gameplay loop is extremely simple but still fun. Grab starter weapons slay your first boss use the body parts to upgrade those weapons and/or armor (for you veterans who stuck with Leather) use your stronger weapon to slayer stronger monster repeat. The game does throw a slight curveball about halfway through the game when you exit Low Rank and enter High Rank in which you repeat the previous content however the bosses do adjust accordingly. They tend to move faster hit harder their AI is adjusted to be much more aggressive while taking much more damage to take down let alone stun/break parts etc. Sadly no Palico gameplay. Armor wise while don't upgrade pieces into another piece like weapons you CAN utilize armor spheres to boost the defense level to make things slightly easier on your end. Don't be afraid to use these as later on your earlier tiers will be hilariously useless compared to the amount needed for 1 level of Rare 8 armor pieces.Contrary to earlier games World has very little gathering quests and gathering items in general. You have the choice of setting out on Expeditions to the areas you unlock to gather items or utilizing the farm. Expeditions while a fun idea tend to stop being useful as you near the end game. Monsters simply aren't worth hunting in there as you miss out on potential quest rewards. You do get rewards from the Handler but they're arguably nowhere near as good as Investigations. Good luck getting a gem from them. As for item farming most players in the beginning will be heavily using the Expedition system but overtime as you complete side quests (Optionals in game) you'll be upgrading your player farm to be able to farm all these items without need to venture out as well as farm slots and the ability to farm multiple items at one time and at the very end you'll be able to have all your farm buffs active for up to 9 quests at one time. The Optionals mentioned above are not only used for unlocking farmable items but also the new equipment that come in World Mantles and Boosters. Some players tend to be split on whether they like them or not the choice is up to you however they do serve a decent purpose for players. Both are items you activate with a fairly sizeable cooldown and grant you special affects that let you ignore flinching/knockbacks boost affinity of you and your party members heal allies in an area and so on. You'll be unlocking these all the way into endgame so be sure to complete the side quests to ensure you stay up to date on your unlocks. The meat of the game however isn't tied to Optionals but Investigations. You unlock them via multiple ways farming tracks murdering animals and monsters or even breaking their faces and tails or other fun body parts. You can hold up to 250 Investigations but can only have 50 active at one time. Investigations range from 1* all the way up to 9* difficulty and are arguably the primary way of farming monsters for more loot. They'll have special requirements attached to them such as limited deaths smaller time limits limited party size etc. But as always with risk comes reward and Investigations will also come with 2 5 extra items indicated at the bottom of the quest information screen. The difficulty of the investigation (usually) tends to influence the rewards harder ones will grand 1 or more gold item slots with much higher chances of rare items while easier might only max out with silver or even bronze item slot chances. PerformanceProbably the biggest issue with the game isn't the gameplay but the performance of it. Overall it's fine if you are willing to turn options down or even off. That being said even with some turned off the game does look very very good especially if you're coming from the 3DS games or even moreso if you stopped in the PSP/2 era. I personally run an i5 6600k OC'd to 4.2 16gb of ram an RX480 with 8gb of VRAM and have the game running on an SSD and tend to stay at a consistant 60fps in fights. Unfortunately Capcom did screw some things up such as Thunder element annihilating FPS for almost all users and Nvidia users having issues in the Rotten Vale on the newest driver. Depth of Field Motion Blur and other gimicks are unable to be turned off however can be modded off using Kaldaien's Special K tool with ReShade however it's unknown how long this will continue to work due to him discontinuing the project due to Capcoms ineptitude coding and awful anti debug garbage going on (that being said a huge thanks out to him for the work what he's done so far has been huge in making the game better to play). Overall the port isn't terrible it's miles better than a lot of other JRPG developers have pushed out. It does have issues but hopefully they'll continue ironing them out. It does need to be said though this is the first time for the MH team to develop for the PC version and it shows. In their attempts for visual parity it also seems they aimed for framerate parity as well and the FPS issues seem to make more sense if you look at it from the idea they were aiming for 30fps not 60. This is unfortunately a console mindset and hopefully they'll continue working on it and begin to understand that PC users do tend to want more out of their games. Only time will tell. Connection issues were rampant on release however with the new patch released on the 23rd apparently have been fixed (Disclaimer I never had issues with it so I can't confirm). Sadly that's all the patch targetted and it still isn't completely fixed and has created a weird issue regarding SOS flares. I've worked around by simply narrowing the search requirements to specifically what I want to hunt.Pros Gameplay Best graphical quality in the series Multitude of weapons ensuring that almost anyone who enjoys action games will find one they enjoy or several. Decent amount of monsters to hunt 31 total. Not the most in the series (Play MHGU on the Switch if you want that) but not the least amount that honor still goes to Tri's awful 18. Interconnected maps no more loading screens between areas Ability to change weapons refill items inside your tent while on quests Tempered Monsters are your endgame so you're not stuck farming easy normal elders in end game these will tear you a new one if you're unprepared. Free DLC monsters incoming such as Deviljho Kulve Taroth Lunastra Behemoth from the Final Fantasy series and rumored Orochi Kirin and Alatreon.Cons Major performance issues. Some might argue it's due to the nature of a massive map with open world tracking etc however even top of the line PCs seem to be having issues hitting 60fps at 1080p. Mid grade PCs should be able to hit 60fps on 1080p at High for console parity. SOS issues will hopefully be fixed Soon Overall I recomend the game even with the flaws. However I cannot stress enough that players check performance in the 2 hour refund limit due to the performance/network issues.

2018-08-17,0,0,429,False,Recommended,After a few days without too many connection issues I think it is safe to say that Capcom has fixed the connection issues. It was too little too late however as my friends and I had already beaten the game in its entirety. I hope any future releases will get the foresight they deserve when it comes to servers especially seeing as servers can always be repurposed. With that out of the way Capcom did deliver on great game content and a beautiful and challenging experience. The gameplay feels entirely original to me and the concept is brilliant. The monster designs are incredible and the combat system is near perfect. The menus and item bar can be a bit clunky until you get used to them but the leveling system feels incredibly rewarding and the weapons are brilliant and diverse. I'm definitely looking forward to the next Monster Hunter World for PC and hope the next time around the server issue doesn't resurface from poor planning or cheap corporate tactics whatever the case.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-03,0,0,235,False,Recommended,"I already bought this game on console so obviously like it. PC graphics are way better than Xbox and PS4 however this doesn't mean they're the greatest. That said the graphics are good enough to not take away from the gameplay and it's still way better looking than any Monster Hunter title before it. (Maybe not the old online one however I never got a chance to play it.)Anyway if you like Dark Souls crossed with a grind and without a great story you'll probably like this title. Meaning that's the one area this game fails the story sorta sucks. Still there's only 2 games in my 2 000 plus game collection not counting the 10 000 plus retro games I own that're better than ""Monster Hunter World"". That says a lot because I've got a lot a choices and one wouldn't think this would come in as a 3rd.My only disapointment is that this game is addictive and kills way too much time. A bit of a warning up front this game takes time. One thing to note is that while it currently doesn't require multi player if the go the console route it will for certain monsters. That said the game doesn't at all require another person and you can solo it. Will take the average person around 80 hours to ""beat"" the game.

2018-09-03,0,0,208,False,Recommended,"Being a long time MH player ever since the first came out I must say this game is literally everything I expected except for a few things which will probably get added quite soon ingame.First off graphics are flawless for this franchise past games always were either on DS PSP and stuff without decent enough graphics to make it enjoyable yet the content of the game itself and the gameplay made it all worthy and graphics just were a secondary thing however this game made it all look awesome. Detail in the enviroment and even small stuff is wonderfully made and I can pretty much say it's one of my 3 Fav. MH games so far.Gameplay for veterans it's easy to understand and play since it hasn't changed much weapons are even the same (which is a good thing and a downside at the same time hope they come up with something new someday anyways) most of the consumables are the same but crafting is made easier in this game you really don't have to make those hour long expeditions just for materials here you get to jump straight into the action without having to worry that much about consumables since even just clearing the story gives you a decent amount of mats. Another awesome thing is the play area back then everytime you wanted to move to a different area you just had to load the area itself in order to advance there however this game just made it a huge single map meaning it's less lost time due to that and you get to explore everything without issues. there's a lot that has improved ingame from the past MH games I can keep listing everything but it'd take forever.For newer players this game is quite newbie friendly woulnd't let a kid play since the mechanics are somewhat hard to understand (by kid I mean a 5yo for instance) and they'll probably just get frustrated and just leave the game but for anyone that's new to monster hunter the game is quite easy the difficulty escalates as your hunter rank does and everything is explained ingame and if something isn't you can pretty much just search for it online there's even a reddit made for this game if you want to check it out. Hunts are hard at first but my advice to new players is to play all of em on solo mode until the last boss to improve your dodging timing and knowledge of the game overall to avoid making it a frustrating experience for veterans or players with enough experience that's gotten that way. if you're doing all story hunts on group you'll probably end up lacking the knowledge it's needed to tempered hunts and will likely end getting killed and your whole team failing the hunt itself (since the times you can get killed on a tempered quest counts for all players the same it's not for each one). Aside that just learn from the game and search anything that's not familiar with you.The only current downside to the game is the amount of hunts that are available so far I was hoping for more monsters to hunt like the ""exclusive"" Harudomerugu Shah Dalamadur and stuff like that but I'm guessing they're gonna add those monsters at a later date or at least I hope so.Getting the PS/Xbox updates will be another awesome thing can't wait to beat Deviljho or even Lunastra mostly for their gear but still they're fun to hunt and new content is always welcome. and the FF event seems awesome aswell.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-03,0,0,250,False,Recommended,"Really fun game with a couple of caveats.The maps and monsters are interesting and challenging. There's a good bit of depth to the game with its crafting systems and equipment customization options not to mention the way different weapons work. But crafting will only get you so far as skill is also a factor. It's easy to spot who is a veteran and who isn't considering the way they use their weapons/tools/environment.One gameplay related info is that this is a slower paced game. Most of the time you aren't diving into a hunt and just taking out your target in a minute or 2 (unless you are geared to the teeth and hunting low rank monsters). You track a monster engage and wound it chase after it when it eventually runs disengage when another monster joins into the fight etc. Other than that attacking also feels sluggish to some because once you commit to swinging your sword or w/e weapon you have the attack animation cannot be cancelled in vast majority of cases. There's no ""oh snap I'm gonna get hit before connecting this attack spam dodge roll for days!"" in this game. You need to think before mashing attack on this one.Negatives of this game are mostly related to graphics and controls imo. The game simply needs more graphics options like FoV adjustments and some way to turn motion blur and depth of field off. There are also a couple of monster effects late game that just wreak havoc on fps for some reason no matter how strong your system is. Other than that controls can be a nightmare at first (for keyboard and mouse). You'll need to spend some time adjusting and readjusting everything a couple of times before things become manageable. There's also no direct mouse input option so the mouse acceleration makes it feel floaty and sluggish. Takes work and time to get used to... not fun.Overall positives way outweigh the negatives for me. Going through all the monsters alone gives you enough value for the money not to mention arena challenges upcoming free monster additions and multiplayer fun with friends. Hopefully they can patch out the issues with the game in time to make the whole package even better.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I been waiting for this game since it dropped on console months ago. I feel like that they made the game more easier and causal with its crafting systems and etc. The game felt much shorter than other monster hunter games and not as diverse in monsters. The game with its tutorial style questing made it seem more tedious for veterans but I knew this would be a lot of peoples first time playing as this used to be more of a niche game in the West. Where as in other monster hunter games you learn as you go or never finding out unless you read the help guide. The real grind of the game doesnt start until you get to the end credits where you then start farming for tempered monster and decorations. The only real issue with the game was the connectivity issue and the disconnects which made the monsters scale in difficulty.

If your computer is closer to the reccomended specs and you're not on the newest NVIDA drivers it should run very well. Basically don't try to run this on a budget PC right now. There are also serious issues with connections both to the main servers and to other players. Connecting to other people is a hassle tons of errors when trying to do so and once you are in multiplayer you will get dropped pretty often. If you're centering your experience around playing with others wait until this stuff gets fixed. The story and cuscenes are also garbage. But when it comes down to it they don't matter at all. We're not here to talk we're here to hunt monsters.If these issues are deal breakers for you put this on your wait list and we'll see where some updates get us to. If these aren't deal breakers then buy it. This game is more fun than I've had in years and easily one of my favorite games of all time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,281,False,Recommended,Played roughly 250hours of this game on PS4 and would've continuned playing if i wasnt trying to burn out before PC release to play with friends.That being said this one of the best games i've ever played. I personally have had little issues with disconnecting crashing and fps drops. However my buddies are having the above issues every now and then. If you can get past these two problems you'll have a blastPros great co op 14 weapons and every weapon feels like you're playing a different game somewhat difficult and challenging gameplay easily 100hr+ playtime free DLC every month adding new monsters/weapons lots of endgame content on ps4 that will hit PC relatively soon high amounts of min maxing builds to fight any monster and to customize how you play any weaponCons disconnect issues fps drops on certain computers occasional crashing,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,172,False,Recommended,MH W is an incredibly fun and action packed game filled to the brim with customization and strategy to make no two hunts the same. The game is aesthetically beautiful but can be very CPU intensive and the anti cheat requires a newer processor. Being a console to PC port also brings it's own problems including no raw mouse input and difficult keybindings (as of 8/12/18) but once you get used to it the game feels quite natural. Capcom has also improved the in game documentation and information system allowing you to easily see what gear to bring to each fight. Multiplayer is always fun but can be difficult to connect to friends especially in story mode. Overall the game has incredible combat that doesn't get old quickly while offering tons of choices with 14 different weapon types with over 50 weapons in each class as well as over a hundred armor pieces to choose from. Monster Hunter World is a rough gem and with some optimization will be a truly incredible game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,202,False,Recommended,RIght. This review is to clarify a few things about the various ranting posts as well as the overly OVERjoyed ones.As far as cons are concerned 1) Poor performance No issues if you have a decent rig (1080 or similar and above). Runs 100 fps solid on 2k screen.2) Bad keyboard control (?) and no mouse acceleration option Use controller. Game is designed to be enjoyed on a controller.3) Bad online connection Yep still an issue. Hopefully will be fixed as time passes by. Flares may not be there but you can always play with friends.As far as pros are concerned Well game is amazing it is one of the best ports I have ever seen. additionally as a regular on the series I can confirm that all the quality of life improvements and the open world feel did not come at the expense of the MH feeling from back then.P.S. I really hope we will get the stable connectivity soon. Cant wait for it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Let me preface this by saying this is my first Monster Hunter game. It does take a bit of tweaking to get the M+KB to feel natural and is extremely smooth with a controller. Despite the multiplayer and connection issues it is a great game. There are a lot of small details that you don't realize you missed until you start digging through forums for answers and realize just how in depth this game can get. All in all it's a blast but don't think you'll be able to just hop on for a minute or two. The intro/tutorial is almost an hour long and most of the hunts/expeditions will be 30+ minutes. If they fix the multiplayer and connection issues (that are extremely noticeable) then it will be a great port.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,139,False,Recommended,This game in not done for PC. I am a long term veteran playing since MHF2 and have been waiting for this moment for a very long time.I have played through the game on Xbox and have now gotten past the flagship monster essentially getting through the meat of the campaign on PC again.First and foremost the negatives This is a horrible horrible PC port for mouse+keyboard players especially because of the unchangeable mouse acceleration settings. I cannot stress this hard enough if you do not like playing with a controller and if you cannot stand motion blur and the somewhat typical shortcomings of console ports with the PC setting then this game simply is not ready for you. Add it to your wishlist check on it occasionally maybe get it for the steam Christmas sale but it s not ready today.To the positives IF you are ok with using a controller and have a reasonably beefy PC this experience blows the console version out of the water. Faster loading times unlimited fps faster joining online lobbies and games its fun and its amazing. Let no one tell you this is a bad port period because it runs like a dream. I have not experienced any bugs ever and maybe it s because I am in Europe but the servers have not let me down either although it does seem that looking for SOS Signals often yields very few results.There is too much to explain about how much of an upgrade this game is to previous titles and I am sure you will find great console reviews that can cover that part but in short this in the beginning of a new age for this franchise. I have confidence that the overwhelming success of this game will not be ignored by Capcom and that this game will get the overhaul patch it deserves as far as its controls are concerned. Personally I will keep playing this game on PC and am not disappointed one bit but that is only because I am used to playing this series with a controller/handheld console already and therefore have no issues to continue playing it this way.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-10,0,0,626,False,Recommended,I have never played any MH games before this. Though I hear a lot about it from my friends that played on PS4 and Xbox. TBH as a ''virgin'' to MH and playing this on PC for the first time I love it. Take your time immerse yourself in the environment. Hunt whenever wherever. I like the freedom and choices of quest investigations events etc that you can choose to do at your own leisure. I see many rush through the game to gain high rank levels some even hack to do it. No point wasting the money if you are not going to enjoy it. It's like ordering a Kobe Steak and finishing it in 1 bite. So for those that have never played any MH franchise this is worthwhile. Take your time and enjoy it slowly. As for connection issues I am writing this review on 10th Sept 2018. Havent had any connection issues playing online with others for 2 weeks now.

Updating this to a recommended status it's a great game!This is an amazing game.... When it works.I've played this game for hundred's of hours on console already but this port to the PC is just broken. It's nearly impossible to play in multiplayer right now as you get disconnected every 5 20 minutes can't join your friends and the co op system itself is a huge pain in the rear.I'm consistently having issues with getting into multiplayer hunts only to be disconnected and have to fight an enhanced monster on my own while my rewards are also cut down just because the hunt started with more players.

2018-08-23,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,Capcom needs to release a comprehensive patch that fixes a lot of the issues the game is having. There is still the bug of low resolution textures affecting everything from terrain to armor and weapons weird graphical issues all around throughout the game that marr just how good the game could look as a whole. The game is very demanding for how little improvement there is from the console version which leads to turning down settings on even powerful rigs that in theory should be able to max the game out no problem. Do I recommend the game? Yeah I do. It's THE best Monster Hunter game to date. Do I recommend it as it is? No. It is unnacceptable of Capcom to release a game in this state despite having delayed it by 6 months while also being behind on content when compared to the console version.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,308,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World is a pretty good addition to the Monster Hunter series. These are just my thoughts as someone who has already spent 100+ hours in MHW and has spent 1000s of hours cumulatively throughout the series. Pros Combat I'll take this over aiming on a PSP/3DS any day of the week lol really though the combos are really satisfying when you pull them off its alot more fluid and less stiff/rigid than the previous entries. Its a lot of fun for newer players and I hope this is the standard for future games in the series Hunting Areas I enjoy having one big area to hunt monsters in over separating the map into smaller separate areas that each have their own loading screen when you transition between them... The game is not a loading screen simulator Potion Drinkin I actually like the change where you can move while drinking your potion (if you dodge roll out of it you dont get the full heal though). I think it was kind of anti fun to stand perfectly still to instantaneously heal your HP and then lose all of it or get one shotted by a monster atleast with this change you can control when your wasting a potion as opposed to the monster just wasting all your gained health for you Armor Skills The armor skills were different in the previous games but I think I like how they turned out in MHW although it is simpler (having 1 skillpoint activates the skill and the bonuses increase for each 1 skillpoint) and there are no armor skill risks vs rewards (there arent any pieces of armor that subtract from skill points/no negative skills). Blademaster/Gunner Armor type unification OOOH controversy. Honestly I like just needing to make only one type of armor. I remember in MH4U I spent 500 hours to make G Rank armor sets for all my melee weapons. I really didnt like the fact that all that work and materials to make those armor sets was completely wasted when switching over to gunner weapons... This change gets a thumbs up from me Whetstone The whetstone is infinite use/special. I dont know why Capcom made whetstones a single use finite item in the first place so this is a good change The Scoutflies CONTROVERSY PT. 2.... Honestly I miss paintballing monsters to keep track of them but I think the actual gathering of monster footprints and markings adds to the whole ""Hunter"" part of Monster Hunter. It suits the game well so I'm putting this as a pro Poogie Neutral Lack of palico mode I cant play as my palico? Literally unplayable. Lol. Honestly this might be a con for some people but I was pretty indifferent to playing as a palico in the first place Difficulty Its really easy until you get to tempered elder dragon monsters then it feels about as hard as a Monster Hunter game should be except not as long I remember the longest damn monster hunt I ever had was in MH4U when I soloed the stupid Gogmazios. 2 minutes left on the clock. Anyways in MHW the tempered elder dragons can be t sometimes but for the most part any cart that takes you back to basecamp could have been avoided. Yeah I'd rather hunt a tempered elder dragon over an Apex Rajang *PTSD* Damage Numbers Another point of controversy.... For new players I think this is really good to know first hand where you should hit each monster. For hardcore elitists I think you should just turn it off? Lol. For me I dont ing know how damage works in any of the damn games so regardless if its off or on it doesnt matter lol Cons Online Multiplayer COMMUNICATION ERRORCONTINUING THE GAME IN OFFLINE MODE End game Yeah.... The end game is a big let down for me... which sucks because this is a big reason why I play Monster Hunter.... Limited Monsters To Hunt There's only around 30 unique large monsters to hunt. Even if you count the tempered variants it honestly doesnt take that long to have hunted every low rank/high rank/tempered version of each monster in the game.... (On a side note the rainbow dye was definitely NOT worth getting.... in previous games its all flashy and vibrant... Its like straight out of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure but nah its dull and lame in Monster Hunter World) Limited hunting areas Excluding the special arena/arena the area for Zorah Magdaros and the area for Xeno'jiiva ... There's only like 5 main areas to hunt monsters in. There isnt even an arctic area where you need to drink a Hot Drink to stave off the cold.... but there is one for a Cold Drink? huh.... No G Rank Equipment They dont even necessarily have to add G Rank its just the lack of equipment after High Rank.... After going through the whole story I just started mindlessly farming tempered monsters to get jewels to put in my High Rank Armor decoration slots... and that was it... I wound up getting to over Hunter Rank 100 but I dont really think it was that rewarding at all. If there was actually a tier of equipment beyond High Rank for hunting tempered monsters I feel like it would be a lot more rewarding and fun than it currently is Conclusion Even though I dont think this is the MOST fun I've had in the Monster Hunter series I still had a really damn good time playing with my friends (when it works) and I'm still probably gonna keep on hunting the current monsters until they add the ones that are already on the console version of the game",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-25,0,0,306,False,Recommended,The game look amazing compare to playing it on psp and 3ds. There are few map but they are super large and complex and the environment have great detail. The connection problem is fixed. This game is very fun to play with random and friends. community is mostly friendly and helpful toward new players. They separted some item so they used up your bag space like ammo ores and the equipment to fish and pickaxe. Hunting monster is fun and rewarding with turf war and multi monster in one area fighting each other and the player. Loading is pretty quick.The types of monster that is available is a bit lacking if you compare it to other monster hunter. The weapon look kinda similar to each other. Lack of content is a problem until more event appear. Still some FPS down when kushala daora resting area fight where it summon 4 6 tornado.Still confuse about whether moding is allow is still unclear from capcom.

2018-08-28,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Lets see it is really hard to review this game at the moment because your only really getting to experience half a game which is why the reviews are so mixed. If I was to review the game as a single player game I would rate it quite highly. I would probably put it at a 7 out of 10. The combat is insanely good and feels great. The world is well crafted and looks amazing and the story is great. The characters are all fairly interesting and I really didn't find myself hating anyone and actually enjoyed the majority of them. The biggest downside is the gameplay loop does get a bit boring for a solo game. The problem comes with the repetitive grinding you will have to do at certain points for resources. It really becomes a slog through those points when your fighting the same boss 3 or 4 times in a row hoping for a certain material. This of course would not be an issue if the multiplayer worked but solo it just ends up being a grind. Right now it is hard to say anything about the Coop experience because more often than not it just doesn't work at all. The fact is for a delay as long as the game took for PC you would have expected them to have anything resembling a decent group system set up. I mean this is easily one of the worst grouping systems I have ever seen in a game. It is unintuitive and just straight up does not work half the time. I really just don't understand the decisions that went into this at all. Pretty much it takes what could have been the best game of the year and pretty much just ruins a large part of it. That said I still can recommend the game based purely on the single player aspects of it but honestly I probably would not say at full price. Without the multiplayer the game is worth a solid 40 if they ever get the multiplayer in a good state though it would easily be a 10/10 game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-28,0,0,201,False,Recommended,It was a bumpy bumpy start when the pc release happened a lot of connection issues and people complaining about it. However after the latest patch the connection issues have ceased and are almost non existant. I've put quite the time in the game and at first I was about fed up with it but soldiered through. Those who have been swayed to not get the game due to connectivity issues then now's the time to give it another look.Onto the game itself the game play is enjoyable and aside from fire there isn't generally any graphical issues. That's coming from someone who plays on a low end pc. The story isn't all that great so don't put stock into the story keeping you attached. If you've never played a Monster Hunter game before don't fret. Just know it is grind to the extreme however you can just take it at a slow pace. As of this review the game is short if you blast through it all however soon the free dlcs and expansions will be coming so it will add plenty to do. Overall I suggest this game to anyone looking for something enjoyable to play with your friends and fights that keep you on your toes then this is the game for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,503,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter in itself is an amazing franchise.MHW does the franchise a favor and brings the big monsters to the actual next gen! TL DR The game is beautiful fun and engaging. Some issues with connectivity for Multiplayer that will be fixed for sure. Most bad reviews of the game aren't based and others are just a matter of time until it's fixed but not really a reason not to pick the game for it's single player.There is currently a very noisy part of the community complaining about the connection issues and to some extent I understand the frustration. Now a days people tend to expect things quickly like being able to play Multiplayer as soon as you join the game and so on. Even some veterans are trying to compare this iteration with previous ones and that's just absurd. At least in the way most are going about it.Basically MHW brings a LOT of quality of life changes making it a lot more intuitive to farm and so on.Pros Amazing graphics and a refreshing update to the old Monster Hunter formula. Although the begining of the game is slow it does a better job than any other MH game at introducing the game to newbies. This is a ""short"" MH game but since now they are in big plataforms that support a lot of patches and such the potential is huge. Amazing single player experience as well. Don't need a party to do everything but definitely wont be easy. Prepare yourself and fight wisely.Cons For now the connectivity issues that actually feels like are more of a Valve/Steam issue than a Capcom issue. Some veterans to the series might feel the game a bit easy. The way they did the whole multiplayer is weird. It isn't necessarily bad but it feels very weird for sure and I don't know why they didn't make it so we would connect to our sessions automatically anyways and just let us join other people and so on if we want to instead of the ""create session"" thing.All and all I would give this game a solid 8/10 with a lot of room to get a 9/10 if Capcom manages to patch some issues and Steam/Valve actually work on the connectivity problems.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-24,0,0,186,False,Recommended,Superb game very memorable soundtrack good enough story line / campaign (nothing mind blowing but it's solid it serves its purpose well which is to progress your Hunter Rank). The physics and dynamics of the combat system are fantastic the character (player) movement and fighting animations are absolute Top Tier and so are the monster's (Capcom really do have great animators very easy to see from their other games as well such as Street Fighter 5). The maps are diverse and distinguished from each others (they're also sizable and multi layered). The Large Monsters themselves are a blast to fight each one of them having their own unique sets of attacks and moves to memorize (and they all look very good).BUT...Now with this said (and I could keep going praising the game in general although it's NOT 'perfect' there are some flaws here and there) I MUST mention that the frequency of 'updates' for the PC version is WAY too slow.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

So my best friend from when I was really little bought me this game since we both used to play it on the Wii and had the best time ever so we got extremely excited when this game came out and we were amazed by the game after playing it for the first time I mean some people complain about frame drop but mine never really dips below 50 frames and max settings given I have a decent computer but still I recommend this game 100% so don't judge it based on negative opinions because this game is straight up amazing!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-15,0,0,105,False,Recommended,Amazing Game! even for veterans of the series there are alot of Quality of life Changes to MHW than the older games making it alot less preadsheety to find the best builds and alot more welcoming to new players. The dynamics of the enviroment and all the new mechanichs add alot for the playtime of the game. I notice alot of the dislikes of the game come from the connection issues at the beggining of the PC release (This happens to every MH online game in the first month or so after release so they can stablize their servers.) and alos from the lack of a current G Rank. I can assure you the connection issues are well beyond resolved as of september 4th ish and I cannot say anything about G Rank. The fun to be had without The legendary G rank is still there and it is still just as challenging Remember though That this Game was released on PC X box 1 AND PS4 which all support massive updates. This means that although there isn't a G rank and maybe theres other things players wanted aswell there is always a change it could be added as one of thier free DLC's.

I'm new to the Monster Hunter franchise and only got this game after getting hyped up by the console release.

2018-09-15,0,0,163,False,Recommended,Overall I am very satisfied with a Monster Hunter port to PC. I played MHO for a little while before giving up since I couldnt read japanese (or chinese whatever language the game was based in). The amount of monsters is a fair bit lower than previous games and is no where near the console build at this moment.Long story short this game is the ideal gate to the monster hunter franchise. Fair warning you will have a hard time going to the old system in which areas were loaded individually. One other warning Monster Hunter is about trial and error as well as getting a handle on dodging and feeling how a monster works.This game is worth the buy even to just check it out. Beautiful graphics on a middle ground PC. Story is somewhat engrossing. Difficulty is appropriate for any level of experience,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,479,False,Recommended,I am changing my review to recommending the game since they addressed most issues I had a problem with. The game still doesn't offer a proper support for 3440x1440 and it's very annoying that they are not getting the content up to date with console releases but it is a good game and playable now. MHW is a game that involves a lot of grinding for RNG items to build and upgrade your gear. All of the weapon types are viable and you can tailor your gear to fit with your playstyle (attributes are tied to gear not character). Old review I already own the game on console really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this PC version. Hopefully they fix the many issues that make the game pretty much unplayable very soon. Aside from the constant disconnections flashing screen issues and corrupted memory problems this port took about half a year to finally come to PC. 3440x1440 resolution is a bad joke. I can understand that things go wrong and need to be fixed but after half a year of waiting they release with the resolution support being a quarter of the screen on either side is just black? I'm not some programming developer tech expert or anything but that just seems lazy and unprofessional for a full priced game from an established company like Capcom. It's too late for me to request a refund so I will keep playing on console and hope that these issues get resolved soon.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It is wonderful to be able to play this game on pc with my friends and randoms who would never have gotten it because it wasnt on pc. It runs like a dream and loads SO FAST!! The controls feel fantastic and hunting monsters has never been more fun for me. Please don't let the bad/negative reviews keep you away from this game and surprisingly kind comunity. Some people can't run the game and yes that sucks. But that doesnt mean its a bad game!! It just means they can't run it. They need to stop ruining this games rep because of a problem that has NOTHING TO DO WITH GAMEPLAY OR STORY! If you can't run the game refund it and move on. Don't bash the game and simmer with hate...Moving on All the weapons feel great and its fun to switch up your style now and again! You can use Long Sword Great Sword Dual Blades Sword and Shield Switch Axe Charge Blade Hammer Hunting Horn Lance Gunlance Insect Glaive Bow Light Bowgun &amp Heavy Bowgun!All weapons come in different versions that have different strengths (Ex fire dragon etc) AND each weapon can be upgraded along branching paths for even more power and utility! If you don't like an upgrade you made you can also revert it to its previous state and get all the materials back! (Not including the weapons final upgrade gotta commit to that one).THEN THERE IS LIKE 1 000 FREAKIN ARMOR PIECES!! And they can be upgraded and you can mix armor pieces for utility or fashion! And they all have different uses like the weapons!And most important fighting monsters. Fighting the monsters feels better in this game then any monster hunter game I have played... ever. I have played all the past games (except monster hunter 2) and this is the most fun I have had out of all of them BY FAR!So come on! The hell are you waiting for? Consider this a personal invitation to play this game!Oh and for you Solo players or Shy players use the SOS flare. No talking just fighting.

Also some endgame monsters can tank anyones computer with thier supernova dragonball atacks but again if there were something liek a particle setting this would be less of an issue. anyway thats all i wanted to say after they patch it up completely its great. Edit some of these issues have been fixed. like teostra laggin everything and the particle stuff. i can now recomend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-30,0,0,147,False,Recommended,First things first as a PC gamer this is my first Monster Hunter game that I'm playing (because afaik. its the first MH that has PC port). So take that in mind when you're reading this.The idea in this game is pretty simple Track and hunt monsters and use their parts to craft gear. Such a simple premise but yet so fun to execute.Its because of that aspect that the game is very grindy because you're not always guaranteed to get those drops that you're looking for. But that's okay because hunting those monsters is always fun.The game has a decent story mode too. You create your own character and embark on a research commission to a new continent caleld New World. There you go through a line of different but yet so similar quests and unravel the mystery behind the event called Elder Crossing.I'm not gonna go too deep with the story because I don't want to provide spoilers but after completing the story I can say that it's bare bones but interesting enough to go through. It took me roughly 60 hours to complete the story mode but I could have finished it a lot sooner if I wanted. I just like to take my time with the games.After finishing the story some would say that the real game starts where you can now challenge the more tougher and challenging monsters. But with high risk also comes higher rewards. The whole end game is basically you hunting monsters &gt craft better gear &gt hunt tougher monsters &gt craft better gear...and so on. You get the idea.When I first started playing the game I was surprised how challening the monsters can be. The monsters are though and it takes quite a long time to hunt monsters of your own level. Its prefectly normal to spend 15 minutes on each monster and sometimes it can even take 30 45 minutes to hunt some of those more tougher monsters.Each monster is different from one another forcing you to learn their behavior and adapting to them. This means that you have to prepare yourself for each fight beforehand meaning that you need to take advantage of the monster weaknesses if you want to bring the down. If you're not prepared you'll get wercked. Some monster can first feel like they're overwhelming and you're never gonna be able to take them down on your own but that is wrong. You can take down each of these monsters on your own. All it takes is some practice.But its not all flowers with this game because like any other game this game also has a few setbacks.The first and the biggest flaw for me at least is how poorly the co op is designed. I'm not gonna go and explaing it in every detail but lets just say that they couldn't have made it mode complicated than this. You basically have to search for online session each time you start the game hoping that you find one and while in game you have to post a quest and hope again that someone will join. I say hope a lot because the game has some serious connection problems. Half the time I'm getting disconnected from the online sessions and have to search for a new one.Second mentionable thing is how poorly the game is optimized. I have a pretty decent rig on me and I can barely run the game at 60+ fps on medium settings when I should be able to run it perfectly smoothly on high settings according to the system requirement charts. The PC version was delayed by 9 months because the devs wanted to get their first PC port right on the first attempt but in my opinion those 9 months wasn't enough apparently.Lastly the quests aren't really that interesting either. You basically have 3 different objectives that you usually have to do hunt/capture the monster search for clues/tracks and gather certain number of materials.Overall while the game does have some problems I'm still enjoying playing it.Pros + Challenging monsters+ Lots of stuff to do+ Play your way with your own style+ End game+ Decent storyCons Network connection issues Poorly optimized PC port Co op mechanics are unnecessarily complex Boring quest designs Palico AI is horrible Can get grindy if you're not lucky with the RNG Lip syncing during cutscenes is distracting( Hunt preparation can bet time consuming at times)Do I recommend Yes. Even with its flaws hunting monsters is fun on your own and with other people.Verdict 8/10 Good game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,45,False,Recommended,"I'm surprised this game is currently sitting at ""MIXED"" on Steam. Although it seem to be mostly technical issues which is unfortunate. So I'll split up my review into Technical and Gameplay Technical I'm running the game below spec and it runs GREAT. Load times are fast graphics are smooth with very few hiccups on medium settings. Yes there are some options I'd like to change that aren't available to be adjusted but this is a much better port than I expected. Note that I'm not maxing things out nor do I expect to max things out. But I also haven't run into any crashes.Gameplay The long and short of it is that this is Monster Hunter. It's not a game for everyone. There is no lock on so you have to approrpiately move around the enemies to target specific parts to do specific amounts of damage. Hit it til it dies. Don't get hit. I enjoy it a lot but it's not for everyone. There's a tough learning curve that is easy to cheat yourself out of if you let yourself get carried in multiplayer. But if that's how you enjoy the game you do you. Things get intense but as you get more practice you find that weapons and armor are not the only improvements that make fights go smoother. Player skill matters. A lot. That's why I keep coming back to this series.However if I do have a beef it's that ""World"" feels fairly empty when it comes to interacting with other people. There are rarely other hunters in your town. It may get better in the late game but at least for the time being I am hard pressed to find any quests via multiplayer unless I make my own mission and fire an SOS flare to allow other people to join in. As a result there isn't nearly as much interaction with other hunters as I hoped. Apparently trying to organize sessions with your own friends has its own additional hurdles although I have not tried that portion of multiplayer yet. As it stands multiplayer runs smoothly enough. But the way it works right now makes the rest of world hubs feel devoid of life.Still I recommend this game. Monster Hunter World is an excellent entry into the series and I am very glad I get to experience it on PC. It provides hours and hours of hunting gathering and resource farming that can be done alone or (with some caveats) with others.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-30,0,0,74,False,Recommended,After playing for 70 hours and getting to end game I can safely say that this game is amazing. It's not a hack and slack game in the same sense as traditional games it requires you to learn the movements of the enemy understanding how your weapon works and a lot of dodging + proper placement. It requires much more strategy than your average N3 game.You will be challenged a few times over and some of the monsters will always be a challenge. Running with friends that coordinate and communicate will significantly make a difference. Teaming up online with others will help as long as you don't run into people that don't dodge when they're drinking a potion and the monster lunges at them... or other similar causes.It's a hard game with a really good difficulty scale. There is a lot to do as well for completionists and collectors.All the negative reviews causing this game to be Mixed are due to some server and network issues that the game had on release which they have mostly fixed since then. Adding udp to your start commands will fix most matchmaking issues. This is minute and doesn't deserve a downvote considering people rarely come back to rerate games. A trend that should die.I highly recommend this game. Get 3 other friends and run together. Try to vary between ranged and melee it will help. If you're having a hard time try a different weapon. Maybe yours is too slow or too short range.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-30,0,0,824,False,Recommended,Here is my honest review of Monster Hunter World First of all i want to say that ive played Monster Hunter Tri and Monster Hunter 4U.You are definetly going to play it for 100 hrs at least.After that its more grindy and stuff idk if you like that.(There is still 4 Monsters missing since they got added since they got added on other platforms via free DLCS which we dont have atm at pc)The controls feel great and id switch the controls from the previous MH games for these keyboard controls anytime.All the Weapons are viable (there are 14) and ur gonna find the one you like. Promise.The game is SUPER easy to get into compared to other MH games.Many ppl talk of an early game wall which i didnt expirience my friends didnt as well since i helped them via mulitplayer.Now the bad stuff It feels like a good console emulatorNo wide screen supportRuns at 60 fps ( 3440x1440 with an 1080ti + 32gb RAM + i7 8700k)You have to watch the cutcenes before every quest.Which means if you are trying to play with 3 other friends everyone has to host the same quest watch the cutscene abandon and rejoin the 4th player. One more thing What took them 7 months ? Anyway i still love the game and i hope they fix the stuff that i mentioned. Im probably going to play it for at least 400 more hrs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monsters you fight are scaled to 1 player if your alone or 4 player if you have 2+ ppl with there HP and resistances to stagger ect being much higher. As far as i can tell there is no diffrance in a 2 4 player boss so there isnt much reason not to have 4 ppl if you wanted to duo the game with a friend. Onlything i can see bad with the game on PC specificly is i think it has 2 match making servers some kinda daytime and nighttime server the daytime server seems to have no problems locating other peoples games and the nighttime for some reason picks up at the most 2 games ever for me at a time im not certon on the hours of those servers and i could be misstaken but its been consistant that way for many days. Is also a very obvious delay on the nightime server when it atempts to find games.Note at launch the matchmaking was nearly unplayable but that has been fixed as of the last patch that was a seperate issue from the day/night server mentiond above tho.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,125,False,Recommended,"Since about half the issues are fixed I'll just go ahead and put the review to recommended since it's still a good game even though it still has some port issues. As much as I want to give this game a positive review I'll give it a not recommended for now. I've played the PS4 version to HR 70 80 clocking in at somewhere between 100 200 hours so that's what I'll be comparing it to now after around 30 hours of gameplay in the PC version reaching the last few story quests.Improvements to the PS4 version * Load times the PS4 Pro with the standard HDD was a very horrible experience in fact it was so bad that I went and got a SSD for it only to still suffer extreme load times even though they literally halved. The PC version on a 850 Evo SSD loads so fast that it's the menu animations limiting how fast you can go into a mission. Great improvement.* FPS so for PS4 Pro I used the performance mode which was a variable frame rate of 30 60 with a resolution of 1080p. Well..... it was basically 35 45 mostly and being used to G Synced 50 100 fps in the majority of titles I play it felt like the game was almost unplayable for the first few hours. At some point you just accept how bad it was. On this front I'm glad to report that locked 60 fps on a 4790k and 1080 GTX feels amazing in comparison. I'm running it at 1440p with all but volumetric rendering maxed and it's a stable 60 fps for 'most' of the time which I'll get into below.Here's the sad part that's it.... no other improvements really.Degrades from the PS4 version * Textures...... Something is VERY WRONG here maxed texture settings still looks like when I had the original HDD in the PS4 Pro causing textures to load so slowly that they were a blurry mess. At times you can see the true texture but it's so rare that's disappointing how bad the majority of the textures look due to this.* Graphics overall for all the effects that are in the game still don't seem to have any improvement over the console. You can watch DigitalFoundry's comparison video to see how it compares to the Xbox One X version which is the best console version.* Multiplayer dropping the squad system in favor of gimped steam groups is going to make the multiplayer worse than it is on the consoles unless they add in some features for ""Steam Group Sessions"". Both the console and PC releases have seen multiple networking issues right now I'd say the PC version will have more long term issues while the console version actually had some server down time which I've so far not seen on the PC.Console to PC port fails * Particle effects.... I don't know what is going but when my friend got his lightning daggers FPS started plummeting from stable 60 to 40 dips when he was attacking it honestly felt like 20 even. Apparently every lightning effect in particular as well as some of the boss magic attacks cause major frametime spikes. There's even a area later in the game that a consistent frametime spike every 3 5 seconds and some people have noticed a lightning effect coinciding with this spike. In my case it's not that bad FPS drops to 58 but you can really feel the hitch.* Mouse and Keyboard the mouse is so badly implemented that it's probably a emulated analog stick. Decided to use my DS4 controller to play the game which works as intended apart from only having XBOX keys in the UI.Conclusion If they fix the textures particle effects I'll easily give the game a positive recommendation. Making the multiplayer a bit more stable and give us a proper squad session would be great as well.Personally I don't still want to go back to the PS4 version at all with the improved FPS and loading times on the PC but some of the issues here are just not worth suffering through right now so wait with playing the game in case you absolutely don't have to play it right now.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,46,False,Recommended,While I have my complaints with the game and things they should have ironed out with the time they took to release this separate form the PS4 I still love it even after buying it twice and playing through it again.I personally have no issues running the game as my hardware is beyond what they require to run it. I do find it odd how CPU is the most demanding thing in reality to the game than the GPU which im sure is what is hitting most players the worst. Be sure to have your PC up to snuff.First week with the server issues is a frustrating thing However releasing a game on steam in any fashion is by far the worst experience a Company can have should even the slightest issues occur. Steam is a mixed pot of a LARGE user base. you will not make everyone happy. damned if you do and damned if you dont.I find it also odd that we are not on more current patches with certain fixes and issues resolved and certain QoL changes that PS4 had very close after its launch that should have been a pre packed deal with the PC launch thats a given. However if we are getting the content in the same fashion as PS4 then we will have changes and fixes soon and know what to expect with the changelogs.Load times are near non existent on my SSD. Comparing the PS4 to PC its a stark and noticeable contrastThe controls were a little confusing at first But quickly adapted to the changes and now they really make sense and work well for me. I have made no custom keybinds or changes at all and have tried all the weapons. The Ranged weapons are the only thing that feel odd to me personally.Overall I have and will continue to enjoy spanking Monsters solo or with my group (when server permits) for many hundreds of hours just like I did on PS4.There is a lot of hate out there right now and negative reviews. Give the game a few weeks and things will flatten out and pick up. its not a competitive game what are you losing by not being first?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,42,False,Recommended,This improves upon every facit of previous Monster Hunters. The grind of the games is not for every one. I have had no performance or technical issues so far. I have loved every minute of it. I would highly recommend to anyone who liked a previous monster hunter game. For every one else watch some youtube gamplay videos and see if you would like it. The concept is very simple learn the tells of each monster so that I can exploit their weaknesses. Once I have killed or captured them harvest loot from their massive steaming corpses and make better weapons or gear to kill or capture even larger more epic prey. That isnt for everyone and that is okay. To me this is a great game and well worth the AAA full price. Even if I can't disable motion blur,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Does it have its issues? Of course it does it's rare that releases like this that are this anticpated go over completely smoothly and I very strongly disagree with the sentiment that it is just a ""half quot PC port. I've seen much much worse. The multiplayer issues are much less of a port quality issue and more of a SERVER issue. Let's not forget MH W's multiplayer was basically unplayable for over a week at its release on console. I understand the frustration with how annoying the servers can be but when a game slingshots up to the thirdmost game in Steam's concurrent players board the day of release I feel like it's fair to expect some server issues. Especially when there's really no way to completely prep for a full release of that scale with new servers. When it comes to multiplayer your yield may vary for myself personally it has its hiccups but for the most part I've been able to do numerous succesful hunts with my friends when it DOESN'T work however it can be a massive pain in the That seems to be the BIGGEST gripe most are having with this game but it's something I expect to be fixed soon as the amount of players levels out or as Capcom patches the game in the future. However there are two other issues as well.From what I can hear the optimization can be pretty hit or miss for people. My friends and I all have PCs ranging from mid high end and most of us have little no issue. The graphical settings are pretty specific and can be changed if you're having issues I'd recommend turning a few settings down and it's easy to run consistently well on medium at or above 60 fps on most mid range rigs.The secondmost problem being mouse controls and camera controls. The camera requires getting used to and I changed my settings a few times to find what I was most comfortable with but it'd be better if they were to update or patch it to be more user friendly. Mouse controls are a straight no go for me unless you're using a ranged weapon of some sort. Otherwise I pretty much only use my controller for this game and with the response to the mouse controls I'd recommend the same.Overall much fun to be had. Load times have the speedforce especially on an SSD Higher framerate options higher resolution options Multiple inputs supported Steam integration is cooler than squads fight me.All this on top of an already amazing game with a beautiful world. The tradeoff is the servers may be janky SOMETIMES maybe a few frame drops for you and mouse acceleration will take some getting used to.BUY IT!!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,158,False,Recommended,A fantastic if somewhat occasionally frustrating experience with paradoxically the most supportive online community I ve ever experienced followed by the shallowest human interactions. The multiplayer facilities could use some work as playing this through (story missions) with my partner means waiting for one of us to die horribly and or fail miserably after seeing the cutscenes which can kill your experience somewhat having them join from the beginning and stay with you would have made this an unbeatable online experience for me but as is (much reported matchmaking bugs aside) it s a stellar time and one you can spend hours playing without realizing how many you have. When it works it works the animations are fluid the fights are poetic in rhythm and structure and the obsessive loot drive mechanics are tragically all consuming the only thing limiting this to a perfect are the above multiplayer issues and the following technical issues. Fireworks and bombs will tank your framerate the connection to online and people 1 foot away from you is shockingly bad with drops occurring at the worst times savagely yanking you from your immersed perch and spitting in your eye if you happened to use a voucher (I m not bitter). And my most nitpicky and by no means exclusive issue with either Capcom or with the MT engine itself just a general gripe about gaming in general and current trends. Maybe I should shake my cane at Nvidia instead of here but the lack of PC feature leverage makes it relevant. It is the lack of SLI support textures above 4GB and generally the lack of milking the PC machines for what they are worth the RTX 2000 series has been announced no massive framerate leaps look likely on single cards unless recent Nvidia features are turned on and we are reaching the limit of die shrinks. Microstutter is preferable to any other issues raised by SLI integration technical issues DRM issues whatever the cause the game could look prettier and run smoother as Digital Foundry have pointed out the port is missing features from the console which future patches are likely waiting in the wings to rectify. But all in all it could have been pushed harder and one feature in particular for this is SLI as the games that use SLI show what can be done with raw power when harnessed (Tomb Raider Witcher Far Cry) different engines different teams sure but it s sad that one of the most played games on Steam lacks this PC appreciation. That episode over it doesn t change the fact that good games are good 16 bit or all the bits and if you can overlook the teething troubles on what could be a lot worse of a port then you ll likely love the world this game offers.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I pre ordered this on Xbox One and have atleast 1600 hours registered to it and I can say for like the first month and a half online connectivity was garbage. Give them a sec because it's not an easy thing to get a handle on right away. Yes they had a plenty of other games before this with multiplayer but you gotta acknowledge that we're talking about a game built off the Nintendo DS and we all see how rigid their online structure is. Most of it is bluetooth. This game is sick. The singleplayer is sick. It took them a while just to get the game to look as good as it does on PC from having to up from the Console ports. If you bought this game or just loved the other Monster Hunter games pick this up too.

2018-08-14,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Scroll down for TL DR summary.So as a heads up there are currently big connection issues with this game. I'll get this out of the way if you want to play Multiplayer hold onto your money. You may even want to look into some of the other issues with this game as for some it doesn't even run. (There is a Fan made fix out for several of these but not the connection issues )Besides these glaring issues this game is a flawed masterpiece. Once it gets patched it'll be worth every penny especially when they fix the server issues. Again if you want Multiplayer don't buy this YET. If you want single player though hoo boy are you in for a wild ride. This game is one of the most addictive things I've played in years. I may be a little biased being a long time Monster Hunter Veteran but this game is just wonderful. Great combat great customization lots of stuff you can do.

I did not have any game crash. I did not have any frame drop (people complaining just don't know how to properly reduce their game settings my PC is 9 years old and I'm playing this game in 1080p 60fps like a charm). I did not have any issue when doing alt tab because I set the game to run in borderless windowed like a sane persone would do. I did not have any issue with the controls. All MH games for more than one decade have been tweaked and polished for using controllers so I'm using a controller the way it was meant to be played. Great rumble support.Things I had so far Tons of fun. A beatiful game and a lushful vegetation even at low settings. Surprisingly good online synchronisation with other players and monsters (aka no lag). Tons of online quests with strangers. Tons of online quests with friends.Yes the cinematic system is badly designed and prevents you to join a player doing his story quest for the first time but once you understand that and get past (and around) it the game has so much to offer.WOULD RECOMEND 11/10 this is the Monster Hunter that was always meant to be.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This game took everything unique and iconic about Monster Hunter distilled its essence poilished up some of the mechanics and crafted an experience that is a pure joy to play. Whether you play with a friend with random people on the internet or just solo the game is challenging rewarding and so damn fun. Each type of weapon could have a whole damn game dedicated to it because they feel so different to play with and each category is completely viable this is probably one of the most balanced games I've ever played as well come to think of it. Whether you like to get up close and personal shoot from a distance leap around the battlefield or support your party you'll definitely find a weapon style you like. My personal favorites hammer gunlance and charge blade.I understand that many people have had connection issues myself included and others have had their game run like hot garbage (myself excluded thankfully) and if the only reason you want to play the game is because of the multiplayer aspect then you may find yourself losing time trying to connect to or create lobbies for the purpose of multiplayer.

2018-08-19,0,0,143,False,Recommended,I'm a big fan of MH franchise I have a PS4 but I didn't buy this game on PS4 so I can play it with my friends on PC. Patiently waiting longer just for the PC version at first I'm very happy playing this game until the connection error happened. At first I think it just my Internet connection but I was told it was because of the server. I thought Capcom will fix this matter quickly but they didn't. Honestly I love this game so much I really loved it but the connection problem is really annoying sometimes I can play with my friends but some other time I can't even search for their online session and keec DC ing when in a quest. This problem really makes me sad I really wish Capcom will fix this problem. I really love this game but for the connection problem I will just give it bad review. EDIT CAPCOM seems have fixed the connection issue it's been great for now I can normally play co op with my friends sometimes we got the connection issue but thats not a problem anymore since we got less more DC thanks for listening CAPCOM,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,This game bring me suffering more than happiness How could you this up so bad? Not recommend untill they fix all (alot) the problem but i doubt it.Monster Hunter World is Highly overrated Pro Fun to play with your friend if you can really play online Nice looking map Umm Cool animation maybe? but not the facial animationCon The variety of weapon you can chose but mostly everyone would go will something op rather than utility because if you can't kill them fast enough they either leave flee and make you chase them but don't get me wrong it a good feature but runaway every 3 5 min is kinda stupid Stun and Roar wtf is this aren't you an A list hunter? everything can stun you with little effort. Sure you can use the set to neglect all that but does that make you stick with the certain set what about the variety? if i don't use it most of the enemy could stunlock me to dead. No story here just a fetch quest Bad location placement Ex Canteen Workshop SOS flare system For a system that meant to help you instead you're rolling a dice either you finish your quest or someone would your quest up Idiot character everyone is over exaggerated specially the handler. also eating animation make me feel like my character isn't really an A list hunter just some random guy who has problem with eating.I don't hate the game I love it but there is too much negative than positive If i hate the game I would just uninstall it and never touch it again. So this is why i wrote this review it because i care and Here some cookies.Hope they fix it before playerbase die out.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,"I got this game because of a recommendation from a friend who has played the entire series and got it on console. I wanted to hunt monsters with friends and fight big creatures and generally around. I have been able to do exactly none of those things. First off the port. Capcom took 6 months extra to release this game after the console and I expected a decent port... boy was i wrong. Its a port it basically forces you to use a controller out of all my friends 2 decided to try using keyboard and mouse and both went to controller after the abismal mapping and horrible joystick like movement from the mouse. My friend actually went and bought a controller for the game just because of how absolutly unplayable it is. I wanted to use my mouse and keyboard but honestly if you arent using controller you cant play it.The graphics and performace. I have 32 gig of ram and a 1080ti as well as an SSD and still i dont play on max settings because of framerate issues... so yeah that sums that upThe ""play with friends"". The game itself has a built in ""call for help from friends"" button because it knows how had it is. Well that would be great if I could use it or even get online. Ive had it 4 days and have yet to even see a friend in it or join a lobby but i cant tell you how many times ive seen ""Error code 301... mh1"" whatever. I wanted to hunt with friends and i cant even connect online. Ive been to every forum post and every website i opened every port it said to restarted reinstalled and even rebooted my router and nothing worked. To add insult to injury my 2 friends have been playing non stop with eachother so listening to that is getting pretty annoying because im left to myself in offline modeas far as gameplay. well its monster hunter its hard you have to know your quarry what its weak against know your combos when to go in and out all that stull. I guess with that regaurd i just have to git gud since i kinda suck at it altho the controls and camera arent helping me much.tl dr sucks cant run it cant play online capcum fix your pc port and servers. dont get it unless they fix it. Ill update this when it gets better.... if it does",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,24,False,Recommended,played since freedom unite on psp and we've come a long way baby. performance is fine on my machine (rx480 + ryzen 1600) with a reasonably constant 60fps just about maxed 1080p. playing with a ds4 so can't comment on m/k controls. pc specific stuff aside the game is very fun so far though it took till the barroth fight to really click as a mh game for me with the first few hours being very westernised and hand holdy as other reviews will attest. a deluge of interruptions annoying characters tutorial waivers and unskippable non monster intro cutscenes with at least one qte abound. I don't mean to sound negative as the pastiche quickly fades in favour of a much more familiar feeling game with many quality of life improvements and far and away the most dynamic vibrant living world in the franchise. if you are already a mh fan this is an anonymous endorsement from a self proclaimed peer. if you aren't yet there are a decade of brilliant very playable games that will give you a better idea of the quality you can expect than the steam reviews ever will. rip emuparadise,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,93,False,Recommended,The performance during Teostra and Kushala Daora is atrocious in almost every other part of the game I get 40 60 FPS on a machine that barely exceeds the minimum recommendations.Multiplayer is fun and works decently well for the most part (especially since the latest patch).Finishing the story took me around 56 hours but I also took my sweet time and did optionals investigations etc. Considering the real endgame only starts now I have gotten and am still to get tremendous value from this purchase.There is a decent amount of depth in different skill builds with mixed armor sets it's just a shame that layered armour exists and we can't simply transmog our minmax clownsuit.The mouse input is pretty gross I still play on KB/M it's not that bad...unlike having Denuvo DRM which is obviously terrible and was the main reason I considered not recommending the game.Also worth mentioning the story is rubbish but the extra cutscenes you will see during visits to the canteen sending out a tailraider safari etc. are absolutely some of the best features of the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Well we've figured out the multiplayer quirks well enough so I can update this review and say with confidence (as expected) that Monster Hunter World is easily one of the best games to come out this year. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying but what surprised me is that that's not what my favorite part of it is. My favorite part is easily just the happy atmosphere and the depth the world was crafted with. Talking with NPCs is a delight watching cutscenes (especially involving palicoes) is simply the best and the music and character present throughout are endlessly endearing. You'll have to figure out how to get the multiplayer to be consistent but it's highly worth it. I look forward to being a part of this world for years to come.Original Will update with full (likely extremely positive) review when the servers actually function.

2018-08-27,0,0,212,False,Recommended,It was tough to decide if this gets a recommendation and it's not just because of a poor PC port. They are making fixes to the port. Overall it's a good game the best in the genre.However the hit boxes are horrible it's almost like they never changed them from the PS2 version.This alone can make you fail at battles to hit box RNG. Which is not fun. Fortunately it doesn't happen all the time.Animation RNG is bad as well. The telegraphed moves of monsters can be almost unreadable at unlucky times.Controls can be clunky for no reason at times.But if you enjoy challenging fights with big bosses and grind up the gear you will probably like this game.This game has a lot of potential to bring a whole new generation of players hopefully they keep fixing the issues instead of ignoring them and just release the DLC.Like I said it's a good game but new players beware of the issues. I just choose to work past the issues and enjoy the game in the long run.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,109,False,Recommended,"30 hours in as of writing. Probably the easiest MH game to get into. If you've played Monster Hunter before or are interested in getting into it and have a controller especially if you're on the fence buy it. It is MH at its core. You kill something. You use its body parts to make better weapons and armor to kill even bigger things. You repeat while gathering for ammo food and utilities. Etc... etc...If you would rather wait for better KBM support which currently is supposedly good albeit with issues I would wait. But the game is undoubtedly good and will inevitably get better. Most of the issues seem to be on a player by player basis so the only way to know for sure if you should buy it or not is to just buy it. You can always refund.Why you're probably reading reviews Optimization seems pretty solid. 60+ FPS with everything maxed with the exception of ""Volume Rendering Quality"" on low running on a 2600x and 1050ti driver 388.13 with minor dips in certain scenes which is to be expected. Volume Rendering Quality on highest offers negligible improvements to visuals when compared to low and does not justify the performance hit. The effect is nice as it adds an atmospheric feel to the area so I leave it on. Although it can make things seem a bit hazy and washed out so I'd recommend running reshasde (which we will undoubtedly do with just about every game) and rectify this with Curves Levels Lumasharpen and Vibrance. As well as some good 'ol SMAA to replace the crappy TAA devs have been opting for as of late.Jump in play for an hour have fun then refund.

2018-08-13,0,0,90,False,Recommended,So far an increadibly enjoyable game. There is a ton to do here and a ton of ways to do it.I personally cannot speak on how well it handles using pc controls because I use an Xbox controller but so far it has handled well with a smooth 60pfs. I haven't had many of the connection issues playing with friends either though that may as well be a steam side issue. Many of the new 'features' steam has implemented such as the friends and chat and the voice chat have also cut out when MHW dropped me. I reccomend private matching through the session id and using Discord as I have had fewer issues this way.EDIT Also noticed another steam realated glitch. Steam as of this review puts me at 9.1hrs.

Don't mind grind while you get to look epic and fight epic crap?This game has these things but more and less.Sure fighting can be stale after a while but even if you bounce between weapons and gedgets it gives you more time to Master the art of Monster hunter. So you may be asking yourself ""Whats the point?"" ""why play this game over others?Here's a bit of insight.I've played it all drove myself into the gaming experience so hard i've blown money eveywhere to keep myself emergered into this child like feeling of ""clue less innocent like fun of Discovery and what i may call Fantasy gamer magic.""Sure this may not be The best monster hunter to you or a friend or even the best game of all time but it stays good to what the series is just about huntin monsters. It's that simple.Even after the cinematics and angry cheeses from monsters that can happen This game feels alive in a sense more then i've seen up to date.The best part of this game is the sheer number of interactions it has in it along side your quest to hunt monsters.Everything you do in this game just re enforces the title further.Cause it's simply a game to take your time and get lost in.Who cares if you dont like using the same thing over and over just go kill a monster and change what you wanna be just like that or work your way up.if you die because you couldnt roll through an animation or was still attacking thats ok just means positioning can be awkward and mistakes are common and this game will punish you for being naive like the monster it is.Notes Just as well structured as the promise this game can hold and let go. instant build changing with materials well balanced progression (if you feel you goin too quick try a different weapon style out) many many things to learn about what you can do but also what you can cause territory wars are an amazing way to watch monsters fight but to also bum materials. (with training and dedication passive play may be optional) Don't focus on the story cause it's your mishaps and funny incidents that define your personal run of the game Be SILLY try to run a monster to another monster in the middle of your group. You will return with some interesting results and if you're still good friends afterwards and no one took it too hard i bet you'll have the greatest time here. If fashion is important to you this game does well to deliver You can join S.O.S quests and wear your favorite setup wether it be behind or current or ahead of that zone don't be afraid to lose out on stats because at the end of the day it's all about hunting monsters and if it gets away it will find it's way back to try again and get crafty or smack it a different way. Hammers Hammers Hammers Hammers Hammers Hammers Hammers Hammers. Crafting is always relevant with somthing even if its limmited to 1 thing the enviornment it helpful and damaging (Damn Thee stunning toads to heck) and cool part is you can capture them with your little net. Don't like killing monsters much? you can capture them and it even gives more/better loot. pick flowers pick bugs pick rocks pick your gender pick your palico (cat) pick your bugs to enchant a staff pick your poisons pick your enemies pick your friends pick your colors pick your missions pick your poogie's outfit. Uh DUH ARM WRESTLING (in town duh) run around feeling like a kid run around feeling like a badass run around feeling like jack sparrow occasionally eating things around him acting like a kid away from things like an idiot drinking half the time and looking like a badass while doing it While still not knowing whats going on..The game is flawed and can have some interesting turnouts.So if you wanna delve in to this game it can be done with your brain ON and or OFF.Sit back and relax as you get rockin or get rocked by a literal rock or some fish that are trying to screw with your emotions as they pull great hooks into your life by being out of water. Like literally they will jump out at you..This game I reccommend to players isn't the greatest in all these things like graphics or story or combat filled with countless combo's.BUT it was Designed as one great thing it's great at being a game.

2018-08-11,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Ho hum people are dumb...I feel somewhat uniquely qualified to review this having played every game since the PS2 era in this series. I'd actually say I'm more neutral but generally leaning toward positive with this installment(really not as good as previous games) but because Steam will apparently never let you leave a neutal opinion positive it is. Anyway let's get an actual game review instead of an 'I don't know how my computer works' review shall we? But first let's address part of what people are complaining about a lot.KB/Mouse controls I'm exclusively playing this on keyboard and mouse the controls have been thusfar fluid and clear. You cannot turn instantly because you cannot turn instantly. just because you want to do a 360 on a whim doesn't mean that gameplay supports it it's how the game works and has always worked since the original Monster Hunter on PS2. Literally the only thing I needed to switch so far that is wrong with these controls is that the radial menu defaults to a controller setup(even after changing input type to keyboard and mouse) and needs changed. Other than that no issues or anything that deviates from expectations of a Monster Hunter game. I'll take questions if you're confused as to how things work so you can hapiilly not add to the stupid around here.Optimization Unless my magical $1200 laptop is better than your $2000+ gaming rig I think we can safely chalk this up to user error...and possibly Windows 10. A lot of games on PC do not default to using the full capacity of your GPU unless you tell it to in your graphic settings (NVidia at least I don't use...that other brand P) Anyway a few changes to your NVidia settings can make all the difference from desync to general motion stutter. Had the same isues when Nier Automata Tales of Berseria and every other pretty game in the last 2 years has released. Why? I dunno but it's not hard to fix if you have half a clue what you're working with.Connection Errors? I had some the first day but nothing since. I'm on comcast which is notoriously bad and have had storms in the area on a constant lately. I'd say check permissions that the game is being allowed by the computer restart and try again because at least here there's no connection issues.The Review(thusfar)Monster Hunter World is somewhat of a watered down version of its predecessors with less apparent customization fewer choices and more shiny things. Streamlined to allow a new generation to more easilly accept it but somewhat disappointing for an old fan.The Pros Combat and movement Both far more fluid than most previous titles only exception being the mounting system which has been reworked so that's a bit of give and take. Gone are the days of stop motion sprinting and crouching to a halt on a dime. While fun and sometimes funny it never really made sense. This new movement just feels better and more natural.Also a nice new feature you couldn't move at all when using items before we actually had to time behaviors and stand there smashing items into our faces or sharpening weapons hoping we didn't get hit before the animations were over because there was no canceling or rolling out of the way when you started. Being able to dodge an attack while mid sharpening or drinking a potion is freaking nice even if it wastes some stuff.The environment MY GOD IT'S SO SHINY! It's pretty really pretty and big. I am constantly lost and I love it. Hunting areas are multiple times larger than they ever have been which makes it more about hunting and less about popping in and out of zones to see where things are after your paintball wears off.The story?! I'm just surprised they put one in again. MH Tri had a good one Gen and 4 really didn't have relevant stories beside being an excuse as to why you're mercilessly slaughtering things and conviniently ending up where you need to be to hunt new stuff. We'll see how it develops but so far so good for a MH title.The Whatevers Interface I miss you old interface. I miss my mini map I miss my paintballs and crafting book and all the little things that you plastered all over my screen my health and stamina bar being perpetually shown to me...but that's just my feelings. As for the new stuff the old mini map would definitly not work and the rest is actually pretty solid. The item menu actually does keep to the old one and is functionally the same (if you can't figure out how to use a potion on the move you're slightly stupid in my opinion).Scoutflies I get it but I don't like it. I'd rather have a little arrow or something just hovering over random stuff than for my screen to steadilly fill up with little green particles. That said I don't know how else they would do it that actually makes any sense for the world so....meh.The ConsWeapons and armor(Edit) This is the big one to me. This was what made Monster Hunter amazing. You had weapons and armor for almost every large and several small monsters before. From weapons as silly as a frozen tuna or large bone or armor that made you look like a teddy bear or cat these were the things I loved and went after. They seem to be missing from this game and that really sucks but more than that the entire expanse of things that you could make seems to have been cut down to maybe a third of what it was for comparable progress in the game. Armor sets don't actually seem to be sets based on the skills they have and I guess there are no accessories anymore? It's an odd choice from a series that has always added things in this department now it's a hollow shell of its former self. So the gem slots and talismans are back but they only show up later everything else still stands.Every hunt has multiple large monsters It's just annoying and there's no good reason for it that I've been able to discern. I understand some of them like the Great Jagras maybe the Kulu Ya Ku but having things en class with a Rathalos and Barroth in addition to whatever you're actually doing is simply annoying. If it was once in a while I could understand that but not for every single quest.That's all I have so far...to be continued/updated as I get further.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Plain and simple. It took the formula improved it and made it more accessible. The quality of life changes are huge and the game feels alive as opposed to previous iterations. Everything interacts in the game not just you and the monster.The network stability has been consistently getting better and better and it is not uncommon at all for a game to have stability problems at launch (even for much more PC experienced like World of Warcraft. Warlords of Draenor anyone?). Hell look at the mess that Batman Arkahm Knight was and compare it with this. This runs great for the first major attempt at a Monster Hunter on the PC. People like to forget how much trouble past Monster Hunter games had staying connected to Hunting lobbies but at least in this one it is super easy to find your friends and reconnect.If you want to change everything about a game to fit your personal customizations there are limited options available but frankly the game doesn't need much changing.

Because I (and you all should too) consider it as a brand new game. It's not a Monster Hunter. The game just keeps the weapon and some monsters but that's it!So to the fans that loved MH freedom or other MH of the serie you'll find it easier because most of the mecanics have changed. But I personnaly love how they focused the fast paced and exploration gameplay.To the begginers though this game is a good one to start the serie but also a bad one. If you play this one first and decide to buy old ones (or even the new GenU) you will find them slow different with useless details but more challenging and with more content.In MHW they get rid off a lot of useless aspect to me. Now pickaxe bugnet fishing poll and sharp stones are unlimited. The get rid off the hot potion and the cold potion is uselefull for one area only and for few zones.The games feals way better the way it is in MHW. Though for veteran you'll find the game easy because you don't really have to prepare yourself before ant battle (but maybe in endgame you'll have to.

2018-08-11,0,0,61,False,Recommended,"This game is amazing so far. I haven't really had a chance to play it much due to an upcoming test in school but I already love this game. I've played most of the previous monster hunter games and this one is by far the most beautiful and developed. Regarding the PC performance issues I can't say I've had any. I'm running an I5 7600k GTX 1080 Gigabyte z270 at 1080p and an SSD. I understand that's not really a potato but I get 60fps consistently on maxed out settings. Do I need maxed out settings? No and I would have no qualms changing them if I needed to. Also I haven't experienced hardly any loads times (which is a huge improvement over what I've seen on consoles).I do think the game is pretty well optimized considering how taxing the game itself is compared to how well it runs. In case you aren't aware the game loads the entire level and all of it's ecosystem onto the CPU because the game is trying to balance an entirely interactive ecosystem AT THE SAME TIME!!!! The maxed graphics aren't a joke either. Personally I think that's freaking amazing and it really develops a sense of a ""hunt through an environment"" kind of feel compared to previous Monster Hunter games where the monsters tended to stay in the same areas rather than moving around and interacting with other monsters and geography. Capcom clearly spent a lot of time developing this game and it seriously has paid off.The people that seem to have a hard time enjoying this game are the people that want this game to run above 60fps at max settings and above 1080p. If that is your priority in games then you may want to consider an upgrade if you want to run this game as well as you run Overwatch or something. This game is huge and clearly is something more akin to a Next Gen game. All the PC reviewers say they didn't have a problem getting the game to run on various hardware with a little tweaking. My monitor doesn't support above 1080 so it's not a problem to be. If you've got a $6000 PC to run this game in 120fps and 4k good for you. If you don't you can still play this game and have a blast while doing it. This game from what I can tell is already a vast improvement in quality and performance over the more easily optimized consoles (where I've seen they can be rather taxing on consoles as well despite being optimized).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I wanted to play with friends on the PC at some point.Then played Dauntless (at first it was fun but it was actually a terrible designed game).Monster Hunter world came out... Alot more fun than dauntless.The main point of the game is Kill stuff make gear to kill better and harder stuff to improve your character. Skills are tied to your armour and weapons so equip the right stuff for enemies to make it easier. The best thing about the game is the ecosystem mechanics. When you explore around the map there is a ""Food chain"" where certain enemies will react differently to each other. 2 or more monsters are more likely to have turf war where one will do more damage to the other. This will guarantee material drops from creatures which is useful in the later game.People will complain about this game about Denuvo but who actually gives a flying about it. Multiplayer is a pain in the to connect as you have to find your friends in the ""Bulletin board"" and find the right session stuff. If only you could stay in a party forever (even in the main lobby) but it's a small price to pay for a good game.Try as many weapons as possible to test your play style. Different weapons will suit different battles. Bows if you need to attack certain parts. The Insect Glaive if you want to mount the creature to slow it down. The combinations should be used in tandom with what you think would assist with the battles.

I have faith that Capcom will eventually address the issues considering they are still developping content for the game. But if you are too worried about the problems just follow the game and wait till the problems are addressed. Overall it's still the game the game I loved on the PS4 (not pro) but now with non of those minute long loading screens and occasional frame drops that came with it.

Tons of upgrades little side quests to go through and you get a Palico friend! Yay! Also you can meet your friend's Palicos in the field! DOUBLE YAY!

2018-08-13,0,0,77,False,Recommended,My review will be more targetted towards people who have the console version already and want the PC version or are wondering if the PC version is superior to console (spoiler it is).One of the best console games of 2018 has (finally) made it's PC debut. The reviews/ratings of the console versions effectively carry over here as it is a pretty direct port of the console version. While the graphics have not been increased you are able to run the max graphics of the game while staying at 60+ fps something consoles cannot do (you must pick one or the other. Best graphics or stable fps).As an owner of the PS4 version and running it on the newer PRO version of the console it's pretty obvious that the PC version to no one's surprise is the superior one. The game runs wonderfully on my medium high build PC and I have every setting turned to High/Highest. If you want to run the game on medium/high you should be able to do so with a PC made in the last couple years that cost around the $1000 mark.A lot of reviews are commenting on the network and I must say I'm disappointed. Everyone seems to be forgetting that consoles had the EXACT same issues at launch and after like a week or two you almost never saw them again. Like every other game that has released in the past few years the servers aren't able to handle the massive strain of player increase just yet. I predict within a month it'll be just fine. Just like the console version.Here's a run down of what you get for getting the PC version compared to a PS4 Pro. Graphics can be run on high and you keep your 60 fps which as I said earlier on console you must choose between the two. Load screens are a joke now. While on console they can be long (longer for older consoles) on PC I have yet to have a load screen take more than 5 seconds. Quest load times are also a joke now. On console you wait like 10+ seconds and then you can start the quest. On PC (from my experience) it's borderline instant every time to the point where I don't notice it getting the quest ready. It just is ready that fast.Cons Keyboard and Mouse controls are acceptable and will likely have to be customized to the user's liking but it's certainly not the way to play. No matter what I changed them to I couldn't shake the feeling I was playing the game wrong. Which I technically am. The game was made with controller in mind and I strongly recommend using one if you have it.And for people commenting on the lip sync it is my understanding that the lip sync was made with the Japanese version of the game in mind and we got a direct translation. Unlike anime where they attempt a 'rough' translation and will match syllables to make the mouths line up as best as possible to English words. Monster Hunter took the route of just directly translating everything and the mouth ends up wherever. I personally couldn't care less the story isn't what I'm here for.TL DR It's a good game with a solid port and I'll likely sink over a thousand hours into it just like I did with the console version. I just wish there was a way to transfer my save file from console so I don't have to do everything over but I'll live.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The 2nd patch fixed all the multiplayer issues for me and I'm finally able to experience the multiplayer just like I did on PS4!Hoping they will fix the texture issues soon... This is a collection of workarounds for the issues I faced. I'm currently using a GTX1080 so I'm not running into FPS issues for the time being. I'm currently running the game on the highest settings other than volumetric rendering which I turned to ""Low"".I played for more than 200 hours on the PS4 and was hoping to transition to PC but I ran into a number of issues A. Mouse input lagB. Textures not as high resolution as I'd have likedA. Mouse input lagMost people recommend turning off vsync which I did at first but it really made screen tearing very bad. Others recommend turning up the mouse sensitivity in game to more than 50 which I also did. I have set mine to 60. This made the game more tolerable.I also did something slightly different and it seems to have some effect. First I kept vysnc ON to prevent screen tearing. Mouse sensitivity in game is still at 60.Second I went into the nVidia control panel and changed ""Maximum Pre rendered Frames"" to 1 for MHW. It occurred to me that vsync in this game was introducing too much mouse lag compared to other games and perhaps double buffering was to blame. If so double buffering could be avoided since they are probably rendering onto a rendertarget anyway (granted my DirectX knowledge was from years ago and probably outdated).B. Textures not as high resolution as I'd have likedThis workaround is a lot more subjective. In the nVidia Control Panel I used these settings for MHW Texture filtering Anisotropic sample optimization (Off)Texture filtering Negative LOD bias (Clamp)Texture filtering Quality (High Quality)Texture filtering Trilinear optimization (Off)to attempt to increase the sharpness of the textures. It seems to be working for me. Hopefully Capcom will solve the texture resolution issue observed by Digital Foundry.The gameplay is stil the same good gameplay from the PS4 version.

All of the online features and the way you connect/play with others is identical to previous games so how hard can it be to get something that was already perfected to work on better hardware and presumably better servers as times have moved on??The conectivity issues have completely ruined one of best aspects of this whole game HUNTING WITH YOUR FRIENDS!! So far after trying atleast 50 times I have been able to connect to one of my friends and play through 1 quest YES just 1 quest to completion...all other times the game gives you an error message and kicks you with no option to reconnect to that friend to carry on. How can you create such a masterpiece then fall short with something like that it's not as if we are connecting to 99 other players to do a battle royale just 3 other players and you cannot make that work...?I am one of those people that has waited so long for what I thought was going to be the best monster hunter to date and after reaching HR13 and playing the whole thing bar one game solo I am extremely dissapointed I will not recommend people buy this game until the connectivity issues are fixed as the multiplayer aspect was sold as such a central part to the game which is completely broken CAPCOM FIX YOUR GAME!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Until they are addressed put your money into other games that interest you. Edit They have released a patch which sorts some of the online issues and I have done a few sessions without any of the disconection issues as such I have changed to a might reccomend for those that want to play it in that regard.21 9 is still not nativly supported and one of the mods might or might not work as of the update to this review so we don't know if and or when they would be getting that sorted for those with ultrawide monitors so keep that in mind you will still be playing with pillar boxing should you decide to purchase and play this on an ultrawide.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,44,False,Recommended,An MH release that doesn't hold much resemblance to its predecessors especially in terms of difficulty (Game begins to pick up at HR 14 with Nergigante). Its the first MH game to be released that isn't beginner hostile and it practically handicaps you from the start. To all the MH veterans out there there is simply no excuse to cart on any quest below HR 14 as the game is literally a walk in the park before then. The multiplayer is semi functional tried it a couple of times but never finished any quests because it would constantly boot me at random intervals. It's also worth mentioning that this is the first MH title that I haven't felt a desire to acquire and max every single armour set I come across (Not sure why maybe because this game doesn't make me feel at home). Another thing to mention is that this is the first and only MH game to have any form of paid DLC (Previous titles only had free DLC). Overall its still an enjoyable gaming experience and it would make for a decent starting point for any newcomers to the MH series. But for the older folks it would probrably be better for us to stick with MH4U or Generations Ultimate/ Double Cross as they make for a much more traditional and nostalgic Monster Hunting experience.

2018-08-22,0,0,111,False,Not Recommended,The gameplay is good the best out of every monster hunter if you just embrace that you will spend half a hunt just chasing a monster who won't stop fleeing but that's just nitpicks.That's about it on the positives i have about the game as many reviews the online doesn't work the graphics options are lacking the visuals are quite blurry menu navigation especially the itembox its a chore to navigate with how its done.What is the purpose of making a Gathering Hall if there is no practical usage for it aside from taking arena quests that are only available to up to two people the chatbox is a mess you will lose your friends messages that will be drowned by NPC speech and if you still stay ingame connected online you are greeted by solo missions because everyone needs to solo view the cutscenes for every story mission making coop play which is the most fun part of the whole game a huge pain.Not to mention when you're playing online and someone disconnects randomly which happens from time to time you are left with taking down a multiplayer buffed monsters all by yourself.What made me make this review is that after the end boss my game keeps crashing at the credits everytime (fixed by installing and running the game on another machine didn't see you needed a minimum of two pc's on the minimum requirements for this game). kindly waiting for the future patch fix and i sure hope its a big one.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I dont know why everyone is complaining about the controls they seem fine to me (Though I dont use targeting at all so that may be why but I think its cheating anyway). The multiplayer is a bit fragile but it was the same on console and Capcom isnt known for its stable multiplayer anyway. It works good enough to play with friends though and in SOS missions.

Being a PS4 player I know some quest isnt easy for beginners so not having the online play is pretty bad. If you are here to dive into the game with your friends i'd recommend you not to get this game yet as you might be disappointed with the fact that the online play is fully broken. You will enter the quest with your friends but a few minutes in you are bound to disconnect. Until the server side is fixed...

2018-08-10,0,0,235,False,Recommended,i5 4590GTX 660It's OK if u don't look up at the trees. And it's not like the game is crushing or something like that u just don't want to with max low graphics. Believe me.The bad thing is I already played for 2 hours and couldn't refund if wanted to and I haven't played with real person yet. It's not about dead online it's about TOO LONG tutorial in camp. I wish they added more fighting at the beginning so people could test how their PCs doing with this game earlier. Up 'til now the game feels pretty friendly to newcomers and a bit more casual in some ways comparing to MH Freedom Unite for PSP.Upd. 2Played for 22 hours and still enjoying it. No crushes no freezing. Online isn't very stable ( party were disbanded several times during the day and it's really annoying since I'm using horn) but alive alas the game just made it to the PC release and it's too early to judge how long will it stay like this. As for the gameplay I've got what I was expecting to. Upd. 3You know what? F this sh! I can't kill elder dragon not because team is dying but because I'm disconnecting. And here's one interesting thing when somebody joins the hunt the monster is getting stronger but it doesn't work in other direction so when server is playing opossum you're just staying alone with 4x stronger monster.

Plays better in PC but the netcode is terrible a metric ton of conectivity issues since launch. PLUS it's a ported version from consoles and it's not up to date with content? how come? This should have been some sort of ""Definitive Editon"" or some other buzzword game companies like to stick on their re releases. As I said before a great game that sorely needs better multiplayer support and its full roster of monsters to fight. For these things I can't possibly recommend MHW in its current state. I'll gladly update my review when the issues get ironed out.*Edit* The Network issues seem to be completely fixed and DLC content is getting released.

2018-08-12,0,0,213,False,Recommended,FINAL REVIEW.A solid Monster Hunter game worthy to be the first Monster Hunter port to PS4/PC. Since the connection issues have been 90% solved I recommend this game to any fans of Monster Hunter Player Vs Bosses games and Souls fans.+Breathtaking visuals. This game will amaze you with how well crafted and beautiful the New World is.+Interactive. That rock hanging around? You can shoot it to drop on the monsters. The level is your weapon aside from the ones you're carrying around+Tight hitboxes. There are very few exceptions but most of the time I got hit when I'm bad or greedy.+Fleshed out weapons. Each of the weapons are unique. Like other MH games but fleshed out even more with new combos and finishers. Bland weapon design. Except a notable few weapons are kind of boring to look at Limited monsters and monster archetypes. 30 monsters is not a lot in any MH games. And they're mostly wyvern/dragon types with a few fanged beasts and what not. Paolumu is a nice change of pace but I need that RAJANG to be in this game.+/ Streamlined mechanics. While some of the features are an improvement (the pods) and should be kept in future games there are some mechanics in this game which I feel has been too streamlined (wheres my paint ball). This makes the game far too easy compared to any previous MH titles even more when combined with keyboard/mouse controls.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-04,0,0,73,False,Recommended,A lot of people are complaining about this game but I ve had a more than fenomenal experience. Yes the online is hard to use but when you learn that the sos flares is the only way to play with random people you ll have a good time. I recommend creating your own session and starting a quest then using your sos flare. People will join you instantly. You can see what weapons and armor they have and if they suck rly bad and die you can kick them. Problem solved.They are so many aspects to this game that make it amazing. They really stuck to their roots and focused on the best part of the game which is finding cool monsters in the wild using your Sacajawea powers killing them then making cool out of their flesh.In regard to graphical issues I m playing on a great cpu garbage gpu and I can run on low settings looks great with 60 FPS.750ti with i7 3770k,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,386,False,Recommended,Platinumed the game twice on PS4 and now PC. Easily sank more than 700 hours combined across platforms. MH games are time drainers always have and always will be. Content gets drip fed (Kulve Lunastra Behemoth etc.) to try and prolong your investment but I think that Capcom is being dumb by waiting too long. The main story is a hot mess just bear with it to get to the fun hunts instead of looking for footprints for stupid amounts of time.A lot of initial release problems have been fixed through patches (constant session DCs frame issues with elemental damage etc.) made the game suck real hard in the beginning. Not the case anymore. I don't get superb frames but it definitely takes a spicy sh!t on the PS4 Pro now.Multiplayer works pretty good. Having dedicated servers instead of P2P is definitely great. Very little lag or latency. Playing with randoms is a grab bag in terms of efficiency/experience. Don't use mic in game you'll get no response or some beaner breathing into the mic with caso cerrado in the background. Stick with text chat or talk on another platform. Try to play with either only 4 players or by yourself because of how monster health scales. Let Hammer/HH prioritize the head otherwise they do p!ss damage the whole hunt. Kick any player that carts more than twice in a hunt. Kick any player that aggros an elder before bombing/buffing/dropping rocks/etc. Immediately improves your sanity during hunts. A lot more communication on PC version than PS4. Having a squad of Koreans means you kill the monster sub five minutes. Mod scene is just starting to bud. Many QoL mods (getting the handler to not look like a pig and to shut up are some pretty good ones) coming onto the scene. Quest editors are out if you want to create a decent challenge for yourself and others. Transmog mod should be added to base game but Capcom has a fetish for slowly releasing layered armor for some reason. Audio replacement mods in the works (still waiting to be able to hotswap Bazelgeuse roar with Loud Nigra scream). Only ones that are really out right now are the one that replace title/Astera/quest complete/fail themes with some old MH themes and the ones that replaces the Hunting Horn melodies with Toto Africa.Overall get it if you got an above average PC because you'll def need it to run decently. This game is an MMORPG(lite). If you don't like grinding leave. Try out all the weapons switching up your weapon feels like a whole new game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-21,0,0,263,False,Recommended,"Edit 9/30 Definitely worth the buy you get your moneys worth out of it you can play the entire game solo or multiplayer and the options for weapons are awesome this is my first MHW game and i love it. i dont do console or like ds/switch so i have no interest in the other games but since this one is on pc and doesnt look like it belongs in the early 2000's it looks great runs great and keeps you busy. Great game but the way it runs and how unstable the multiplayer is right now is just awful its been almost 2 weeks and still no patches or real word other than a ""we know theres an issue"" from capcom so hopefully they get everything sorted out so i can give this game a good and propper review. its Super fun all around but right now im basically stuck with single player for the most part.EDIT the MP is now a whole lot more stable but theres still the issue of Thunder weapons and teostra destroying FPS. and it also needs more content ive finished everything there is to do so im hoping they turn on deviljho dlc on the 6th when they are supposed to have an update.Edit 9/5 deviljho is coming out on the 6th they are also fixing the thunder weapons fps issue unsure if this will include a hidden patch for teostras pixels but i hope so. great game and capcom is doing awesome to fix stuff so im changing this to a positive review. totally worth the money and its such a fun game.

2018-08-13,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World has been the most fun game I have played in a long time. I have only played 2 games before this and I would say it's a great improvement and change to the other series. The attacks and dodges are more responsive. No need to hassel and paintball monsters every couple minutes. Extra inventory by not needing to prepare paintballs nets and pickaxes. Ability to play bowguns similar to a third person shooter (playing range on the DS was a nightmare). Maps are huge with secret camps NPCS and cats scattered around. Monster on monster action!!! The weapon upgrade tree is amazing. The environment has so many cool interactions with basic attacking or even using the slinger shot on flash bugs healing wasps sleeping/ paralysis toads etc. I could continue talking to someone for hours about this game.As for the cons I would say like many other people the disconnecting part sucks. Sometimes I cannot join a matchmaking lobby or my friend's game. The way I have found that seems to work is to start offline then join an online lobby. Also the connection seems to work better if you join one with more people in it instead of a private lobby. Another con is that there's people but it's rare to actually hunt with a random person. People seem to stick to themselves or their groups. Also since the maps are so large without the scoutflies guiding you up and down the levels it can be very confusing when on an expedition. Plus those egg quests are always awful.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,Before I start I just want to say that I love the Monster Hunter franchise and I bet that eventually all the flaws and issues with this game will be ironed out. However when people say this is a bad port they aren't kidding.Before I even started the game as I was tinkering with the options menu reading the forums and tooltips on what everything did I could visibly see how the options were having an effect as the main menu screen background would be at a noticable stutter or not.Then based on what others had said as well as a couple of websites for options that almost nobody had any clue what they did.. (Seriously what the hell is Z Prepass and SH Diffuse Quality?!)

Unlike some I've had zero 70% 100% CPU usage issues but what I have had is the game fluctuating between 10 24 FPS with cutscenes being at a lower FPS than the game itself! When a cutscene stutters the subtitles become out of sync and after a couple more stutters the audio video and text of the cutscene are all so out of whack that my first cutscene had no noise for the last 30 seconds and only had background ambience. Once I finally got to control my character I eventually noticed another weird issue even though my game was chugging at about 20 FPS the face portraits when a character was talking to you ran at a smooth 60 FPS... Yeah. Also during the game audio would randomly cut out for a split second.Currently I've changed my Resolution Scaling to Mid Anisotropic Filtering to Mid and Shadow Quality to Mid and whilst I'm now above 30 FPS in game there are still notable issues and I still haven't seen a cutscene with the new settings yet so I'm dreading my next cutscene.My next steps are possibly turn off Vsync and update my graphics drivers. This is obviously a very bad port as Final Fantasy 15 is smooth for me. If you cannot handle the woes of FPS issues wait a while.Edit Upon updating my nVidia drivers I have had a massive FPS boost immediately with a few minor issues still. Not a smooth 60 FPS yet but unlike the time of writing this it's more enjoyable now. Still a bad port though so the neg rating remains for now.Editx2 Nevermind it just chugs once it's been running for a bit... me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There is nothing more annoying and tedious than preparing for a hunt only to lose connection due to your infamous error and having to start from scratch.

Network is not perfect but certainly better than many other AAA multiplayer games. Most definitely worth a buy._Long &amp Boring Version_So... I read all of the positives and negatives as this game was realeased. Naturally I waited for good ol' Captain Com to get his ship sailing straight again. Upon my entry into this game I was expecting some of the reported issues to plague me.Reported Problems Motion Blur Shennanigans Poor Mouse &amp Keyboard Emulation Crashes and Network Hiccups Save File Corruption Graphics Hiccups &amp Poor Texture WorkI have played for roughly 130 hours at the time of this review and made decent progress with friends. I have been pleasantly suprised by the lack of most all of these reported problems from occuring. I personally did not notice any severe oversusage of motion blur. Mouse and keyboard controls seemed fine given the combat style of the game. No crashes network hiccups only happened to me when I had been AFK for hours. Only one case where a friend dropped session and that was likely due to the fact that he lives several continents away from me and has questionable internet to begin with. I did not run into the dreaded end game crash followed by save corruption. Textures and graphic design are on par given the complexity of animations. Though I do have some nit picks overall I did not see any reason to downvote this game. Personal Nit Picks Armor coloring should not be a later game feature there is no rational reason to withold that function. Some armor coloring lacking in detail as many armor layers ignore color choice other than their accents. UI default controls tried to remake the wheel but failed miserably. Lacks cosmetic slots/cosmetic freedom (You either look good and function poorly or you function ideally and look like a garbage monster fell into BDSM convention). Tutorial system is questionable as many key quality of life mechanics are not intelligently brought to a new player's attention (i.e. Field camp Tent system auto crafting usage of cannons and balistae etc.). Hunter's notes lack convenient information regarding little things like slinger ammo types/details enviromental trap details Monster turf war details thing in general that any sensible hunter would keep... yeh know... hunting notes of.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-06,0,0,111,False,Recommended,PROS Great combat. Different weapons and armor builds suit multiple (and possibly endless?) playstyles. New and returning monsters except Bazel....I hate Bazel.... FREE DLC except emotes/cosmetics. 4 big and beautiful maps . Collect small and rare animals to place in your home . No more pixelizted 3DS graphics. You can easily sink a TON of hours into this game . An okay story better than past games. Mantles and slingers are a fun addition.CONS Garabage port insulting to those who waited 6+ months for pc release. Can't disable motion blur. Frames CONSTANTLY dip. Low armor textures possibly a bug. The grind to unlock tempered elder dragons feels way too padded. Endgame is boring grind elder dragons to get decorations and augments just to fight more of those same elder dragons. Weapon designs are lazy a lot of weapons use the same iron &amp bone base with just a little scales sprinkled on top. (A big downgrade from the older games) Since this is an all new HD game they can't just re use assests from previous 3DS titles but that shouldn't be an excuse for these boring/repetitive designs. Playing with friends through the story is a pain because you both have to start the quest separately watch a cutscene then one person abandons and joins the other's quest. Gathering hub is pointless because you can accept quests from several locations in the town hub so nobody goes there.Once again it's up to the modding community to fix all of these problems.There are a lot of cons to this game but I still recomend it because it's a REALLY fun game.

2018-08-19,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Updated on 26AUG2018. After spending some time on the steam forums for this game I have found lots of technical fixes that have solved 99% of the issues I had for this game. Multiplayer is now working fine and after some optimization to my settings graphical bugs and other small technical glitches have been solved.Have to say that this game is 100% worth picking up.Game needs to be polished. Has some optimization issues and online play is hard to get working as of 19AUG2018. Besides those issues the game is fun to play. If you enjoy the monster hunter series then this is definatly the game for you. If you feel like the game may be too buggy or rough around the edges for you then give it a week or two. Or wait for the game to be on sale on steam. Time will fix the issues most people have with this game.Over all a blast to play but hold off for a little while if you arnt 100% sure this game is for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,184,False,Recommended,Multiplayer is broken 100% its like a major troll as the difficulty scales up but once everyone gets kicked out of your match it does not scale back down ( and they will get kicked out very very rare can you kill a beast befoer everyone gets DC. Most of my friends wont play since we cant stay connected.......Its a fun game but was sold on the multiplayer aspect of the game. I would be so much further in the game if it was not for the damn DC's .once it is fixed i will change my review Gameplay 10/10Multiplayer 1/10If you prefer solo then this will be great for you please ignore my rant.8/26/18 seems most multiplayer bugs have been fixed Still a alt tab issue but this is minor. I will change my review to recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-26,0,0,370,False,Recommended,The game itself is very much fun. Going in solo is certainly not less enjoyable in my opinion but hunting with others is much more fun. IMO Pros about this game Satisfying single player experience upto to completion of the game missions(60 80hrs) of gameplay afterwhich the multiplayer becomes the strength of this game. Hunting with others is much more fun.Different weapons to choose and play with is another great thing about this game. The grinding depends on your preference if you want to stick to one weapon of your choice as story progresses you get the required materials to upgrade it to the fullest anyway with maybe a few more hunting.Cons Multiplayer. Earlier you would used to get disconnect mid game for no apparent reasons but apparently they patched it and now you dont get disconnected abruptly. I played several times after the patch not a single disconnect. But the problem still persists in different form though. You can't find any sessions nor SOS most of the time. It seems there is a specific time of the day when you can actually find matches. In a nutshell the matchmaking scene now is for most part of the day you search you get 1 2 lobbies to join with 2 3 people to play with and for the other part of the day you will get lots of lobbies and SOS.Other issues such as port fps drop saves getting deleted I have not experienced so far.With That said I will still recommend this game. 20 30hr satisfying single player experience. Multiplayer not really that bad(no disconnects midgame) although it still has issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-26,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,"Game should be good but it's just bug after bug after bug.They released a patch to fix some of the connection problems and broke other things (sos) it has maybe the worst matchmaking i've ever seen in a videogame. It's clunky and unreliable to play with a friend it's difficult to join and it doesn't work everytime maybe you get lucky maybe you don't.You can play the story with a friend but it's just a complicated mess and it's easier and faster to play alone.Texture bug it sets a lot of textures to the lowest setting and keeps them for the entire game so it sucks when you play and it sucks when you watch cutscenes a mess.You need an external fix (special k mod) to ease the unnecessary work on the cpu default it just creates a bilion of process and gimp your cpu performance graphic or texture aren't something special (standard work) so it's just the port that's ed up.Under the pletora of bad things there's maybe a good game but for now it's just a mess and they are asking 60 for it after 8 months of delay for the optimization of the port yeah guys good job i guess.Lastly it's not on par with the console updates they will release them later on after some more delay not bad.More than half of the hours i played were full of problems and bugs as stated above so i can't really recommend it right now watching how ""fast"" they released the first fix i think it'll be a long wait before it becomes mostly bug free sadly.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

(no seriously its meant to be hard)Now onto the main bit as a monster hunter game it is sweet great world interesting new mechanics good level design interesting new creatures and more than i can really think of at the moment. there are some problems that i have with them making as many basicaly tutorial monsters as they did and som hitboxes are wierd as but thats somewhat normal for the games as a whole and none of those are game breaking in any way. new combos for weapons are cool but sometimes almost exsessive on some. now onto the multiplayer...................(sigh.........)capcom has a tried and true system they had forever that worked well on the wii and all their handheld games however when they implemented this onto us on steam they added the steam social settings and interface(which just updated and is still quite buggy) into the mix and is making thing rather ed when trying to get a stable game connection to anyone or anything at the moment.

2018-08-14,0,0,111,False,Recommended,I was pretty confused seeing this game have a Mixed review on Steam so i decided to chime in and give my thoughts.If you wondered if this game is well optimized to be honest its passable.You can see that team who worked on the port aren't very experienced in PC gaming. Hell its even been confirmed in interviews. Don't expect a constant 60 fps expect a few dips when there is a lot on screen (4 people + 3 monsters for exemple).The online stability is also uneven. Joining lobbies is a bit of pain but playing with friends and responding to S.O.S call work perfectly. Might be because there is too much people but i heard that even on the PS4 version it had similar problem (on a smaller scale). Might get better has time goes on i hope.Its my first Monster Hunter and ill be honest i love the gameplay. Its feels like an arcade version of Darks Souls mixed with Shadow of the Colossus if you ever played those. Killing a monster is super satisfying and gettting new equipement is exciting.Overall i really like this game. Its not perfect but it is good in my opinion.

2018-08-16,0,0,136,False,Recommended,9.5/10 Honestly one of the serious reviews Im going to write/type Pros 1. Beautiful game and amazing scenerey. Followed by that confusing yet satisfying storyline. 2. Character customization is satisfying and simple. 3. Gameplay is nice and easy to understand with a controller. Partial controller support doesnt mess with the controller settings at all. In fact its is pretty good. 4. Monsters are aesthetically pleasing to the eye and each one has a difficulty scale (basically means as you progress each monster is going to be harder to ) 5. if you have a well balanced pc set up game runs smoothly and without any troubles or fps drops. However as a warning it has troubles with i5 cpu's and from my knowledge refuses to work with them. Im using an AMD Ryzen 5 1600x six core processor. 6. Single player is very fun and enjoyable. Always remember to back up your save files for this game in case anythjing goes wrong. Dark Souls players im talkin about you ). 7. If you dont like players comming into your games and ing you in the then fret not because there is no pvp. Again if you ever played Dark Souls you know what Im talking about. 8. This game is very grindy so if you like to grind then this is the game for you! ANY ING MMORPG PLAYER THAT EXISTS IN THIS GODDFORSAKEN WORLD KNOWS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. Now for the cons of this game 1. The multiplayer is very flawed as the servers are trash and make it difficult for any friends to play together and raid monsters. 2. As I stated in the previous comment this game is not very friendly to the people that have low end pc set ups do not complain if you have a low end pc set up. Like jesus ing christ read the goddamn requirements it even says that you have to run the game on low to even play it in the MINIMUM sytem requirement description. 3. This game has alot of quality flaws especially relying on steam overlay for controller support. This is a huge pain in the and honestly if you dont want to go through the hassle with that jsut use the mouse/keyboard. It legit took me 2 hours to figure out how to get my ps4 controller set up on the pc to steam overlay. There are also moments when monsters can just appear magically out of nowhere and I dont mean the grubs I mean the big mother ers. Also the hitboxes on some of the boss monsters are really broken. 4. This is not CapComs first pc game to come out on steam. This is the Monster Hunter Teams development crew for the first pc release. If you wondered why the game is even though they delayed the schedule for the pc release is because they focused more on the aethetics of the game instead of the quality and feel of it which is a big step to the no direction. Also the Monster Hunter series was originally a console only game for them to be stepping out of the comfort zone and actually releasing this game on PC is a big step for them and more than likely are fixing the problems as everyone is writing angry reviews about it. In conclusion if you are new to the monster hunter series and want to buy this game just to say that you played it and call out about it then dont buy it because its a waste of money for you and a waste of time for them. If you have a low end pc build then dont buy this game because it will crash on you and burn your pc alive. Remember that most of the series was developed for nitendo software and sony so even though they did have an extra 7 months to actually perfect this game its honestly pretty hard and the change is vastly different. This game is more than likely not the finished product because there are still a hella ton of monsters to be added and the final fantasy XV crossover to be added in as well. Im happy with the gameplay so far and not experienced any issues except for the multiplayer and a good bit of bugs. But I expected this beforehand even when they said that they will be releasing this at a later date because they did not even do any testing or even set up test servers. Expect this game to be a hit when they fix most of the bugs and the multiplayer issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I understand there was a lot about this game that was going to be rocky with the transition to a new platform but there were several things that could have been done better. That being said there were also a lot of positives and if the mistakes are learned from MHGU and future games look very very promising.To be honest my expectations for this game were quite high and so that may have had a factor in it.

2018-08-19,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Network issues on a game that took 8 additional months to be released on this platform. That is unacceptable. If it has anything to do with the Denuvo DRM that has been known to be total #### then once again capcom has shown their craptasticly bad ability to produce a proper port. Don't buy until Network features are actually fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,158,False,Recommended,as a long time fan I can say that while the game is perhaps too streamlined compared to previous iterations. It's a fantastic experience with a new sense of freedom in playstyle movement and progression.10/10 will continue to slap wyverns with sharp pointy things for days to come.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-27,0,0,683,False,Recommended,Despite what people says the team behind the game has made an incredible job bringing the game a month earlier because they knew we were so eager to play it adding jho out of nowhere and now have our first huge event as MHW PC.The only real issues were at launch the network stability (wasn't great) and the last week update ( I was among those who couldn't launch the game ) but they provided a quick feedback making it clear that they were working on it and they do listen to the community in general.People are taking things for granted way too much Capcom brought us a wonderful high graphics MH game on PC thing I was waiting since my first MH game Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on Wii. Content isn't overflowing like in the previous games but the previous games lets be honest was mainly copy paste the out of everything we did the past decade and the graphics/dynamics can't be even compared (don't get me wrong I love the old games).I wish for this game to succeed in the long run because I want more of it and I believe they are going in the right way.Did I mentioned the only priced DLC are cosmetics?! in freaking 2018...ungrateful childs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,193,False,Recommended,TLDR Game is honestly fun especially playing with others. It delievers exactly what you would expect from the title alone. Even if you haven't played any other MH games it is a really great game to jump into. It has a dark souls vibe in the boss fights but the open world and exploration of zelda the last breath. The only downsides are the talk/messaging interface and the prevelant connection issues. However that is sorta expected due to it being their first port to pc and only recently coming out. Pros +Combat is a blast.+The monsters. The monsters are all unique and vary in difficulty. It is all about getting into a rythm and learning their move sets. When you beat one you feel a sense of accomplishment+Gear. The gear in the game is really good. There isn't a long grind to get the gear you want. It normally just takes killed the monster who has it a couple times or doing quests to trade in items for it.+Weapons define combat experience. There is bound to be a weapon you love.+Multiplayer is great when you get to the end game or just play with friends+Visuals. The game looks amazing.+Music. The score is absoultely amazing. Every monster has its own score+Controls. The controls are easy and straight forward.Neutrals. The story itself is alright NPCs are alright only a few are memorable Palicos (cat companions) can be useful or useless. There is hardly a middle ground. They will save you or get you killedCons. Cutscenes ruin multiplayer. You and your friends have to indivdualy start the same quest if it has a cutscene and watch the cutscenes by yourselves. Then all but one of you leave the quest and join one person who did not leave and is still in their quest. Overall it makes for a poor experience doing story quests. Past the story though it is GREAT Optimization. The game can be a struggle to run depening on your rig but with an i5 and msi 1060 it runs smooth. Just turn off fog and anti aliasing and you should be good. Also cap fps at 60. Servers. Their are a bunch of server problems. The main one being a communication error between the players and the servers. This leads to leaving parties and having to continue quests/fights solo. Hopefully this is fixed later on as this happens normally when games first come out. Conclusion When you are playing and everything is fine with the servers. You'll love the game. The fighting the music the graphics all great. The game when it is working is honestly one of the best to come out recently. It works 90% of the time. The servers are the only problem but if you want to play solo then you are perfectly fine and will have a blast. The pros outweight the cons if you can deal with the server problems. They shouldn't last too much longer hopefully.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I also just learned I can fling myself in the air during combat and come crashing down on the monster. It's a fun game connections work fine for me but my only complaint is there is so much to learn. I have no idea how to do most everything in the game except bash in some skulls. Still I look forward to playing more and learning more because this game gets deep.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,23,False,Recommended,Not the world's best port but far from the worst. The game itself is fantastic. Easily one of the best Monster Hunter titles to date and not to be missed. If you've got the console version it's worth waiting for the issues to be fixed. However if you've never played Monster Hunter before or you've been waiting for this instalment to hit PC get it immediately.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,154,False,Not Recommended,After three days (25 hours playing time) I can already see this is going to be an awesome game EXCEPT the multiplayer is broken.

2018-08-14,0,0,81,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World encapsulates everything I ever wanted on a Monster Hunter game since I first played Freedom Unite on the PSP. That being said I love the game to bits. The only problem I have with this title is that it's far too demanding for what it is. My system can run it fine at 30 45 fps with high settings although I can run other recently released games with bigger maps better looking effects more complex models and physics at 60. This game although very beautiful in it's art style has no excuse to be so demanding on a system given the overall quality of the graphics and map sizes. If your system can run it even at 30 fps buy it. It's one of the most fun games I've ever played but make sure to set reasonable expectation on how the game looks versus what it demands on your system given the current issue.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,The whole muliplayer aspect of the game is dysfunctional for now but the game itself is fun so far. I'd suggest waiting for the devs to fix this major issue before giving it a try.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,150,False,Not Recommended,Running on an OC'ed i7 16 GB of RAM and an OC'ed GTX 1070. Playing with a PS4 Controller. Game runs smooth at 1440p60 with a mix of medium to ultra settings. Looks and plays gorgeous even though it is noticeable that it's a console port. It is a fun and rewarding game if you're willing to overlook the flaws that it has like instable online connectivity. I wouldn't mind most of the problems of this game but it is difficult to recommend if CAPCOM spend a whopping 7 months on this port only. If you're a diehard Monster Hunter fan then look no further than the PC version of the game. It is still the best version of this game. I can fully recommend it to people who love the franchise or Japanese RPGs in general. Otherwise wait for a sale.And CAPCOM please get your stuff together and deliver a proper port for the loyal fans that waited months instead of purchasing the console version.Review will be updated as necessary.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-30,0,0,133,False,Recommended,This game is extremely fun pc port works fine but you may want to use a controller instead of mouse/keyboard since they didn't spend much effort on pc controls. There are some issues with the latest graphics drivers which will cause your game to run like poop but if you do a bit of googling you can get around the issues pretty easily.Then what you are left with is what I said before an extremely fun game. This is the first entry into the monster hunter series for me and I was honestly amazed. Always thought I might like the series but was always hesitant due to a few concerns I had. But anyways once you actually get into the game it really is a completely unique experience. The weapons you use to hunt are have deep complexities to them that are easy at first to use but have nuances which makes mastering each of them an engaging challenge.The fights against monsters are very satifying it's basically a non stop chain boss battle. The monsters can be extremely deadly able to afflict you with deadly status conditions and knock you around without any effort. You'll be burned alive you'll be tossed off cliffs torn apart poisoned stunned and put to sleep only to be brutalized by devastating followup attacks. But as you play you'll begin to become just as deadly. Able to knock monsters out with perfectly timed charged attacks. Knock flying monsters out of the sky and out play the beasties in all sorts of interesting ways.Anyways the game is great the core game loop of hunting is rewarding enough to repeat for hundreds of hours of gameplay. I highly reccomend checking this game out despite the negative metascore at launch.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,187,False,Recommended,Ok i know probably none of you want to read 234 pages manoscript so i'll keep it as short as possible. If you ever played a MH game and enjoyed it but now you are not sure to buy this or not YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME. If you are new to the series and you are thinking about buying it YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME create a random character and rush the prologue you can reach the first actual boss before the 2 hours mark so you can refund if it's not you cup of tea. This game is just soooo worth at least a try. If you are like me and you feel it when you drop even 1 or 2 frames YOU SHOULD WAIT FUTURE PATCHES (because there will be patches stop moaning you crybabies). The game is not perfectly optimized and you will probably find yourself having some frame drops in certain specific situation. MINOR SPOILER ALERT Multiplayer has some issues with lighting weapons and Teostra ''final move'' can make you drop even 15 to 20 frames. I'm playing on a PC that can run almost everything Maxed out at solid 60 FPS. Final zone has an issue that make you drop 2/3 frames every few seconds my theory is that are the lighting on the screen causing it since every time they strike i lose the fps. If your intent is to play with your friends YOU SHOULD WAIT FUTURE PATCHES same story as above since the game it's not optimized you often find yourself kicked out of party even if hunt already started or if you are the party leader something the multiplayer will simply not work and you'll get an error on the screen and get put offline just do a quest and retry it worked for me a couple of times. Check spoilers for more info. If you are a Solo hunter YOU SHOULD 100% BUY THIS GAME i finished 85/95% of the quests (optional quests included) at this point and i did them all solo for the first run. If you dislike grinding games DONT BUY THIS GAME Monster Hunter World has alot of content and (hopefully soon) will get some updates from the ps4 with even more content but at the end of the day all you do il grinding monster for better gear even tho grinding against huge monsters is pretty epic if you really dislike those type of games sadly MHW is probably not for you. When you buy the game just do a quick check on the internet to see the OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION some option if maxed or even on Medium (Looking at you Volume Rendering Quality) are extremely heavy for the FPS even on good machines.With that being said i think thats all you people have to know about this game. Have a nice day!Sorry if there are some errors my english is pretty bad.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,39,False,Recommended,This is one of the best monster hunter games I have ever played. Sure it has it's problems like any of them but the support the devs are giving this despite this being their first foray into the PC gaming world is amazing *cough*nier automata got ZERO patches*cough* (not that nier is bad but it could have gotten some patches that weren't fan made to help optimization)Anyways rambling aside the graphics are great(use reshade to make them even prettier if you have a beefy computer) the music is awesome the monsters are intense and varied in their abilities and AI methods of skulking about the various maps you get plopped into. The multiplayer when it's working well is amazing. I love hunting with rando's and friends to take down beasties and get awesome gear and crafting materials to make traps potions bombs and more. This game is incredibly daunting for newbies I'm sure but once you get rolling in the mess with the rest of us you'll likely be having just as much fun. Try not to solo too much if you can help it and you will have a much better time of things. Only big problem I have is friends have to jump through hoops to assist you in story missions which I feel is pretty bad. Other than that big flaw the rest is pretty golden. I hope we get some optimization patches and other fun stuff! I look forward to battling behemoth and the murder pickle with friends soon!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,165,False,Recommended,"SHOULD I BUY THIS IF I'M NEW TO MONSTER HUNTER?Yes! Get it if you expect you'd like these games. If you're unfamiliar with this series then think of it this way A chunk of the playtime is focused on boss fights and the other chunk is dedicated toward planning for these boss fights. I like that. Preparation is fun and gives weight to each battle but not every one enjoys the downtime and ""grind."" You must take your time and develop a routine even though many new features make the process more convenient. Before buying World ask yourself if you'd find planning to be engaging or boring. And ask yourself if you're ready for a steep learning curve. There's a lot to take in but well worth it if you're in the mood for a complex experience. Also note that these games while high on atmosphere tend to be pretty light on story. From what I've seen so far World features the most developed plot yet but don't expect something robust like Final Fantasy or a Bioware game.SHOULD I BUY THIS IF I'M A SERIES VETERAN?Sure! Why not? I honestly would've passed on this if I still had my PSP and Nintendo 3DS. But I foolishly sold those and the games some time ago. Gone are my copies of Freedom Unite 3 Ultimate and 4 Ultimate. What a dummy! World wasn't calling out to me that much and my schedule no longer supports playing the series on a regular basis but I was getting nostaligc and wanted a Monster Hunter game at hand for whenever I had the itch to play.I've no regrets.While I found the numerous small changes overwhelming at first I came to appreciate these for making the game less annoying. Eg. Adding the equipment wishlist making certain items unlimited and always in your inventory (whetstone pickaxes fishing rod etc) the new approach to expeditions the approach to fast travel etc. I didn't mind the status quo (I like the grind) but I'm okay with the changes and don't really miss the old way of doing things. Some features aren't for me (eg. autocrafting) but these can be turned off or adjusted.I love the changes to skills. This encourages experimenting with different abilities and mixed armor sets. I LOVE IT. It really promises to make skills a matter of player preference and style.The changes to the combat system are awesome so far. I've seen people do ridiculously cool things in some gameplay footage though I've yet to master a lot of mechanics myself. I'm still working on incorporating slings into my battle plans. Combat seems slightly floatier than I remember but maybe that's just me.I really like how areas are treated as one unit no longer broken up by loading screens. Maps geniunely feel overwhelming in size. I'm still learning my way through the Ancient Forest. Scoutfiles were kind of annoying at first and their design should've been toned down a bit. It's a bit much to have them fly toward every nearby gathering point. They can be pretty distracting. Even so they are a neat immersive tool during monster hunts. Paintballs were passive and boring in comparison. I'm still disgesting my feelings toward the AI changes. I've only just run into the more aggressive monsters but wish that some others (eg. Great Jagras) weren't so passive before the hunter starts a fight. Then again I'm just starting the game. Monster on monster fights promise to be the most awesome thing ever. In any case the AI changes are an exciting development. More dynamic ""realistic"" AI is a great thing to have. Even if World doesn't stick the landing here I expect Capcom to improve the approach in future Monster Hunter games. I'm still digesting my attitude to the damage counters. The purist in me hates it but the scrub loves it. _ I'll probably turn it off later...Caveat I can't speak to the online experience since I haven't tried it yet. I've always been a single player kind of guy. There are some obvious problems however. See the ""Port"" section below for more info.BUT $60 IS A LOT OF MONEY...Anyone wanting more value may want to wait until the likely release of an ""Ultimate"" version featuring G rank or instead consider the upcoming release of Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate on the Switch (context I haven't played the original Generations so I can't compare this to World). Nonetheless this release of World still promises hundreds of hours of possible gameplay. Besides G Rank is proportionally the hardest mode so ""casual"" players can safely purchase World and still get their money's worth. Buying this on sale or via Humble Bundle will be a terrific deal. Series veterans may be put off by lack of G Rank. It's worth mentioning that I've heard late High Rank can be pretty difficult. I only just ran into Tobi Kadachi and Anjanath in Low Rank and um I had to drink a lot of potions for those fights. _ 'IS THE PORT GOOD?Good enough for me. World tends to run 50 to 60 fps on my laptop which features an Intel Core i7 7700HQ CPU 2.80 GHz GeForce GTX 1060 GPU and 16GB of RAM. I don't recall messing with the default graphics settings that much. Resolution sits at 1920x1080 texture at 1024 ambient occlusion at mid volume rendering quality at high shadow at high dynamic range at 64 bit. Pretty much everything is high. It hardly sticks to 60 fps and fell to as low as 45 during certain cut scenes but I got used to it. It's fine. I never think about frame rate after I turn off the counter. World crashed just once in almost 25 hours. Not perfect but I'm fine with that. It felt more like a freak accident more than anything. The game FEELS stable. This isn't modded Skyrim where every stutter induces anxiety. You should be fine though experiences may vary from rig to rig. Note that it runs fine on my computer with version 398.82 of the NVIDIA driver but other people report better results on driver version 398.36. Refer to https //steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/3/1745594817434182597/ for more information on that.The big sticking point for some people is online stability. The game routinely falls offline. Again I don't really care because I'm a single player kind of guy but multiplayer people will want to keep this in mind. Anyone with concerns about FPS or online connectivity should look at this August 14 2018 article for more information about resources etc https //kotaku.com/how to get monster hunter world working better on pc 1828335178. Hopefully Capcom will release a patch to improve performance. Fingers crossed!I lack an Xbox One and PS4 so I'm unable to compare the PC version to its console counterparts.TL DRNewbies should buy this if they expect to enjoy complex boss battles prefaced by lots of preparation. Veterans should buy this if they want a fresh experience or if they were stupid and sold all their other Monster Hunter games. Take the system requirements seriously because this is a pretty damanding game and has a reputation for poor optimization. Anyone looking for a multiplayer experience should be very catious before purchase because online connectivity remains an issue as of August 18 2018. Context I've played up to Hunter Rank 5. My save is at 16 15. I put in a total of almost 25 hours as of this review but a lot of that was spent in the character creator. I started the current hunter after I failed to anticipate my first appearing blindingly white in daytime scenes. _ '",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-31,0,0,278,False,Recommended,Amazing game. Connection issues and some optimazation issues aside I'm having a great time. It's all I play anymore and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

2018-08-19,0,0,171,False,Recommended,Definitely scratches a certain itch the core loop of hunting monsters to craft better gear to hunt more difficult monsters will keep you quite busy.The way the multiplayer co op is implemented is a bit shoddy sadly having to have watched a cinematic to play a story mission together and occasional connection issues.Recommended for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of grind and constant 'boss' battles.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-30,0,0,341,False,Recommended,I have been waiting for this game forever. Ever since playstation lost this series to nintendo after the ps2 era I have been waiting. Every year hopeful that a new version would be released on the newer generation of playstation consoles. I even had hoped it might move over to xbox just so I could get my fix. The hope never left me.Now! It is here! In all it's graphical beauty. I may have moved on to the PC stage and am happy to do so. I am in awe. I was truly blown away during what I believed was a cutscene but was amazed when I was viewing my player with all his detail and equipment during the movies. As I changed gear and new cutscenes emerged so too would my characters image during the playback. What a time. If you're in for a grindfest repeatedly killing monsters that are akin to Lightning Unicorns or Firebreathing Dragons or perhaps a Water Snake with constant evolving/devolving legs with different difficulties or maybe you'd like to try your hand at a Bomb dropping Armadillo then this is the game for you. Need the gear to be better equiped at the monster you're killing? You'll have to kill that monster multiple times. It's satisfying when you clearing a quest and have achieved victory. There are multiple weapons to use based on your preference with different attributes that you can craft as you farm the monsters you battle. You can craft gear based on the monsters as well (although you'll have to defeat them several times for the pieces you need). Then there are charms. A single item you can bring with you that gives you another boost to a skill based on the amount you have upgraded it. Then there is jewelry. Certain weapons/armor have slots you can place these jewels for another boost. The possibilities are endless.The community has been great. It's very easy to drop in and out of parties and everyone is generally very welcoming.The farming never stops and you'll get well worth what you've paid for. The wait is over and the hype train is here. All aboard!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Aside from the clear graphical overhaul Monster Hunter World doesn't do a *significant* enough things differently from other games to justify its cost without a stable online to play with friends. The game certainly would be amazing on sale as the single player content is certainly worth the money but given the game is MORE FUN with friends a n d t h e f e a t u r e s i m p l y d o e s n ' t w o r k c o n s i s t e n t l y I c a n o n l y r e c o m m e n d t h e g a m e w i t h e s s e n t i a l l y h a l f t h e f e a t u r e s i n c l u d e d f o r t h e p r i c e a n d f o r t h a t r e a s o n I s i m p l y c a n n o t r e c o m m e n d t h e g a m e .There are other minor nitpicks here and there but overall the game is rather phenomenal aside from the inconsistent online. I WILL update this review when online servers are fixed. But as it stands right now at the time of writing it I cannot say the game is justifiably worth the price.EDIT As of the patch made on the 23rd of August Connection issues have become minimal. I can HIGHLY recommend this purchase if you have the machine to run it. It's Monster Hunter on PC can't go wrong with this one if you have experience with Monster Hunter and with friends to play with even for new Hunters its a phenomenal experience. Happy Hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,183,False,Recommended,Been playing it since it came out and I still find it fun and enjoyable. Majority of the people complaining are about not being able to play online which isnt hard to figure out if you search it up. sure the cutscene thing is annoying for online story multiplayer but other than that its simple to figure out. i do wish it was more open world and would have been nice to see players walking around in astera.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,93,False,Recommended,As someone without a PS4 for the console version I'd recommend this overall. Issues Denuvo if you care about that. In terms of UI and display options pretty poorly optimized for PC with keyboard/mouse. Menus and submenus pop up in different places which would be fine on a controller but turns into constantly clicking different parts of the screen to get through just a few menus. Rather than using raw mouse input it instead uses the mouse to emulate a joystick. This means weird floaty feeling camera and menu controls. With enough tinkering I was able to make it feel playable at least. No field of view angle slider no option to turn off motion blur and depth of field. I haven't done much multiplayer but even singleplayer I get pretty frequent messages telling me I was disconnected. The couple hours of multiplayer I did actually worked just fine strangely enough. For people unfamiliar with the series the combat can feel a little clunky. Many weapons don't let you turn to keep facing the enemy. This part at least is working as intended that's how the combat is in this. There's plenty of weapon types so something like the dual blades will be better for someone more used to quick fluid combat.Overall I'm having a lot of fun. I don't regret spending $60 on it at all and I hope they patch out the issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,53,False,Recommended,I played MonHunt for a while on DS and this is amazing! Multi is not optimized to say the least but the game its self is very smooth and has a much better pace then the originals. You start right off hunting in this addition and side quests are culled down to only nessesary or appealing ones. I understand that multiplayer has been haveing a rough start from relese but I think that it will be smoothed out in the next few hotfixis. More on the game play the whole layout is easy to read and get around when it comes to the forge (where you build new armore and weapons) lots of weapons and styles to choose from DLC is totaly unessasary even the one that gives you armore is quickly out classed New content will be relesed for free from now on (if they do any more payed DLC it will probably just be cosmetic) loads of new monsters for those of you who played the old games and some clasics tooWhat I don't like I wish there were MORE of the clasic monsters to hunt at the start. They curbed the game to be easier to progress and made the grind alot smaller some people like that though I don't. There's my two cents happy hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,380,False,Recommended,Great game I wont give it a negative overall its great my one issue is Bought it for the Co op Sadly its pretty much impossible for me as of this moment cause of non stop disconnects maybe 1/10 rounds do not disconnect for me,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Love this game and the others to and give this one an 8/10 because its still has scoutfly camera issues and connection issues for online play and my only other problem with it is that switching between this and other things can result in the game crashing and reverting back to the last save so be careful when doing so.Still love this game on PC and PS4 still great and challenging and good music for monsters,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,I haven't had any major issues personally but the system in place for multiplayer is very broken. Incredibly complicated and restrictive.

2018-08-18,0,0,168,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World what could have been a strong contender in game of the year is overshadowed by major multiplayer problems and other minor issues. As a result the angry masses that simply just wants to enjoy the game as it was meant to be played but cannot has downvoted it and it s now at 42% on steam truly a shame.Despite these flaws this game will make it to my top 10 best games of 2018.With a deep and rewarding combat system great immersion. great soundtrack well designed zones and monsters the main story alone will offer about 50 100 hours of gameplay.If you want a game to play with your friends I suggest you wait until the multiplayer issues have been solved.I highly recommend you pick up this game once the issues are solved or when it goes on sale.Playing with a controller is highly recommended.Final score 3.5 out of 5 (4 5 if they fix all the issues),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,45,False,Recommended,Day one launch has some issues to be worked out but I feel many of these reviews negatively faulting this game haven't given it a chance. MonHun has a heavy story component and a lot of buildup so MP isn't really valuable or viable right from the start. At the moment the servers are bad but you can find lobbies. Which means you can do MP and there are higher ranked hunters to play with. TL DR MonHun is very grindy so spend the early part of the game building your stash of stuff so you can be viable later in MP. The graphics optimization is not great but we finally have MonHun on PC! This is a great thing that will only get better over time. Bring on some events and new content to give them game some longevity!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,203,False,Recommended,This is one of those cases where the default game options and network unreliability deliver a poor initial experience and it gets review bombed out the gate because people are not interested in diving deep. The reality is MH W is the latest version of a long time successful series of games that launched in 2004 which means the core formula for the series is DOPE.MH W feels familiar to Dark Souls boss fights. It is a little more arcadey though. Being a 14 year long running Japanese game you can expect to get blasted by an obtuse UI experience but luckily everything is actually game mechanically sound! There are a lot of things in the game that you interact with anywhere from transmuting sending automated raids by palicoes auto crafting resources to the core weapons and armor forging yet ALL of them feel like they add real value to the experience and aren't just bolt ons. Regarding the game systems I'm always happy to see a fully expanded game idea that hasn't been grossly homogenized by the AAA game industry.The main thing that stands out to me is how enjoyable the game is after it begins to open up around the 40 hour mark. Replayability looks to be extremely high there are lots of collectible items the end game itemization is probably the first time I've seen something done right and MMOs should probably pay attention to this.A short list for improving your MH W experience You need a quad core CPU 2.5GHz or faster You need a 960 GTX or faster (FPS+++) Volume Rendering Quality Off / Low (FPS+++) SH Diffuse Quality Low (FPS+) Anti Aliasing FXAA / Off (Micro Stutter) Use exclusive Full Screen (not using 16 9? 21 9 mempatch!!!) https //steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/3/1745594817434182398/?ctp 8#c1735462352460669327 (Disconnects) There is an official pinned message on the Community Hub that mentions an emergency patch is being worked on (Weird mouse feeling) Use a game padShould you buy the game?

2018-08-18,0,0,230,False,Recommended,Having played most monster hunter game since it first came out in the west for PSP in 2006 I have seen how the game has improved over time. Monster Hunter World just took the Monster Hunter series to a new level.The games from PSP to 3DS and now PC are all well done some better than others but all worth the money. I can only highly recommend Monster Hunter World to veteran hunters as well as newcomer hunters. The main reason for the bad reviews in this game is mainly due to connection error when playing multiplayer. In my opinion this reason is not enough to discourage people from experiencing this amazing game. You can have alot of fun playing this game solo even more so if you like challenging games like Dark Souls (as we know you either git gud or depend on others). The game is being continually being updated along with solving the connection problem. When/if G rank hits Monster Hunter World then it might even be worth the money even if there is no multiplayer at all.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Yes we expect a great game we got a great game!Edit My time is low on the PC however I've played it enough to get enough of a feel to make a review.It's a shame Multiplayer is a little clunky to work at the moment but this game is HARD. If it's too hard for you to play alone then you're playing the wrong game. It only gets tougher in multiplayer. It's fun to play with friends sure and this is it's best opportunity to which is why it's a shame it doesn't work. That doesn't take away from the game as a whole. I'll use an analogy. ""Order cake with ice cream. Only get cake. inform waiter. Waiter apologizes and goes to get ice cream while still busy waiting on other tables. Eventually you get ice cream cake is almost done but hey! Now you can enjoy that last bit of cake with ice cream too!

GTX 760 TI graphics card. FX 6300 processor. The game runs fluidly even in dark hectic rainy fights. Sure it isn't ""Pretty"" because I'm not using reccomended equipment but it sure looks good regardless! Not many games can still claim to look good on low settings this one can. Am I getting 60fps? I dunno I don't framecount. But I've never had any noticable framedrops that have hindered my enjoyment of the game.Am I a capcom fanboy? No. Monster Hunter is the only game of theirs that I enjoy. I don't like Street Fighter and I was too late to the megaman franchise to enjoy it properly.... those are capcom right?Finally ""They had so much time between this release and the console release"". I'm still in the boat that believes it was an exclusivity deal that pushed it back rather than anyting to do with porting the game over. Regardless it's here now with some of the same minor bugs that existed with the PS4 release version but with some of the patches that the ps4 version had gotten later.All in All? Great game regardless of the issues.

2018-08-18,0,0,127,False,Recommended,I love the game. Dont trust the negative reviews. You might as well twist all the negative reviews into positive. If someone spends all day playing a game for days on end rather than doing or playing something else do you think they'd recommend it for you? Yes. If not they're either lying or disturbed.I'm seeing these negative reviews but theyve logged 60 80 even many with 100 hours logged into it within a week and their numbers keep going up so they love it too . They're telling you not to buy it while loading another session after posting their review. Why? Because they're trying to hurt Capcom because they're frustrated with the current connection issues.My opinion I love it I'm running an I7 8086k with a 1080ti so I cant speak for the majority of peoples hardware and how the games put a strain on it. I havent seen any stuttering crashes or graphical issues though the friends I play with haven't either with the exception of one who has crashed twice over the course of 35 hours with a machine with hardware below the recommended pc specs. It's a great game. Does it have connection issues currently yes but after a week it still has 300k simultaneous players. If you've played games in the series before get it. If you haven't watch a youtube video to see if its something for you and for many it will soak up all the hours of your day and give you some of the most hilarious and teeth clenching moments,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-02,0,0,174,False,Recommended,"Overall a great game but there are issues still. The gameplay and visuals are great but don't expect much of a story. The point of the game is killing monsters so there isn't much of a plot.Once you get to the endgame aka decorations/streamstone farming the grind is real. With so many different weapons and skills the chance of obtaining what you are looking for to min/max may take a very long time. I personally don't mind the grind as it gives a sense of accomplishment when you are extremely geared.My gripe is the lack of content. There are many monsters re used constantly with re colors and ""tempered"" and ""arch tempered"" etc.. Even a few monsters with different names are still just re skins of earlier monsters which some change in scenery and moveset. I just feel like there is a lack of variety with monsters in the game. They need to add more content. Adding seasonal decorations in the gathering hub and a few tempered monsters and events isn't really content to me.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,43,False,Recommended,As with any new release there are going to be some kinks to work out. But as a long time fan of the MH Series MH W is great. There are a lot of QoL adjustments to make life less annoying (Ie. being able to eat during quest/expedition) the monsters look great the soundtrack is awesome all around enjoyable. The DRM thing better controller support and D/C issues are a hassle for some people along with the graphical requirements. Hopefully they can solve at least some of these issues then it'd be hard for me not to recommend for anyone who enjoys a high octane very deep gameplay experience. MH is not a very forgiving game for beginners but it can be so rewarding when you do put in some time and effort to it. You can upgrade your equipment but as you play through what you really upgrade is your own skill. The game really does make you feel like a hunter too!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,200,False,Recommended,I usually don't write reviews for games but seeing this game recieving so many bad reviews recently has prompted me to offer some support for what I believe to be an outstanding game. If I will be completely honest this game does have a pretty huge issue right now with multiplayer but I don't feel like that should earn this game a negative review. Look this game may not be for everyone. Generally speaking the game involves hunting a variety of monsters and gathering their body parts to create new gear. There is something extremely satisfying about spending the time to research a monster's weakness gathering and preparing the neccessary items to take them down and then tracking down your quarry. Look if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea don't get this game and then write it a bad review because you don't like it. Once they fix the network issue this game imo will be stellar but right now I think it definitely deserves a thumbs up.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,97,False,Recommended,I've put a few hundred hours into this game on PS4. The game itself is amazing. There is so much content and there are constant free updates. The problem with the PC version is all of the technical issues. If it were just the servers then it would be somewhat understandable but from what I hear there are a host of other technical problems. I personally don't seem to have run into any besides the server problems. I HIGHLY recommend this game BUT unless they fix the technical issues soon then it would be best to just wait for a sale. If news comes out in the near future and they seem to be fixing all of the problems then 100% pick it up and give it a try!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,15,False,Recommended,worth the wait.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,180,False,Recommended,"On literally the first work day post launch devs have allocated attention to correcting disconnection issues which have already nearly disappeared for myself and the friend group I play with.Take the time to read through the content of negative reviews on this game you will find nearly none of them criticizing any actual gameplay elements. Certain elements of the port aren't as graceful as they could have been but if what you want is an extremely good game that for the large majority of people functions already and is only going to become more stable in the coming weeks this is that. Now onto the game itself MHW represents a huge upgrade to the monster hunter series which I have been playing since the original Monster Hunter launched on ps2 when I was still on dial up internet and had to play all by my lonesome. There hasn't been a jump this large in general quality and production value between iterations in this series up until this point. ""Quality of life"" was obviously a mantra for the development team because elements in all sectors of gameplay have been improved in that direction. I'll keep my opinion short and sweet since anyone can do their own research this game is absolutely worth what you will pay for it and the PC version is in several key ways superior to the ps4 version which I also own. (namely loading times. this might not seem like a huge deal but they're MUCH shorter on PC and quite long on ps4.) It is better to play with a controller probably but I have a close friend who is playing on keyboard and mouse adjusting having fun and doing very well. No trouble keeping up with the rest of the group. In summary this version of the game is the one to buy in my opinion. Capcom's support for the title on ps4 leaves me very confident that the port specific issues will be hammered out relatively shortly and even right at this moment I've been having constant fun on the port as is. Hope to see you in the hub hunters!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Unfortunately as a huge Monster Hunter fan which has been playing since the original that came out for PS2 I cannot recommend this game. This is due to very poor performance (stutters FPS drops fuzzy graphics) of the game as well as connection issues (disconnects not being able to find lobbies/players). Considering that this game is native to consoles (Xbox/PS4) which has much lower specs than my PC I'm very suprised that it runs as poorly as it does.

2018-08-19,0,0,225,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game. I've played through only 1.5 Monster Hunter games before on the 3DS and although I enjoyed them it always felt clunky maybe because it was the 3DS . This game feels a lot more smooth and easy to pick up. The turf wars not needing to go to a safe adjacent zone to go heal as you can walk and drink the graphics the new monsters and environments I enjoy it all. IMO this is a really defining Monster Hunter game and although there are quite a few bugs and connection issues it's a good first release for a team that has zero experience porting to PC. I'd like to say buy it right now but if you are wanting to mainly play with friends I'd say hold off for a month or so so that server issues can either A be fixed or B less server load as people are dropping the game. I look forward to the updates that will come to the game and what Monster Hunter has coming in the future and what aspects of World will be staying moving forward. P.S create a save data backup before beating the final boss of the game as at the moment there's a chance your final save will be corrupted. Not too big of an issue if you know about it as it's easy to google how to create a backup for a steam save file but is awful if it blindsides you and would be another reason to wait for a month or two.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

When it's finished I'd say it's absolutely worth a buy but after having at least two crashes each day since launch and connection issues I feel like I've been robbed. One can only guess why Capcom didn't have a more experienced team port this game to PC.

2018-08-15,0,0,90,False,Recommended,Having a great time with Monster Hunter. Between the gameplay loop hunting with friends gathering and making new gear I've very few things to complain about. The only niggles I have come down to online connectivity. Maybe once or twice a day I'll have an issue joining a friends lobby or I'll randomly get dropped from online mode for no apparent reason. While somewhat annoying it by no means has ruined the experience for me. I was actually a little bit tentative going in because I'd heard about all the issues people had even getting the game to run. Fortunately even with my old i7 2600k and a GTX 750 I was able to run it reasonably well with no crashes. Though I must admit it looks a lot better with my GTX 1070 Aero OC. I imagine I'm probably a niche case in that I've had no problems running the game but still I highly recommend Monster Hunter World.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Also there are new drivers that may make your game run smoother or you may have to roll back to the 2nd to newest driver for best results.

I may be giving them the benefit of the doubt but with the amount of free content coming the fact that there's no subscription fee like PS+ and how great it looks even when every setting is on low shows it's worth every penny.

2018-08-13,0,0,84,False,Recommended,The game is very fun and by far one of the best monster hunter games I have played. The graphics are great and the game feels good to play. As a whole the port is decent if you have a good computer. The frames tend to drop but in my expernce not enoguh to make a noticble diffrence and if I was not tracking my frames I would not have noticed. The only thing really making me not rate this game a 10/10 is that the online part of the game is having a lot of issues. You tend to get kicked offline pretty often.

2018-09-29,0,0,148,False,Recommended,So after 90 hours of playing the game and finally finishing the main campaign wow. This game is just brilliant. First time playing a Monster Hunter game and I wasn't certain how I would take to it but now I am hooked and eagerly awaiting further content as time just flies by while playing this game and I just want to get back into playing this whenever I have a chance which I haven't had from a game in years!The game is gorgeous and the style and character it presents really gives it a position among the top the RPG like mechanics with farming gear and rafting item management just fulfils that sense of RPG urges I have finding people to play with is fairly easy (however I would like to add there's not much comunication among us) the game itself I find runs really smoothly and I didn't experience any crashes or technical difficulties the Monster fights and interations all are great and do provide a degree of difficulty as you work your way through higher tiers. There's a lot more I could say but I'm no professional review writer so in summary Just a fantastic game and well worth every doillar.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-29,0,0,376,False,Recommended,I've been addicted since the first time i played this series of MH. Looking forward for the monster updates!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,501,False,Recommended,Ok first let me address the bad stuff with this game the connection issues and the glitch that corrupts your file. The connection problems are rampant due to the game using some outdated P2P crap instead of having a proper network. This causes a lot of drops a lot of disconnects and a lot of frustration. In some cases you can get lucky where you and your partner both have a good connection so neither of you ever drop from each other's game but this isn't the case for the majority of players.Then there's this whole data corruption bug. It doesn't affect as many people as the network problems but its a major issue that exists none the less. It normally happens right after the final boss which you will know your there when you have to hunt 3 different elder dragons to advance the story. Before you go fight the final boss back up your save file which there are a ton of guides on how to do that online now. EDIT The connection problems (at least for me) have been mitigated with a recent patch and now disconnects only happen if I alt+tab though only with a very very low chance.HOWEVER the game has recently been littered with quite a few cheaters. Some of them are relatively benign by simply altering their own hunter rank or giving themselves the material needed to make equipment but there are a few who will play online with ridiculously adjusted stat values or infinite health and one shotting monsters. They'll have quest rewards give thousands of every item they can possibly drop or the worst yet affect those they play with by resetting their HR to 1 or adjusting their stats so they can't do anything. THERE IS NO ANTI CHEAT IN PLACE FOR THIS GAME. If you want to play with other people try to avoid always playing with randoms in order to mitigate any possible negative effects.So despite those major greivances and some optimization probelms I do recommend this game for fans of the franchise. It adds a lot of nice quality of life stuff that I wish would exist in the other installments. The grappling hook that lets you get around some vertical areas much faster. The open zones that don't have loading screens between rooms. Monsters that move more fluidly and realistically (to a degree there is still some jankiness here and there). Gathering no longer takes ages and can be done on the run. Being able to set up automatic crafting options so if your holding on to a first aid med and you pick up some honey you'll automatically make first aid med+ without ever going into a menu. The forge that actually shows you the weapon tree what will upgrade from what making planning out your weapon build much easier. If you use bows or bowguns you now have an indicator for when your in critical range as well as several other nice upgrades to make using ranged weapons fun not to mention armor can be worn no matter what kind of weapon you equip so you don't have to suffer the halved defense value from gunner armor. There's so many nice things about this game I don't think I could list them all without an actual list myself.The game supports controller gameplay and a lot of people recommend it but I've been using mouse and keyboard from the start and its worked out pretty well. I had to adjust some key bindings for bows and bowguns but I've managed to reach near the end of the story without a controller ever being plugged in for this game. It does take some getting used to but it's certainly not bad.I've not gotten a chance to play this on my main desktop computer with all the nice beefy parts and have had to stick to my kind of ok laptop since the game released but she's managed to hold out at the medium quality settings without any major frame drops (it's sticking to the mid to high 50s and reaches 60 when I'm looking straight up or down). There have been people who have had complaints about the optimization but I can't verify anything myself. Overall I can't help but recommend this game. I know a lot of people are throwing negative reviews out primarily because of the issues mentioned above but when I review a game I take into account EVERYTHING the game has to offer and I don't just focus on the bad parts. I know some people have lost their progress because of the bug I mentioned and that sucks and I'm sorry to hear that. I get that the network issues are frustrating and get in the way of you and your friends playing and having fun together. That doesn't mean this game deserves such bad reputation on here. By all means don't stop complaining. Capcom needs to know about these problems in their game and if you feel review bombing it on here will help then by all means go for it. But just remember that if they do come around and fix those issues that plague you that you turn around and grant them the benefit of reversing your decision.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-10,0,0,125,False,Recommended,my first and only monster hunter game i did not think repeatedly hunting a monster would be fun but it is tons of fun with my friends and playing solo is also satisfying too. at first you are a weak and unskilled hunter who struggles even fighting the 'weak' monsters but when you engage in the game and start learning monsters moves and improve your gear then you start kicking and feeling like a true badass taking on the ego of one of those movie/anime protagonists who are overpowered and come in with a bigass weapon to annihilate everything in the way. but it's not always like that starting at the anjanath (the trex) you get really challenged and fooling around or taking hits becomes dangerous and then the true essence of the skill &gt gear comes into play. gear definitely helps because it helps mitigate your mistakes but overall it comes down to learning the mechanics of the monster and playing smart/working as a team. very satisfying gameplay. only gripe would be i wish i could transmorgify my armor to make my look exactly as i want it to be,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-12,0,0,171,False,Recommended,It's a pretty good game. The negative comments are people rage quitting. If you like games like Dark Souls with challenge this is differentely the game for you. If you are new to these kinds of games then enjoy the new genre.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-11,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Well.. This is a really good game the combat really fun like u feel like a badass when u mount the monster then the satisfaction when u completed a really hard quest it's feels really good the sound for the monsters really good then when u gathering some stuff or using some stuff it's doesn't take very long like the older game. Eventhough it's kinda repetitive but it's still fun to play. But like everything else there's a twist or downside for example like the characters voice aren't sync with there mouth (idk if I'm the only one who experienced it my voice setting for the characters is Japanese) then sometime when u hunt with other person the monster when it's down they suddenly it's moving on its own (idk if anyone experienced it before) then the shortcut (for keyboard) or whatever it's called (the one when u press Q (in default)) it's kinda hard to use cause u need to press arrows to change what do u want (like up for combine down for items shortcut) or maybe it's just me how can't really use it and also Eventhough there's 8 slots u can only use 4 slots cause u can only go up down left right (again maybe I'm the only one who doesn't know how to use the other 4). But well it's not like that really important u can still play it those just some little problems. Overall it's really decent game highly recommended if u like big monsters want to feels like badass etc,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The graphics. ing amazing this game is absolutely beautiful 10/10 glorious. Each area has a nice art style from sprawling desert locales to forest grottoes and a few other areas that are simply breathtaking to behold but I cannot spoil them here.2. The Story.Let it be known that this is my first monster hunter game and so I know little to nothing about the lore. But I will be honest this story plays it pretty safe nothing groundbreaking but not too bad either. You start out on a ship and get attacked by a volcano dragon this acts as the tutorial which sounds badass until you realize that your Handler sounds suspiciously like Navi yelling HEY! whenever she is not voiced. Speaking of there is very little voice acting to be had which does cause a bit of disconnect for me being as I have played a lot of games that are fully voiced thats mostly just a nitpick though. 7/103. The Gameplay.Lets be honest this is what I expected to be the best part of this game and it really is. Who doesn't want to have a sword bigger than you are and the ability to slay monsters with a flurry of knife attacks. Cut off certain parts get specific monster bits make better armor and weapons kill bigger monsters etc. You get a little buddy called a Palico to help you on your journey and he is absolutely adorable. Each monster has a unique fighting style and different effects they can inflict on you weaknesses etc. to keep you on your toes.10/10 great gameplay.I have heard bad things about the multiplayer in this game and I don't know how true it is as I have no friends who are able to buy it as of now but when I get the opprotuinity I will give it its own section.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-18,0,0,401,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a game I very much enjoyed playing. The depth to the weapons monsters and environment create a combat system that is satisfying to master while tweaking gear load outs kept me invested well beyond when I would have stopped playing The lack of monster variety in its latter half and terrible story are only minor inconveniences and I can even look past the silly online implementation because of how well crafted the rest of the game is. However the issues with the online and performance are absolutely shameful so I can't recommend Monster Hunter World to anyone in its current state.

2018-08-14,0,0,411,False,Recommended,"tl dr The game is great. Set your settings based on your computer specs and hopefully they'll fix multiplayer. You don't need multiplayer to have fun though.I've been playing Monster Hunter games since MHFU. Been waiting for this port for a long long LONG time. I can say that its worth the wait.For those who are having issues with FPS crashes and network problems I really hope someday Capcom will fix these issues. I really hope it won't let you be bias towards what the game has to offer as a game itself and not as a product.As for me my laptop isn't high end but it sits between minimum to recommended system requirements. The game mostly starts off with everything off or Low settings and the intro was amazingly well done even if the textures aren't pretty. I care less about graphics and would prefer a stable FPS of 30+. I put myself in a private session so no one could join my game but I could still connect for the daily login rewards. I've had little to no stutters FPS has went down below 30 ONCE when I was in a battle with a Rathalos Rathian and the thunder lizard thingy (I'm still getting used to the new names they're so bizarre). And that was probably because of all the particle effects.With those annoying things out of the way MHW is perhaps the best game ever. Seriously. I have always loved Monster Hunter and will continue on loving it but MHW adds so much more. In previous games the world didn't seem alive and was rather bleak but with the addition of new floras faunas and unique environments this game just BLOWS it out of the water. The scenery is so beautiful (perhaps even more so with better graphics than I have) and I have to say that the monsters and fauna feels fluid and lifelike. As for the combat mechanics the game is simply better at everything. The movements look natural the hits to parts feel solid and I quickly get used to several new types of weapons as well. Since MHFU they added Switch axe Charge blade and the Kinsect glaive. I picked up Charge Blade faster than I picked up the Great Sword in MHFU. Perfect balance of mobility defense and offense. I love the weapon to death. The Kinsect glaive offers better mobility than the Long Sword and it adds a unique combat style between Long Sword and a Dual Blades. The Switch Axe is my second favourite weapon simply because it has offense and mobility similar to Long Sword but adds more movvement set than it.Like I said before I'm a veteran and my first 30 or so hours has been ""EZ Game EZ life."" The slightest bit of difficulty was Odogaron but you quickly could pick up that his attacks are all forward attacks except for the small tail swipe. So just position yourself slightly to his left (your right) and you will dodge most of his attacks. I'd discover that you could literally stand still beside his left hind leg and you would be fine for a solid 15 or so seconds. Seriously. Other than that the monsters are BEAUTIFUL and well designed. My favourite monster Diablos was spotted early on and even though fighting it was just CHEESE with the Charge Blade it really brings me back to those nostalgic times.If you want my advice pick up Sword and Shield and start getting used to sticking yourself to the big monsters (the bigger they are the harder it is for them to hit you when you are too close). Then when you're not afraid anymore of using few dodges as possible try out the heavier weapons and hit the sweet spot (belly the small part between its legs). Using this you can quickly discover that most monsters have a ""center point"" and this point will dictate which direction and the hit box of attacks. Once you do that the rest is simply positiong yourself so you have space and time to attack. Simple no?MonsterHunterLanguageIsTheBestLanguageOption / Ten",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Clocked in over 200 horus on Ps4 version bought it again so I could do ultra/4k graphics. I am however dissapointed in the graphics even at ultra 4k they look dated and rough very low res textures being the biggest culprit.A single playthrough can take 60 100 hours it has an extremely addicting loop of hunting beasts for crafting mats to make better stuff. It can be a bit of a grind to get high end gear but 90% of the crafting takes a reasonable amount of time and effort to attain.There is a wide range of unique and memorable monsters to hunt requiring different tactics and gear. Virtually all of the monsters have superb design and are a blast to fight against. Its a shame they made the game more accessible difficulty wise once you get a handle on the game mechanics even the final ""Elder Dragon"" monsters are fairly simple to kill. Although this can be a good thing if you have no appreciation for Souls like challenge.I dont play online but the times I have joined servers/hub groups I was disconnected twice. This doesnt effect the game for me so its not a big deal but if you plan to do coop it can be a problem.9/10",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Not anymore you can go through most of the game by yourself so if you're not into muliplayer fret not MHW has you covered. Notable exceptions do apply though.PC optimization is still dodgy.

It is still missing customizations with motion blur. Another patch has fixed mouse keyboard controls. Camera movement no longer emulates a joystick but uses directinput that is common practice in every other PC game.Constant disconnections makes co op play with friends or strangers extremely difficult. Online connection is required to play the game solo as well. Requirements to watch cutscenes before being able to play co op with people is very confusing. It took me three hours to figure this out.Graphic settings for a pc port are poorly done as expected. No settings to disable motion blur. Keyboard/mouse controls are clunky.

2018-09-23,0,0,237,False,Recommended,A lot of the negative reviews you see on here are people complaining about the optimization issues present when the game first launched. This is the first time that the Monster Hunter devs took a main series game and PORTED it to PC its new ground for them and should be considered. Since launch the issues have cleared up nicely and they're working really hard to bring PC MH W players a polished experience. More people complain about the lack of the newer content on PS4/XB1 not being on PC yet again this is more of a port issue as they have to make sure all the events they designed for two consoles transition to PC without major hiccups like what happened did at launch. They have stated that they plan to sync console and PC events as much as possible so its just a matter of patience and waiting for things to roll around.Those things aside I personally have been playing Monster Hunter since it's debut on the PS2 years ago and it remains to be one of my favorite series of all time. At time of writing im sitting at 100+ hours (on PC 100+ hours on PS4 as well) and I only today managed to clear all the Optional Quests and am sitting at Hunter Rank 69 (Nice) with still more content to come in the coming months/years.The game is a blast with friends with 14 different weapons that are built to suit many different playstyles. And for one such as myself who likes doing lots of different things thats 14 different options to make different armor sets and weapons to play around with and customization.Some people complain that this game is a grindfest and I suppose it sort of is but the series has always had material farming...so not sure why people are griping about it. Some of the rarer materials in the game (Plates and Rubies/Gems) can be exchanged for a voucher for completing the weekly Limited Bounties so thats a guaranteed plate or ruby every week for doing things you're already doing in game so that's already lenient!All in all I would heartily recommend this game to anyone.

2018-10-01,0,0,181,False,Recommended,I'm having a blast with Monster Hunter World. I have had a few connection issues but they are becoming less frequent. It may help that I tend to play late at night in the 8 00 GMT time zone I'm not sure. The game is absolutely beautiful for starters and the weapons all play very very differently from one another. Hell Charged Blade has controls that are simple but requires some experience to chain together well. I honestly think that I could continue these fights for at least another 100 hours (121 at the time of writing this review). I haven't kept up with patch notes of developer commentary so I can't weigh in on the stuff that other people are discussing in other reviews. All I know is that I like this game. It's my second Monster Hunter game. My first one was Tri on Wii. This plays much better than that and I'm very pleased that I picked it up when I did. Playing on PC when there is a wealth of other players and regularly cycled events has been a lot of fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-01,0,0,118,False,Recommended,"I've been a PC gamer for most of my life and have missed out on console exclusives. Monster Hunter has fit that category and while I've been interested in it I've never had the chance to try it out until World. General premise is that you're stuck on an island and need to investigate and kill/trap monsters to figure out the mystery. You're given the option of a wide variety of weapons each with different fighting styles to huint the monsters with. Learning that weapon's combos strengths and weaknesses is one major aspect of the game. While some are incredibly difficult and eventually rewarding to learn others are easy to pick up if you're looking for something less challenging. Weapons and armor are upgradable allowing you to pick the right weapon and armor for any fight that you take on.The general ""feedback loop"" of the game is finding a monster to hunt gathering the correct equipment and consumables to take that monster on hunt it down learn its attack patterns and movement beat it then loot it for parts to make new armor and weapons for the next fight. You may get stuck on a particular monster and may not be able to beat it right off. You may need to try a different approach a different set of armor a different or better weapon or maybe you need to find a potion that increases your resistance to heat. Overcoming these challenges is the major draw to Monster Hunter World being able to not only beat a monster but do so in a flashy fashion with the least effort possible.I've really enjoyed the combat and the crafting system and the fights are all really fun. The game is a little short but I've been playing it for the past two weeks almost every day and have already beaten the ""last"" boss. There's more stuff being released by the developers for free after the game has been out which is free content to take on after making your perfect set of gear. Then there is the replay value of taking on earlier bosses with your tricked out character and seeing how fast you can beat it. The game's difficulty can be staggering sometimes and can get frustrating. People wanting an easy mode will not find an option available you either learn the combat or will need to throw in the towel. There is a great community who has tons of information on the game if you get stuck and need help. Just don't expect to be spoonfed.After playing with Keyboard+Mouse and with a steam controller would recommend against picking this up until you have a steam controller or equivilent.Overall really enjoyable game if you're willing to cut your teeth on the difficulty.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-25,0,0,229,False,Recommended,I'm a long time fan of the Monster Hunter series. Starting with the negatives. I hate the tutorial at the beginning it's long and explains things more than a fresh player to Monster Hunter would ever need. Lot's of cut scenes that don't add any value and you're constantly getting saved by NPCs from scenarios your character could easily handle. Then there's monster bait... I hate her so much. She adds no value to the experience and is constantly frustrating to interact with at all. Lastly the game will hijack your camera anytime you're tracking bugs begin tracking you approach a target monster for the first time during a quest for every quest or if you've targeted a creature than re enter targeting range or if the game decides to auto target at that moment. I despise this feature I want manual control of my camera at all times. I've yet to figure out a setting to make that so. Other than these things the game is actually fantastic. My favorite MH play style so far with gear customization and other nice features. The gear creation and abundance of armors and weapons is great. Lots of variety I do wish there was a transmog option though. Most monsters in the game are fun to fight and the co op play is fantastic with a good socializing system and quick access to gestures and short phrases during quest. I really like the hotkey system and customizing my character's automated quotes that are triggered by specific events. Lots to enjoy in this game. This is my first time playing with other players in a MH game I've been missing out for years. When it was first released there were a number of connection and crashing bugs. They've been patched and the game runs great now in my experience. Highly recommend this game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There's no 'fix' for it don't bother looking. Any fixes you find assume that you can't play any games online which isn't the problem. It occurs in stretches you'll have five missions working fine online but then you're getting errors for the rest of the night. Fixed hasn't happened in a stretch of four days Hasn't happened since Crash to desktop errors randomly. This depends on your system I get them my wife doesn't. Generally happens every 2 3 missions and luckily mostly in town for me. Fix is for you to login on another computer and try to load the same character still not great The last monster has about a 25% chance of locking you out of your character and you lose everything. So yeah there's that. So if you go and buy the game don't kill a ""Xeno'Jiiva"" if you want to keep your stuff. Edit lag spikes have gotten more noticeable as I get higher rank and the few seconds it takes becomes more important in dodge or die situations More or less fixed you still tend to freeze up for a split second if you get hit by an attack the knocks you out don't know why but it's always when you're hit and you go down. It is a great game just doesn't have a great system backend. It made my 1080 act like a portable heater until I turned it's settings down which didn't produce any notable quality drop thunder weapons cause frame drops and some other performance issues.Game is fantastic I can't really oversell it. If the combat of dark souls met with world of warcraft style raiding it'd be something similiar to this. If you do go against my advice and buy the game remember.

You are constantly disconnected from the servers while playing multiplayer and if you have a friend or rando join your mission the monsters become exponentially harder. Alright. Fair. BUT if everyone leaves the mission for whatever reason including server issues the monsters do not regress back to their normal difficulty leaving you stuck fighting enemies much much harder than they should be.

2018-08-17,0,0,113,False,Recommended,The game? Amazing. The experience also amazing. I have played for a week and never felt a dull moment..... almost at least. The problem with disconections DURING the hunts is canserous. Playing with my friends and suddently the two of us getting thrown off not leaving the session practically since when we try to rejoin it says we are already there but actually the game throws us to offline mode which isnt offline but its not online either. I love the game. Honestly it is amazing and i am thankfull i can play it on PC. But the frustration it puts you through due to its technical difficulties is unbelievable. Don't recommend it until they fix it. 60 EURO game with more bugs than beta games. Come on CAPCOM.... don't prove the bad rumours all the time.And so 2 months passed. Capcom fixed many issues (though there are still some people having enormous FPS drops) and i truly believe the game is better. I now recomend it to everyone... with enough time and/ or balls to try and mess with this late game. My goodness teleporting monsters through walls is scary,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-22,0,0,190,False,Recommended,A great Fantasy hunting simulator with heaps of progression and gear to craft. Complex mechanics and every monster has its own unique set of abilities. Amazing story progression and artwork. Detailed monster bosses. From the addictive gameplay to the great graphics this is easily the best MH game to date. The multiplayer is the best thing in this game.The game has plenty of weapon options which allows for almost any playstyle. Mastering your weapon and predicting the moveset of the monster go hand in hand. Each monster has a specific tell that will give you insight at what kind of attack is going to perform.Highly recommended.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It follows the same amazing formula as it always has but somehow better. There's only 2 downsides to this game. The relatively small amount of monsters compared to older games. They have added 1 2 but the oldies would be appreciated. And the lackluster servers for PC. I also own this on PS4 and i never drop my online connection. The PC version seems to struggle to even get a connection (though I am on a hotel wifi). I will never give this game a thummbs down but it does need solid servers.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-19,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,Mulitiplayer for PC is an issue constantly kicking booted out of a session. Confirmed it to be the game issue cause friends have the same issue. Also I bought the game to play with a friend and it's hard to play with one another in the game... you can't do quest together cause one person has to do a prologue or a cut scene... which means the other player can't play with you till the one activating the quest finds the monster he/she is suppose to kill.sometimes we just want to join other people together but you can't do that. you wont see the game your friend is in unless he shoots a sos flare which you can only shoot if you're the Host.Warframe proves the multiplayer of this game to be very lacking... very ing lacking.It feels like the game is made for consol which i know thats where it originated but i hate that they say it's keyboard compatable when it feels like you have no control of what your character is doing. The mechanics is horrible.Leveling up and unlocking new upgrades for your equipment is a pain. It will not allow you to upgrad nor show you what mats you need to upgrade your weapons unless you actually fight a monster that gives that paticular material when you kill them. so it makes leveling your gear very difficult and frustrates you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Core issues Other than those issues my only complaints are the terrible gear item selection system and its laughable story but that just seems to be part of this game.Final thoughts I really enjoy the combat and how different all the bosses are. I really want to build all the different armor sets because so many of them look awesome. Sadly the vast majority of them are useless and a waste of an artists time since there is no transmog system.

I have a GTX 1080 and an i5 6500 along with 8 GB of DDR4. So my system is definitely capable. The graphical detail doesnt justify how poorly this game runs at times.

2018-08-13,0,0,136,False,Recommended,It's great. To explain the concept of Monster Hunter World in the most simple way is to say that MHW is Dark Souls but much less t and you can play with friends or strangers for that extra bit of help. The world is structed around completing quests that are boss centric to progress to the next quest/boss and fighting these bosses is a good 90% of what the game is. The bosses range from dinosaurs to dragons to nightmares of all sorts each with different move sets tactics weaknesses and damage types and range from quite easy to extemely difficult. When you kill bosses you carve them up to get loot to craft better armor and weapons which all have their own effects and elemental strengths and weaknesses.For those that are familiar to Monster Hunter they will appreciate the no nonsense attitude of MHW. No more collect 6 jaggi hides and steal 2 wyvern eggs to fight the next boss MHW dishes out boss fights like deals on black friday all that collecting and hunting small monsters is optional side quests. I only have two complaints with these game unskipable cutscenes and that PoS MLP bastard Kirin. While the cutscenes only play once and can be rewatched from the gallery later if you want to when playing a mission for the first time friends cannot join until the host has watched all that cutscenes in the quest which can take awhile with some of the more intensive cutscene quests and the first 2 ish hours of the game are very cutscene intensive. Kirin is a boss who is just an . But it is still a great game and well worth the full price.Also while the handler may be a little autistic she could feast on my mushroom anyday 6.5/10 waifu.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-05,0,0,265,False,Recommended,I have a laughably low end PC and it's still able to play it (albeit at low settings) with only some stutters when a thousand effects go off at once. Besides that the game is absolutely gorgeous even at lowest texture settings. The different zones *feel* different. The different monsters *feel* different. It's clear that the monster types are reused through the game but they still feel different with a few exceptions. For example the Tobi Kadachi and the Oodogaron are obviously utilizing the same general body shape and bone structure but the way they look and attack is like night and day. There are some exceptions like the Rathian and Rathalos (or even worse Rathian/Pink Rathian and Rathalos/Azure Rathalos) but it's a smaller number in comparison to the rest of the monsters. I'm only about 150 hours in and I haven't hit the softcap HR 15 yet choosing to do all the optionals before continuing on but I'm still having a lot of fun with this game.

2018-08-10,0,0,263,False,Recommended,"I won't talk about gameplay (which I enjoy) as there are other reviews/videos for that.Bad part is that the game &gt still&lt has DENUVO Anti Consumer Technology which provide no benefits to customer (and at this point company) while hogging resources meaning that if you have low/mid range PC you aren't going to enjoy the game with better graphics and you have denuvo to thank for that. This is enough to thumbs down the game to counter any gain the publisher might gain at &gt your&lt expense. This along with some bugs at game launch (and PC players ignorance of monhun pacing) caused the game to have quite low ratings.Now the Good part is that the developer (along with publisher ofc) is actually fixing (read fixed) stuff and making the game worthy of the ""proper PC port"" title game has numerous settings to adjust to your preferences from video settings to fit your PC hardware or remove stupid drunk simulation (also known as motion blur) to controls and UI settings made for PC including very nice Steam integration. Nowadays that's a rarity and deserves praise as almost all AAA publishers stopped bothering with quality control good gameplay and other stuff and only bother with marketing their unoptimized buggy crap to ignorant masses because spending money on marketing (like bribing all those numerous critics/journos for 85+/100 metascore) brings them more bux than spending that money on development which unlike marketing actually brings you enjoyment.Also another thing to note is that the game is getting all the events that consoles got though with some delay.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-02,0,0,203,False,Recommended,"This is an amazing game and I've had a history with Monster Hunter since the 3rd Ultimate game for the 3DS. (My introduction to the series) I've always put in about 100 hours for these games simply because it's so much fun fighting these monsters especially with friends. While it got off to a rocky start with a lot of lost connections this game has picked itself back up quite nicely and I've not had any issues with it since the first 2 weeks the game was released. I will say that you NEED a decent Graphics card to play this game properly otherwise it's just going to be frustrating for you. (I've got a GTX 1050ti and I have to run it on low unless I want choppy 30fps) Monster hunter is not a game for someone who only likes completing a story once and then saying ""All right I'm done.""

2018-10-01,0,0,71,False,Recommended,I am a fan of the series and MHW on pc is amazing compared to the 240p graphics on the 3ds. However even with low optimization expectations I was still very disappointed. I would say that a 970 or above is needed to play this game at decent settings at 60fps which prevents many from fully enjoying the game. In addition even though hitboxes have always been wonky in MH in general it is extremely poor in MHW considering that this is a ps4/xbox1 game. Either capcom cheaped out on devs salary or they just straight up suck at making good hitboxes. The mouse and keyboard play surprisingly well for me but I only play GS so I cant speak for others. Last but not least the decorations system is terrible even with deco sniping as an available option.

However if you're like most and play monster hunter to actually play with other people then do yourself a favor and just skip this or pick up the PS4 version.Constant disconnects I've not managed to sit down and play one time without several disconnects. It isn't my net not my PC. I run the game fine and no other game is kicking me offline.Update It seems now you're able to connect with other players and not get kicked. It still has some rubber banding issues that the console never had but now that you can actually play it with friends as intended I highly recommend it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,50,False,Recommended,Network issues have been mostly fixed so I'm changing this to recommended.Great gameplay focusing on wearing down your target and looking for openings rather than the usual spam crazy combos.Great music with many monsters having unique themes.Progress is made quickly in this one. You will likely get all the parts needed for an upgrade in 2 to 4 hunts with a monster. Not 10 to 15 like in previous games.Only big complaint is that many main story hunts require you to see a cutscene before others can join which can make going through the campaign with a friend a pain.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'm changing it as promised since the majority of the network issues have been resolved.This game is like a hot super model girlfriend that pisses you off to no end and slaps you in the face when your yelling to the next guy to help you out cuz your stunned. You'll hate it so much! BUT! You'll always want to come back because you just can't get enough of her. Out of all the monster hunter games I've played since the beginning. This one has made me laugh and cry the most. It's so unfair but its so fun. Once you get the hang of it you have this mysterious self gratitude that's hard to explain.TLDR Get the game get at the game. Leave for an hour realize you'll want to come back repeat.

Load times definately faster on PC making the game go quicker which is nice to turn around more hunts per hour. This was my first Monster Hunter title to play and with little knowledge of the game and the series it was a bit overwhelming. However through persistance and practice learning how to solo even the hardest monsters in the game within minutes became fun as I built out my character.

2018-10-07,0,0,626,False,Recommended,"First off this game is incredibly fun. The amount of content at the current time of writing is slow in release but after finishing every achievement I still find it fun to just casually do things. The game isn't too hard to get into and can have it's frustating moments but getting through those moments makes it all the more worthwhile. Everything in Monster Hunter World can be done solo and playing with friends or even the people you meet through matchmaking is perfectly viable. One of the things that I really appreciate and love is how every weapon is viable and the vast majority of builds(ignoring the troll ones) can clear basically all the content. There isn't a ""meta"" outside of the speedrunning community and quite a few of the runs follow restrictive rules in order to standardize them. While I myself enjoy speedrunning a bit I do enjoy the variety of outfits you can put together with the large selection of armor pieces. Ther is also no reason to rush yourself through content but the endgame is grinding for your decorations and augments. But even without 100% optimal DPS decorations you can still do just fine(honestly the difference is like 10 15% ).The game does have a few issues but Capcom has been prety active in adressing them It would be amazing if they could speed up the updates more as well as G Rank being added as a DLC. Overall I definitely recommend this game to anyone who's interested.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-04,0,0,207,False,Recommended,"*Turns up Phil Collins*I've been waiting for this moment... all my life OH LORD Finally a Monster Hunter game has made it to the PC (outside of Japan) and it's glorious. If you have played a MH game before it's basically an improved version of the past games across the board. So many quality of life changes have been made to make crafting inventory and even exploring the maps easier. The maps are essentially ""open world"" now with no loading screens between areas anymore and a slight bit bigger than they used to be. The controls are smooth on both Mouse/Keyboard and Controller and the game finally doesn't look like a PS1 game anymore.I think the only real complaint anyone has is that the monsters aren't as tough as some people would like but they didn't really make any monsters easier than other games. Being on modern consoles and PC allows it to be made with a better engine and have better controls which in a round about way kind of does make combat easier but as a completely unintended consequence. Capcom has been slowly releasing newer and harder monsters to make people happy though they seem to be listening to fans. MHW has been more successful than any other MH title to date and probably more than any other Capcom game period. They are certainly just as happy as we are and will probably do even more for us going forward to keep us happy and paying them money. There are currently 34 monsters in the game (32 on PC for now the others will come later) and more planned. Each monster will increase in difficulty as you level up and unlock new ranks. There are also 14 weapons all with very unique play styles and looks there is sure to be a few weapons for everyone's tastes. I am not going to go count them but I am sure there are over 40+ different armor sets that you can mix and match for different stats and jewels to put in them for further customization as well. As for new players to the series there is a lot of grinding and a lot of mechanics and resources you need to learn about the game like any MH game but this is the best and easiest it has ever been. You can jump straight in and start having fun without any real stress of worry about not knowing much. The game gives you all the basic combat information to get you through the lower ranks and by then you will be so hooked that you will research higher rank information on your own and learn everything they didn't teach you. The game is good in solo with friends and with random people but I think it's the most fun when you are with a group of friends over Discord. Definitely a great game to play with your friends if you are looking for something new to try out. The game has a lot of grinding but you can play it as slow and casually as you want without any worries. With the release of special limited events during holidays and a few on rotation every single week it has the ability to keep you coming back for a while.9.5/10 is the least I would give this game because I love this genre and have for a long time but even people who don't like this genre would have to give it an 8+ if they were being objective. It is hands down an improvement over the other games in the series and is hopefully a sign of more quality MH games on PC in the future.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I played Hammer and Longsword for the first 100 hours and still don't feel like having mastered them (especially the conter mechanic of LS).As of now there could be more content sure.

2018-08-12,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Updated 11/10/2018After some patches to the game Monster Hunter seems to be properly playable with friends which is my biggest complaint from my original review down below. MHW still today suffers from some performance issues that should still be resolved if possible but its a good time to play with friends. Capcom seems to me more on top of things now which is good but they still have work to do. Original Monster Hunter World is not quite like the older games. In some ways a bit simpler/easier designed to reach more people. In many ways they are good QoL changes. The game is certainly quite fun. On my computer the game runs rather well for the most part at a solid 60fps but does have a few moments of hitching. Unfortunately best played with a controler as mouse and keyboard controls are kinda clunky. Nothing that takes away from the experience too much given how the console version runs.HOWEVER being now 3 full days since launch there are serious networking errors that make multiplayer difficult to impossible to use for a lot of people and no one is talking to us about it. It's not even listed as a known issue in the discussion board. I will not makes claims as to if it's a Steam server issue or something on Capcom's end but the lack of communication is inexcusable for a game built around team play. If you're interested in MHW hold your money and stay tuned for when these game breaking issues are ironed out.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-15,0,0,71,False,Recommended,"This game is by no means bad and should not have the sheer number of negative reviews it has recieved. If you are like me and do not own Monster Hunter World on a console this game is worth the buy entirely. Everyone ""Not Recommending"" this game are mostly players on Ps4 that are upset the first week wasn't absolutely perfect.The game itself is beautiful the gameplay is very intuitive and the animations are perfect allowing for the combat to feel very smooth. This causes the game to be an absolute marvel to play. By FAR the best Monster Hunter game of franchise and one of the best games I have played full stop I cannot fault this game on anything the entire 7 hours I have currently played and the future thousands of hours I will probably put in.Now to address the number of negative reviews Personally I have had no performance issues whatsoever and have no installed any unofficial patches the game runs at a smooth 60fps for me and dips are lowest to 30fps and I am not on a modern super computer of any means all my hardware is relatively outdated especially my cpu (AMD 6300 Six core) and the game runs perfectly as stated. The port works perfectly and I have no issue with the controls within a couple of hours the very few shakey controls there were I got used to nearly immediatley and now I would not have them any other way.And the big part The servers. Even if the connection actually WAS as bad as all of the reviews make it out to be (it's really not that debilitating I've found personally) the game itself is not worthy of so many negative reviews. The online functionality (although a big part of the game itself) is not entirely essential to the game and if the game is treated as a single player game the game holds out as being near perfection on it's own. (I honestly believe if this game was single player only and did not have online functionality it would have overwhelmingly positive reviews up there with The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt) Regardless to that the only issues I have currently had with the servers was once trying to use matchmaking (although using filter search for a manual way of matchmaking worked fine) and another time where the servers would not let me connect to an online session however this problem was resolved within 5 minutes. I have been playing the best of the 7 hours today with absolutely no connectivity problems whatsoever and I have been playing most of the day consistently playing with other online players throughout the entirety my gameplay today.Verdict This game is amazing. Even when the connection is being faulty I would still recommend the single player aspect of this game entirely and the multiplayer aspect works incredibly well the majority of the time and a lot of fun can be had both online and offline. I'm upset and ashamed the community has caused the reviews for this game to plummet but here I am attempting to show people it really is just a bunch of upset keyboard warriors looking for perfection and jumping on any excuse to give a perfectly good game absolute hell.9.6 / 10Thank you for your time to read this D",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,90,False,Recommended,14 August 2018 after launch.Currently i would not reccomend the pc version of the game. It has a lot of glitches and connectivity issues that NEED to be fixed in order for it to be a fuctoning game.Aside from the multiplayer the single player is great. The only thing that grinds my ing gears is the drops for crafting materials. Stuff you want hardly ever drops even if you smash the monster in the right places anjanath fangs for example are so ing hard to come by.This game is great but at the same time needs soooooo many things touched up on and fixed.19th October.So im gonna update my review and change it a little. Since they FINALLY fixed that issue on pc for the most part.The PC version is still massively behind the consoles and needs to catch up but theres rarely any issues other then the odd bit of lag a bug with monsters and the odd crash with partys the game runs pretty well. I hope they keep adding to this game and don't keep screwing the PC version over.Id also like to say fix drop rates for gems. Gem drop rates are garbage getting an attack jewel is harder then killing the pickle.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,515,False,Recommended,"I maybe a little biased since I've invested countless hours into the series on PSP 3DS PS4 Switch and now PC (About 250+ Hours as of this review).The game is as the title states you hunt monsters to get parts to craft better gear to hunt harder monsters. Think of it as you're fighting Dark Soul bosses. Movements and controls are similar. You ""commit"" to attacks and swings with punishing recovery times if not timed correctly. There are a variety of weapons ranging from ranged to melee. Each are fun and great on their own and from the start you have access to all moves the weapon can perform. There is no character ""leveling"" and it's all gear based. So you can easily swap gear to try out a new weapon or play with friends. Unfortunately there is a bit of a learning curve before you can get into ""the loop"" veterans of the series enjoy. World takes a few steps in the right direction (QoL changes environments monsters etc) but take a step back in other aspects (Monster count including DLC recycled assests network issues). However looking past those this offers the same Monster Hunter experience veterans and newcomers willing to try out and learn will likely enjoy.Going into this game blind you'll likely have a not great time. The game was never one to ""hold your hand"" and throw you into the fire. Unfortunately the game still does the same approach minus a few ""brief"" tutorials which just glance over mechanics. I recommend watching some user made beginner tutorials from content creators like Arekkz or gaijinhunter. They provide easy to digest info to help get a beginner started.Now with MP being a bigger thing and the huge appeal for World it's not clear how to do it. Unfortunately you'll need to complete a few intro missions before you're allowed to hop online and play with friends. Another thing I should mention is the ""story"" and doing it with a friend. You can but unfortunately there's a few hoops you'll need to jump through. Story missions typically have a cutscene you'll need to watch by yourself BEFORE you can do it with a friend. Either one of you will need to watch it before leave the mission and then join yours once your mission allows it or both of you can watch it seperately and then relaunch it from the start. I can't speak on the networking issues since I never ran into it much on PS4 or PC but it has happened to a few unfortunate friends of mine and turned them off the game completely. I've had no issues joining random lobbies or helping out others and doing SOS'es.If you can make it past the mentioned above it's a fun game to play especially with friends to feeling like a badass in a fanatasy world.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,601,False,Recommended,"It's hard to describe the thrill of switching gears going from games with guns and fast paced bullet dodging hiding behind cover antics to suddenly facing off against fearsome beasts of considerable size that'll do so much as eat you alive in a single flash of fangs. Being the first PC Monster Hunter experience Monster Hunter World has definitely captivated some new fans (myself included) into the genre...albeit with the current meta of games holding true to the ""RNG"" scene of things.With a variety of weapons to choose from (fourteen to be specific) there's a different playstyle and different strategy with each weapon and each monster add one two or three extra buddies into the equation and either you can wind up with a hellish torment of salt and rage or a barrel of laughs so large that no comedy out there will ever outdo it.The story is short able to be finished within a relatively short amount of time (I'd estimate...ten or so hours at most? non stop?) provided you aren't the type of player who gets into a desire to hunt/capture a specific Monster for their parts to make the newest greatest best of gear you can have at that current time! Plenty of extra quests on the side though most still involve hunting or gathering that's a good easy description for Monster Hunter Hunter/Gatherer. But the developers at Capcom have a way of tying in continuous events and other universes in their repertoir to entice and interest players for days/weeks to come.If you want action MHW has got it. If you want thrills MHW has got it. If you want salt hell MHW has got it (trust me sometimes mechanics will leave you questioning the meaning of life).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-25,0,0,121,False,Recommended,Finally a monster hunter game for PC.Too bad no one tested the autosave feature which is on by default my game corrupted after beating the final boss because of it now i have to start over immediatley as i got to end game.The problems aside it's a good game and a great entry in the series and I can't really find any gameplay stuff to nit pick but the quality control was clearly taking a dirt nap along with my save file.Now for the nit picky stuff. The handler is probably the least enjoyable character in the game the fact the story puts her as the same rank as the player is a disgrace not only does she turn EVERYTHING into a food reference when she does actually participate in a mission she becomes the food.And if you're playing on linux (proton or lutris) god forbid you take a mission from her when you could have used the board because you usually crash. At least that one is linux exclusive unlike the autosave crash that even happens on console so I can't be too mad about it. Even the adorable goth halloween event outfit wasn't enough to make her tolerable. The voice acting is the least inspired that I have ever heard in my life. I'm not even being dramatic most of the voices are so uninspired that getting knocked off a cliff by a dragon and landing flat on your back losing all but a sliver of your health sounds like you just expressed disgust from stepping in jaggy poo.

This is the kind of game that you can always come back and play over and over again and have a different experience every time. If you play this game alone it's great but with a friend even better! It turns it into a whole new experience. In the beginning of the game it might be hard to fight a weapon you really enjoy playing because there are so many different options to choose from. When you do find the weapon you enjoy using on hunts you'll feel great after a difficult hunt and you'll look forward to hunting something even more challenging. When you complete a difficult hunt you get the same rewarding feeling as beating a boss in Dark Souls. Also during certain hunts some epic music will play making you feel like a total badass.The devs also release a lot of free updates and I can't wait where this will take the game in the future!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

OR.... and this was super cool you can catch the monsters and bring them back to the village and disect them slowly to harvest the maximum amount of parts. But that was when I realised by monster hunter they don't mean hunter of monsters... They mean you are a hunter and even more so a monster.Try your best to exterminate entire species that have no problem with you until you start physically assaulting them or stealing their eggs. Yeah stealing eggs gets you ""rep"" with the local village this is represented in points that allow you to push your agenda on the village. Like forcing subservient cat creatures into cooking for you or hunting when you don't feel like it. Two of these cats are always in your room with you and one of them you can force to dress any way you wish including dresses. The cat's oppinion of this is irrelevant. I feel that there is something clandestine going on that no one seems to want to acknowledge.The one quest that I personally thought was great was Zorah Magdaros. You are kind enough to pop the zits on the thing's back and it swims off into the sea until the next time it eats too much pizza and shows back up. AND THEN! I come to find out that is the only part of this game that people don't like. Not that it's a large part of the game. You only need to complete that quest once but of course I'm one of the few people seeking redemption and have done the quest repeatedly. Maybe just in an effort to alleviate my shame. That and mushroom/herb collecting.I wasn't ready to learn the terrible thing that lives deep inside of me. My therapist has told me that I must learn to forgive myself. But I'm just not ready to. I still wake up in cold sweats remembering the cries of a poor helpless nergigante it's spikes torn from it with my elderseal weapon. It was helpless and I never stopped. It's only crime a pitiful attempt at fighting it's own death. And as I sit there in bed... I can't help but feel like I put that piece of #&amp in it's place.

And yet when it came out I was hugely disappointed. I couldn't put my finger on it but everything felt awkward and weird and after a week or two of playing it lightly I put it away in resignation.About a month later I had dug out my controller to play Attack on Titan and decided to give this game a shot using a controller and it changed everything. Despite the MKB controls being decent on paper it just doesn't work and after switching this game was everything I had hoped it would be and is among my favorite games ever as I had hoped and expected it would be.Any time I've thought something was missing or off compared to my previous Monster Hunter I progressed a little further and found whatever I was looking for (skill gems come to mind) and even though there are some weapon changes I don't like (namely I hate that the bow went from a piercing sniper weapon to a spammy combo weapon with a coincidental ill fitting pierce attack and that they locked the greatsword's strongest attack behind an awkward combo) but with fourteen weapons available and my favorite the lance better than ever I am loving the Monster Hunter experience just as much as I ever did.In summary I highly highly recommend this game AS LONG AS you are willing and able to play with a controller.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-08,0,0,182,False,Recommended,"This game is absolutely amazing GOTY for me. Still playing it regularely since August and the devs are adding more content every month.One thing you need to know before you buy this game is that it is NOT hack'n'slash game that you breeze through the combat is a bit slower compared to other action ""RPGs"" you have to be methodical because you have to act according to how the monster you are hunting moves. This makes it very rewarding but IMO the combat only felt slow the first hours the more you play the better and faster you get at (predicting the monster movement) landing combos inbetween the monsters attacks and all the more satisfying it becomes hitting a fully charged greatsword attack is one of the best feelings ever and I absolutely love the combat in this game now. It does have a bit of a learning curve. You can do jumping attacks sliding attacks charged attacks every weapon has a few good combos you can MOUNT the monsters and stab their fricken eyes its amazing.As for how this game looks it's probably one of the coolest games I've ever played not only does the maps look incredible but the monsters you are facing all have a distinct and interesting look to them they're all unique *cough diablos* in looks and patterns in and out of combat. Sometimes you can just follow a monster around and look at their daily routines.The first 90 hours I played in this game I was completely immersed and I am ashamed to say but I even forgot to eat dinner a couple of times (be wary of addiction).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-08,0,0,203,False,Recommended,Fantastic game but the decision to drip feed players with new content that is around for a limited amount of time outside has been puzzling. Previous MH games released the event quests and you got to keep them. This time around the inconsistently available endgame with the lack of G rank really has me disappointed. Do not get me wrong this is the best MH title mechanically speaking however from a content point of view there hasn't been so few monsters in an MH title in quite some time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-09,0,0,55,False,Recommended,One of the few games that requires grinding that I really enjoy. The gameplay is just so incredibly solid and fluid. Rarely experience lag of any kind even when playing with AUS folk.The only con I can think of is that the current monster roster might get a tad dry after a bit. Never played any previous MH games but from what I've heard there are a ton of monsters. Hopefully we get DLC soon because I'll hella buy that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,460,False,Recommended,"It's ok ish I guess _(ツ)_/ But serious now since they finally fixed the connection issues added some more content and also trying to cath up more 'n more with the console version I can recommend the game w/o the ""fanboi hype"" from my side (playing/loving the franchise since 2005 ).Yet I know the game is not for everyone so ask yourself before you're going to buy it if you enjoy yourself grinding bosses with a small challenge if so you'll love this franchise. With the 14 different types of weapon there is also some variety on how to approach the monsters/suit your playstyle or just to try out something new. Only real downside in my opinion is the ""decoration""system which is very RNG heavy and will take houndreds of hours to get the top tier decorations for some builds.8/8 m8",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-09,0,0,73,False,Recommended,A great Monster Hunter for beginners and new players to the series! I found prior Monster Hunter games to be quite challenging as I'm not the most skilled player in the world but MHW afforded me the chance to really get knee deep in combat and doing what the game does best huntin' monsters.It can feel a bit overwhelming for new players who may be intimidated but once you've had the chance to get your first big kill in you're hooked!Improvements since release have made the game much easier to play and I now prefer the PC version over my PS4. With plenty to do including hunts events different weapons to try and master different armor sets and tactics to take advantage of it's hard to get bored!Pick it up and give it a shot if you have the chance!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-29,0,0,386,False,Recommended,Playing on Linux via SteamplayI've first played Monster Hunter with Portable 3rd on the PSP and since then wished that the series would come back to proper platforms. With MH World this wish comes true. Monster Hunter has a quite simple premise you accept a quest to hunt a monster prepare yourself for said quest hunt the monster and then do it all over again. Now prepared with better gear and knowledge. The game squeezes hundreds of hours from this simple gameplay loop thanks to its excellent combat system. It's a system that rewards knowledge from the enemy you're fighting and the tools you carry and execution. While Monster Hunter World has a more modest monster lineup compared to its more mature predecessors the fights offers greater variety with the more dynamic and engaging maps. They present an unparalled verticality in the series with slides ledges runnable walls and ropes adding a much necessary third dimension to the combat. Add all this with the enviromental hazards and the new add on to the series the slingshot and you have fights that never feel quite the same.So while it's possible to improve in a lot of fronts Monster Hunter World is a amazing first page to a new chapter in this old series and the best entry point you could wish for.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,449,False,Recommended,I won't compare the nuts &amp bolts of this game to other Monster Hunter titles I will just say that the overall feel of this game reminds me of the good parts I recall from playing the other titles and that for me it is a fun improvement on the series.As a disabled gamer I have found that the keyboard &amp mouse configuration is top notch. From what I can tell it allows all keys to be re bound including the Esc key number pad keys and mouse buttons (including mouse button 4 5 etc.). I prefer Keyboard &amp mouse over controller due to my disability and this has been a joy to play because of the customization. I know there have been some complaints about the lock on system however I have never needed it to take on literally every monster in the game and suggest doing the same. My Recommendation If you like fantasy games with hunting tracking learning how various monsters act/react fighting with various weapon (your choice of 14 different types each with numerous elements &amp abilities) and like to solo or small group play then you may like this game.Problems I have experienced (played from day one) First couple weeks there was a total of 3 times when I had connection issues and had to solo (wasn't really a problem never happened since). One time I was disconnected from a group and sent back to gathering hub.Problems I haven't experienced (played from day one) Bugs (I don't recall any bugs glitches etc. it has been beautifully clear I assume that they probably have ironed them out in the console versions first). On going connection issues (This has never been an issue for me and that's while running on a 20mb max DSL line!).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

When i first started playing it was ok wasnt too hard and everything. The first few monsters are rather easy to beat and it lets you learn the basics on how to actually play the game. The is more than enough content and they keep updating the game and adding even more for free. If you love being invested in a game i would definetly recommend. The best thing is being able to craft epic gear from the monsters you kill makes you feel like a total badass and gives you an amazing sense of Progression.

2018-08-24,0,0,155,False,Recommended,Updated This game is fun but not when you try to play it solo or try to do side quests right away. Once you figure out SOS flares and that hunts are exponentially easier in a group and you need to progress the story in order to improve your rank and equipment the game becomes much more enjoyable. Once you get some practice and understand the typical effort required to finish a hunt the game seems like much less of a grind (although trying to farm the right pieces for weapons and armor is still super grindy). You need to eat before each hunt and tailor your armor with the right elemental resistance to avoid one hit TKOPrevious review This game is not fun. Improving your character is impossible. You gain no skills/xp and weapon/armor upgrades barely make any difference at all. Battles take forever and then when you are about to win you get hit by an undodgeable one hit knockout or the monster just leaves the ing area. If you like being off and screaming at your monitor by all means buy this stupid game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-09,0,0,29,False,Recommended,UPDATE 11/15After learning how to play and getting learn more about all the items weapons and crafting list. This game is pretty awesome! Why do I like it?Well Monsters are still amazing to fight! Weapons and upgrades are great! Although I wish they looked cooler.I am also playing past the first map and man was I wrong about how the enviroment is.It really takes you in and makes you forget your actually playing a game instead of being in the jungle map or dessert map. Took me some time to get into it but now that I learned a few things and am acustomed to my weapons and how to fight its a pretty amazing game.Old Review 2 hours Into it I am currently 2 hours into this game. I was curious because of how cool it looks.Now I have only done the first few missions but like every game there is ALOT you need to learn .Also in this game I personally feel the time go by. Comparing it to something like witcher 3 were your immersed with its beauty of nature and Overwatch for its rather fast fun gameplay. How I have to run everywhere and also fights are long. Again I'm only 2 hours into it but I do like how the monsters feel. There huge and scary! Reminds me of when I watched Jurassic Park as a Kid and saw T Rex.The WEAPONS are awesome aswell! Many to choose from with different playstyles and cool moves. I also have a few problems with graphics for example sometimes my frames slow down (minor but my pc can handle it).Most of the time textures take some time to load and it is very noticable. Also I had to lower the brightness quite a bit because the in game enviroment is VERY BRIGHT. My Specs AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Nvidia 1060x And trust me on the rest. My PC can handle it. Ask me if you need it though I'm too lazy to look right now.If I were to rate this game so far..... I'd say 7/10 if im optmistic. It may take some time to grow on me. And currently I can'tsay I'm satisfyed with paying $60 for this game. Reminds me a lot of Evolve that other monster hunter game. O how did I forget. THE LIP SYNC WITH VOICE IS HORRENDOUS. LIKE MASS EFFECT ANDROMEDA LEVELS LOL. (Or worst),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-05,0,0,26,False,Recommended,As a diehard fan of the Monster Hunter series I've been playing since the days of the PSP. I've played many of these titles. Unlike some of the other veterans I actually really like this game. I like that some aspects of it are easier. I feel like there is less hardcore grinding and more action. I simply don't have time for all the griding in my life anymore that was required in some of the older titles. So this is a welcomed addition in my opinion.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-05,0,0,301,False,Recommended,I've Been Playing in the Monster Hunter Franchise since MH2. Aside from the Sheer Beauty of Monster Hunter World there are 14 Weapon Types to Master With a lot more Armor Sets ( Fashion Hunter ). The Pallico Setup + Multiplayer was done well. A good number of Monsters to Hunt. each with their own unique fight to master. There is definitely some grind but such as the case with this series. Comparetively there is less of a grind to other MH Games and even less than some of the MMO's out there. The Rank up / Hunter rank system is very well done. The Main story. albeit a little short is still good It does connect to the rest of the Series. I'm almost 185 hours at the time of writing this. I have over 2000 hours in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.... I'm easily going to beat that with Monster Hunter World. 12/10 Worth the Investment.P.S.

Graphics and animations are amazing compared to the older ones. Sure a part of me misses the OG Monster Hunter feel and even the graphics but this one made a huge step in the right direction. I do feel like the weapon tree is lacking compared to older games though especially until you get in the High ranks. Designs are just meh until you've maxed the weapon out and even then some of them are too similar to the others whereas in older ones there were tons of variants and a lot of them were unique within their monster variants.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Coming from a PS4 where the loading times took literal minutes sometimes this is amazing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-01,0,0,253,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is a game series made primarily for Monster Hunter veterans and while this feels like a much more accessible and user friendly game than the ones I tried to play before that's still obviously true.But this one did stick. It's addictive and rewards carefully planning out builds tailored to each monster. It's grindy in the extreme but if that's your thing then this does that type of gameplay well.And on the plus side after slaying The Behemoth I think I'm a Monster Hunter player now.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,203,False,Recommended,This game is has a plethora of improvements over previous titles but over ambitious map design makes navigation a greater challenge and a greater timesink than fighting the monsters or preparing for the battles. The added frustration kills the tension of a great battle.Updating this review from negative to positive after several more hours of play. The first area is still a problem but the rest of the game eclipses that inital negative impression. After the forest area the desert provides a much better training ground and subsequent areas do not approach the complexity of the forest. It is a shame Capcom tied to show off at the beginning of the game because the overall experience is wonderful outside of the overproduced first map.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Story cutscenes are slightly annoying and unskippable/temporarily block co op but are a non issue and disappear entirely after 40 hours in a 100+ game. Port is good enough at the time of writing this review doesn't perform well on older hardware but also performed at sub 60fps on consoles ontrols well enough with kb+m. Load times alone make this the version to get.EDIT As for the crash/disconnect errors every negative review mentions I didn't have any at the time of writing this (40 hours) hence their absence from the initial review.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

(Not that I can even fight them yet) Im just barely into high rank and ive already sunk over 30 hours into this game i think thats longer than the usual but I had to collect the full sets for all my favorite monsters! Anyway yeah the game is good and mostly fixed now still getting some frame drops with a i7 700k and a GTX 1080 at 1080p which is kinda really bad but ya know!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-01,0,0,198,False,Recommended,I'm gonna keep this short because we all know what monster hunter is. I generally play on PC more than Switch XB1 PS4 and after playing the ps4 version I just had it with the inconsistent fps that I managed to catch the PC version on sale and gave it a run. OMFG I am hooked and love it better on PC! GTX 1060 OC Ed 16GB 2166 RAM I3 6320 and this plays maxed at 1440 or 1080p 30 60 FPS now the 60 FPS made me want to puke and wasn't enjoying it at all. 30fps was awesone and never dips lower than that and the load times are 5 secs compared to PS4 50secs to A min in most cases. Came across one crash so far and it was when I was playing online with 4 other players and was fighting a Baroth and all of us were hitting it and maybe there was just so much happiness going on at once that it crashed but other than that the game is perfect in my eyes. Xbox 360 controller works or Xbox 1 with my exp and thank you for that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But you are so all's well.A truely fantastic game Monster Hunter has been one of my favorite series since 2015. Certainly the best in the series packed to the brim with things for newcomers and verterans both. It is a challenging experiece that allows you to grow naturally as a player and a character in the game. You can look cool feel cool and actually be cool in this game as you hunt more mosnters and craft better gear to fight even more vicious monsters. It's a game you can plug 50 hours to and never get board. Grinding in this game is so. much. fun. I don't say that lightly.If you're looking for an action packed game with satifying controls heart pumping action and a ton of weapons and armor I can't recomend anything but this.

Best enjoyed with friends but the random pick up groups aren't all that bad the community doesn't seem to toxic. I enjoyed the controls more than I have in the past with Monster Hunter Tri.

2018-11-25,0,0,81,False,Recommended,Great GameCombat animations are good. While the general gameplay loop is enjoyable.The best game in the series for newcomers with dozens of quality of life features that are not present in previous entries. Unfortunatley the multiplayer system can be very confusing to use and you will most likely need someone to walk you through it.The same goes for most of the complicated systems in the game this isnt necessarily a bad thing as being taught how to play and then teaching others is a unique experience that is part of what makes Monster Hunter Monster Hunter.All in All if you want a solid melee based PvE game that rewards you based on how well you play then this game will be to your liking. BEWARE If you hate grinding or do not have that much time to play then you can't expect to see everything this game has to offer. The game isnt easy but it most definitely is satisfying,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,164,False,Recommended,This game does so many things right as it does wrong.Graphics are okay but nothing to stand out. Story is almost non existing. Online features are scares and laughable for a 2018 game. No possibility to join missions as a team what you need to do is join a mission fast enough with a friend to take the limited mission slots. Frequent server issues to join online sessions. Very disappointing especially knowing that most issues have been known since console launch and strictly REPEATED. Event schedule is identical to the console one half a year ago. The monsters log is scarce with some monsters just being recycled from an existing monster but in a different colour and higher aggression and damage output. However it must be said that the loot system is addictive and pushes you to know your monsters in order to get that particular armor build you are looking for.The co op part may save it for you as it did for me feeling satisfaction after successfully slaying beasts 6 times your size with a friend having outsmarted it in the end.Please do note that the game series is known to be rigid and strongly based on repetition (for material drops monsters being present in different colours but basically the same and mission types)The game was said to have a delayed launch for PC to ensure quality but this feels like a cheap PC port.

2018-08-18,0,0,123,False,Recommended,I personally haven't had as many problems as many other people have. Yes there are connection issues here and there but a reconnect fixes it right up. I haven't really had any kind of quarrels about the game that make me change my mind from how much I actually enjoy it. I've been playing since MH4U and I've loved the series in its entirety. I've been waiting for this for years and now that I have it I can't seem to stop. Can't wait for more content and I can't wait to see more fixes and updates to the game through the years.UPDATE I have been having numerous issues with my graphics card failing on this game. No other games have had any graphical issues that cause immediate crashing so it must be this game. It has gooten bad enough to edite my review. This NEEDS to be fixed as I have lost several hours of time and effort because of a crash. I love this game but there should NOT be as many problems as there are with how much time they had to PORT a game. Not create a game but ONLY port it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,140,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is one of my favorite games of all time. The Monster Hunter team finally made a game that is both accessible and on mainstream consoles and even PC! Now that Capcom has cleaned up all of the network issues I can't recommend this game enough.If you're new to the series I highly recommend this game. The highlight of Monster Hunter has always been the meaty combat and huge boss battles. This game takes it even farther by reducing the amount of downtime between hunts due to the lack of as many gathering missions. A fair warning here combat can feel clunky until you get used to it. If you're feeling like combat is just too slow or you feel restricted by your attacks switch up your weapon! It's really important to try out lots of weapons at the start even if you want to specialize later down the line. If you're familiar with Monster Hunter then you'll probably love the streamlined gameplay as the game still has the same feel without the tedious gathering. Gathering in World is much faster than it has been in previous titles and because of that it can be easily done during other hunts without sacrificing very much time. The combat feels faster and a little smoother which while I like some might not. That said 99% of the game still feels exactly like Monster Hunter always has.Now onto the negatives. One of the things that I've heard the most complaints about are the scoutflies. Scoutflies are the little green bugs that lead you to your target. They can be kind of bright and obstructive but on PC we have an active modding scene so if you feel like the scoutflies are too bright they can be changed. If you're familiar with the other Monster Hunter games that came to the west you might feel that Monster Hunter World lacks the content of MH4U as this game does not have a G Rank. Nobody knows if Capcom will release an expansion or new game with a G Rank but they are supporting this game with plenty of new event quests and new monsters. With all of the content in the game right now I would say you could easily get 80 100 hours out of this game and probably more if you enjoy collecting equipment. And Capcom is releasing more quests and new monsters fairly often.Overall this game is the best thing to come out of this generation of games in my eyes and I cannot recommend it enough.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-26,0,0,2,False,Recommended,I already played this game on console as I wasn t going to wait months for a PC release however when the PC version was released it was a joyous time for me.

2018-11-21,0,0,198,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a riveting and great accessible entry to the popular hunting series Monster Hunter. If I could describe this game in as few words as possible. It would be that this game is the ultimate hunting experience with a variety of weapons to pummel and beat monsters from the anime esque Longsword to the spinning death ball Hammer! Of course there is a lot more to it and with constant updates I always find a reason to come back to this game. I played through the whole game solo before on the console launch but I bought the game here on PC on launch to play with friends. Granted there were many issues at launch but the majority of issues are fixed now. And because there are 14 different weapon which ALL play differently I did not regret my purchase nor get bored at all. A very fun and great game with some of the most satisfying boss gameplay and combat I have ever played. I hope Capcom continues to bring more Monster Hunter titles to PC! It is a fantastic series!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-03,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Just not my cup of tea first off I think a better tutorial would help. Compare this to another monster hunting game Witcher 3 In Witcher for the first real monster hunt (hunting the griffin with Vesimir) you are given tutorials on how to properly prepare for a major monster engagement craft some bombs lay a trap brew some potions make some oil and this lays the groundwork for monster hunting in that game in general you have to have the right equipment for the job and the games does a good job of telling you want equipment that is. This game does the exact opposite theres a mess of UI's and even if you managed to get to the monster entry in the research place it gives nothing but a description not what ammos are effective against it not what kind of traps you can lay or other details nothing. Take the first real hunt (Greater Jagras I think what it was called) for example. You are told to upgrade your gear buy stuff from the quartermaster and get a meal from the chef before going into the fight. nothing about what ammos are blades are effective or what kind of bait you can use or even how to track the damn thing (they wait till during the mission to tell you a real nitpick from my side but still) Additionally the game does not make it clear in the slightest that this was meant to be played through multiplayer. I thought it was going to be a primarily singleplayer game with optional multiplayer (think borderlands or don't starve/together fun alone even better with friends) but I guess I was wrong. I just don't think this game appeals to me bad tutorials and terrible UI's are extremely offputting to me (unless something else can draw me in like Elite Dangerous's space aspect). Maybe when I have more time and patience I will go back to it but for now I'm probably not going to play it. Of course maybe I'm just a big dumb idiot none of the other reviews mention a bad tutorial so who notes. Regardless just not for me. Unlike the other reviews I never had problems with performance and the controls while clunky aren't that bad. Bad characters is also something I see mentions in other reviews which I agree with but its a JRPG so I expected it. TLDR A better UI and a better tutorial with less focus on multiplayer could make this game amazing. I've gone back and replayed the game a lot and I got to say I judged it unfairly. I just needed to get more time to learn the mechanics and maybe look up some guides to learn how to do stuff.The tutorials and the UI are still hot ing garbage but the rest of the gameplay and depth of equipment makes up for that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-10,0,0,102,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is strangely just like the old monster hunter games but also different. They dumbed down/made some mechanics more streamlined and they made online more accessible compared to the old games so if you are new to the monster hunter series you should pick this game up to start. Then you should go back to the old games like mhfu and see how slow and brutal this series used to be. All in all this game is solid and is worth picking up if you've got an extra 40 60 dollars just make sure you have a controller nearby as playing the game with a mouse and keyboard is like shooting yourself in the foot.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,263,False,Recommended,I am a Hunter of the old times... a veteran if you want to call it like that. I've been playing the series for numerous years now and yet i'm still loving it! This game in specific brings in really good graphic and a pretty good story line to the already very good combat system and tweeks that one even to feel more fluid and rewarding. There might not be just as much content as in previous games of this series yet but therefore it has almost only new Monsters with their own habits and way of living in an all new and fancy eco system.The only little problem I see in this game right now is the fact that you can kill almost every Monster in less then 5 minutes when you get to the late late game so the fights start to feel more like a slaughter of your prey then a serious hunt. But there is already new and harder content on Ps4/Xbox so we just need to wait until this gets to PC and the problem is fixed ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,78,False,Recommended,"An excellent entry point into the franchise Monster Hunter World captures the spirit of the original games while combining it with the series tagline in the most appropriate way possible ""In the world of Monster Hunter you are never alone."" While some simplifications might be a bit awkward for series veterans (the ability to switch equipment mid hunt a simplified crafting system that left a number of series mainstays behind and making all elder dragons uniformly weak to ""Elderseal"" instead of using their classic weaknesses e.g. Daora Kushala) it still delivers an all around great Monster Hunter experience. The promise of future updates adding in more monsters (some of which have already happened) extend the value of the game much futher for anyone balking at the price.

However there are game ""mechanics"" outside of a monster's moveset and overall feeling that I dislike which I'll talk later about. The difficulty curve is very good (except two cases). Here is my personal difficulty curve in a scale of 1 to 1000 Before LR Odogaron 1LR Odoragon 5Discovering permaflash strategy all HR before Nergigante 1Nergigante 30Kushala 5Teostra 15Lunastra 40HR kirin 40 with LS 1 with Gunlance.Vaal 1Xeno 12 Tempered Bazelgeuse 100Tempered kirin same as HR Kirin.Post Tempered Kirin All LR 1Post Tempered Kirin All HR 1All non fliers tempereds 5All fliers tempereds 25Arch Vaal 50Arch Kirin 350 with LS 100 with gunlanceArch Teo 70Kulve Taroth 700 with LS solo 40 multiplayer.Behemoth 900 with LS solo 500 multiplayer.As you can see the difficulty curve ridicously spikes at Kulve and Behemoth compared to everything else aka theres no middle ground difficulty (the Archs are time limited) which I'll expand upon on the ""what I dislike"" section.On the other hand there has been six main factors that massively reduces the difficulty curve for most of the game if you know what you are doing (which explains why I didn't bother setting a specific difficulty for each and every monster LR/HR/Tempered) 1) Mantles Especially Temporal and any of the Element resistant ones. Combine this with Tool Specialist + 50 min quest + some patience and you are able to always hunt with a mantle on.2) Felyne Insurance and Felyne Moxie both are food skills from the Canteen. Basically you can die once without penalty.3) Fortify skill Gives greater attack and defense after faiting up to 2 faints.4) Cluster bombing.5) Permaflashing.6) Restocking and changing equipment at camp.* What I'm neutral about the game From going to HR 1 to HR 50 discovering all of the game's aspects little by little in the end the overall feeling is that the game feels too ""streamlined"" compared to past games (My first MH game was MHTri which I played since 2010 World is my second game which I played since late 2018). It's not a bad thing but I just wanted to point it out.* What I dislike about the game As I said before I actually do love all monsters of the roster. The thing is there's problems with two particular monsters and it's not a coincidence the game specifically tells you to hunt these two monsters with other hunters here's the breakdown Kulve Taroth Three problems.1) The rewards system is not good if you are looking for a specific weapon. Unless you main 3 or more weapons just be content from what you got so far if you intend to farm it. I main ONE weapon so imagine.2) The HP is the same regardless of doing solo or multiplayer.3) There's TWO time limits One is the clock the other is invisible and depends on Pursuit Level But the LVL6 one is not enough time.Behemoth Three problems.1) The rewards for Extremoth are mostly not worth it in my opinion.2) The HP is the same regardless of doing solo or multiplayer.3) The time limit is too short. BIG problem because it's not a matter of playing passively either it's a matter of either going all in or go home. AND even if you all in YOU WILL TIME OUT if you are using a defensive build/set/decos. It's ridiculous.Really those are the only serious problems I have with the game I could forget some things but they would be very minor things.I'm not including the disconnection issues because the game is mostly soloable EXCEPT (they are doable but hear me out) Kulve and Behemoth from the reasons mentioned above. I know they have been soloed but just look at the difficulty curve that I felt.* Things some people hate/dislike that I disagree with The Handler She is actually alright for me she likes food a lot so what? Reminds me of Goku in a way. Pretty sure there is a character trope going around there heh.X things that Y weapon users do These kinds of generalizations are bad discrimination too. Also getting flung by someone makes you be able to deal mount damage if you attack.Non Human NPCs Clearly newcomers to the franchise who say these things. I'm a cat lover so I may be biased but there's lore as to why these kind of NPCs exist.The monster attack's hitboxes They are pretty decent in my opinion most of the time.The story It's fine for me. Especially if backed up with previous lore of the franchise it's not that bad.""Bad"" graphics or artifacts on low settings I mean... what did you expect by going low? AND I do play on low btw lol. If it were possible with more settings I would go even lower just for more fps.Goofy stuff or stuff that doesn't make sense You have to understand where the game comes from. Japan. Different culture.* Things some people hate/dislike that I agree with Most of the weapon designs I completely agree. Going for realism is not a bad thing but changing THAT feature of the series dramatically is horrible!Lack of monsters 100% agree. Then again I come from Tri which had a measly 18 monsters and I never played that game online so I only played with 15 monsters. BUT World is supposed to be way bigger in scope right? Well... not so much on the monster roster it seems.Collaborations I believe behemoth was a clownfiesta in the end unless you played in a voicechat group 24/7. The Assassin's one was also a clownfiesta I heard. I prefer if they focus more on expanding the roster WITHOUT collaborations (like Lunastra and Kulve) because frankly Behemoth WHO IS NOT EVEN PART OF THE GAME'S UNIVERSE shouldn't be the hardest monster in World. I want the hardest monster to be a Black Dragon or something.Nonsense HR requirements Mostly agree. It should have been like this specifically HR 75 for any Arch Tempered and Kulve HR 100 for behemoth and I guess HR 150 for Extremoth.Disconnects and Crashes Agree. These kinds of things cannot be 100% fixed but they can always be improved which I think they are not focusing on enough.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"Most of the gameplay is in the title hunt monsters and kill them. Although sometimes the monsters run away a little too much. This game has a beautiful and emersive environment with monsters pretty much everywhere you look. Normal animals are easy to kill contrasted to the monsters you fight in the game which sometimes can take up to 30 minutes! Although it is definately worth it. Playing with friends or others is definately reconmended because it makes hunting much easier having someone to take hits while healing or recovering.The only downsides to this game are the customization options which are pretty minimum to say the least but still ok. Also the co op/multiplayer options for the game are not super clear and if you are trying to play the whole game with a friend or group of friends will be distrupted because quests with ""cutscenes"" will not allow you to party up.All in all this is a great game and a fun way to kill time although you will be need at least an hour or more to fully enjoy it.

2018-11-25,0,0,36,False,Recommended,It's a grind. A lovely blissful grind but a grind nonetheless.Now this is my first experience with monster hunter and I have to say I was very surprised by the level of polish here. Buying and playing this game will stick out as one of the few times where the hype was justified and satisfied. It looks feels and plays fantastic. Every weapon feels different as does every monster you fight. The world feels alive and when two colossal monsters start slapping eachother it gets hard not to just stand there and watch. Kudos.However this is not what I'd call a perfect experience. I have to nitpick at a few things. There's something to be said about the latter half of the game. There's missions where you need to wander around the maps and collect tracks and such. This is required for completion and stops any progression dead in its tracks. I get you want me to explore but I already ran up and down these maps already. I want to fight monsters not wander around the map. I was playing with some friends and none of us were particularly pleased when we got to this part. The game was actively trying to waste our time. That's a no no. Speaking of waste of time a lot of these monsters have way too much health. Combine that with a tendency to run away every few minutes and some instant kill moves and you have a recipe for some frustrated players.But I'm not going to say that those complaints effected my experience of the game very much. The thrill of the hunt and that burst of accomplishment when a monster finally goes down easily makes up for all of the games minor shortcomings. Yes it's kind of annoying that I can't skip cutscenes and that the story itself is kind of flat. But who really needs that when you can slug an actual dinosaur with a huge sword?Easily worth the money.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

And all things considered from their weird start (I jumped on with the console release first and then waited for the PC to do it all over again without batting an eye) to some technical dificulties (though I can't say I noticed any) it's a game you will either abhor or love. It looks like a simple button masher on the surface but the actual environment never grows hard on the eyes and the nuances to a successful and efficient hunt are much different than just hucking your nice warm body and a big hungry beast.

2019-01-09,0,0,230,False,Recommended,My buddy that I always play vidya copped it first and loved it and really wanted me to get it so we could jam. He got it a week before I finally caved and got it myself I absolutly hated it for the first few missions I had never played a monster hunter game and was running around like a headless chicken trying to figure out wtf was going on. I couldnt find the monsters before i collected enough tracks to get the scoutflies working correctly and was seriously considering returning it but I gave it another chance and I'm so glad I did. Once everything clicked and I knew what I was supposed to be doing Ive been having a hell of a time with this game. At first I only played when he was online since I wasnt really excited about it but now I play no matter what and will solo like a champ. If youre new to MH games give it a chance I know at first its hard to like but once you get the mechanics down you will be glad you hung in there. One of the things that really put me off was capcoms crap online ui once again their games online access and design is stuck in 1995. If your friend starts a private game instead of just joining them or having them invite you like every other game in existence your friend has to copy and paste a unique session id to you in external chat wether its steam or facebook it doesnt matter it just cant be in game. Then you copy the id and seach for it and join the game its so ridiculous especially when you can see your friend in the freinds session list in game but cant join them and there is no instructions on this nonsense workaround so you just have to kinda figure it out you can click your friends game and choose join and it just says sorry you cant join a game in session this way. I just cant figure out why they decided to even have a list of friends games online if you cant e3ven join them from said list. Its annoying but dont let it take away from the fun of them game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,330,False,Recommended,From a Single Player point of view MHW is a great game its gameplay has been greatly streamlined from its predescessors there are no major gamebreaking bugs to speak of and quality of life has gone up substantially no more pained wrists from struggling with a tiny PSP. That said it is still very much a Japanese game with all its associated eccentricities it has a very steep learning curve and for a game about hunting and studying monsters it gives very little information about itself or its mechanics or otherwise burying it all under mountains of text. If you are used to JRPGs you will be fine but if you are a casual or new to the series consider yourself warned. That said if you are content playing alone then this game is a definite buy. Multiplayer though is what tips the game into negative territory because for a game about getting together and hunting stuff the getting together part is horribly problematic. The game features many gamebreaking bugs that range from connectivity issues sudden disconnections post quest disconnections inability to rejoin quests after being disconnected (hence losing rewards and vouchers) etc. So I cannot recommend the game until Capcon has patched all the problems but then again its only been a week since release. N.B. There is a well known bug about the game crashing after Alt Tabing which is a since you need to trade Session ID Codes to actually join other people's games and Steam in all its wisdom disabled Chat in Big Picture which is mandatory for using a Xbox 360 controller. This can be fixed by switching to Borderless Window Setting allowing you to Alt Tab without danger of your game suddenly crashing. And of course if you are having performance issues disable Volumetric Rendering a view of the sky doesn't really matter when there is a T Rex sitting on your head.*Update One year on Capcom has addressed virtually all the issues and has a kept up a steady stream of FREE post launch content. As you can see from my hours logged this game is very much worth the money.*,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-27,0,0,324,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game solo with friends and most times with randoms. For someone who hasn't played much of the Monster Hunter series World does a decent job at getting you to learn the basics thoughout the game. It does have a story that can be completed solo or with people. Even with the story complete there are hundreds of hours that can be spent playing because of the decoration system. Farming tempered monsters to get those decorations for your weapon/armor sets is the endgame goal. There are plenty of weapons to choose from with different gameplay styles so there should be something that you like playing. Monster types are varying and each have their own movesets and behaviour. Personally I haven't had many problems with the performance of the game besides the scatter disconnect from online but that happens very rarely. Overall I think this is a great game that is very rewarding. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good singleplayer/multiplayer experience!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-27,0,0,50,False,Recommended,I wasn't sure this game would be for me but this game is an amazing blast. I hear it's a bit easier than games in the past though I wonder if that's because most of them were handheld portable titles whose controls can be a little more difficult that a full comfy controller but either way it's challeging while being super fun and accessable. If you've ever had an interest in the series I suggest giving this one a try. It still has a difficult curve starting out for new players but the experiences you learn over your play time really make the difference in being capable rather than just levels or gear. This is a game you can have a blast with friends and even alone for years.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-12,0,0,318,False,Recommended,Disclaimer This is my first Monster Hunter game so this review will be aimed at a similiar western audience. I have played this game on PS4 as well (160 180 hours on record).Where do I begin.. Monster Hunter World is different to your typical western RPG. No it isn't Dark Souls as they like to say. It is difficult to grasp yes but it definetely isn't a clone. The gameplay loop of this game looks like this Kill monsters &gt Gather their materials &gt Craft gear from said materials &gt Use your new gear to fight more monstersThere is a story in this game but it isn't great by any means. It simply functions as a medium to introduce you to new locations monsters and characters. It can actually be described in one sentence 'You come to the New World as a member of the Fifth Fleet to investigate and resolve the Elder Dragon crossing.'The design and graphics of this game is absolutely amazing. Each monster is visually unique and has different attacks. Sub species of monsters (simply put different colouration) also have their movesets expanded and behave differently from their main kind. Weapons and armour design can be a bit lacking compared to previous MonHun games but there are still unique pieces of weapons.Speaking of weapons there are 11 melee and 3 ranged weapon types ranging from the massive Greatswords to weeb ish Dual Blades Bowguns and even Hunting Horns and each of those 14 weapon types has their unique playstyle. Your typical Sword and Shield may not be the most damaging weapon in the game but it boasts utility allowing you to heal and fire your slinger (a ranged utility tool everyone has) without sheathing your weapon or your Insect Glaive which allows you to propell into the air and mount monsters with ease as well as having a Kinsect to boost your stats temporarily.There are 5 locales in MHW as of now each being strikingly different from the one before it. Ranging from lush green jungles of the Ancient forest to the shifting sands of the Wildspire Wastes you will want to explore more of those locations as each tiny corner has something that could be of use to you there are resources spread everywhere plants bugs bones metal deposits. Half of those are used to craft consumables the other half to craft weapons and armour.The dilemma between playing solo vs coop is a hard one for me. Personally I played through the entire game on my own at first. Not because I wanted to but because the servers simply didn't want to connect me on my PS4. That being said it is entirely possible to finish the game on your own. Some people might obviously want to play coop and that shouldn't be shamed. The time it will take to reach the final monster of this game will be around 50 60 hours depending on how long you will take. After that however there are enhanced Tempered monsters lurking around. Killing those will unlock additional weapons and armor upgrades as well as decorations (jewels or gems that you can slot into your gear).Definetely one of the best games of 2018 in my opinion even worth the full 60 price. If you are unsure you'd like it however wait for sale it usually goes down to 40 or so.Thank you for getting this far I hope you're having a great day.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,125,False,Recommended,It started off as a normal night... playing monster hunter and having a good time.... but he kept showing up. The damned beast.... quest after quest he would intrude and ruin everything. I was failing so many quests because of him just randomly appearing and getting a cheesy hit.... I grew irratated and got off the game and went to sleep.Even in my dreams I can't escape him... a normal family dinner a date skiing... no matter what I dreamt he was there swooping overhead roaring. I became so shook that I violently awoke in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.. through the darkness of my room I could see a glimmer...what is that?I sleepily got out of bed to investigate itit can't be!!!!It's a Bazelguese scale.... just laying in the middle of my room(not a low rank one either it's energy could be that only of a high rank)Quick I have to keep him awayI ran to the kitty litter to grab some turds and I lay them around my room even under my pillow.Feeling relieved and safe I dosed back to sleep just to be awoken to the light of my computer coming on and the sound of monster hunter's battle music playing through my speakersI wearily try to look at the screen through my crusty eyes... what the hell is going on..It's bazelguese!!!!!...... he's just standing in the middle of my screen staring at meI quickly jumped up and unplugged my desktop but the screen remanined onI should have known better... no amount of turds could drive this horrifiic beast awayHe began running towards me... and thats all I can rememberI had fainted...I was awoken by my cat licking my face... I...I dont feel normal...I feel... sexually frustfrated and angry... and I feel like I have to go around telling everyone and showing them just how insecure I am I have to keep telling them... thats rightI'll follow them around... no matter where they goI'll find them and let them know just how sexually frustfrated I am,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Holy I just want to play with my friends and its nye on impossible without encountering some god forsaken networking problems with their garbage servers. But thats not all maybe I could just resign in and all will be well. Well I would if I could but you have to exit the mission to relog into the online services.

2018-08-12,0,0,35,False,Recommended,"Overall great game but the large amount of issues with the control scheme makes many things annoying.First of all I choose keyboard and mouse because i find it easer to play with even though I wanted to play with a controller. Menu navigation is very tedious on both controller and keyborad but having a mouse is a bit helpful.Game cursor and camera are just badly emulated control sticks so both will only move at set max speed.There's no click and drag or simple ""holding shift to unstack"" and ""hold ctrl to move the whole stack"" when managing the storage and inventory instead to take out an item from a storage you press ""1""(god why). If you want to put an item from the inventory into the storage press ""2"". So okay you're ready to go and want to quit out of the storage menu but to do that you have to press RMB because pressing ESC will take you to the loadout menu and pressing it again will allow you to change a name of the current loadout.The biggest issuse I would like to adress is the keyboard control scheme where one key is bound to 3 4 functions. Ex. Attack unsheath weapon interaction and jumping from vines all bound to LMB.Sprint stealth mode dodge and more mobile attack moves bound to space. Sometimes you want to attack but you will roll instead.This is understable on a controller but not on a keyboard. I feel like Capcom is trying to handicap keyboard and mouse players so it's evenly difficult on both devices.Combat is a much more complicated topic to just simple say it's better with a controller or with a keyboard and mouse because of the variety of different playstyles each weapon offers.Simple sword and shield playes well on both of the devices but then there's the Kinsect Glave.Most of the combat consists of bouncing off enemies and steereing a small bug trying to hit certain body parts.Playing on controller is just impossible. With ""camera lock"" on the camera is all over the place while airborn and above an enemy. With it off it's even worse since it's absurd to constantly adjust the camare and keeping a combo going. This is where a mouse has a huge advantage.There's no proper hotbar. Currently if you want to use an item bound to a number key you have to press F1 F4 and then a number key. You have to press an F key each time you want to bring up the hotbar. You can also you the scroll wheel to cycle through held items but it shows all usable items in your bag so it takes a while to find someting you're looking for.Multiplayer is broken random disconnections while with other players in a group and the game is swithcing to offilne mode often",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-07,0,0,81,False,Recommended,I'm just gonna throw out some random points. Some are facts some are opinions. Take this with a grain of salt.1. The game has a relatively easy to follow story.2. The Handler is the dullest character in the entire game. Seriously random NPCs have more development than her. 3. The amount of starting weapons is very daunting. From personal experience don't start hammer if want to have a good time. Hammer is powerful but not beginner friendly.4. Fighting reminds me of Dark Souls.5. Eating is essential if you want to be successful.6. Game looks great. Other than the opening scene the game is perfectly playable on 1080p High with a GTX 970. Average 45 60 frames depending on whats going on around me. Never drops below 40.7. Controller is almost required. Keyboard and Mouse are usuable but the game wasn't made for them. Use a controller here for the same reason you would use a controller in Dark Souls.8. The learning curve can get steep. Might need a guide.9. Don't hit your teammates with your weapon unless you want a taste of what the original Xbox Live lobbies were like.10. Anjanath will always one shot you the first time you face him. He has broken hitboxes. Good luck.11. The moment you get to high rank a monster known as the B 52 Bomber shows up randomly in your quests. You'll know what I mean when you get there.12. Deviljho and B 52 Bomber hate each other. They will fight. When they fight get the popcorn and wait a while.Good game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The frame rate is really smooth the graphics look way better than console but the only minor flaw is the fact that there are some moments in which the game decides to crash or shut down on me but I don't know if this has happened to other people but gladly it stopped doing that.9.5/10 I highly recommend this game to anyone out there who is interested in monster hunter,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,244,False,Recommended,I've edited my review and recommend the game now. The main reason I didn't recommend this in the past is because of the connection issues wherein you wouldn't be able to complete a game without having you or one of your friends get disconnected within 10 mins. Though the connection now is improved it is still far from perfect. You'll still experience disconnections every now and then but its not as bad as when the game launched.About gameplay its a game where you hunt monsters with your friends. And you do it again and again and again until you farm the weapons and armor you want and the cycle repeats itself. In other words its a grind. I personally dont mind the repetitiveness and enjoy the experience it gives me and my friends. Its fun and I'd recommend this to people who would play this in groups.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game is extremely CPU intensive and for an optimal experience out of the box (no modding) you'll want a machine that exceeds even the recommended system requirements by a good margin. For those still curious and with more modest setups read up on the mods available for optimization first. If you can also manage to snag this on sale like I did then more power to you. I put nearly a thousand hours into the game on ps4 and while I stand by my opinion that this game is absolutely worth full price on console I cannot say the same for the pc port. Monster Hunter World joins the long lineup of excellent games being bogged down by poor porting and optimization which is the reason for my refund of the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-16,0,0,235,False,Recommended,Edit They have finally fixed the intermittent connection issue so lets get on to the real review. This is my first ever monster hunter game and I have to say that I really2 love it. I think my game time spoke for it self. When people say that this game is going to be hard and grindy I honestly expected more but it is not the case at all. Like all the best games there are definitely a large learning curve but once you learn that you will not be able to put it down. Another important thing for anyone who wants to try this game. The number one thing that will make you love or hate the game is the weapon experience. There are 14 of them and I really recommend for you to try all of them and hunt a monster with it to see which one that you like. I have almost quit the game but one weapon saved me from that. It was the insect glaive (which allows you to be really fast and not slowand methodical like most of the others). There are honestly everything for everyone here you just need to push through it for a couple of hours to see which one fits your playstyle. TL DR Really good game. Try all the weapons before quitting as there is something for everyone.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monster Hunter hasn't felt this fresh since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and it does that by not only returning to it's hunting roots but also expanding that concept in a way the fans of the series never thought possible.

It's a cluster .OLD REVIEW I'm pretty early into the game but it's pretty much exactly monster hunter just with refinements. Notes about me I play on controller I played the older monster hunters I get about 30 fps I have maybe 1/6 a second input lagWhat really sets this appart from the handhelds is the online (unfurtonately kinda buggy right now) and the potential for DLC.

2018-12-22,0,0,36,False,Recommended,At the time writing this review I bought this game about 4 days ago. I'm not sure why people were giving this game such bad reviews and I've been playing monster hunter since the ones on the PSP even to the Wii U. My pc is running with an rx 480 4gb with an amd fx8500(garbage) and 12gb ddr5 ram. This game runs on the highest settings at close to 60 fps for me and my cpu is so old and busted up that i actually have it downclocked so it works properly. (for every game not just this one)Story wise it's the generic kill a huge monster sort of thing but as usual theres most of a twist. The story has enough interesting things to make you want to play more but the story is probably the weakest part. this is by far the least grindy monster hunter i've played so far. You can usually kill a monster once to farm all the materials you need to make at least one weapon armour is usually more luck based. Online works perfectly literally I just join peoples missions whenever I want. People can join me whenever they want and I have met mostly really nice people. I haven't disconnected yet and I have played this game a lot. As a note to beginners this game will reward you by the time and effort you put in. Coming from other MH games I wasn't a super hardcore fan but it made it a lot easier to hunt in this game. Knowing monster tendancies hunting grounds weakspots etc... These aren't things I tried to learn or anything like that it just comes after playing this game for a little while. Occasionally you will take a bit of time to find a monster but unlike other games this game makes it much easier to track after you find it.Controls are the same on controller as every other MH game except a few additions that dont distract from the gameplay. I'm not entirely sure why anybody in their right mind would want to sit down and play this with a mouse and keyboard. If you have a rig good enough to handle this game I'm sure you an afford a cheap controller. Only problem is that it doesn't directly support PS4 controllers so they just appear as xbox buttons when you play. Overall this game has pretty much improved in almost every way compared to previous monster hunter games. The best way to play is to sit down in front of a tv and play with a controller like the previous games. The online seems to work flawlessly even with my terrible internet. The game runs perfectly and hasnt crashed on me yet even when pretty much every other game crashes due to my old cpu. Story is whatever but killing monsters is still fun as hell especially with other people. The areas are cool and interesting with different monsters in each. overall would recommend even for new players,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-22,0,0,255,False,Recommended,I've been waiting for mohun on the PC for ages. Athough at launch there were some problems overall it's been a great experience. It's constantly updated and I really enjoy it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-22,0,0,122,False,Recommended,This is a fun game to play with friends and all. But it's a poorly port to PC. I've encounterd some glitches and Achievements does not unlock even if you've done the requirements. But in the end It's still worth to get this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-22,0,0,226,False,Recommended,For anyone who's played one of the Monster Hunter games in the past there's been a TON of quality of life fixes. No more pickaxes or bug nets and whetstones are unlimited to name a few. The open maps makes the game so much more immersive and each location feels massive. Now that can get frusterating with some of the flying monsters as you may spend a few minutes in persuit but is worth it for the overall feel and for lack of loading screens.For anyone who's new to the franchise this is an amazing one to get into! 14 weapon types that have widely unique play styles and all of them great in their own way. The monsters feel almost alive as each one has it's own attack patterns and seems to learn yours as it fights you. Even when you need to go back and refight certain creatures no two fight exactly the same. Some will favour specific moves and others will dish out everything they got. This game also keeps releasing new monsters as free updates a good mix of free and paid cosmetic DLC as well as big plans for even more great future updates. It's not too late to start hunting now and there wwill be more and more to look forward to as you go. I've loved this series for a long time now and I can't wait to see you all in G Rank next year!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-17,0,0,816,False,Recommended,Frankly speaking the game is pretty simple. You hunt monsters and craft things. Also there isn't much of a story.But the amount of gameplay depth here is pretty great. Lot's of options to craft and try out and each weapon offers a radically different playstyle. People often compare the combat to Dark Souls and maybe DS3 comes closest but the mechanics baked into each weapon class make combat more fun in the moment. Many different monster types (though veterans of the series are accustomed to more) also make for some very interesting hunts.If you have friends also into this it's really really good for co op. It's really fun to run around hunting monsters and eventually getting into a coordinated groove. Some late game stuff is multiplayer focused but online lobbies seem sufficient for the task for the most part. Occasionally there are some connection issues but nothing particularly distressing since they fixed the majority of the Day 1 issues.Highly recommend.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The monsters are challenging and rewarding to beat each map looks amazing the controls are much better but still need some tweaking and the soundtrack is amazing.It is fairly grindy especially in the late game but if you enjoy that then this game is a must have.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-05,0,0,201,False,Recommended,The core game itself is fantastic! Every hunt is different grinding gear is not too difficult to be swayed from it and playing with others online remains makes it even better. Online still has various connectivity issues that initially bugged me and many others upon release. However the patch has fixed almost all major issues and any minor issues remaining can now be worked around. Hopefully Capcom can finesse those smaller issues then the game surely can have no complaints! One of the best gaming purchases I have made!Now that the events are arriving this game will only get more worth and enjoyable!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Where to start. Monster Hunter World is an amazing addition to the long running franchise. It brings fresh gameplay elements mixed with updated and breathtaking visuals. The soundtrack is fully orchastrated and really gets the blood pumping while fighting unique and ferociuous beasts. TLDR If you haven't tried a Monster Hunter game before this is your chance. If you have played the series before why the heck do you need a review to decide to play this one? 9/10Pros Awesome in depth gameplay based on players learning the ins and outs of hunting big monsters. Yes you will get stronger gear as you fight your way through but that will only get you so far. The game is designed to reward you for paying attention learning the mechanics and discovering the weaknesses of your opponents. This creates a very rewarding experience. Design The setting of Monster hunter universe has always been very unique. It is a fantasy world but it a very organic and down to earth fantasy world. All the monsters in the game look like they belong and are a part of the ecosystem. The weapons and armors can be a little outlandish however but like the fantastic creatures they still feel like they belong. Sound and visual design are superb. Constant updates and support from Capcom really make this game great. It had a rough launch but Capcom really turned it around. Not to mention that there are free content updates every other week or so (sometimes big sometimes small but free is free. lol).Meh Multiplayer One of the best multiplayer experiences of any game series but not the best in all of Monster Hunter. You can play world for hours and hours with your friends however this entry really gives you some hoops to jump through while playing through the story with a pal requiring you to watch cutscenes before your friends can even hop into the quest. Nothing too terrible but an inconvenience nonetheless. Cons Weapon variety coming from other Monster Hunter games the weapon design variety in this one is... disappointing. most of the endgame weapons have one or two base models with a few monster parts slapped onto them and they call it a day. Which is a real shame because there are so many amazing unique weapon designs in the series. There are some select few unique models in the game but they are few and far between...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,255,False,Recommended,So far overall I'm mostly enjoying Monster Hunter World. It is my first Monster Hunter game so in the beginning it was very difficult for me to figure out how the combat flows the menus trying to figure out how to play it with keyboard/mouse lol. It's getting a little better with time. There are many things regarding the controls and menus that could have been better which others have stated as well... so I won't waste time on those.Relying solely on keyboard to move around (when you'r'e spending 40 minutes killing one monster because it goes offline in the middle of a multiplayer group) is not fun and on a Diablos at that. I almost gave out just because my finger was tired of using the W key. And that is the biggest problem. The online feature seems to only work maybe 50% of the time we try it. It's awful when it drops in the middle of multiplayer quests.Controls and technical issues aside the game looks beautiful and definitely keeps you busy with many things to do. It's loads of fun with a friend or even solo.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Game is great and maybe a bit complicated to learn at first but once all the beginner stuff is learned and past there's so much more to dig into the game. I've had so much fun with this game and it's given me a unique joyful experience unlike other games. You begin in the game with so many weapons to choose from with each having their own unique abilities and strengths. There are many monster you encounter throughout the game that have their own weaknesses and as you progress you can upgrade your armor and weapons. There's so much to do in the game and it never really leaves you feeling empty. It's a great game and really fun to play with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-16,0,0,91,False,Recommended,"Very great successor to Monster Hunter and the new ""next gen"" era.As a Monster Hunter veteran I was obviously scared a lot that they butcher it up and a lot of changes still feel a bit of weird to me but I can successfully say that imo they finally made a fantastic successor and where able to finally modernize the franchise. The feeling is still there it is still Monster Hunter at an integral part and most changes are just really great and you see that the developers really know what the fans want. I would even say that it most changes intesified the feeling that Monster Hunter always tried to invoke in the player the sense of exploration of an unknown area getting to know the exosystem and fauna and flora and obviously hunting and tracking a monster in a living environment. Many weapons got really good changes without simplifying them and the new environments are simply fantastic and have really great verticality. It makes one almost chuckle thinking back about the classic maps that were mostly just flat plains in comparison. Online is also great I didn't think they would be able to make it that good this time considering the previous ones were still a bit meh. But they really learned out of all their mistakes and previous games it feels like everything of the past came together and flowed into this new iteration to give the possibly best Monster Hunter there is. And indeed it is fantastic as both successor and as a new chapter it deserves all the attention it gets.I am still a bit sad that there are some monsters lacking I hoped would make the change but maybe they'll add them in future updates. Dearly miss the snow area but it comes in the next DLC and considering how incredibly detailed the existing areas are it can be forgiven. Story is also a bit meh the new world is great and interesting but many of it feels kinda forced around it. Sure MH never had a good story (or even any) but I feel that MH4U had a much more interesting one. PC port is pretty okay but the game's not as optimized as it should be there are still some issues that probably won't chagne. But the graphics are fantastic on the other hand. Some minor issues still are there like they finally introduced a weapon tree but you can't upgrade all weapons from it you have to first chose it. Or the npcs always talking when you just want your damn might seeds. But all minor stuff thinking back about how much they improved the stuff this time in comparison to the earlier games they made fantastic progress. The next game might take some more steps.Also Kirin holy I never hated thunderpony so much.Recommended to everyone if you think hunting Monsters and making weapons and armor out of them in a badass manner is dope.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Since then however this has been mostly fixed and I can now play with my friends without problems.On the game itself The controls are tight as usual all weapons now have cooler tools for hunting monsters moving around is a million times more dynamic than in previous entries picking up environment items is mostly instantaneous and there are interactive ""environmental traps"" you can use to help during hunts.There has also been a pretty frequent wave of updates introducing new monsters events and more which incentivizes a player to keep logging in which is great and I hear there's more on the way.Overall they did a great job of making the world look alive with monsters interacting with each other as well as their environment.

For this research Kaldaien's Special K Performance Pack (PC Gamer). Is a miracle worker againts this absurd CPU use.Capcom is doing a great work with pactches and bug fix.

I think this game is great but when compared to some other games from the past it can be underwhelming. It lacks some creative monsters a lot of them are similar or almost reskins with slightly different movesets. The graphics definitely were not tailored for release on PC and neither were the controls. Despite all of this I think that if you are a new player to the series this is one of the best games to get into. That might be a negative to some older players but for me it's what brought me into the series in the first place.

We you're fans will keep supporting you and the developers of Monster Hunter. The best game in my opinion for all the years to come! Give it a try people.

2018-12-21,0,0,533,False,Recommended,I feel compelled to leave this review seeing this is still 'mixed' this game has an immense amount of content (save currently 350hr some afk) and is all included in the $40 price tag a significant amount still not released for months to come. It can feel a bit grindy mid game but the 'gameplay loop' is very refined and there are tons of players responding to SOS flares.The game has significant amounts of mods including QoL and transmog (works online) has a lot of advanced graphics settings now and again the upcoming free content (witcher 3 crossover) looks excellent.The only downside I can think of is the relatively high system requirements and some odd learning curves figuring out different mechanics and systems within the game. These really help develop a nice feeling of progression and flexibility with builds long term however and are worth learning.Also the soundtrack is great.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,39,False,Recommended,This is my first exposure to the series and I must say I'm highly impressed. The world feels like a living eco system and has beautfiul locales. The combat is incredibly varied as not only do the 14 different weapon types have seperate animations they have their own set of combos as well. This makes each type of weapon play in unqiue ways which makes the system always feel fresh. The premise is simple but this game just keeps adding layers. Clocked well over 100 hours on PS4 and I dont know if I missed a bad launch for PC that has since been patched but it runs just fine on my machine and Ive yet to drop below 60FPS so I am unsure what the negitive reviews mean by terrible port.All in all I cant wait to spend another 100 hours playing it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,21,False,Recommended,More limited time event pls!!!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,935,False,Recommended,For those among us who like figuring out the weaknesses of their opponents wander a world with areas which each have their own unique feel to them and can oversee the fact that some events are only available for a limited time... well I'd say go for it. If things like going toe to toe with monsters or bothering them from a distance paired with a developer who takes care of its games is also to your liking I don't believe you would be disappointed.Of course the choice is up to you and for that matter Yes you are perfectly able and allowed to try and tackle everything all by yourself. However for some challenges like sieges ( so far one ) it wouldn't hurt to at least bring one friend along.For me personally it's a nice game with just enough story behind it to justify the situation you end up in.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,312,False,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun especially with friends.you are new person joining as one of the monster hunters in a world full of monsters. you are in a team with a Handler and your companion Palico on mission to track new monsters that could be a major threat and to eliminate them.That is pretty much it about the game.The handler doesn't help in eliminating monsters but more stay in the back in camp and somehow communicates with you to let you know about the monsters actions. she is more a backseat that wont shut up and takes part of your credit of hunting. also likes to put self in danger in scenes.Your palico is the best companion to have around. helps in combat buffs heals tank and harvests some mats around the world while adventuring.The game is heavily skill base meaning you can die very easily in this game if you make a few mistakes.gear does help but doesn't top over skills and there is stragetize in this game on what to bring with you for certain monsters.there is a high chance of being encountered by other monsters while in combat with your target. some will fight your target which is useful advantage. other times they will all gang up on you.Other than that the combat is a lot of fun and a great feel when you pull off some moves that are hard to do.This is definitely a great game to play with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Finally the monster hunting experience comes to the PC and it's definitely worth the wait. The core game loop of hunting upgrading and hunting some more is very compelling especially with all the quality of life upgrades to the gameplay systems over previous entries to the franchise. I enjoyed the time I spent playing and would definitely recommend it as an introduction to the genre as well as for returning fans.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-21,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Gameplay? Incredible combat can be odd at times but you also gotta just git gud.Gathering and crafting? HEAPS of stuff to make use and benefit you in hunting monsters.Armor and Weapons? Arsenal of weapons that fits any playstyle your after with different elements to take down specific monsters. You're also not stuck to any one weapon and can switch without needing to return to base.Monsters? Good variety killing every new monster for the first time is incredibly satisfying. Every repeated fight is always fun as you learn more with every fight. End game monsters are intense every time.Story? Meh does the job. But this is all about gameplay.Best part though... THE PALICOES(companion cat) You get your own to customize. Homeboi follows you around with essentials gadgets and are they damn adorable.Tl dr. Get the game for the monsters and gameplay. Palicoes make it amazing to.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-25,0,0,37,False,Recommended,Game is fun enough but it's another poor port from Capcom. Would recommend getting at a discount if I could redo it I wouldn't have paid full price. Still the game is fun especially with friends pros probably outweigh the cons but it does get extremely grindy pretty quickly even moreso than Diablo (Which I love) so keep that in mind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,298,False,Recommended,Highly recommended the combat is immersive and the visuals aren't too bad either. Used to play a tun of the original on ps2 and I waited for a loooooong time for a PC port (MHF not released or coming here). If you want a game where you yourself get better as well as your gear then give this a go but if you're not into strategic combat against what are essentially boss monsters avoid it like the plague. To each their own you know but to me this is better than other games with a similar combat style (looking at you Dark Souls).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,45,False,Recommended,One of my dream games.I'd reccomend picking it up on sale if you aren't already sold on it because the title is pretty much the entire game and I wouldn't be suprised if the game dies down within months even though it's still getting updates in content.What do you do exactly in the game?YouHuntMonsters.For those who can't grasp that it's pretty much back to back bossfights and/or preparing for said future bossfights.My only gripe is the optimization but it's gotten better recently. I had to screw around with the anti alliasing a lot just to make sure my game didn't look like a window cleaner just half arsed his job. But with no help from the bs menu I was able to eventually get things looking good and up to speed.The game's graphics was designed by an alternate dimensional Bob Ross who also painted dinosaurs and dragons all over his stuff.Don't pick this up if you aren't down for grinding because that's the root of this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,195,False,Recommended,This PC port had a very rocky start but has since fixed almost all of the network and framerate issues that were plaguing it. The game itself is PHENOMENAL and outside of steam I also have 150 hours on PS4. One of my absolute favourites.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,81,False,Recommended,The one thing that really took me in when I started Monster Hunter was how different each of the 14 weapons in the game play. Each one forces you to change your playstyle and could be featured in their own game. There is complexity and depth to every weapon even the ones that seem simple at first.Then there are the fantastic monsters an amazing gameplay loop and a really fun crafting system. After all that the cherry on top is the really fun sense of humor the world has. From cats that make you a meal to really hilarious hunts. Monster Hunter has made me an obsessed fan in under a year. It is one of the best game series I have played.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-26,0,0,316,False,Recommended,"Updated Review They seems to fix disconnect problem... by hiding the messages. Well at least now the disconnect messages happen less and i can actually start a private room without being thrown error message.Old Review The disconnection need to be fixed sure it's engaging for hours when the monster are new and playing it solo but not after you have beaten everything at least once. Then came the multiplayer random disconnection can't even start a room without error being thrown first (my first attempt creating room from loading menu always fail only the second or later will work and not for long). This is after the ""disconnection patch"" that turned out to be a placebo as well.edit updated for Autumn Update 2018",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,24,False,Recommended,A short preface I played 100+ hours on the PS4 version. Very recently grabbed the Steam version and it makes the game better in many ways(Most notably the load times).Before Monster Hunter World I had dabbled in the Monster Hunter series briefly now and again. I could never get into it. Then Monster Hunter World came along and changed all the problems I had with the series. It did away with segmented maps with load screens between them. It opened up and made the game a lot more open and a lot more beautiful.Between the variety the game offers between the various weapons the motivation to keep hunting to get better equipment and the increasing levels of fun from hunting with co op partners the game has a huge longevity and keeps getting more fun the more I play it.Highly recommended.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-27,0,0,137,False,Recommended,"DISCLAIMER YOU. LITERALLY. HUNT. MONSTERS. AND. THEN. RINSE. AND. REPEAT.Before we get into this review keep in mind that I am not the type of person that has ever played an RPG game and actually spent more than maybe 5 10 hours on it. This is also my first MH game. I also suck at writing reviews so stay with me 3With that said Monster Hunter World has become a drug for me and I play it whenever I can (although as of the time writing this i'm a bit burned out as of the moment) especially now since I'm on winter break. I bought this game sometime around Thanksgiving of 2018 which wasn't that long ago as of the time writing this and I've logged about 100 hours on already. Now you might be thinking ""Hah! These are rookie numbers!"" and I would agree with you but again I'm not the type of person to spend their entire day playing a game even though I generally have nothing better to do. In this game you literally just hunt monsters and then make gear to hunt even stronger monsters. I was gonna write a long essay on the basics of this game but videos on youtube can explain better than me and I also get to save some time. Basically this game has 14 weapons one of which will suit your playstyle or you could even learn all of them which is what the cool kids do (people who one trick are gross ew). You hunt monsters and get their gear to fight stronger monsters and then you just keep doin that and gather or grow stuff along the way to make stuff that help you in your fights. BASICALLY YOU JUST HUNT STUFF K? btw 10/10 recommend buy even on full price (although who does that tho unless ur rich lets be real)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The gameplay loop is super fun the environments are beautiful and the monsters are life like and fun to fight. Fashion hunting with my SO has been especially fun. There were complaints about connection issues but besides a few times in the very beginning we haven't had any problems. Some also had a problem with the slow release of content but that has improved as well and wasn't an issue at the rate I played anyway. I also had a lot of fun playing solo and just fired an SOS flare if I ran into trouble so don't worry about needing a group to enjoy the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,740,False,Recommended,"This game have a charming enviroment and a world that wont let you get bored for a while.If you like farming and slowly improving your gear to fit your needs and you like challenging fights this might be your game.You have 14 different weapons and for each weapon the game changes completely. You need to change of strategies and even change your playstyle to fit the weapon.You can play solo or with other 4 people. With a great team you can bring down the hardest moster without any difficulty.You can learn the monsters patters and improve at counter attacking those moves.I have to add I support non abusive mods and the use of those. The mods that does not give any type of advantage over other players or the mods that will not interfere with anothers player hunt should be allowd. I thing the modding community benefits the game more than it hurts it.I hope they dont start some type of rampage banning people and breaking the mod community. It will make them more harm than good.One thing that don't like is the mechanic of ""knoking"" and ""roaring"" that being said you also learn how to aproach these problems and if you dont want to deal with these you have some skills that can mitigate the negative effects (at the cost of other skills).The other thing that I think that should need a little tweak is the skills jewels drop. Some of those are impossible to obtain it takes too long and for the people that don't play much I understand that they prefer to make some cheats or the use of some exploits to obtain them.Some things that annoy me are the char limit in chat and some menus.Playing multiplayer when trying to chat its a little bit anoying to separate the phrase into multiple messages because they dont let you write more than a fixed ammount of chars. And the same happens with the customizable loadout names and the player shoutouts.The menus could be improved a lot at least some actions they perform. Some when you select an option close completely but other brings you back to the previous menu. This type of inconsistency could be easily fixed with a patch and I hope they do so.I must say the state of the port to pc wasn't great but they have been fixing most of the issues and trying to make it fit the pc the most. There are still some bugs and anoying features but right now comparing with the ammount of content that they are delivering and fixing its starting to be aceptable.Overall I would really recommend this game now (at the date written this review) that they are catching up with the features of the console Its starting to fill with interesting content.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Acceptable enough storyline to keep you going always a lot of objectives to achieve amazing music that is perfect to put you in the mood for whatever you're confronting or overcame! I personally enjoy the absence of focus on competitive play. People spend more time helping eachother than destroying. This version is no exception. Putting everything I love about the series into something extraordinarily beautiful and easily playable with many options for different play styles. I found the added tutorial functions quite helpful for the newcomers.

2018-11-25,0,0,52,False,Recommended,"The game isn't bad but I had WAY more fun playing Toukiden 2.Few issues with monster hunter world 1. It might as well be called ""Dino Hunter"" because most of the enemies are some sort of dinosaurs/lizards.2. Relatively low monster/boss variety.3. Small number of severalble parts on monsters which is disappointing after Toukiden 2 animation system where you could cut off most limbs and creature would adjust its animation.4. Combat is quite slow and methodical.5. It gets dull.6. Relatively small number of costume types and variations.7. Really bad camera movement. When fighting certain creature you are often fighting blind because you're standing under the creature and camera very helpfully points at creature's butt. However good stuff 1. The environments are pretty and lovingly crafted. There's wildlife running around you can capture it and maps are very detailed.2. Animation is really well done game has many animated cutscenes with animation pretty much on pixar level.3. High budget title with investment into art and environments. Basically....The gameplay is sluggish/slowish and requires patience plus has learning curve. YOu try many weapons eventually find something that works keeps improving it. A lot of love was put into crafting the world itself although it mostly related to the scenery few cutscenes and so on. Despite that there's surprisingly low number of npcs you can meet elsewhere. So all things considered I'd recommend getting it on sale. Butchering dinos is less fun for me than butchering demons but this kind of game is something you could play in short portions over course of large periods of time mostly to unwind and see fantastic landscapes cats creatures and so on.Something like that.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The improvements are numerous ranging from camp travel points to item usage such as flash pods and screamer pods. The game has also finally been released for a system other than handhelds which really help to show how beautiful this game could have always been with very picturesque locations designed. The multiplayer aspect of the game has always been great as well. With the game having a more ""friendly"" community that doesn't try to trash talk and insult you 24/7. Infact you may find yourself having moments with random players as you hunt with them and enjoy the events that may unfold from coincidental synchronized action to funny moments.The only real issues with the game is how trying to do story has storylocks with friends and unskippable cutscenes. The storylocks forces you to go out of your way to view cutscenes before returning from said quest and reposting just to be able to play with other people. Luckily story isn't the main focus for the game and gameplay with variety of monsters to fight are.While the game had a rocky start with disconnection issues and other minor bugs. Capcom has patched all issues and added more options to customize based on feedback from the community. The game is constantly being updated and slowly catching up to the console's contents.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-21,0,0,151,False,Recommended,This is my first Monster Hunter Game.so saying that. I can happily say i enjoyed every moment in this game.It has never been more exciting to kill monsters and get cool armor and awesome weapons.My only problem is it's a little confusing to get started in the game and you need to farm a lot but other than that.I can recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Despite the mixed reviews Monster Hunter World is a very good game.Apparently many people have had problems with it running poorly or not starting. Personally I haven't had any it runs flawlessly for me.The only minor gripes I have is a lack of PS4 controller UI layout (the controller works it just shows Xbox prompts) and a lack of options for blur and depth of field.The rest is great but you should know what you are getting into. Monster Hunter is grindy you will fight the same monsters a lot to get materials for better armor and weapons. I've also seen people complain about a lack of healthbars for the monsters etc. Research the game before you buy it or get it on Steam and return it if you have trouble getting it to run or don't like the gameplay.If it works for you however and you like the gameplay you can a lot of hours out of it. I heartily recommend it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,142,False,Recommended,If you've never played a Monster Hunter game before I definitely recommend that you try this one as it is honestly the most accessible and easy to learn MH game to date. What is it about you might ask? Well if you like the idea fighting monsters using a variety of weapons ranging from great swords to heavy machine gun (heavy bowgun) with/without your friends then you've found the right game. If you like the idea of fighting these huge monsters in a way that makes you feel like an actual hunter where you actually have to track it down and the only way you know you're beating it is by seeing that you cut its tail broke its horns and made it limp away back to the hole it came from rather than see a healthbar for the monster (or you can capture it) then you're still in the right place. Finally if you like the idea of instead of leveling up to increase your power you just get to turn the scales hide teeth bones and whatever durrable materials you carved from these monsters into better armor and weapons which will allow you to fight better monsters (so that you can of course get even better gear) then I don't know what you're still reading this instead of playing the game right now.Now for those of you who are returing Monster Hunter fans I will say that this is not everthing you hoped for but it is a good start. They fixed so many issues with the game that we've just been dealing with throughout all the previous games such as long load screens between areas the way all your menus work (to just barely scratch the surface). It does not have as many monster as most of the previous games (especially when the switch game has so many) but it makes up for that with a stunningly beautiful world/monsters/character design... I mean it is the way monster hunter looks in our dreams where all the old pesky mechanics are fine tuned but still familiar to us old hunters and the combat just feels great and just looks fantastic. The only thing this game needs is more and more monsters. And Capcom is going to give that to us but even as they add more I still believe this game is amazing in its current state. Please give it a try and Happy Hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Mouse camera is fixed now with the addition of the new mouse mode keyboard settings have been getting more and more changes to make them more accessible and less awkward (to the point where I play with kb+m now instead of controller) and most performance bugs have been squashed so your PC won't start chugging every time someone with a lightning weapon joins the party or when Teostra's explosions go off.

2018-11-21,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Come for the hammer spins stay for the cat outfits.I would recommend this game for the number of hours I've played ( 100) if you're playing solo. I've had very little experience with multiplayer aside from the recent Kulve Taroth event so I can't speak on connectivity issues. The campaign and side missions are fun enough for single player til about 80 hours and I am sure that I would easily lengthen my play time if I did more of the events/multiplayer. Graphically I run a GTX 1070 and i5 4590 and got 45 60 FPS at 1080p with a majority of settings maxed. The exception was foliage distance rendering and some of the lighting options. On release day the game was certainly in much worse shape in regards to frame rates but it's gotten better with a few Nvidia driver releases and updates to the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,168,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter as a series has been a fascinating journey. In comparison to the rest of the series World stands out as a sort of ""black sheep"" for good and bad. There's been several quality of life changes such as eating during a hunt and having more control while using items. As someone who's played the games since the 3DS copies I've found it to be a refreshing experience and a good change of pace from the ""classic"" Monster Hunter.Monster Hunter World is still a tough yet incredibly satisfying game just like its predecessors. Although there are some technical issues to expect considering this is the first game to be ported to the PC (Not including Monster Hunter Online) I still whole heartedly recommend this game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-21,0,0,331,False,Recommended,Unlike every other previous Monster Hunter titles on consoles and handheld MH W got a lot more streamlining here and there so that it is quicker to do mundane stuffs and chores thus makes it faster and less of a hassle for the hunter to get back into the main course of the game hunting the big monsters.MH W PC being moddable is also a huge plus since the use of good mods increase the QoL of playing the game by a significant amount. For example there's a mod to better indicate that there's a material dropped on the ground by the monster and there's also a mod to add proxies of the important NPCs in the multiplayer hub so that you could do your smithing and other stuffs there without needing to leave the hub.Two major negatives for the MH W is (1) the multiplayer connection issue. This aspect has been patched couple of times since the launch but it is still not gone entirely. And (2) is the amount of large (boss) monsters. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the 3DS has 75 of them while MH W only got about +/ 34 of them that's not even half of something that came up on a handheld 3 years prior.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Thank you to the hard working developers who listen to their audience.*below is my previous review*If you already have this game for console and are looking for an awesome keyboard and mouse experience DONT BUY THIS GAME.

If i had the ability to be patient when it comes to MH I would have waited. But that's silly i cannot control myself when it comes to Monster Hunter. Our relationship is complicated... Point is the PC version is superior. Holy crap it's so much better. THEM LOAD TIMES ON PS4 EVEN PS4 PRO ARE INSANE! YOU WILL AVOID USING THE LIFT FOR A FEW LESS LOADING SCREENS!

2018-11-23,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,Still needs work but glad its on pc. * So had to change my review. Game has alot that needs to be done to make it worth playing and worth paying more than 30+ for it. First was random crashes after some time then the armor leveling and difficulty implementation in this game is severly broken i feel. Nothing you grind for really matters except trying to look cool. I keep getting monster noises that dont pertain to what they are doing (black diablos digging noise when its not) and on some points it seems the monsters speeds and attacks are fast forwarded to where they can move and dodge faster than you can. if your level 49 and your cleaning up left over low level optional missions you can die just as easy as before which doesnt make sense because i solod most of the game and was fine before. I really want to like this game but i cant completely until they keep fixing on it. Wont buy another one of these games if they leave this one to rot on pc. Oh and also it doesnt matter what you got in your pc fps will be crap and details blurry annoyingly dumb process to play with your friends and its not fun when you cant see them until your in one area before you go on a hunt your character animation is annoying voices used in all languages is lazy and cheap.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There's minor bugs with friends joining starter quests but let's be real if you need help killing the first two monsters you're gonna have a bad time. Little gathering here and there not really a big deal. Learning curve? If you're not willing to sit and learn a weapon move on to kindergarden time. Here's what I like The music score is phenominal. Everytime you encounter a big monster an amazing symphony is emphasizing the difficulty ahead of you. EVERY MONSTER IS A BOSS FIGHT! Oh you don't like killing mobs leading up to a boss? Boom problem solved go HAM on their monster butts. You get a ing grapple hook and the only downside to that is you can't use it all the time. Come on Monster Hunter get with the program.There's no ""one weapon is best weapon"". The whole game caters to a play style YOU like. You like big slow swinging swords that hit HARD GREATSWORD TIME. You like being a fast attacker with more agility? DAGGER TIME. You like range attacks? Which one? Bow Bow Gun Cannons? This is what I call variety.The armor looks AMAZING and yeah the beginning stuff isn't that good but you gotta work for the good stuff. Also what are people complaining about connection issues? That was fixed in like a week. That's a lot faster than any MMO out there has ever fixed a new expansion (looking at you WoW I still remember BC and WotLK day 1 was my Vietnam). Sorry you couldn't have the best gear day one so you can brag to your cat who hates you.Look here's the rundown. I love games that can be hard and unfair at times the challenge is what brings me back. And sure if you stick with it nothing will be difficult but have you ever tried to play with people that stand in fire? AND try to win? Come back to me if you succeed (spoiler alert you won't). This game can be hard and fair....sometimes. Nothing is going to just be handed to you and it rewards you with patience. Mechanics are mechanics and sometimes RNGesus isn't in your corner. But when you finally take that big bastard down it makes you feel good. And when you do it together with friends it feels even better.I'm telling you if you like action/adventure type games with a plethora of bosses play this game. Or even wait until it's on sale. Give it a shot make sure you're not running anything old (it's a new AAA game get some good hardware) and have fun with it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-15,0,0,248,False,Recommended,This is one of the most engaging game i've played in a long time. There's a sense of progression every time you beat a monster and you can feel that you are getting better with every time you beat a new monster.I feel that each battle is never the same as each monster is very unique I've never feel bored although I hunt same monster every time.There are a lot of weapons to choose from each weapon offers different playstyle and strategy to beat the monster.The armor sets also offers different builds for each weapon.I strongly recommend this game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-14,0,0,131,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World. Capcom's latest entry into their long running franchise. A second on the PC platform as Capcom tried their hands at an ""Online variant"" years ago but how does #2 stack up? First things first the performance. Monster Hunter World will perform well on any system if they are willing to take the required sacrifices. Both Nvidia and AMD have auto optimization in their control panels so make use of it if you fall between or below requirements. As for story It's more than your standard Monster Hunter walk through the park as Capcom seems to have placed more focus on the structure and pacing meaning more cutscenes between areas and the ability to spend hours just learning about the world through a ""Dark Souls"" like nature. Meaning you need to look and find things out in the world without help. Gameplay is close to older titles especially online at any time you find yourself struggling or in need of help you can always call for backup from the community or gather a party of four friends to crush anything in your path. Just be careful as adding more players will increase a Monsters health making the match a lot more difficult even if the Monster is almost dead. If you have played older entries expect something similar but with it's own flavor. Gameplay mechanics have been tweaked a bit to be new player friendly but will give veterans a great experience. If you are looking for a game full of wonder and world building interesting characters and absolutley massive creatures to slay with your friends I Highly recommend this game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

And I'm glad to finally have it on PC especially so I don't have to purchase another PS4 just to play with my fiance and friends.We haven't had any connection or server issues as of yet but when playing with others (even when using the SOS for help) it's always a fun experience.My only issues with it honestly are minor things 1. I wish we could change the color of our armor like in the older games. It just allows for a little more individuality. (UPDATE I found out you unlock this later on.)2. I wish we could upgrade the Palico armor/weapons so that if we find a set that we find cute we can still use it without hampering defense. (UPDATE Thankfully when you get to HR stuff there is more options and colors!)3. Bring the Horizon Zero Dawn event to the PC! I want Watcher Armor!4. More free things like hair and face paint.

If the gameplay of Monster Hunter with its incredible variability in character customization appealed to you but you were turned off by the extensive preparation and statistical gerrymandering required by its predecessors this is the game for you.It eschews the strict necessity of using the right gear/ammo/food in exchange for a more casual experience where these items can boost your run time and lower the likelihood of failure but aren't causally determinant. Highly recommoend to anyone looking for a solid action role playing game with good character customization.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-27,0,0,234,False,Recommended,I'll try to keep this brief as I know most people prefer video / audio reviews for games as some have trouble reading especially the small font the reviews provide. I love monster hunter have since MH4. This game provides around 30 monsters (Around 36 given sub species) and I easily got over 100 hours of play time in the game. I should say for fairness that I spent ALOT of time grinding for outfits I wanted and yes there is a TON of RNG when it comes to getting the carves you need. I've rather enjoyed my time in it resulting in nights I stayed up way too late to enjoy it though that's more on my impulse control issues than the game itself. When it comes to the port I will say it is not the best though for a first time the MH team did a decent job. Frame rates only dripped when ALOT was going on and there were particles everywhere textures only flickered in the final zone and the game manages to stay a buttery smooth 60 FPS when using a rig blow recommended specs. However...I will advise that my experience should NOT I repeat NOT be used as a standalone measure of performance as so many factors go into a game running well on PC that no one case should ever be taken as gospel. In the end I do love this game and I will be going back to it time and time again if CapCom releases more content for it because as people say the end game is rather dull with the main feature being super versions of old monsters that basically just deal a BS amount of damage taking a game about knife fighting monsters and making it about being perfect or almost auto losing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-25,0,0,871,False,Recommended,1 of the many MH francais i've played it's not the best one but it is definitely 1 of the fun one alot of stuff to do it does feels kinda stale after around 200+ hours mostly is because the endgame feature is not as fun(just makes you endlessly grind for the 1 thing you need and the drop rates are tidious) it makes the game feels cheap after that kinda lack of content and monster variation.all and all it's still a good game either way definitely recommend to get it if you wanted to get into MH this is a good way to start don't get it for full price as it still have port in technical fault like ERR12/5038f MW1......get it when there's sale this game did a good job at simplifying things newbie friendly ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This really kicks in the nostalgia bombs the moment I saw/played it.The graphics are amazing comparing to the old look of Monster Hunter the locale the monsters armor and the weapons. I adore the blasts and explosions in this.The controls were suprisingly good I used the PC controls I'm literally just pressing the combination of ""keys"" with respect to the portable console and pcversion and its as if they just placed the controls of the past Monster Hunter into keys and mouse. Its feels comfortable and quite easy to get used to.Singleplayer in this game is available but the main strenght is its multiplayer being able to hunt with 3 other friends is one of the best experiences especially when you transitioned from PSP/3DS into PC just like the old times.My biggest gripe with this game is the old cutscene wall and from time to time some connection issues but they've massively improved on the connectivity issue And it brings back the good old ""desire sensor"" superstition the more you want an item the less likely it will be given it to you.&gt &gt Bring back Golden Rathian",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-17,0,0,261,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter is a game series where you fight monsters to use their loot to make better weapons to hunt more monsters. It's fun trust me Having played MHFU for about two thousand hours i wanted this game. I wanted it BAD.And oh boy does it deliver You get the classic Monster Hunter expierience in the core game ever so slightly enhanced by new mechanics that overall fit the theme and the vibe of the game.You get all 14 weapon types that have ever appeared in the series along with new moves for every single weapon.You get a ton of quality of life changes most of which i think are useful in streamlining the game rather than making it actually more easy.You also get something the game never had before (afaik) a cinematic storyline.This could have been solved better since the cutscenes somewhat hinder coop play when you have not done the quest already but apart from that it's a nice touch and again it fits the general vibe (somewhat).Initially this game ran like crap on my PC (i am fairly above the recommended hardware specs)After downgrading the nVidia ""not so game ready"" drivers to the previous version (398.36) i now have smooth 100 fps at highest settings in 1080p hence why i can now fully recommend this game to basically anyone.Disclaimer I am aware of Denuvo I am aware of the day 0 patch i am aware of the poor performance the heavy CPU load and the heavy connection issues which i still have myself. If you are concerned about anything above then consider this please before buying. For me as a fan of the series i simply had to buy this.From my perspective it is still worth the full price.Update the connection issues are far less since the game gets updated every few weeks it also gets new content at a faster rate than the consoles did one day the update cycle will be the same.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-23,0,0,190,False,Recommended,After over a hundred hours in and I could confidently say that this is my Game of the Year. It has a lot of content especially the end game and Capcom continues to new add content. Performance is ok and acceptable for my GTX 1060 and all the connectivity issues are now gone multiplayer works almost perfect now.I only wish that the updates come faster so we could be on par with the console version of this game. But free content is free content and I really appreciate Capcom for giving it for free. And they are always quick to give me us the status of the updates when ever it gets delayed or they encountered any issues with it.So yeah this is my first Monster Hunter game and I am more than satisfied with it and I highly recommend it to those that like these type of games.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-09,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,I do not want to lie Until end game this game was interesting and fun.However this game suffer from following major flaws that unfortunately outshine the fun parts of this game RNG and grinding Drop rates of important materials like horns and gems are below abysmal as well as the drop rates of useful decorations You basically grind for blue (tempered) footprints until you met the low chance to get a tempered level 2 investigation with reasonable conditions When you have those investigations and manage to win the fight you have to deal with drop rates from 2.321 to 0.617 % (yes percent) to get the decoration you need i. e. there are people that haven t seen an simple attack jewel after 600+ hours there is a drop rate mod for this but it can get you bannedartificial difficultyThis is an important point like I said until the end of the story everything is fine there is a difference between smart difficulty like old monsters with new movesets or dirty tricks and bloody idiotic difficulty like bloating health and attack stats long story short devs decided to use old monsters with boosted stats and call this uncreative trash an actual endgame basically a bunch of monster can one shot you and not getting hit is usually unrealistic therefore there is no real reason to fight tempered Azure Rathalos Bazelguse Lavsioth Kushala Teostra Kirin Nergigante or Jho which is sadawful Level. and Monsterdesign sometimes you have tight time limits and need to hunt monsters that escape all over the map then you fight 5 minutes and spend another 5 to reach the place the monster fled to just to recognize that it flies off again. The monsters themselves are all copy &amp paste a simple Pukei Pukei uses exactly the same tail swing charge attack and spit attack animation like the mighty Rathalos The breath attack of Vaal is the same as Xeno just with another color and effect Of course there are some uniques but not worth to mention Every monster has a roar that stuns you a few seconds that is their greatest trump card and completely annoying and a proof how uninspired the dev team was Yes it can be dodged or avoided by earplug skill but dodging is not always reliable hard to learn and impossible if you fight more than one monster while the skill takes away defense and damage potential And then we have the ridiculous hit boxes of some monsters. For example. Deviljho s tail swing has invisible hit boxes &gt not cool disappointing graphics and performance well this is always a matter of taste but bloom vignette and the bleaching are horrible yes you can deactivate it via mod but then most colors are too strong which can truly provoke headaches regarding the performance if you do not have a high class card and cpu some attacks like Teostra s nova will most likely kill your fps and then the monster will cart your player character lack of content/ nothing to do in endgame despite the ridiculous grinding and difficulty in endgame there is nothing else to do PC is months behind console content and not catching upcontroversial player base Well the arena ranking board is always full of cheaters with finishing times like 00 01 lol Then there are the git gud and don t get hit noobs Honestly crafting during battle means accessing a menu during battle &gt nothing to git gud about it While the weapons and skill system are cool and a strong positive point you will master your weapon by matter of time as well as the monster move sets At first it is pretty hard but every player will intuitively master it Again nothing to git gud about FYI This game a mouse support so you do not even need git gud ninja reactions like in God Eater or Dark Souls And playing with randoms is meh*********Summary*********** If you can live with those points go for it because if the game has something positive like the weapons it excels in this positive points If you have real life friends that are willing to spend a lot of time with you in this game go for it I also recommend buy it from a reseller 35 $ are more than enough for this game While it has a lovely attire it ultimately suffers from poor game mechanics,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,824,False,Recommended,"I know this game has been under a lot of criticism since launch and let me just say that Capcom has really stepped up to the plate with these last couple updates. From server stability to camera controls Capcom is trying their best to keep up with the demand of their PC fan base and considering this is the first Monster Hunter to come to PC and how successful it's been I'm sure this won't be the last. I've put over 400 hours in to the game and I do not see a end to it any time soon. The replayability is crazy on this game. There are some people that say the game is a ""grind"" and in some cases they are right there is some chance involved in getting things you want from decorations and of course the big culprit Kulve Taroth. But I think overall this is a fantastic addition to the Monster Hunter franchise and I hope to see more releases on the PC in the future.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,197,False,Recommended,This game gets alot of flak. I do have a bit of frame stutter from time to time but I have an aging pc with terrible ram and CPU. What I can say is i have thoroughly enjoyed this game this far and plan to play much longer. Plays like a monster hunter game but removed some of the painful (albeit realistic) mechanics of the old game with smithing items and such. The area's are a blast and I adore how developed and well designed the maps are. Controls and combat are smooth hitboxes quite good and the monsters have a good variety. Plus them somewhat developing monster appearences into the story was neat. Only complaints with the game are that weapon designs are somewhat lacking in diversity compared to previous titles. Furthermore there wasn't a huge diversity of newer monsters and movesets but as a whole several of their new ones really stand out as excellent. Also a little more easy and casual than previous titles.A well recomended game to pick up particularly when on sale.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There are monster in different sizes but due to the diversity in behaviour and weakness the size just not counts. It is how you play. For that you really need to be patience and have a good look at monster weakness available gear items and upgrades. I find the game to be very fast in loading.

It was all that and more. Not only does it look beautiful but it plays so smooth on my 1060ti. The variety in weapons has been signifigantly enhanced and the zones are diverse and large. The game does have its issues such as connectivity and lack of non wyvern like monsters however the connection issues have improved greatly since the most recent patch and more monsters will be added in the future.

Maps are massively more immersive than for example MH3U. I think the game is rather easy but I haven't gotten to elders and tempered monsters yet.Many little things were simplified for example crafting skills. This was something I didn't like at first but got used to the new world. Mixed armor sets are much less intimidating now. The game suffered from terrible launch on PC and some bugs are still there but most of the game is fixed. Monster count is quite low but it didn't bother me too much.I absolutely recommend this to old fans of monster hunter and why not to new players alike.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,87,False,Recommended,"Fun game despite its issues.The performance isn't great especially considering the graphics are pretty much 2012 quality. There isn't enough happening in the world to warrant the massive CPU usage either considering what you get in games like The Witcher 3 and GTA V both of which run a LOT better than this game as well as look better.I haven't had connection issues like some. I've seen a connection error maybe 3 times but I wasn't trying to play with anyone or do anything ""online"" anyway so it only slowed down my loading is all...no big deal. I did play all day with some friends and aside from having to do some of the Assigned missions solo for a bit (which is stupid as hell by the way) I didn't have any connection issues with them.The controls are just fine with a gamepad. I still wish the lock on target worked more like Dark Souls but people will be stubborn. The keyboard and mouse controls aren't horrible but the mouse has a ton of smoothing/latency/acceleration which makes it feel really bad to use. It still works fine but feels pretty bad.There also should be more graphical options to adjust. Shadow distance shadow sharpness how about a freaking depth of field option?It's a fun game over all.

2018-08-31,0,0,283,False,Recommended,"Most negative reviews are based on two things 1) Server connection issues that occcured during the first week which later (withing the first weeks) got fixed. 2) Not getting all the content consoles currently has as consoles haas been out for almost 10 months. In my opinion does this give the game an extremely unfair reputation as the gameplay is simply brilliant. Speaking from a strictly SOLO experience is the gameplay quick to learn and difficult to master. There are 14 different weapons each with their own uniqe playstyle. There are in the base game 30 different monsters where two are a special case of boss battle all of which has different abilities and attacks with more monsters comming. In any way it's an fantastic game highly reccommended. If you think you're gonna like it you probably will in spite of the ""mixed"" reviews. I hope Capcom now embrace PC as a great gaming platform and release more Monster Hunter titles on PC!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-26,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Product received for free. An excellent RPG game with fun cooperative elements. The game reiterates three primary concepts which are prepare loot and kill. This leads to a long and endless grind but the best possible grind. The game stays interesting throughout and offers immense complication to many of its mechanics which establishes enough variety to keep players interest peaked throughout. With perhaps the cutest mascot ever Palicos who substitute in for whenever one of your friends are missing. A great game to play alone an amazing game to play with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-28,0,0,74,False,Recommended,"Really like this game. Already had 200h+ on my XBOX Account and still bought it again on PC.I've been waiting for this ever since I've played MH3 on the Wii and I wasn't disappointed. The monsters feel great to play against even though it felt way easier than back on the Wii but this could be because I'm already experienced and familiar with the franchise. I recommend it for people who like to challenge themselves especially fans of the Dark Souls series. Positive Combat feels smooth challenging (depending on the monster) and also rewarding. Looks are also great Both the monsters and all the weapons and armor look amazing. The maps are designed very nicely and atmospheric. Weapons are pretty well balanced and offer a great variety of playstyles so the game can be played for a long time without running out of things to do. Each weapon plays differently and has different strengths combos and so on which are there for you to master. Music especially in the Coral Highlands and the Caverns of El Dorado is well composed. Wide range of monsters to fight against. DIfferent armor bonuses enable you to create the wildest and craziest sets for each weapon enabling you to play each weapon differently once again depending on the build.Negative Some monsters have some really really really depressing and unattractive moves that weren't planned well. There is no fun in being ran over by a Rathian/Rathalos 5 times over and over with you getting up just to be instantly run over again. It's like ""Hey I'm out of real moves so I just gotta run around making the hunter unable to do anything and hit em with my gigantic hitbox"". Not thinking they are particularly hard for it to matter greatly but still. This sucks. Hitboxes!!! With MHW the Insect Glaive which is by far my favourite weapon was introduced. The aerial combat feels amazing and the concept with the Kinsect is great. However The weapon was implemented with a huge emphasis on aerial combat. The problem? Most of the hitboxes were adjusted to take into consideration your Z Axis or your height. There is nothing more depressing than seeing an Uragan knock on the floor 10 feet beneath you and hitting you midair. Nor is it with Vaal Hazak whos beam you just jumped over and still hit you. The hitboxes are still the same mess they were 9 years ago. It's like adding planes to a car game and still having them use roads to drive instead of flying. Enable us to dodge on the Z Axis! PLEASE CAPCOM!So taking into consideration that I still had fun playing this game after already spending 200h on XBOX and having ""finished"" it there I'd give this game a 4/5 stars. The game is super fun but seeing that in 9 years nothing has changed in terms of hitboxes (which I already hated back then!) makes it hard to give it all stars.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

PD Capcom get your together and finish fixing this game most of the bad reviews are well deserved.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-20,0,0,194,False,Recommended,After they've fixed the connection issues for multiplayers (which is the only main issue with the game) this game became probably one of the many best games on Steam. It's addictive it's thrilling it's intense and rewarding. The monsters you will go up against will act as huge walls that you have to overcome. Intense battles packed with fast paced actions that will leave you utterly frustrated with the entirely of the game's mechanics from how difficult monsters can be to how annoyingly slow your weapons can be at desperate times. But no matter the overwhelming stress you'd want to come back over and over until you overcome that one monster and you'll feel as though someone just patted you on the back. Amazingly diverse and beginner friendly with no requirements whatsoever for new comers to the monster hunter franchise to feel right at home with monster hunter world. The game teaches basic knowledge at the beginning on how to conquer monsters how to navigate your lands and to use the resources you aquire. More advanced knowledge however are only accessible via the forums/youtube vids. Nevertheless Lobbies are filled with veteran players who are willing to guide new players. Stunning graphics and some very unique monsters although don't expect too much mammals in this one as the game focuses really heavily on reptilian based monsters. Battle mechanics can be difficult to get used to at first but you'll learn through experience as you understand more and more about the monsters' attack patterns. Each weapons are special to their own rights and none are better than the others. It all falls down to your perspective and which play style suits you the most from feeling mighty as you hold onto a gigantic Great Sword or be a swifty fighter as you dashes around the battlefield with your trusted Dual Blades. Grinding can be repetitive especially when you're at endgame. Large amount of hours can be put into this game as you desperately try to farm for that one single special jewel with a very low drop rate. But unlike other grindy games this one actually offers a lot of fun into it as you'll never really get bored easily for the fact that each battle can be very different and you cannot really quite tell what'll gonna happen next. In conclusion definitely get this game if you want a fun challenging beautiful and addicting game that can help distract you for many weeks to come. This game has so much more potentials to grow and it's exactly going down that path. It is worth very single penny of its price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This is something I know a lot of my fellow hunters cannot say and I will lay out why. But not just yet. I want to focus on the things I really like about the game. First and foremost as a former MMO fan it feels like all I am doing all day is raiding. Most games lack endgame this ENTIRE GAME IS ENDGAME! It's awesome! After you slay the massive beast you're fighting you carve them hand in the byproducts to skilled craftsmen and get tools to help you on other hunts. Very awesome concept. Simple fun. Its so fun in fact that you want more some of the fights are just giant punching bags other fights are just reskinned versions ( and that is being a bit generous) of the same damn dragon (but you are FIGHTING DRAGONS!) and that brings us full circle to the above mention. A lot of hunters are feeling burned out on the offerings I get it. You guys have been going hard for months and I just got into the game when they released 3 new bosses. Is there a drought of content in this game? Yes. No doubt. But as a business person I understand a company has to be profitable so there are going to be droughts when content production is expensive and the concept is proven. This is the reason you should buy this game and support it. We have the chance to vote with our dollars. These are the types of games we want to see. Then hold their feet to the fire to not get predatory and when they do stop your support. That is my motive in a nutshell. But I digress. So what are the bad things besides the content drought? Well the events. Some of them are boring it's not clear what you are getting they are on rotating timers that are confusing and some of them you have to grind so freaking hard it's not even funny. Take KT (a boss/event) you have to do her in parts p1 p2 p3 etc. Unless you are lucky enough to have the gear you need to complete builds (also a punishing grind) to afford you the ability to one shot her. Now to be fair this is not very hard. Any serious gamer should be able to do this with ease hell I am not a great gamer and I can do it with ease. But I would not call it ""easy"" the difference being to a guitarist a solo may be an easy thing but to a nonguitarist making all the sounds is CRAZY! To a casual that has a job kids etc. This much of a grind is just insane. I mean you cannot even begin to justify that kind of sacrifice. And why did they deviate from the crafting form? I just don't understand. Kill boss unlock drops craft what you want.... HELLO? So in all the game is worth it. For sure I would buy it again. No doubt. I will be playing every DLC and future games. But its far from perfect.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,567,False,Recommended,"This is one amazing and stellar game I got to enjoy and already damn well making my money's worth off of it particularly since it got me to enjoy games with friends again and I have rarely if ever found such games anymore what with a drought of co op proper games of working towards a common goal and having fun along the way.It isn't perfect however by any means and is definitely lacking in various fields The story is so bare bones bad and dumb that it is best to not pay it much mind other than possibly treat it like a good dumb bad fun B Movie of go for the ride and not the thinking.The gameplay is fun in of itself what with a variety of weapons play styles builds and nothing truly meta unless you are gunning for things like speed running or similar strats that demand for essentially specific setups.The Decoration hunting is the WORST ing thing ever for RNG garbage in the stack as there is little to no means to actually MAKE specific decorations (even if say willing to give up a stacked up load of decorations you never wish to use similar to how they do have it but for such a small handful that involve upping elemental damages defenses and straight defense that it is LAUGHABLY DUMB NONSENSE).You CAN mod the game just don't expect to not be banned for it and the possibility of such is miniscule to immensely so depending on what it is. While say a ray of light indicating monster drops is minor and won't likely proc for banning things like putting in custom systems of being able to purchase monster parts craft more decorations at varied large costs and so on will more than likely bring attention.The game will start to admittedly drag out as you play due to a lack of content when compared to other Monster Hunter titles that seemingly to this day get constant support new monsters even weapons and fighting styles but sadly perhaps just how it is with Capcom in the end. We will likely never see this game get 50+ large monsters new areas weapon types and so on until they decide to re release it as a ""Monster Hunter World G Ultimate"" or something as that and have to redo it all from scratch for those that got into this game upon release.OVERALLI'd have to say it is definitely worth while of a game on discount as if it can hit your niche of wanting to be a badass taking on kickass sick monsters in stylish varied ways and keep up busy with it then by all means! Especially if you got some pals to group up on weekends or something to shoot through hunts and events as they come and go! But if there is a lack of friends (whether due to them being Console VS you on PC or just no one is interested) there is always people online to get to play with and friend with too. But if the lack of story loads of grind lack of content of variety of monsters (powered up version do NOT count in my book like with Tempered and Arch Tempered) and so on then it may not be for you.ADDENDUMKindly off with the micro transactions for god damn emotes and other nonsense like that and just add them in you were already a ing multi million dollar success do you really need the extra that badly?

2018-11-25,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Despite a rough launch this game eventually got pretty good. I'm a longtime fan of the series and this game introduced a lot of quality of life changes that make the game a lot more enjoyable to play compared to older Monster Hunter games (such as added mobility and a seperate materials bag so you don't have to worry about inventory space when you are looting crafting materials). The game isn't perfect. It feels too easy at times and navigating the menus can be tedious however the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and I recommend this game whether you are new to the series or a veteran monster hunter.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I know the main reason why this game has bad ratings is the connection issues and i can understand they often ruined a nice game with friends but people keep in mind this game only just came out plus it's their first ported game so give those people time to figure it out and fix it instead of instantly spamming the hate.

2018-11-27,0,0,104,False,Recommended,A Mastercraft of Combat Hindered Only by RepetitionMonster Hunter World is the series at its finest form hands down. This is due to the leaps and bounds Capcom have taken in player accesibility putting emphasis on ease of access for newcomers to join the hunt. However these great strides in gameplay as well as in graphical fidelity come at the cost of content. Monster Hunter World features only about a third of the titular monsters as its contemporary entry Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.Gameplay is KingMonster Hunter World's finest component is certainly its gameplay. Outside of the hub city where crafting shopping and material farming is taken care of the great bulk of a player's time will be spent on hunts. It'd be a farce to say that every mission in the game is stellar but each great monster the player faces does have its own merit. Starting with the diminutive Great Jagras and working all the way to the likes of mysterious Elder Dragons the difficulty curve is mostly smooth along the way though it airs on the easy side of the series.Part of what makes the game seem easier than past entries is the refined control scheme which now allows the player to perform actions such as firing a ranged weapon using dual analog aiming. This is a boon to players who are new to the series and likely a refreshing change of pace for those who are not. Other improvements include an item wheel for significantly easier item usage and the ability to consume potions without stopping in place entirely. It's important to remember that the game being easier because the controls are improved is not the game being dumbed down but rather the developers not moving the goalpost from previous entries after effectively making it easier to get into the race.Maps of previous Monster Hunter entries were comprised of several bespoke chunks of land connected by several different loading screens but Monster Hunter World changes that tradition with new highly interconnected and seamless maps. Monsters on these maps aren't quite living as Capcom would have you believe tending to start in the same locations time and time again but they do explore the map as a mission progresses and tend to make things more dynamic than any prior games in the franchise. Everything new about the gameplay of Monster Hunter World is an improvement right down to picking materials as you're on the move and auto crafting things if you wish it to do so.Rinse and RepeatIt's well known by now that Monster Hunter is a series whose sole gameplay loop relies on fighting the same monsters multiple times as you master their movesets and accumulate parts to create new gear before moving on to the next monster to do the same. Creating builds in Monster Hunter World can be enthralling especially when you enter High Rank at the mid point of the game's main questline and gear begins to have many more skills on it.However with such a small pool of monsters compared to both its contemporary and even most previous entries in general it's hard to say that it doesn't get repetitive much sooner than it has to. There is new content being added periodically to the game but ultimately you'll have to enjoy the fights against the roughly 30 monsters quite a lot to get the same mileage from this as you would from other entries. A lot of this comes down to items needing more overlapping parts due to the smaller selection of monsters meaning sometimes you'll have to hunt just one more of some other monster that isn't the main proponent of your materials to get an odd piece for your next gear. Chances are pretty good that other monster is one you've already faced quite a bit in the process of getting another piece of gear.It's not to say that the game isn't providing enough quality content there's still a lot to learn if you want to master combat against every monster especially as you get into late game Tempered fights which are monsters that have beefed up stats and can often take you down in one or two hits. But if dancing with the same few partners isn't something that interests you this likely isn't your cup of tea. Be prepared for repetition and if that doesn't bother you just know that the loot doesn't have as long of a tail as it used to.Fun with FriendsOne of the core tenets of the entire Monster Hunter franchise is hunting with friends. Having other people to play the game with will increase the fun by a significant factor and monsters will find themselves with increased stats the moment another player enters the level with you whether they stick around or not.The game's main questline has an awful habit of not allowing players to play a mission together until everyone has seen the first cinematic of a mission at least once requiring all but one player in a group to then leave the mission afterwards and join on one host player. This is a frankly terrible design decision and I'd be remiss not to call it out.Missions outside of the main questline both sidequests and post game content do not have this issue however and are easily accessible by friends and random players alike. You can at any time during a mission that isn't challenge locked to solo only or a quest mission pre cinematic launch a flare to allow random players to join you from a matchmaking service. If you want to help other players you can use the quest board to search for SOS Flares using a variety of filters ranging from what monster you want to hunt to the region the player is based in. No matter what you do the game is made better with other hunters mixing things up especially if they're friends you can trust not to throw the mission.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone that loves action combat and a grind for loot especially if you have friends to play it with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-27,0,0,182,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a great game if you like long boss battle like fights mix and match armor sets and weaponry aswell as a vaired amount of weapon art combat that provide diverse experiences in combat. There is something to be said about the amount of grinding one has to do in order to get everything you want but truth be told grinding in this game is far from a repetitive feel as each hunt is fun in it's own right and what the game is mostly about.Having reached the end game after nearly 140 hours of playtime (I took a lot of time 'grinding' for things I wanted instead of going straight for the mainquests) the game holds a lot of active playtime.Also highly recommended to play with friends (Or even random online people) as some (Most) hunts are far more satisfying when taken down as a team effort. The solo playing part of this is a good experience but in my opinion co oping monsters is a more rewarding experience. The pricetag can seem a bit hefty but considering the amount of potential active playtime you have in this game I would strongly recommend it if you enjoy games like the Souls Series for the boss battles.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Plus you're not button mashing that much anyway. Great Sword's Shoulder Tackle and Charged Blade's Guard Points are some of the unique additions to the genre.

Ranged / melee its all there. 14 weapons with ea their own playstyle(s). Pretty much easy to learn hard to master conceptAnyway i enjoy the game it plays really nice its my 1st Monster hunter game Got 2 saves 1 for ranged only and 1 for melee only and the playstyles are really diffrent. ( Monsters react diffrent if your close or if you are far as in diffrent movesets which is nice.)IF you like grinding this game is great and very rewarding.So many options and ways to play it is really nice! )IF you like hugging a piggy thats a option too..

2018-11-22,0,0,128,False,Recommended,Despite a rocky launch Monster Hunter World has continued to improve and stands now as a challenging deep experience that rewards preparation as much as mechanical skill. 14 weapon type choices each balanced and varied means there's something for everyone and each will take dozens of hours to master.

The game itself is beautiful to look at and the sound design meets and exceeds my expectations for a AAA title.My biggest issues with the game have to do with the fact that this is very clearly a game designed for console play. The menus require way more clicks/keypresses than they should and the social systems are minimalist at best.A lot of the negative reviews I've been seeing are A) Monster Hunter vets who are upset this game isn't something else or B) people complaining about network connection issues that I personally haven't run into in literally months. I for one am glad that Capcom decided to change things up. As good as the previous games may have been they were flawed niche games. If MH W is anything it's accessable and with it's success on PC hopefully it's also a starting point for designing future MH games with the platform in mind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monster hunter has accompanied me my whole life now.Every new game they get up with new types of monsters with unique attack patterns and a new game mechanic which enhances the gameplay in comparison to the older games.

2018-11-21,0,0,289,False,Recommended,"After reaching HR 100 I thought this would be time for a short simple review.The good Game looks stunning and alive with each monster having their routine of hunting napping wandering around the map. I was amused watching the Odogaron find a Legiana corpse and bringing it to its lair. Balance. I think the balance is pretty well thought out. You can't have both damage and defense in one build and the weapon types have their own uses and traits. Pick a weapon that you are most comfortable of. Grind. The grind for items I find quite ok except for you decorations you suck. But the grind of finding specific monster loot is what I find forgiving giving you a little taste of grind but not too much grind that you will be get too lazy to farm it. (except decorations) A lot of Quality of Life changes. Especially the not flexing animation after drinking a potion... Fun playing with friends. Team work is KEY in this game when playing multiplayer. As with MH games there are no downs or revives. if one of you goes out. You lose your shared ""lives"".The Bad Content is lacking compared to other MH games. Most of these content are locked to limited time events such as Kulve Taroth that is happening now and is extended until December. The grind. For Decorations. I understand some of these decors are great but the drop rates of these really need to increase a bit for me. Maybe I'm just pure unlucky. In terms of immersion I do not know why we have to go to the gathering hub to be able to see our fellow players in the server. I'd actually would love to see players running back and forth in Astera doing their own business. Servers. When this game got released it was a bloody nightmare. Connections always being cut off and such. But Capcom has been improving server performance lately and has been really good now recently. This could be the reasone of the mixed reviews. The Handler leeching on your achievements.The ehh??? I don't know what to call this category as players are divided by it. I appreciate Capcom making their new MH game be offline friendly and not do an online only game. If you don't knowm you can play this game offline if your internet's been cut off or just bad Capcom servers. Ahh good times. Being offline friendly makes your save file saved locally. And you know what happens when your files are locally saved? It can be exploited. Some people don't like people playing with these types of people even ranting them out on discussion pages. As much as I do not like playing with cheaters as well we can't do anything about it. As it is saved locally. Even if Capcom tries to combat these cheats these guys will always find a way to make their cheats work. Personally if I see someone with an HR 999 on my team I wouldnt mind as long he's not one hitting the monster or anything that gives an unfair advantage.Overall It's pretty good.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But your anger is thrown at the WRONG target! It's not Capcom's fault in fact it most likely has NOTHING to do on Capcom's end and here is why...(PS It's Valve's fault 100%)Remember that you JUST had an Steam update? And that your friend chat system is somewhat revamped and it's quite different than what it used to be? Well in fact other games are also experiencing connectivity issues the same as MHW so has Capcom screwed all of them with some magical force? NO! Capcom had no idea something that Valve changed the Steam API right before launch had such a dramatic effect on connectivity.Read ahead to fix your connectivity issues that Valve screwed over...Credits goes to wu360463231 in Steamcn forum and the Reddit post https //www.reddit.com/comments/96h8w5________________________________________Found this from a Chinese forum hopefully this will be helpful to you too.TL DR add nofriendsui udp OR nofriendsui tcp as Steam launch optionsThis will force Steam to use old Friends UI and UDP/TCP protocol instead of WebSocket.Here's how Right click on Steam shortcut (create one if you don't have it) select Properties In Target field append "" nofriendsui udp"" or "" nofriendsui tcp"" (w/o quotation marks be sure to add a space after the existing quotation mark) The final result should look like ""C Program Files (x86) Steam Steam.exe"" nofriendsui udpExit Steam then launch it with the modified shortcut.EDIT if you are having trouble logging in to Steam with tcp switch try deleting (Steam) config config.vdf and try again.EDIT2 according to our experiment the udp switch works far better than tcp but YMMV. Apparently some ISP performs better than the others. Also switching to wired connection can help.EDIT3 /u/Xavr0k mentioned a registry edit that makes the launch options apply on startup (so you don't have to exit Steam and run from the shortcut). Kudos to him. Here's how this works (as translated from the op. Credit wu360463231 in Steamcn forum) The multiplayer is based on P2SP (peer to server and peer) in which players has to keep connections with other players and also Valve server.There are Valve servers in Jiangsu Hong Kong Japan Singapore LA and other regions. The server you connects to depends on the host. ... Error code 83 you are disconnected from Steam (Valve) service. (n.b. this is the case when you see bunch of Steam popups that your friends ""started"" playing games at once)Error code 5038f P2P host are d/c or is experiencing interruptionsIf the host are d/c all members in his/her server will be d/c and see 5038f error.Solution force Steam to use older Friends UI which is based on an older protocol rather than WebSocket found in the new UI.Add nofriendsui udpOR nofriendsui tcpas launch argument of Steam.exeWhich force Steam to use old Friends UI with UDP or TCP protocol respectively.________________________________________TLDR "" nofriendsui udp"" or "" nofriendsui tcp"" for your Steam launch shortcut and RESTART Steam and MHW both afterwards. Also remember to launch steam with said extentions before valve fix this.Hope it worked for you as did so many others and remember...IT'S VALVE's FAULT&lt BLAME VALVE and not Capcom!________________________________________Update The game's updates have gradually improved connectivity and stability so it should be good to go now.current rating 9/10",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The fights are very fluid with interesting and active environments.The only naysaying I have so far is the lacking of more endgame content that most of the other entries have. MHW only goes up to High Rank but does not have a G Rank or more event based missions. Capcom is doing a ok job releasing newer content over the last couple of months but it's nowhere near comparable to previous entries. Still it's much appreciated since they are free. I can only hope Capcom releases a G Rank expansion for MHW and/or more monsters.For Hunters new and old Monster Hunter World brings forth a new and exciting adventure that does not disappoint!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,389,False,Recommended,Easy to get into hard to put down and even harder to master. Constant updates of new monsters armors weapons and events. It is really fun with one or more friends but it can get grindy after completing the story because of the randomness of some high tier jewel or weapon drops. Community is super friendly if you need any help. Graphics are nice but not very well optimized (you will need a good PC) sound is ok too controls need some time to get used to (and set up the quick buttons). Story is not extraordinary but decent enough. You get into quests fast so no long waiting or loading time which makes this game perfect to do a few quick hunts in the evenings after work. Monster fights feel like big boss battles and can last between 10 25 minutes. Monster Hunter World is one of the most fun games for me this year even though I never played any Monster Hunter titles before. For me it is like a mixture of an mmo and single player game but just the best things of both worlds so no extreme grinding like kill 1000 monsters for leveling up easy switch of class and weapons anytime can play on your own but can call for help anytime and can team up with others to do event quests. I would definitely recommend it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Great game.******************************************************************************************************UPDATE 09/01/2018Disconnection happened once on Sat and Sun. Other than that online seems fine now. I don't know if this is because Capcom has finally fixed the conflict between their game and the new Steam chat but it's time to change my score to positive.******************************************************************************************************UPDATE 08/25/18A good sign has finally come. With the official patch (I didn't try any other fix) disconnection happened only once (Error 2xx) on Sat 25 Aug. Other than that multiplayer with a friend worked fine (via Join Friend Session). No disconnection.Give it another week and I'd change my score to positive.******************************************************************************************************UPDATE 08/18/18On Saturday night (Bangkok time or Sat morning in the US) I played multiplayer with my friend for a few hours (2 3 quests) and it was an absolute blast. No connection lost not even a hiccup. Steam voice chat stayed connected all the way. HOWEVER the connection lost issue was back in full swing in Sun morning and Steam voice chat kept disconnecting.So the online experience may be less ugly (because of God knows what) but it isn't pretty yet. My score stays negative.*******************************************************************************************************PROS Performance is good. I've got steady frame rate almost all the time on i7 6700 3.40 GHz GTX1060 6GB 32GB RAM Win 10 64bit on max settings. No game breaking bug found. No crash. X360 controller works fine. Single player is great fun.CON A VERY SERIOUS CONMultiplayer is a big mess right now.Random disconnection occurred all the time and I kept getting kicked out of online session. Matchmaking didn't work. SOS didn't work. Creating an online session didn't work. Joining a friend's session didn't work.Bad online experience is a colossal flaw for a multiplayer focused game like this. I'm sure Capcom will fix the problem but I cannot recommend it now.

2018-11-23,0,0,382,False,Recommended,Pretty decent PC port. Over time they fixed and patched initial issues with the game. Played to HR 260ish on ps4 and am really enjoying the higher fps and smoothness of the steam version. As we all know we're waiting on the limited time events to catch up to ps4's but they have been working hard to keep up and actually have been close with getting the Halloween festival up in time. In addition they seem to have synched timing the ps4 festivals starting with the Winter fest. Friendly to newcomers to the series but apparently still not for the faint of heart in some ppl. Nice convenient changes from the original games but still needs some QoL changes.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,208,False,Recommended,This game is very good. The combat with monsters is amazing every weapon is unique and has some sort of role in co op (except for the horn).The music is great and very memorable and the graphics are some of the best i have seen. There is only one thing i highly dislike about the game the endgame. After completing the story the player unlocks harder versions of the monsters killing which lets you upgrade your armor and weapons to a further level. But after reaching the strongest monsters all the armor that the player may have liked will most likely become useless and the player will have to prioratise the final 10 rows of armor in the list out of the existing 100+ armor sets. The creativity and costumization with the character while being awsome at the begining becomes nul at the endgame as the player gets one shot by a light pet on the head from the monsters if not wearing the correct armor set. I hope the devs will fix this issue. It could be relsolver by letting the player make layered versions of all the armor sets or letting him/her customize the atributes and upgrade the defence to the same levels as stronger sets.Also having to eat sharpen your weapon and consume seeds like a drug addict gets very annoying sometimes.Overall i would give the game a 8/10 though as the greatest part of the game the main story lasts about 60 hours if you don't rush through the game like a madman.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

You will keep coming back for more eventhough you've slayed that monster a gazillion times. The devs are also (still) adding on new content for your hunting pleasure. All in all great game to play but most importantly a fun game ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,583,False,Recommended,Aside from connection and optimization problems the game itself is pretty solid.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,243,False,Recommended,"Let me preface this review saying I'm a fan of the series and have experience with previous games ( 240 hrs. in MH4U 180 hrs. in Gen 280 hrs. on this game on a PS4 Pro.) but I will try to be fair with this review of the PC port.For a player new to the Monster Hunter series I believe this is an incredible game to start with. They've removed things that once made this a niche title that's hard to get into and added new features (mantles for buffs scout flies for tracking quick traveling around the map etc.) that make it pleasant to jump into. For a first time player the challenge is still there and you can easily sink up to 500 hours into this game especially with friends.Now in negative reviews you'll probably see the fact that this game has a poorly implemented coop system. For the most part I think the coop system is okay UNLESS you want to play the game's story with your buddies. The game requires that the host of a quest sees the cutscenes before they can invite their friends to the hunt. That means while your in the middle of a TIMED UNPAUSABLE HUNT you have to navigate through a series of menus to invite your friends into your game. They won't be able to see the cutscenes you saw unless they host the quest themselves meaning you'd have to REDO story quests a number of times before you can progress. This is honestly a pretty stupid design choice as previous Monster Hunter games were able to have multiple people in the background of cutscenes just fine. Ultimately though I don't think this ruins the coop experience. The lackluster story (seriously don't buy this for the story buy this for the gameplay) is such a small part of the game that you will get to experience a pleasant experience playing with your friends. Endgame farming leaves you with PLENTY of hunts to work together with your friends. Soon to be added monsters such as Behemoth and Kulve Taroth are specifically designed to be fought by multiple people. Another concern is Denuvo hindering performance. I personally haven't had much an issue optimization wise and I can get this game running on my midtier 4 year old gaming PC at 60 FPS with settings on High. I don't want to flat out say Denuvo doesn't alter performance because quite honestly I don't know if that is the case. There are games that don't implement it properly and there are games that do. On launch Denuvo DID prevent older CPU's (2013 models and prior) from launching the game but that was patched. I personally don't have an issue with it although I do hope they won't renew their license once the DRM is cracked. If this is something you're on the edge about I highly encourage you purchase the game and see if it will run on your system.Coming from PS4 Pro I can certainly say I prefer playing on this port. The load times are phenominally better than what they are on consoles and I'd honestly encourage people to double dip for this sole reason alone. I do think there could have been better graphical optimization BUT I think the game looks just as good as it did on console save for this awful texture bug that's currently in the game. Despite texture quality settings being at their max the game for some reason renders them as blurry low quality textures. I assume this is a bug and will be fixed soon but in the meantime I don't mind too much because it doesn't affect the majority of the visuals. Another minor gripe I have with this port is the social/communication options being lazily ported from consoles. For things like ingame text chat emotes and shoutouts the menus are EXACTLY the same as they were on console with the only difference here being the fact I can navigate it with a mouse and keyboard. The chat has a CHARACTER LIMIT that is ridiculously small (50 characters I guess? I can't type more than 4 6 words most of the time) so it hinders ingame text chat. At the end of the day these are minor insignificant features that don't really affect the big picture. The main gameplay and controls feel great and the port really didn't change anything from the consoles.I do suggest getting a XB1 gamepad to play the game despite this game having KBM support and all the gamepad support that Steam supports (Dualshock Switch Pro Steam Controller). Keyboard and mouse is fine to use but some keybindings (specifically for the ranged weaponry) are a bit ridiculous.The rest of this review is my personal opinion as a returning player of the series so I wouldn't really consider this stuff in your decision to purchase the game if World is your first title. Monster Hunter World has cut a lot of the crap that was boring in the older games out. For example you won't find yourself doing nearly as many gathering quests or small monster quests as you did in titles like Monster Hunter Generations. Because of that the experience I had playing this game was consistently enjoyable. Despite this I have two main issues with the game Difficulty and amount of content. I think the difficulty and amount of content is PERFECT for new players it really makes for a fair and challenging experience (considering new players need to learn weapon mechanics monster tells etc.). As an unfortunate side effect of the QoL changes that made this game much more accessible I feel like MHW is THE easiest title in the series. Mantles are probably my biggest quarrel as they're essentially specialized armor sets that make you PERFECTLY adapted to a situation with an item cooldown implemented as the way to balance them. Elemental mantles negate their respective element essentially throwing out the idea of building an armor set to defend from a monster's special attacks. It hasn't been implemented yet but the temporal mantle will literally AUTOMATICALLY DODGE ATTACKS for you. Why would anyone need to perfect their timing or positioning with a mantle like that!? Content wise I'm unsatisfied but I understand why. I came from games like 4U and Gen which had MANY titles they could recycle monsters and maps from so I had a LOT to do in a Monster Hunter game. World lacking that luxury does not currently match the level of content that those games had. I'm particularly disappointed with endgame content as tempered monsters and decoration farming grows old within 30 hours of doing it. Tempered monsters just have higher health/damage pools. There's no new move sets so fighting these monsters isn't challenging you it's just making the grind more tedious than it was. I'm really holding out for a G rank expansion or a ""Monster Hunter World Ultimate"" to really quench my hunger for more content.At the end of the day I really love this series and I'm glad to see it grow from such a niche title to the success it is today. I really encourage new players to try this game. I WISH I started with this game frankly. For returning players I think you'll definitely enjoy it but try not to expect the same amount of content as you would in the previous titles. Happy hunting!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,215,False,Recommended,I was a fan of previous titles in the series playing 3U 4U and Generations on the 3DS for well over 100 hours each.This title improves on the previous in regards to environments movement and graphics along with a fair few quality of life improvements. You don't need to have played the previous titles to enjoy this one.When it comes to monster variety it can be rather lacking. The monsters if does include are destinct but beyond that there are almost no subspecies. There are only 2 ice enemies and a single water enemy meaning you could be working on the same creatures a lot in order to get weapons of the desired element. These issues should improve in time with the addition of free content updates.Paid DLC is purely cosmetic though if you want to alter your characters face/body then you'll need to buy the DLC to do so (the first change is free but that doesn't excuse the terrible excuse to charge you).If you're looking for a co op game then this should get you a huge amount of hours progress is on an individual basis but you can play through missions together (so long as each person has seen the intro cutscene for that story mission start the mission and then leave after the cutscene if you and a friend want to play a mission for the first time).If you don't have people you know who own the game then you can drop into lobbies or search for individual quests to help out others.There are 14 different weapon types each with their own movesets allowing varying playstyles. Weapons have their own upgrade trees which are displayed to the player unlike in previous titles. Performance has been hit and miss on the PC I have an i7 and 1060 (6gb) and usually manage 60fps occasionally dropping under specific circumstance or if kushala daora has 8 tornados going on in its nest. Overall it shouldn't ruin your experience of the game as long as you meet the requirements.

It does have a bunch of faults like the content lacked horribly on release good armor pieces are scarce and weapon elemental choice is lacking because there are literally 1 monsters for thunder and water. The story part was awful and I hated every moment of it but the fights were fun as all hell and actually felt great to just go into the game having to relearn to fight all these monsters that aren t using the same AI from gen1 or 2.

Slaying giant monsters with friends is the best but the game is enjoyable even when playing solo.The only flaws are Heavy farming / grinding for resources unnecessary complex mechanics and statistics and the game lacks some minor quality of life features that would make the gameplay smoother.Strongly recommended even if you're new to the MH serie.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-21,0,0,70,False,Recommended,I've followed the Monster Hunter series since I was a kid back on my Playstation and later on my PSP. I followed it to the Wii and then to the 3DS. For years I had wanted Capcom to listen and bring Frontier over to the west. This is a good compromise in my eyes.Its grindy. That's just how the MH series works. If you aren't a fan of large rng based (I'm looking at you Attack Crystal) grinds then you probably won't enjoy this game. It's amazing to play with fans so long as the servers don't decide that its the perfect opportunity to mess up.There's a lot of replayability and honestly the graphics at times for the environment are absolutely stunning. At the end of the day This is also the most beginner friendly in the series and adds a lot of new mechanics that veteran hunters may find either too handholding (...scoutflies...) or much needed. At the end of the day I'd recommend this game to anyone that wishes to give the series a try but doesn't even know where to begin. I'd also recommend it to veterans of the series no questions asked.Side note I've played a lot more than what Steam shows you. I've been playing World since the midnight release of the console versions and have over 800 recorded hours.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

There is absolutely no reason for this game to run as bad as it does.Still the pros outweigh the cons it is an incredible game. The weapon selection is sick fights and character progression feels rewarding and the overall atmosphere of this game feels great it almost feels like an exotic vacation.On the final note FOR THE LOVE OF GOD if you are going to pay for denuvo and have such an insane launch and graphical issues then don't dump your money into it use it to improve the port quality and as a result your reputation.Fun was had though.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-07,0,0,224,False,Recommended,I wasn't sure if this game was for me. I've heard nothing but great things about BUT that it's also kinda niche in who it appeals to. And I can say without a doubt that I am horribly addicted to this game. There are times where I want to pitch my controller over the balcony but after coming back and re assessing my stratagies I can overcome my previous monster encounter.That being said the game isn't perfect. There's a lot of clipping and some odd hit detection but man...Is it a hella fun time,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,400,False,Recommended,"ERR12 Graphics device has crashed.After rolling back my graphics driver I was able to circumvent one instance of this issue but it keeps cropping up regardless. Crash after crash after crash the game is more a game of troubleshooting than hunting monsters. I'd appreciate it if your game actually functioned before you sold it but hey maybe I'm just. Asking. Too. Much.EDIT I've had some success using the 398.36 Nvidia driver as well as running the game in borderless windowed mode. If you're having similar issues on Nvidia GPUs try that configuration. The sporadic inconsistent crashing for the third time just before beating a monster kind of success.8/18/2018 Some success circumventing the crashes by installing Kaldaien's ""Special K"" mod as well as alternating between driver versions 398.82 and 398.36 after every crash. Some drivers seem to allow me to pass certain spots without a crash while some always cause crashes depending on mission.Addendum What an embarrassing insulting tragic lazy enraging port job this is.8/30/2018 For myself this crash seemed to be caused by an overheating issue with my GPU that CAM was not showing me. Setting a custom fan profile fixed things. While many others have been crashing for different reasons than this I suppose I can only write a review based on my personal experience with the game so in that way I'll be changing this to ""positive"" so as to reflect the fun I'm now having with the game.Without going into detail this is by far the most fun Monster Hunter game I've ever played. I'm someone who generally enjoyed Tri and Freedom Unite back in the day but learned to hate those games as I progressed. Clunkiness poor mobility bizarre hitboxes stiff combos... all in all I just didn't like old Monster Hunter titles and was more than a little skeptical of this one. In all honesty I only bought this game to play with friends hoping I at least wouldn't hate it too much.Not only do I easily ""not hate it too much"" but there have been many instances when the game has absolutely swept me off my feet with how fun and satisfying fighting monsters can be. Mobility has been drastically increased focus on stamina management made a touch looser turning and aiming attacks during combos is actually possible though not to the point where you can blindly start attacks without thought weapon movesets have exploded making all of the weapons feel viable and able to cover all of your options.Flexing in place when healing or using an item has been replaced with being able to walk (and trot by using stamina if holding the sprint button). You can dodge cancel potion drinking at any time however the earlier you do the less healing you get out of your item.4 customizable radial menus make accessing items a breeze at any point in combat.You can now gather items without losing any speed by simply hitting the button to pick them up as you move over them.The whetstone is infinite.The quality of life changes are many and have a massive impact on the game's fluidity and overall speed. This game screams all killer no filler and all this serves to cut out all the moments of draining grog that pervaded the previous games while cutting straight to the fun bits while simultaneously turning those ""fun"" bits into actually FUN bits.Speaking of speed everything feels a good deal faster here. Monsters can be more aggressive now that the hunter is more versatile and it makes for a much faster paced more action packed experience. Fighting multiple monsters in an arena for example is actually a stimulating challenge instead of the instant death sentence it could have easily otherwise been.As a player there are so many more branching options available to you at any micro moment than have ever existed in Monster Hunters past. The waiting and down time while in combat has been squeezed out like water from a towel and the gameplay becomes infinitely more dense. Every weapon has adequate mobility to deal with even the most aggressive monsters and a movepool large enough to lay down pressure largely regardless of situation.That there CONs section I suppose even though I didn't really label the pros If I had to have complaints and I do I'll say that having to go back and forth between the Hunter's Hub when doing arena missions your room to manage the tailrider safari and the tradeyard for basically everything else is a waste of time even though loading screens are very quick in general.I wish there were the ability to save custom radial menus separately from your loadouts.The character creation options are a bit limited and I could never get a face I was happy with. Also no changing your face after you've made it. But why??? Apparently that ability was sold in the form of one time use coupons on consoles and it's Capcom so of course I'd believe they'd do something so with DLC.Many graphical effect toggles are simply broken. They just don't work. Water reflections? Toggle it all you like it'll only dip your performance.OVERALL?Did you hate older Monster Hunters but think fondly of the concept in general? Do you like fun and hate innaction? Do you like learning attack patterns and optimizing your damage? Do you enjoy things that are dense with fun instead of having the fun spread intolerably thinly? Well come on down to Monster Huntster emporium where we shoot the concept of fun at you as fast as you can blink and leave all those geriatric MH games in hospice where they belong. This entry is genuinely as though they took all of the elements I hated from old Monster Hunters and dashed them away all at once. It's a massive leap forward and I'm excited to see where they end up going with this franchise.Addendum The stun mechanic is literal and has no place in this or any game. What's that? You enjoy playing games? All attacks should be able to be dodged otherwise the game is in the most technical sense unfair? How about we hold you in place for a bit. You know what players love? Being told to stop playing the game for a few seconds. You're all brilliant.Good game though. D",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-07,0,0,277,False,Recommended,the game is good and the core mechanics are mostly solidI wish there was more to it but story is just there to be there so don't expect much out of it. It serves its role as a vehicle to introduce you to the machanics and monsters of the game but nothing more than that. I didn't think it was possible for a game to have negative character development yet somehow the characters get even more boring and generic the further into the plot you get,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-08,0,0,279,False,Recommended,Finally the beloved series got out of the PS2 Era! I've been a huge Monster Hunter fan for about 11 years to this date and can safely say that World delivers almost everything I ever dreamed of since killing my first big monster on the 2004 original.Normally I really don't care about graphics that much but Monster Hunter is a game where pretty graphics and sound design really help to transmit the feeling of epicness and thrill.And yes the graphics and sound design are glorious even more in comparison to every other title in the series.The forest sounds enchanted and mysterious weapons sound and feel realistic as how you expect them to and every part of the wilderness is filled with details such as little animals shortcuts tracks or collectibles.The 14 weapon types still play as you expect them to with some additiones here and there.Combat feels drastically more fluid especially because of improved dodging mechanics.But not only combat became much better Capcom also worked out minor issues.You're now able to collect stuff on the go without standing still drink potions while you walk eat in the base camp of a map and so on.If you're a new player be warned Yes MHW heralds the entrance into the mainstream for the franchise but this type of game always felt like filling a very special niche to me.To obtain the weapons and armor sets of your wet dreams you need to go through a RNG based heavy grind which consumes a lot of hours and is not always fun.You really need to want to do this to get the most out of it. In addition the game is hard and can be very frustrating at times.The sense of adventuring and living in a dangerous unknown world while slaying fire breathing dinosaurs to make fancy hats out of their bones is what drives you onwards.Otherwise you will drop out halfways.With it's amount of big monsters to hunt this game is hardly any bigger than the original for the PS2 in that category.Yes additional content will follow and for most people the amount of things to do is more than satisfying but if you played Generations Ultimate or 4 Ultimate and loved them you will miss the 90+ Monsters inside those games.There are some very minor negative points for me in addition such as the lack of a snow level.Shame on Capcom.Also the armor sets often look very bulky and lack the style they once had for example the Rathalos set which apart from its shape is identical to the original one.But that's just me criticising style. In almost every aspect this is the best Monster Hunter in existence and the best entry to dive into the series and see what it's all about.Thanks Capcom for giving us these games ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,154,False,Recommended,The newest next gen entry of the long running series Monster Hunter. This game does a couple things wrong or overly casualized and the servers were a complete disaster on launch (fixed now) but it's also an amazing game with some of the most satisfying gameplay i've ever experienced and i'm saying this as someone who played the original game back in the day,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-21,0,0,182,False,Recommended,I honestly find this game extremely fun and keeps you invested for a very long time. There's tons of monsters to kill/capture armor to acquire and weapons to forge. Sometimes it's very grindy but playing with friends makes this game less tedious. I recommend if you want to have a lot of fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,263,False,Recommended,so this is my first monster hunter game..i've played it now for almost 20 hours and i am still hr4 (yea playing with a friend and he is a slowpoke..)i can only say that's just my type of game i love challenging co op games where you really have to observe enemies find patterns learn their moveset learn the environment learn the different game mechanics like traps and stuff use strategy and so on!even tho not everything is perfect i mean nothing really is i love the world. i've got to see the first two areas and i really can't help but wander around and just enjoy the game in expedition mode. collecting bugs fishing observing monster interactions between each other all those things make me enjoy the game so much more. if you've got a good comprehension you're a fast learner then you've got no problem to join such a complex game!for people (like my friend) that just search for some 'go in and beat them to death' type of games i don't think this is the right choice.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,197,False,Recommended,"Begin.I bit difficult to get into at start if you've never played the series before like I have. Controls felt a bit... clunky but after a few hours of playing you get used to it and it becomes a GREAT game. Equipment.Each weapon in de game feels as if its a whole new game. Every weapon has a pretty advanced mechanical system behind it and its fun to learn them and eventually master them But a fun challenge. Gear is created by using whatever you carved from the dead monsters. each piece of gear has its own unique perk and allows for a fun mix and match type of system. Monsters.The rush it gave me when i fought my first ""big"" monster had me a bit intimidated. I felt overwelmed with all the mechanics and i just grabbed a weapon provided and had no clue what i was doing at the start. But after more depth and understanding of what monster do and how they behave. You'll start to notice how to exploit their weaknesses and strenghts to your own advantage. After the main story.Not to reveal anything but after the end i'm still having loads of fun. Mostly im grinding for monster parts to create certain builds and new weapons. Under no circumstance have i felt bored yet and each fight is unique even killing the same monster multiple times. Multiplayer.In the core this game is fun alone but even more fun with friends. Sadly the multiplayer is a bit.... difficult to use hense the negative reviews mostly. CO OPing the main story is not really an option if you are into the story. If both players start anew one cant join the other because he/she ""Has not progressed to this point yet"" and if that isn't a problem you get the ""the player has to watch the cutscene before you can join"" and the cutscene is usually the introduction to ""the"" monster of that story chapter. In the end game multiplayer is quite enjoyable and alot easier to join or create through SOS Flares. Conclusion.Looking back I had and still have alot of fun in this game. I will recommend it for those who seek a unique challenge with elements of grinding crafting party questing of sorts. The co op thing is a bit of a bummer because i bought this game together with a friend and not being able to progress through the story together without huge effort is bad. Already looking forward to the winter event!!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,396,False,Recommended,In short MHW is a game about using all kinds of cool weaponry to hunt down giant monsters alongside your trusty (although sometimes a bit derpy) feline partner. It's a more casual version of the earlier games in the franchise and just casual enough for a scrub like me. I feel like the game's still not too easy and if you want a challenge from it it can offer that too. The game's definitely more fun with friends like most games with multiplayer capability but the many hours I've dropped into it just playing solo prove it's clearly not too shabby of an experience alone either.TL DR Giant monsters. Cute cats. Plenty fun alone or not.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,20,False,Recommended,This game has become my favorite game full stop. There isn't enough space in this review to fit all my praises of this game but I'm going to try anyway. From the natralistic designs to the gorgeous visuals I really don't have any complaints (well except for Jyuratodos). Even after 100 hours every kill is still satisfyinging and the monsters still manage to keep me on my toes. The greatest thing about this game is that that is a weapon for every play style. If you don't like the game at first try a different weapon and I'm sure anyone can like it and I would recomend this game to anyone and everyone.

Great gameplay as usual in MHW and for my part it doesn't crash or give me any errors (heard some people might experience errors though.). Edit I'm having more and more problems also with how the coop works. It is unstable for a LOT of people AND it is just annoying as hell having to start a story quest by yourself and watch a mandatory cutscene before You can group up with your mates. Once the coop works its so much fun that I cant even put into works how fun it is. I will update this review and NOT recommend it until AT LEAST the connection problems seem to be fixed for most people.EDIT2 Online seems to be fine for most of the time now since the last patch that helped some connectivity issues and all.

2018-11-23,0,0,146,False,Recommended,This is the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played but it's so good it makes me interested in the older games. It brings a lot of things for different kind of players to enjoy. With the wide selection of weaponry some are way easier to get into and can let you play side by side with pro's without investing hours and hours into the game. The progression can be slow but once you get to the end of the game there's plenty of hard content to push your limits on. Make no mistake this is a farming game. You get materials craft better equipment so you can slay bigger monsters and get better materials and so on. However the replayability is huge not just from the big arsenal of weapons but the number of monsters available to hunt. I've had a pretty good time playing online but playing with my friends in this has been the best multiplayer experience I've had in over a year.

2018-11-22,0,0,193,False,Recommended,"Had a rocky launch thankfully I got the game after all the major issues.I still get the odd crash now and then but the game saves quite often so you don't really lose anything. Graphically the game is amazing i have it running almost maxed the only thing i have turned off is volumetric rendering as that literally cripples the FPS at anything above 1080p.At 1440p on a Vega 64 which is displaying onto a 1440p freesync screen it gets a pretty consistent 60 80fps. Which is perfect for me as its right in the top end of my freesync range.Gameplay is only as repetitive as you let it be yes you have to kill the same/similar monsters a lot to usually finish a weapon armor set or upgrade your gear. However theres LOTS of different weapon types many ways to play each and an infinite way to build your armor set decorations and charms to get an almost unlimited variety of buffs that come along with them.there are definitely a handful of ""OP"" meta weapons namely stuff that is crafted from events *cough* rocket powered greatsword *cough* but to be honest you'd have to be running a min/max build for damage to really notice anyway and not a lot of people do that.The game does allow you to min/max as much as you like but a lot of the time you are better aiming for utility over raw alpha damage no point having a weapon that can dunk a raging pickle monster on the noggin for 1000+ Damage if you can't actually land the hit cos it takes so long to charge up and the monster roars keep interupting you...TL DR Great game easy to play but hard to truly master.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-27,0,0,312,False,Recommended,I have been a long time fan of Monster Hunter since the release of MH Freedom on the PSP back in 2006.So Monster Hunter World finally gives the game a much needed graphical overall and gameplay feel but not without faults mainly that being that the game is a lot easier than the originals and it really does a lot to hold players hands throughout the game which is not entirely a bad thing that allows for newcomers to the game to get into it such as Scoutflies showing where items are points of interest and tracking monsters plus they do this annoying thing where it just throws your camera off in a direction while your doing your thing.The researchers you showing you a detailed graph of weak points/element weaknesses and drops also with high enough levels monsters can show up on the map permanently and indicate with a skull icon to show when they're near death.Armour skills are guaranteed an effect per armour piece which also allows for easier armour mix and matching.Eating meals grabbing items from the tent and calling for S.O.S during quests.Unlimited access to pick axes whetstones and fishing.Auto crafting.The thing about the original Monster Hunter games was always a being well prepared for a quests especially at higher levels.Besides the basic items you could procure onsite what you take with you what you get and not every location would have the items you'd need but that was probably what initially put casual players off all that prep work and learning.For example something as simple as tracking a monster in the originals is that you needed to search for it area by area first and marking it with a paintball which you needed to bring/make yourself and that only lasts around 10 minutes before it wears off so if you didn't mark it again by then you'll probably have to track it down all over again.Anyway I've been having a lot of fun with this game even if it does feel like a lack of locations monsters to fight weapons to craft and prehaps the biggest dissapointment for me is that the style system from Generations didn't make it into the game. I would love to invest more time into this game but there just doesn't feel as much to do at end game in this one compared to previous titles. Hopefully they'll add more in the future like they did with Deviljho.Not shockly the story still pretty much remains the same since the first game new adventurer comes to new village/town slays powerful monsters gets famous and at the same time ancient evil/elder dragons awaken causes trouble.The bigget issue with this game is the Nvidia driver the update 398.82 that was supposed to be optimized for the game caused severe framerate issues especially in the Rotten Vale literally made the game unplayable. Now almost 2 months later I've decided to see if it's improved by updating the driver to 411.70 the framerate issues has kinda cleared up but stutters every now and then and I'm also getting some weird screen flickering. So as of writing this I'm preparing to reinstall update 398.36 where I know the game is actually stable enough for a smooth gaming experience.UPDATE Looks like the more recent driver and game updates have solved the issues I've brought up before now all this game needs now is more monsters from the other games *cough*ZINORGE*cough* and more collaboration events.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,35,False,Recommended,I'll admit I was dubious on this game to start. Weird weapons and universe combat styles that I was NOT used to. I gave it the old 2hr trial and went from there.This game has turned out to be very enjoyable with friends! The combat has been fun to learn and (somewhat) master the monsters get thicc and its a good time to play. That being said I would rarely play without friends I prefer other gamestyles for solo play.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-16,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Absolutely love it...I bought the game on release for my Xbox one sSank way too many hours on it.. had to give up my Xbox (due to travelling) but gladly a port was made. So the PC version is my second copy convinced 3 of my friends to grab it and they've sank more hours than I have.Tips ..1 For this port it's a necessity to use a controller.2 Try out all the weapons I think the weapons choose you not the other way around.3 If there's something to pick up while hunting just pick it up you'll need it eventualky.4 Don't sorry about gold you'll get a mantle that'll boost income.5. Stop and enjoy the scenrery landscapes even the the monster daily habits. You'll be impressed on how much character they've programmed into them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-15,0,0,71,False,Recommended,"Pro good game mecanisms more accessible that older episodes. nice combat system and customization possibilities. good graphisms not ultra HD textures but the landscapes are wonderful really good art in general. there is a coop but...Before Cons game lower its resolution when fps are dropping at 40fps (you can turn off this terrible feature but it's enabled by default). Must be why so many people claims that graphisms are ugly / blurry.Cons (mostly technical I don't think they'll be solved in the future by the devs) the coop system the worst point of the game you cannot just watch a cinematic with your mates no you must disband the group EACH TIME there is a cinematic quit the mission rejoin the group and then restart back the mission. There is 3 4 ways to join your mate and only 1 will actually work. They solved a lot of disconnect/joining bugs they is almost not bugs anymore.How should it be ? Like in every other good game the players join a group and can watch and play every bit of the game together. If a moment must be played solo for staging reasons just make them play it solo then wait other players at a ""checkpoint"". Performances... Meh very CPU consuming (thx to the useless Denuvo ?). A lot of people are complaining about the performance with my i7 2600k and my GTX 980XLR8 I got 60fps most of the time going 40 or 90 sometimes. can't turn off motionblur really bad AA. Seriously in 30 min I achieved to set up a better TAA in Unity (with a plugin) than they did in their game. The TAA only works on moving object. When the camera is still their is just no AA (it doesn't collect samples over the screen it collects just over time). FXAA is just ultra blurry as always no SMAA implementations.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-16,0,0,246,False,Recommended,I could go on about why this game is amazing but honestly it can be sumed up in one sentence. If you like monster hunter or have ever wanted to try a monster hunter game this is the game for you. At first I was very hesitatnt about starting this game since all the reviews spoke about poor optimization dissconnection issues and control settings but I cant see any of that being justifiable compared to have fun this game is. It's a treat for people unaware of MH or never played a MH game previouisly before.Speaking of graphics I own a GTX1060 6GB and with high settings everything is fine at 60fps smooth. The game is NOT meant to be played at its max settings unless you own a extreamly beefy rig and thats not because it's poorly optomized it's because there is so much going on in the enviorments that no rig can secure a 120fps constant without toning down some settings and mainly thats where complaints start. Even then simply turning off the strange fog effect given to this game gives you a 30fps boost and makes the game look nicer in the process. I'm betting if I had a 120fps monitor I could secure it easily and thats given I own a 1060....nothing to write home about in terms of raw GPU power. As for controls I still cant understand why some people hate it I had more issues with Neir than this game ever gave me. I play with a keyboard and mouse and the only downside was Capcom deciding it was a smart move to not switch it's pc game settings over and rather give you strait away controller options. A simple click in the settings where it states PC or KEYBOARD and your set. No motion sickness issues no studdering no sway nothing. I play just fine. Same could be said about connection issues. The game for me seems to work fine with only 2 times I could not reach a server and even then I simply clicked again and it worked. Clearly this was a bigger issue when the game first launched on steam but as of now the game is fine.There was also concerns that this game had poor endgame material but when looking into other games I have to say no game has ever mastered the endgame to the point players just never stop. Only players who fall in love with certain titles can really say they enjoy endgame. Most cases it's either not present a grind others hate or simply a mess others dont care about. For me I cant say I currently have totaled 127 hours in this game and endgame for me is not my concern. I still enjoy it and even if I started to waiver on bordem 127 hours is more than I can say I have given most games. After 100 hours your lucky if any game keeps you stil interested like it did before. So overall I reccommend this game and give it a solid 9/10. The monsters are more than enjoyable they are the star of the game the equipment is fun to craft and weapons fun to build. The enviorment is lush and rich and it takes mastering just like weapons do something I wish other games did more of. The story is probably my only major girpe. Lipsyncing is horrible and the story is typical strange odd but enjoyable for the most part. Seeing as this is Capcons first MH game with major cutscenes in it and story I find this an ok start it sure isnt the core reaason I play. I play because the game is very open world rich with content and brimming with various kinds of gear and monsters to face. Even when I dont have a reason to craft somethings or face some monsters I will simply because it's too enjoyable not to. If you are a person who loves anything remotely to what I just discribed then this game is for you and you wont put it down for hours on end.(Update) With free DLC happening around every corner nows a perfect time to get into the game. Capcom is finally starting to throw events and content that console gamers had before us.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This is a skill based game while gear helps if you have the ability you can complete the hunts using lv1 starter gear. The grind is real but completely optional.Seamless maps are large enough for a few hours of exploration but the core of the game is spent killing the same small roster over and over. PC version is on an expedited release until it catches up with consoles the devs expect it to always be behind. While you are able to solo all of the content offline the servers are healthy and it is easy to find a group regardless of the time.

2018-11-23,0,0,206,False,Recommended,This is Capcom's first foray with the Monster Hunter franchise to the PC. It is a fun yet challenging game that rewards patience and well timed attacks. The environments are lush and varied. There was no time where I thought that the environments took away from the experience rather the other way around. While not having as many large monsters as previous entries in the franchise they are mostly all new monsters. Pros Great visual fidelity Varied armor looks New large monsters Consistent updates to try to get this game even with console counterpartsCons Early game can be confusing to new players even though it has been streamlined for them anyway Not up to same point as consoles in terms of content Some decorations are hard to obtain (RNG) KB/M controlls are mostly ok but is best played with a gamepad (I use x360 controller) Some minor frame dips when many particles are on screen (though may be my graphics card Radeon RX 580 4GB)Other thoughts Tempered monsters mostly do not change their fight patterns just hit harder and have the same health Arch tempered monsters not here yet (maybe winter festival will bring them) The game can punish you for having others join in hunt (if someone joins monster health is greatly incresed worse if they leave because it doesn't lower back. Shared lives pool you only get 3 carts normally so an unskilled player can mess with hunt) RNG drops from hunts seem to not be as bad as previous games in franchise but I did use 2 pieces of legiana armor for most of game to get more drops.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,164,False,Recommended,"+80 hours Okay after some more light sampling of the game (+80 hours Steam says otherwise) I've come to appreciate the game even more now. Still don't have any issues in performance. I've been trying out the other weapons GS LBG and HBG. Three weapons I NEVER liked on the 3DS but it defintely feels a lot more natural in World. LS is becoming a favourite again and I've moved away from my staple SnS DB and Bow. I take back what I said about aerial and evasion styles they're really not needed by the addition of tools and they're such great QoL upgrades. I do however miss playing as a Palico. Contextually it would never work in this game but hey Palicos were great.I do miss some of the other monsters of previous games but this is the New World. I see you Tobi Kodachi but you're no Nargacuga. Just some advice for ""new"" players definitely do the side quests and expeditions. I'm playing solo for the time being until I have a better internet connection. Tailraiders are quite a good support system when flying solo. +5 hours Been itching to play a MH game since Generations and I don't exactly have the luxury with getting a Switch (and other current gen consoles). First hour of the game is a pretty long and unneccesary tutorial with cutscene bonanzas. I honestly don't need to know how to move CAPCOM. I know this game is slightly tailored to assist beginners (unlike the previous trial by fire games) but don't treat us like noobs.I haven't had any issues with launching the game or fps drops game wise it's quite the shift from the previous titles. Graphically it looks amazing (in comparison to previous titles) please don't compare graphics to a completely different series you numbnuts. I have to say it took some time adjusting to the amount of visual information that bombarded me but expedition is a blessing as it gives you the time to see and experiment as to what the hell is going on. I do wish the UI/HUD could be adjusted to be a tad larger (maybe I'm just old and going blind) but they could implement more settings to it give the gamers some goold ol' UX in the future. Here's to hoping.I've only sampled a small amount but as far as I know styles do not exist in this game. I will miss it dearly the aerial and evasion styles were wonders. Mounting is still a thing that's fun. I haven't done it yet since I'm primarily a bow user I've just watched others do it and it is still....magical. At the time of this writing I really am enjoying MHW it's smooth and silky playing on a proper handheld controller (as opposed to the handcramping 3DS) is a GODSEND. Graphically it takes some time to adjust and I do wish the scoutflies were less in your face. And most importantly I'm really disappointed that there's no cross play I would love to play across all platforms and regions. MH Communities are always (or usually) friendly. If you're the type that likes to learn and work your way through a game playing with random strangers/friends that work together for a greater goal and really do not get bored grinding for materials. You will be looking at +300 hours give or take your knowledge or absence of experience. Each players' time spent will vary. If you're not turned off by any of that this might be a game for you.Edit Uhhhhhm I do find Day 1 DLC questionable. For...gestures? Are you serious?

2018-11-21,0,0,635,False,Recommended,In this game you actually can hunt monsters (confirmed),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-10,0,0,491,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a great first time experience in the universe and gameplay of the series bringing several new and old known monsters to fight against and innovating in previously set mechanics like zone separated maps which are now free from loading screens or making some of them more forgiving for example drinking potions while moving or having a limitless sharpening tool as wasting them like in previous games was something rather tedious.The core gameplay of boss fights that is Monster Hunter must appeal to you to like the game because it s all there is each with its moves and attacks and some grinding in the late game if you still want more action after finishing the story which is probably around 50h if you stick to the main storyline.In my opinion it s an overall good game I really enjoyed playing. However it has both its ups and downs which I will be listing PROS Very nice visuals. Some of it could be improved as they re not astonishingly good but enough for me to not get thrown out of the experience at any point.Really deep character customization along with your Palico (cat companion). And even if all that customization is going to stay under an armor for most of the game there s an option for the helmet not to show and so being able to uncover the face of your character you have put so much effort on while still gaining the helmet s stats.Monsters fight each other! The player is no longer the center of attention as now monsters will act aggressively towards one another and even start spectacular Turf Wars between them!The game showcases something similar to a New Game+ called High Rank followed by even harder tempered hunts. To my surprise High Rank is integrated into the storyline and includes some new monsters and a biome not seen on Low Rank and it isn t just do everything again but now enemies have x2 hp .It has a total of 14 weapons each with its own unique playstyle and is what really gives length to the game in my opinion. Each one feels completely different than the other with different strengths weaknesses specialties and move sets. Hunting the same monsters with different weapons can feel like a completely different fight and on a group your weapon has certain capabilities that others don t and will be needed during the hunt for example playing hammer lets you KO the monster if hit on the head stunning him for a brief moment giving an opening to all teammates.The amount of weapon variety and diverse playstyles combined with each monster presenting different behaviors and threats make each combination a different fight from the previous.Deciding what are you going to use and wear is half the game. There s an incredible amount of weapon trees for each weapon type and an armor for each monster. With a total of 5 elements and 5 ailments that can be inflicted to you and the monsters alike. These elements invite you to switch weapons depending on the monster you are going to hunt and its weaknesses same for armor and the monster s damage type. Weapon trees offer these special attributes on attacks while armors have overall defense resistance to these elements and most importantly skills.The game features a skill system where you can buff certain parts of your character be it offense defense or utility by wearing armor and imbedding decorations onto them and your weapons. This addition is what really brings life into creating equipment sets as for each weapon and personal playstyle you have to choose from all the different skills and see what fits best.A fine example for this is a stamina build for the Dual Blades weapon. It offers great offensive and movement capabilities but at the cost of stamina. Putting together an armor that decreases these limitations allows the player to be absurdly fast during longer periods of time while another might prefer to buff his damage outcome. The choice is yours.There re also tons of different items with different uses that you can bring along to make the hunt easier some of them working especially well with certain weapons.CONS The game launched with tons of errors and bugs regarding online connectivity and during the first week it was almost impossible to play with friends a core feature of the series hence all the dislike reviews.Graphical options are limited and unoptimized.Everything clips through everything. It s understandable because of the variety of weapon and armor models that something will eventually clip but some of them make no sense. An armor that provides a really important set bonus to shield users (Uragaan) has both his arms and shoulders clip through every single shield you carry which looks horrendous and is a pretty big mistake about mixing aesthetics with mechanical statistics.Multiplayer storyline is incredibly hindered for no reason making it hard for friends to play together trough the story because of cutscenes. A stupid decision made because who knows why that forces you to go into a quest and then back out once the cutscenes are done to play together.Every activity on the base like smelting weapons and armor checking the farm sending the tailraider s safari and so on has an NPC that will say around 3 5 lines of dialogue before being able to do what you came for.There are 34 large monsters in the game counting DLC content already on the PS4 which is a lot less compared to other Monster Hunter games like Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate with 51 large monsters released on 2013. I understand that the game has been made from the ground up as the graphics have improved greatly compared to previous titles so they had to remodel all monsters but the following is just disappointing.Not only there are 3 layers of difficulty for each monster but some of them are just the same with a different color palette. From the 34 monsters 6 of them are a harder version of a previously fought one with some slightly visual differences and move sets. And it doesn t help that from all monsters some can be ignored after being fought once as their weapons and armors feel mediocre at best giving no real reason to go hunt them for materials. The game even acknowledges this by not giving you a main mission to hunt these monsters just some optional ones. You can literally finish the game with monsters still left to hunt once.The variety of elements and ailments is absurdly narrow. There are around 9 10 monsters that apply fire damage while 1 that uses ice. Why having 5 elements and 4 ailments (not counting stun as all monsters can afflict it) if you re going to have this lack of diversity? Why create cool ailments like hemorrhage if only one monster will use it while everything else puts you on fire? And this transfers onto equipment Way too many weapons and armors are fire reliant same with dragon on weapons while sleep paralysis and water are left in a corner with low rarity and bland stats.Overall it feels like some elements and ailments are just there for show and they do not get the attention they deserve while others like fire or dragon are on every high tier weapon. This does not destroy the experience but it limits it enough for it to be a problem in my regard.I really like Monster Hunter as a whole because of its unique gameplay playing with friends variety of weapons armors and monsters character customization and the amazing experience it offers to me that not many other games can. However be it because of the newly reworked models and graphics or poor design decisions I feel there s an important lack of content and work on the design of its mechanical elements that narrows down the amount of viable and rewarding possibilities so I can't score it as high as I'd like to even though I had a blast playing it.Overall Score 8/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It keeps a good balance between telling you how things work and figuring things out. The late game is also great and you can spend a lot of time with it.

2018-11-22,0,0,497,False,Recommended,If you are looking at the reviews is probably because of the mixed up there and as many already stated in other reviews it's mostly because of connection problems at launch which wasn't surprising for the developer's first pc game. The problems were fixed and they are always releasing patches for other problems a few people might have I personally haven't had any since the first 2 weeks.This is also my first ever Monster Hunter game and it's pretty good. The game is still being updated with new monsters almost every month and the base game already has enough content for 200hrs+ so yeah I got it at full price and as I'm writing this is at sale so go get it and leave a positive review if you like let's change that rating.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,426,False,Recommended,With thousands of hours across several MH titles on Wii a 3DS my bigesst concern was how it will work with my Xbox 360controller? Will the control scheme be the same that I am used to on 3DS? Will it work with controller properly?The answer is YESSS... there is no need to setup controller I just started the game and when I clicked the mouse all the hints were for keyboard and mouse when I clicked something on controller control hints switched to controller. Works like a charm and I can as I am used to play. Started with the charge blade and the PC version fits like a glove.On the other hand I did not tried to play it on the keyborad and honestly I don't want to even try it. MH went a long way from the beginning and all this way were on the consoles Wii 3DS etc. and it was literrary build around the controller and its features. I suppose that keybord and mouse play will be mediocre at the best but probably just frustrating.SO IMPORTANT NOTICE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CONTROLER THIS GAME MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOUAnd as is noted in the negatives below there is a very limited time to test the real gameplay before the Steam 2h time limit expires!I cannot write any first impression from the position of someone new to the MH series but the beginning is difficult As far as I remember my own beginnings were not easy I almost gave up because the learning curve is really steep at the very beginning especially when you for the first time stand in the middle of village with littlo or no knowledge how the things work it might be discouraging. One also have to adapt to typical MH move and view system.Maybe at least the new training room will help newbies to familiarize with the weapons and combat systemBut when you make the firs steps in the game when you start to understand how create a potion or a trap how to update your weapon and what to do with the loot when slay your first big guy and cave from it the rare part that you so desperately need to finish your shiny new armor set than you will definitely say it was worth it now I am the hunter.POSITIVES MORE FOCUSED INTO FIGHTNINGThey introduced swarm of fireflies that is able to show you a way to everything not only monster. You just need to collect a few clues and voila here is you big guy. So no more paintball no more memorizing to which area is this particular monster going to sleep no more freneticaly running around tofind that last mushroom for gathering quest. Everything is served here on a silver plate. I don't consider those changes generally positive but it will make the game more accesible to new players.MONSTERS FIGHTING EACH OTHERThey did not deliver us the promised open world (more about it later) but theother feature that there are all monsters together in each location and they can fight each other is here and it is epic. You feel much more like a tiny hunter surrounded by generally unfriendly nature amd your only chance is that the thing that wants to eat you will be eaten by much bigger thing before it finds you.Of course nothing is perfect in the real world so there are also negatives. And they sems to be not tiny annoyances but so far it seems to me that many of the new features and improvements are broken by designBEAUTIFULL AND VIVID ENVIRONMENTEvery area is full of live and there is so much to do. Mining collecting hunting tracking monsters or just looking around in awe. Except the monsters there were usually not so much to look at especially at the relatively tiny displays of the 3DS consoles but they really managed to create world full of life here.HUGE GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTSSearching for monster is now easier there is no need to remember in which location it usually starts.Mixed sets are now base mechanic for creating your armor there is no need to have 5 10 15 or 20 levels of a given skil for it to work but now every level counts so mixed set are not a rare sight anymore but they are a must. Posibilities are now endless and creating and testing a specialised sets is now part of a gameplay funNEGATIVES DENUVOThis is the biggest monster inside this game. Seriously Capcom if youwant to discourage people from bying your game before they even try it this is a way to goDAMAGE NUMBERS / might be also positive for lots of peopleMH games are about hunters skill knowledge and instincts! All you know about the monster is what you can see and hear. Please no damage numbers etc. Fortunately I found how to turn them off. But I guess lot of people will like damage numbers but for me it breaks the immersion.VERY SLOW GAME INTRODUCTIONStart of the game is basically animations and just basic movement training so be prepared that you will see first real action after more than one hour of gameplay so you will have a very short time to taste actal gameplay before the end of refund periodNO OPEN WORLDThey promised us upen world but this is not open world they just removed loading between areas in a location and call it open world. This is just the same maze of narow corridors connetcting the openings. When I will be standing on the edge of a cliff and watching Rathalos and Rathian circling in the horizon and lonely Barroth laing in the nearby swamp than I will call it open world.But on the other hand it is stll a big improvement because there are no more the annoying loadings that happened when you accidentaly entered another area during the fight. So far Capcom never completely dissapointed me they sometimes try to implement things that does not work well but if that happend they abandoned them in the next iteration. Anyway its a new Monster Hunter a must have for series veterans and maybe it will attract also some newcomers.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Review Update Nov 2018Granted Capcom really screwed up the launch with network and performance issues I still did recommend this game back then. As a fan of the series the first good release on PC was a must have. With current NVidia drivers the game runs without any frame drops for me. Also haven't had any connection issues in a while.The gameplay is fun if you like Monster Hunter. The ingame world looks great compared to older MH titles. Fights can be challenging but are fun. Together with my PS4 version I now put about 800 900 hours in. So well worth the money for me. Mouse &amp Keyboard controls are also decent. Seen worse in my years in actual PC only titles.For people that never played a MH game unsure if this is your thing I would probably watching a lengthy review on youtube first. Lots of farming is involved and RNG can get frustrating if you are looking for some drops later on. Some fights aren't easy either and are probably frustrating for people that just want to get all trophies quick.If you are looking for a great story don't buy. Here it basicly serves as a tutorial to prepare you for the real game afterwards.Anyway hope this helps.My specs CPU Intel i5 3570k base clocksGPU GTX 1080 OCRAM 8 GB DDR3 RAMWindows 10 64 Bit and game on a fast SSD playing in 1080p,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Endgame is basically just tempered and arch tempered versions of the same monsters Players cannot join other people's quests until they have all seen the cutscene(s) of said quest which is annoying and just a time waster. Why can't players just see the cutscene at the same time? RNG decorations WHY!?In summary MHW is a very fun game and even though it has its flaws (what game doesn't really) many of them might be fixed in future updates.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game has everything i love in games like a complex combat system that rewards skill and ingenuity a crafting system that doesn't feel forced or annoying a veriety of playstyles and weapons that all offer something unique and fun a veriety of monsters to hunt with completely unique attack patterns weaknesses/ strengths etca well written and interesting world and storybeautiful details and graphicsa system that rewards careful planning and preperationfree updates that constantly add new content to give the game a breath of fresh airHowever the game is not perferct and does have some issues or features which may disuade some people from playing the game these include a lack of a complex tutorial leaving you to figure out a lot of things on your own which makes the game more difficult early ona steep learning curvea system in which you can't just sit down and waste some time as hunts take time and dedication the game can become a slog if you hit a roadblock of a strong monster as you have to go back doing other easier missions to grind for better gearmandatory tracking missions that kill the pase of a gaming session other hunters/ players that make the game frustrating to play by either intentionally or unintentionally doing annoying things (hitting and interrupting you when you are trying to hit the monster etc)RNG mechanics/ items such as monster plates and gems that have low droprates and need grinding in order to obtainNone of these for me are deal breakers and most can be avoided or overcome pretty easily but for some new players they may be offputting and need to be worked around in order to get the best experience possible so i advise just toughing through it,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,503,False,Not Recommended,Great game packed a lot of quality of life improvements over the previous iteration of the serie. My major gripe come from the lackluster quality of the port on pc. It'd be a must have if it wasn't for the frequent crashes I experience plus the utter lack of content at times. I'd be lying if I said I didn't any fun playing it but there's the fact I have a dedicated group of friends to play with. I'm hoping I'll be able to change my mind about the port in the future but I'm not counting on it. If you're a fan of Monster Hunter or a new player interested in it still buy it while it's in special.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,306,False,Recommended,This is the game. Do not play anything else. It has Dragons Dinosaurs Birds Bugs everything. Even a giant scaley thunder unicorn. The best 4 player coop experience you will ever play. It may have a high skill ceiling but you masochists out their eat that up so just buy it. Graphics are impecable with scenery and environments that really immerse you in a living ecosystem. Each animal and plant feels like a believable addition to the biosphere ever present in each of the locations in MHW. 14 weapon types that substitute the class sytem for a completly adaptable and maleable gamplay experience. ALL CONTENT UPDATES ARE FREE. That is right FREE DLC. MHW is 10 months old since releasing on console and is still receiving free content updates that bring new weapons monsters and quests to the game. This means that the dlc cycle for PC will push that even further. Please do yourself a favor and dive into this game that became a breakout hit for western audiences and rose to the best selling Capcom game besides Street Fighter II. You will grind you will die you will be awe struck you will love to kill giant dinosaurs and dragons over and over with your friends and alone.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,289,False,Recommended,"A game I waited well over a decade for and did not dissapoint.'World' bears the most refined user experience of any game in the series. Lots of small (and not so small) quality of life fixes make this the easier Monster Hunter title to get into. Gone are the 'zone checkpoints' or the need to carry multiple pickaxes and nets or to stock a pile of whetstones. Repetitive support tools are now standard gear that won't break or run out on you. If you have at all been curious to face off against the giant denisens of the New World you'll find plenty to see and do.The basic loop to this is Hunt Monster. Get Materials from the world and Monster. Use those Materials to make better gear. Hunt Tougher Monster.The selection of creatures to hunt and trap is pretty good with most of the more vicious ones having special tougher variants that yield even better loot and gear. And now that 'World' was designed from the ground up for Modern Consoles (and the PC) it can simulate each larger map and run multiple AIs against both the player and itself. These benefits come through especially in this Steam version as the FPS remains smooth draw distance is generous and load times are ridiculously quick.Extra Content comes in the form of scheduled events hailing the appearance of new Monsters and Special Gear (like a Mega Man armor for your feline companion or a Dante from ""Devil May Cry' outfit). The PC version started a bit behind it has just recently caught up to the console schedule. Every quarter or so there is a Festival (the Winter one is coming soon) that sees the return of all the limited time events so far to give people that missed the last time a chance to get those special extras.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game still retains its atmosphere of fun quirky quests although World is a bit more serious in its over arching tone compared to its predecesors. Game still keeps its familiar style with fun QoL improvements. The post content grind with Tempered is a welcome change from its mobile counter parts. Although I dread that Arch Tempered monsters will just be artificial difficulty I have a belief that they'll come up with some kind of paid content to expand the game with more large monsters or Elder Dragons for us to sink even more hours grinding which the game severely lacks compared to Double Cross which boasts more than 100 large monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,110,False,Recommended,What can be said about MHW that hasn't already? Probably nothing. The graphics are amazing in a very classic Capcom/Japanese style. Everything is bright and happy and then it tries to eat you. Which is where the fun begins. For gameplay the rush of plotting strategizing tracking sneaking and ambushing your first Anjanath in the jungle was some of the most exhilirating gameplay I have had in a long time. Then it ate me. So I got to do it all again. Overall the gameplay has a wonderful curve to it. It is not going to hold your hand against the monsters but every obstacle can be overcome as well. Slitghtly more fogiving than say the Soulsborne series but each monster is a much longer/complex fight than any in the Soulsborne series save for perhaps Sister Freide. Overall. If you like to be challenged like to slay beasts 10x your size and want to feel a rush of emotional victory for doing so you will love playing MHW,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The only remaining issues might be optimization (depending on your hardware) and some motion blur that you can only disable using mods.Second edit MP disconnects are now very rare (used to have 1 every hunt or more). No more than once per day. Mouse is still not fixed.First edit They've (tried at least) to fix the MP we'll see how it goes for mouse users.Original review Mouse control is horrendous it's just a simulated joypad meaning you have a deadzone mouse acceleration smoothing AND the worst of all speed limit (you can't turn as fast as you want).Graphic options are too limited (no way to turn off the excessive motion blur).The graphics themselves are just meh it looks good but nothing a GTX 1080 cannot run in 2k good.Cannot recommend a bad port I cannot understand the delay in this release considering how bad the port is.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-24,0,0,151,False,Recommended,"The game for the most part seems fun and almost every weapon seems to be fun in some way however there are a few pet peeves I want to address The keyboard controls are horrible. Yes I'm aware that keybinds can be changed but what if let's say I don't want to use a keyboard? Well the game sometimes doesn't register the controller immediately. This is still a problem a few friends still have after launch/update. End game sucks. While yes you can say every MH game doesn't have much to do end game let's look at a few newer releases. 4u Expeditions. While yeah repeatitive and sometimes cheap they made it fun by rewarding you with legit great loot. Gen/XX/GU Deviants. This is what I liked the most for end game maybe minus a few older games like FU. The end game here (until Kulve/Lunastra dropped) felt vastly incomplete. There are still a decent selection of weapons to choose from but very few stand out. Let's look at the Bows many are dead similar when it comes to shots and shot types and there are only a few that're worth looking into. Now lets look into my favorite LS. You got a few that're god tier and the rest that're mediocre at best. While yes you can play how you want I find it fun when you have multible great weapons to choose from instead of a meager handful. Before Tarot and Luna you were pretty much set in stone for what was ""good.""While the updates fixed a lot of these issues the game just doesn't feel fun to pick up after you gotten everything. A few things I'd recommend is trying to add a newer end game system minus Investigations and the newer monsters out there. Maybe in a way have some old classics come in like Gore Magala. Have say Frenzied Monsters come in and not only make the fights harder make them in their own way like a different version of Tempered where they have not only new moves but with mechanics like the Frenzy thrown in. Maybe add some new arenas like how they did in the older games and some like Sanctuary or the old FU arenas.tl dr Good game fun until the endgame and great community.

But in return you get an absolutely beautiful game that is nearly unparallelled in this field. In essence get a better computer. )Fix 2 Some people who like me have very beefy computers but still suffer from low fps it is worth noting that the game is not optimized as well as it might should be. There are several fixes one of which I found to be most important. There are several AUDIO settings that absolutely tank your frame rate. I don't remember the exact name but there aren't that many 'audio quality' settings so finding it should be easy. I went from 3 fps to 30 fps as soon as I found this particular feature. Playing with the settings can take a while but it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. Trust me! The ""minimum system requirements"" aren't lying to you if you meet or exceed them you CAN play the game at a good framerate. It just takes a bit of patience!I also see people comparing it to other monster hunter series games. ...What exactly did you expect? As you can tell by simply reading the title this isn't a remaster it's a standalone game! And it's a great one! Try to enjoy what you have rather than feeling nostalgic about what you used to play.Now that I've covered these few things I'd like to move on to my actual review which I will keep short and sweet.Graphics quality 9.5/10(Just make sure you play with the settings to increase framerate especially the AUDIO ones!)Story quality 8/10Engaging although there's just a BIT too many 'filler missions' for my liking.Meme quality 11/10The lip syncing of the characters is abyssmal it gives me a great laugh every time to see someone saying simple words like ""I"" with a closed mouth or a gaping jaw. LOLCo op 9/10Fun with very little lag exactly what I would have expected. However the voice chat in game is VERY quiet and is a pain to try to use without messing messing with audio volumes to decrease everything else so that you can turn up your headphones. 1 point.AI and navigation 9/10 The enemies AI leaves nothing to be desired in my opinion and your ability to navigate the game is both intuitive and practice based. This means that although you can get around fine by yourself practice will make you much faster! It's a rewarding expereience although sometimes tricky to figure out.Side quests 9/10 Plentiful and fun but nothing too special.Combat 11/10. Solid. This game gives you multiple weapons to choose from to fit multiple playstyles and each one looks absolutely badass. )I know I don't have very many hours in this game but with the help of my friends I was able to experience a great deal of what MH W has to offer. I am very impressed! Leave me a comment with your viewpoint on this subject.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-02,0,0,360,False,Recommended,"This game had a rough start and an easy one it is not and yet I'd probably tag it as my favorite game of the year.The rough * The connection issues you've heard about have been fixed. I haven't been dropped from a group in more than a month but they were pretty bad originally and deservedly account for many of the bad reviews this game has.* The keyboard/mouse is iffy but better than it was (I still recommend a gamepad of some sort though). * Most people have to turn down (or disable) the volumetric fog as it really hurts performance. * If you're looking for an intricate plot with character development and thought provoking twists... this isn't it. It's about stabbing giant monsters and that's pretty much it.But here's what actually makes this game great * Stabbing giant monsters. You get to stab like LOTS of giant monsters. From big dumb chickens to angry dragon pickle things the varying behaviors/sizes/dangers/environments of monsters are amazing and even hunts you've done before can surprise you. Usually by going totally pear shaped when you don't expect it. * Stabbing giant monsters WITH FRIENDS. This game is merely OK single player or when played with randos from the internet. But get a few good friends on a voice chat and your coordinated hunting is absolutely a blast. A+ * Stabbing giant monsters with custom equipment. I'm a nerd about equipment and item usage (I actually like making ammo in FNV or all the equipment management in Mass Effect) and this game has crafting for tons of stuff made from monsters you kill and plants you pick and stuff you mine. It's great. * Stabbing giant monsters with a huge diversity of stabby things. And shooty things. And slashy things. Each of the 14 weapon types plays totally differently and there's bound to be one you'll like from the smashy hammer and hunting horn to the Cloud Strife Esque greatsword to the light and heavy GUNS if you want to play fantasy flavored Gears of War. Seriously. 14 types of weapon and dozens of craftable examples of EACH. Make something shiny and stab monsters with it! /p * Stabbing things with your cats. Because the Palicoes are adorable. Seriously.And that's my two cents. Take it or leave it!CONTENT UPDATE They keep adding stuff to this game! I cannot tell you how much fun the Kulve Taroth seige is with unique group hunt mechanics and entire lobby teamwork going on. It's awesome and makes even playing with randos much more fun. The harvest festival was adorable and fun and the upcoming content just keeps getting better. While the selection of truly ""new"" monsters doesn't seem to be getting appreciably bigger it might just mean they're saving them for DLC which given the game's overall quality thus far I will no doubt shell out for.

2018-11-25,0,0,205,False,Recommended,A very fun game with a variety of weapons and armor to craft. The combat feels good and changes a lot based on the weapon you use so if you get bored of fighting you can just try a new weapon. Its main issues are 1. network connectivity as you can disconnect often and randomly which sucks if you're playing online and 2. monster variety. It has a lot of monsters to fight and gear to craft but the previous games had way more which is understandable but it's still something I wish for. They are adding more over time however (for free as well) which is nice. I'm not quite bored of all the monsters yet though so I'll probably get many more hours out of this game. It's the kind of game that doesn't really end but the story does end and it takes around 50 hours so there's a good amount of content regardless of if you like grinding or not.

Trudge through the first thirty to forty minutes of awful introduction and you will have yourself one of the greatest games of all time. I have been playing Monster Hunter for years and I've got to say that this is the best game in the franchise.There are a lot of things that have been adjusted changed and even removed to make the series more streamlined and accessible. Some of them I don't necessarily care for but most were well deserved. This game fixes a lot of the glaring design flaws that have plagued the series since its first iteration on the original PlayStation.Buy this you ninnies!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-14,0,0,314,False,Recommended,11/22/2018 MHW just keeps on getting better and better.Honestly I have no idea why MHW (monster hunter world) is currently at mixed review. The only explanation i can give are people either not familiar to the MHW type games (which is why Monster hunter as a series was pretty late on releasing to the U.S. and many other title branches didn't even come out.) Or maybe it's too difficult for some people. As for those that give it a bad review because they can't play it single player monster hunter has always been a coop platform for hunters to work together using the different weapons in combo. Now on to the review.I remember playing monster hunter (frontier?) on the ps2 it was at a friends house and i was immediately hooked. At first the controls were pretty clunky but hunting monsters and making armor and weapons was a wet dream for rpg gamers. Then from ps2 i moved onto the psp then from psp to wii and wii to DS. I think i went through 5 titles of monster hunter (skipping the online game that was made by a chinese game dev) And now we finally get MHW!Wow lets go over the Pros 1 Semi open world. Yea i know it's not a complete open world. But what they did is WAYYYYY better than what we originally had which was a loading screen for every section. Imagine the map divided into 8 parts and you had to load between them! Everything is connected in one instance and i was estatic when I saw the trailers for it.2 Controller support Although ps4 controllers arent supported i find it essential to use a controller. Luckily there is a mod that changes the button input to ps4 scheme. But you can use the keyboard and mouse to its own effects as well like my friend does.3 Convenient crafting Now you can quick craft and auto craft items. Very useful for when i'm going for bombs or flash bombs on the fly. This however doesn't work if the items were already in your inventory which you have to craft it via menu or quick menu. But still a useful feature.4 Gathering Alot more fluid alot more generous and alot more faster. They built up on the feature of gathering to make it less of a hastle as it was in previous older titles.5 connected main city hub the town that you do all the crafting and such is connected by these chain like elevators allowing you to either walk the long way to enjoy the scenery or quickly get somewhere when you need to hurry.6 Vouchers to increase loot do i really need to say more on this? lol These replenish daily i believe7 Alot of potential for content a pc release allows for alot of content so i'm really looking forward to MHW in the long run.8 Graphics improved tenfold! no more blurry faces from a distance no more rough looking terrain and blurred off distances. For those complaining about the graphics just try playing a psp or even the DS genx release! Now there is 1 gripe i have but saved for later in the cons.9 Crafting cluster made easier to manage and v iew Thank god for the wishlist feature for sets and the ability to try on the armor to see what it looks like along with the ability to view all the skills and what they do! No more having to have a seperate app to see stuff.10 All monster info along with weakness and loot drop made convenient and pretty interesting! Now you can unlock info on monsters to see what loot they drop and what they are weak against from the hunter notes. You level these up by finding monster tracks and (droppings i guess) when hunting them or if they happen to be in the hunt you are on.and honestly I can keep going on but gotta move on to the cons.1 The Handler buddy... Don't get me wrong I love her. (I play with japanese voices which should also be in the pros!) She's cute and funny a mix between the original mission handlers and a curious palico. But she just looks so weird graphically i guess. I just don't know why but she somewhat looks as though they did the same thing Andromeda did wit hthe female rider uglifying em and then slapping makeup on. I just don't know why but hopefully it's not what i think it is..2 Character customization I really was hoping for more customizations in this pc release for character creation. But it feels a lot similar to the older releases with minor touch ups and some slider actions. Come on MHW you guys should be able to get black desert levels of customizations!3 Slow content releases the pc port is almost a year late compared to console releases but thats no excuse to be so far behind on updates and new monsters new sets etc. 4 the pod plants Not much of a con but a gripe. Those pod plants are confusing from regular gathering spots. I'd really like it if they made the swarm flies glow a different color when indicating those pod stuff. But meh not really an important matter.And thats about it.This isn't for everyone thats for sure. If you're a single player nut or just dont like grinding for gears (like monster gems) then this game Might not be for you. But it's alot of fun and even more fun when playing with friends. Me and my friend usually get on with 2 other randoms and it gets really crazy good when you make a good combo. for example i was an archer in support role (Throwing flashes and party buffing/healing powders) my friend a Insect glaive (air attacks to mount the monster) A random as a horn (more party buffs and blunt damage) and the last random as a hammer (For stun due to weapon having paralysis and staggering the monster). We made 1 hell of a team and it was really fun. I really hope you try this and and definitely recommend it at full price! All the extra stuff are just cosmetics that you can buy or skip.

2018-11-22,0,0,568,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World is the most accessable the franchise has ever been and that's a good thing. As a long time player of the series I enjoy the immense quality of life enhancements that the old games lacked but had been working on in the past titles. MHW is fun very fun if what you want is a game where you hunt monsters run around a few locales collecting resources and making gear. If you want a narrative driven game with a compelling story Monster Hunter has never really been there. I'm sure people enjoy the story but you could skip every cutscene and still get heaps of enjoyment out of this game. Play with your friends play with randoms play by yourself (or by yourself with a cat companion) it's all valid ways to enjoy this game. You probably know if you'll enjoy monster hunter there's a variety of weapon types for different play styles and passive skills to enhance different styles of play even with different weapons so you won't be dissapointed.You can play this game to the end of the ""main story"" and feel like you got a good game. But if you continue to play and have the desire to continue the monster grind it goes on. Harder versions of monsters grinding for gems to put on your gear for more skills maybe just the challenge of taking on Tempered Elder Dragons by yourself.I heartily recommend this game and that's a good thing.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

When I first bought this masterpiece I decided that I will try to play this game in less than 2 hours to refund the game but the moment I suddenly played. It brought me into this amazing world of Monster Hunter. The Graphics look stunning and all of the monsters are fantastic well...most of them. Although this game isn't perfect I still highly recommend everyone that hasn't played Monster Hunter games before to play this game it will drive you through the adventure that you didn't experience before in any game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,519,False,Recommended,"This is my first MH game but I've logged close to 300 hours on Dragon's Dogma and the two games share a lot of similarites. If you enjoyed Dragon's Dogma you'll likely enjoy MHW as well. I've been pleased at the accelerated release rate of DLC and event based content on the PC version.There are some downsides to the design for events like Kulve Taroth (pub players can just join on Stage 4 sieges and get the same rewards as players who have been there from the start). Furthermore many players will likely not enjoy the RNG aspects of the game especially when it comes to high tier decorations (much like gems from ARPGs that you can socket into armor for better skill effects) and random weapon drops from Kulve Taroth.You can play this game purely with a farming mentality (RNG grinder) and a speedrunner / meta build runner mentality (running purely meta builds like the Heavy Bowgun Dark Devourer cluster bomb build in solo play) and have an easy time. However you might burn out quickly so you'll enjoy this game more if you don't mind completing hunts a little slower when you use other weapons just for the pure enjoyment factor (e.g. Great Sword etc.).I heard the game had a lot of bugs for mouse / keyboard users and connection issues for players who play predominantly with pubs but it seems Capcom has fixed a lot of the bugs and I've experienced no issues when playing with my PS4 controller and when playing with my friends.Overall this game is like the ""Marmite"" of videogames.

2018-11-24,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,Pros It's MonHun on PC Better graphic than previous titles Some QoLs changes (no loading screens no eating animations ...)Cons Lack of contents Lazy weapon's design Problem with multiplayer (connection issues can't play together if your friend hasn't completed the quest ..) Clunky control bad camera angle and locking system Scout fly may sound convenient but they're not blocking the screen always point to items on the map and I prefer paint ball Bad UI design too many information on the screenI've spend thousands of hours on 3rd Portable 4U Gen and XX (Gen Ultimate) but I've only spend around 32 on this game. One reason is because I'm kinda busy lately but I just couldn't enjoy this game as much as previous Monhun. The weapon and armor's design is so lazy like they just slap some details on the base weapon and call it new. The control on keyboard and mouse is uncomfortable so I have to switch to controller. The locking system is bad there're time when I have to click mutliple time just to lock on the monster I want to fight. Even though the game has some changes which make it easier than previous title it still can't compensate for one of the biggest problem of the game that is the lack of contents the roster of monsters is so small that it make you feel boring when fighting those monster over and over. To conclue I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price it's not worth it buy it when it's on sale and you should consider if you want to buy just for the multiplayer it's bad and may give you frustration.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,272,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. I've put so many hours in and haven't even crafted half the items I want to. The content might look small when you first start playing trust me you unlock more craftables than you can handle. It can be grindy to get some of the more powerful weapons and armor but as long as you don't use the same tactic every time it will remain fun.If I were to compare the combat to something think of a VERY relaxed and forgiving Dark Souls.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Overall the game plays smoothly it is fun to play with friends and I appreciate the events that come on every once in a while. At the time of this review the current event calls for a hunt of ""Red"" monsters that in the end earn you armor and a weapon referencing Dante from Devil May Cry. Before that I believe it was Megaman.All in all I really enjoy this game. I can see how this game can be a bit of a grind fest or even repetitive but honestly that's what this game is kind of about.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,206,False,Recommended,Updated Review Game performance has improved both textures and CPU usage. Some area still CPU bottleneck. Connectivity issues have been resolved and random crashes as well. This is a really fun game and now with the additional content will be better. Original Review This game should've stayed a little more time in the oven even more when half of it's issues were present during the console launch.Please do the following Capcom * Remove DRM. It's hogging down CPU performance.* Fix the connectivity issues* Please provide better quality textures.* Please streamline and improve the connection loss and implement a re host/regroup option.* Allow to create an online session from inside a mission. Thanks to the current connectivity errors I have to either finish/abandon a quest so my friends and I can rejoin.To the gamer This game is amazing however there are a lot of problems with it if you're looking into playing co op. Otherwise it's good. Solo is fine until the high ranked bosses. Either grind or wait for a friend patch.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,9,False,Recommended,I have been playing Monster Hunter for 3 5 years starting with 4U then 3U then Gen then this game. I have to say it feels different. Not in a bad way but different. This game capitalizes on how well the series have built up their environments with new graphics and I think it switching to PC XB1 and PS4 truly helped that a lot. Pros Stunning Environment Has challenge and some easier bits. Is good to play with friends or solo. Ok Story better than 3U and Gen IMO 4U's was best. Massive amount of QOL improvements.Cons Controls were changed from previous games. The controls get some time to get used to. Numerous Bugs on PC release. Pretty taxing on Hardware.Overall a great MonHun game but different.. 8.5/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,234,False,Recommended,I would say this game is a really good entry point for people who have never played the Monster Hunter games before. The game has moderate difficulty the design is absolutely stunning and the best of all no loading screens between areas when you are hunting. It is just one HUGE 'open world' where you can run around collect resources catch animals hunt monsters etc. As someone that does not like playing alone I would say the game has quite a healthy population. I would be able to find a public room to join and play with 3 other randoms any time of the day and most people are very helpful and friendly (since it is a PvE based game).Although the game has been CPU intensive right from the start and there are still some issues with bugs and connectivity the developers have shown that they truly care for the port and the community by fixing them regularly. Also new contents are updated at a faster pace to catch up to the PS4 counterpart and so one could hardly run out of content to play for at least a few hundred hours.One thing I really love about the PC port is the possiblity of modding and the activeness of the modding community. All this small little personalisation/customisation really prolongs your play time. So far for the 200 over hours I've spent on the game I will have to say it is definitely worth its full price. Do get it when it is on sale especially.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,208,False,Recommended,There are two ways to play experience Monster Hunter World 1. Play it like a regular game with lots of boss fights each with its own unique strategy and challenges. Can be played solo or with friends (be careful though some creatures have the abilities to annihilate an entire squad at an instant).2. Immerse yourself in a natural history documentary where every creatures have their own daily activities (hunting roaming around drinking water from the river sleeping etc). Only instead of cheetahs gazelles grizzly bears or even t rexes and brachiosaurs you got to observe fire breathing theropods (anjanath) raptors that can take a picture of you with extreme brightness effect (tzi tzi yaku) lizzards that love to punce around and act like a hyperactive puppy (odogaron) extremely angry hybrids of dragons and porcupines (nergigante beware of the hitboxes of its spikes!) and last but not least a living breathing B 52 bombers with unlimited carpet bombing capabilities (bazelgeuse you'll know when he arrives as there's an air siren that announce his arrival).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monster Hunter World is a great game for Co Op with friends and strangers. Many of the negative reviews are Nitpickers complaining about not being able to change bloom or motion blur that is so suttle it almost goes unnoticed. The gameplay in the game feels great and each fight with a monster is different and fun! In my 40 hours of gameplay so far I havent had one issue with performace and I run a gtx1080 with an i7. I run the game on max setting with no problem and have never had an issue with multiplayer and have encountered NO BUGS WHAT SO EVER.

Now it being on PC is a god bless even though there was some issues in the beginning of the release date you must've heard about the issue but now all that is over they are updating this game to best of their abilities almost caught up with the consoles they are also slowly approving graphic options just to make it more optimize for low tier PC.

Some might see it as grindy but you're always working towards something better. Yes there's a little RNG yes you will be fighting the same monster a few times (or a lot depending on what items you're trying to get) but there's so many little things to try and unlock and experiment with you could play this for a longggggg time.Highly recommend playing with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If your just a casual they game does hold your hand..... a bit too much i could say that can ruin the fun of the game (ex. The Handler). Never heard of played the game and think that it is bad?

2018-11-22,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Pro The PC version of this game let's you get in to the fight so much faster compared to console. The patch to mouse and keyboard controls improved this controller scheme so so much. Looks beautiful with amazing hand crafted environments. Multiple ways to play and challenge yourself changing weapons can change the entire fight with a monster and adds heaps of replayability. Cons The initial release was a bit of a disappointment with the multiplayer issues and it has taken some time for it to catch up with content on console.Bit of a grind for some drops with heavy luck involved to make a certain build. Armor and weapons are a bit dull in comparison to previous games.Can't replace handler with a palico. Wish I could. Maybe there's a mod? She scares me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,538,False,Recommended,Most will say that this game is repetitive and grindy.. They're not wrong.But the beauty of this game? ALL of it's different weapons. This franchise has over a decade's worth of history and the one thing that keeps getting improved through every installment is the WEAPONS. They are all unique (to some extent even the LBG &amp HBG) and makes the game feel COMPLETELY DIFFERENT once you pick up another weapon.So my recommendation? If you've fought a Rathalos a thousand times with the Switch Axe and can kill him in less than 2 minutes with your eyes closed? Go fight him with a Charge Blade get your kicked and discover the satisfaction of defeating this annoying MF consistently all over again. Bored with the Charge Blade? Try out the LBG and get your kicked and then kick again!Though you may be fighting the same monster it becomes a completely different fight once you switch your weapons around simply because weapons are so drastically different in terms of mechanics and the way you approach a fight.Also it helps that they give fairly frequent updates to this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I hate that its only optimized on controllers the camera movement for the mouse is just horrible the key binds are bad as well even when you can customize it the resource utilization that the port has for the computer is also taxing even witha beefy computer. And the matchmaking its been said enough that it just doesnt work. its just not that rewarding for me at the moment. Hoping that the game gets constant support from Capcom and not just a cash grab from a famous franchise.update ever since the most recent update my installation now is plagued by Err12 Graphics Device Crashed.

2018-08-10,0,0,133,False,Recommended,This game delivers what you want from its concept and exicutes its very well on most fronts.Just going around beating the hell out of gigantic beasts is the core and thats what you will grind on in the end game. That combat is complex enough to not get boring after hours of playing and every weapon is drasticaly different that you kind of have to soft restart your skill in a way. Play with friends or matchmake online this makes the game better in everyway.The downsides to this game are the left over horrible design decisions that have been with the series forever inexplicably put into the game. Actually connecting to a friend or other play is a huge hassle to get started. Item managment in the inventory is just bizzare...you learn to work with it but its ridiculous.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-25,0,0,262,False,Recommended,I started playing Monster Hunter before World (2nd generation Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP) and joined the MH community quite late (4th generation Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the N3DS). Monster Hunter consists of a core gameplay loop of 1. Pre quest prep (make loadouts of weapons/armor/items maintain resource farms)2. Accept quest3. If you're me finalize pre quest prep. Eat a specific stat boosting skill buffing meal for MAX GAINS.4. Depart for quest5. During the quest you typically have 50 minutes to do the quest objective. Side activities can all be summed up as anything that gets you more materials (fishing mining outcrops gathering plants hunting small/large monsters other than your target).6. Complete main quest objective. If you want scramble for the closest side activity to do for the next 10 60 seconds.7. Get teleported back to main hub.8. Go to step 1.To some players Monster Hunter is just another grind albeit without micro transactions that affect the grind. The appeal of Monster Hunter is its premise. Monster Hunter is the original Dark Souls. To some hunters Monster Hunter is a journey of self improvement. Its fun to overcome a monster that you had trouble with before with some combination of factors like bringing better equipment bringing more items bringing someone to help through multiplayer (hopefully without getting carried so you still have fun learning) or simply learning how to react to each monster's attack animation cues.For others and even those same hunters we hunt monsters because they simply exist and we want to turn them into fancy clothing. In terms of variety Monster Hunter World has less monsters and less outlandish weapon and armor designs but streamlined the overall gameplay loop with quality of life improvements compared to the older titles.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,137,False,Recommended,It's a great game up until you feel no desire to acquire new gear. Then the motivation to keep grinding might fade away slowly but it doesn't mean the game isn't solid. And as you can see from the 100+ hours I've spent in the game world it takes a while for the serotonin to die out. if you have friends you can play with you might still feel the rush even after 200+ hours in the game but that's not my case. You could end up doing more harm than good online. An anecdote I had just joined a session that had been going on for 9 min already the guy had sent an SOS flare he was fighting that wind elder dragon. The boss got harder because of my joining in and he had only one more life to spare. The skull icon was already above the boss and I died a stupid death. Suffice to say the dude was fuming and sent me a couple of snappy messages calling out my stupidity for joining in 9 minutes into the session and wasting his last life. Ever since I always make sure I only join sessions that are no more than 5 minutes in even though the game only punishes players that have joined after 10 min or so. That's it. Enjoy the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,258,False,Recommended,"Compared to the other Monster Hunters this one is pretty unremarkable. There's little variety in monsters and they disguise this having a long ""main campaign"" with some throwaway storytelling and a lot of padding. The open areas are pretty beautiful and have great integration between the mini areas where the combat actually occurs. The combat and exploration have had some ups and downs comparing to previous installments... some things are easier to do faster and more agile but that comes with the price of monster having some cheap patterns. The phrase ""the monster one shoted me"" will be a constant companion until you craft the most endgame of all endgames armor and even so some monsters will still be able to do it on a reagular basis. On the technical level Capcom made a minimum viable product for PC meaning that it runs and can be played but expect a lot of trouble. The required specs are a lot higher than the visuals of the game would justify and according to some more knowledgeable members of the community the use of your hardware will face a lot of effiency issues. Some graphical settings can be tuned though and it seems the low settings make the game both very ugly and playable for a lot of people. The connection to Steam is horrible and most of the online content (like playing multiplayer) suffers a lot for it. The connection drops every 30min not only ruining multiplayer sessions but leaving you to fight alone a buffed version of the monster you were trying to hunt in multiplayer.Overall it seems like they tried to do a big leap in the franchise and while some steps were made forward some others have been made backwards. It's not a bad game just a sad installment given the hype around it. I can't recommend this game especially because of the technical and connection issues but fans of the series may find some enjoyment here. Setting the technical and connection issues aside i would give it a 7/10.Edit The connection problems are resolved now. While the rest of the criticism is valid it's one con down. For that I'm chaning my recommendation to Yes",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-25,0,0,324,False,Recommended,Since i've reached a hundred hours on Monster hunter world i guess i'll review it.First off this game is amazing. From the music to the combat to the monsters themselves this game never ceases to amaze me. Combat feels good and realistic and the music captures the monster hunter feel. Even the monsters in the game are packed with details. For example did you know bazelguese has bad vision but makes up for it because he has extraordinary hearing? This game is packed with content. As in really ing full of content. Im 100 hours in and i haven't even beaten an elder dragon yet. This game is almost a masterpieceNow I am going to talk about what is keeping the game from becoming a masterpiece Not good optimizationIm running a Gtx 1060(gb vram) 16gb of ram and an Intel core i 7 6700hq and im struggling to even get 50. the frame rate mostly stays 40 50 and occasionally 51 58 (if im standing still or there isn't much going on in the world) and major frame rate drops. I have only experienced major frame rate drops 2 5 times in the whole 100 hours i have put into this game. And the game makes my gpu usage go to 96 100% So Optimize the game and you will be one step closer to becoming a masterpiece Connection problemsThis isn't really a problem for me since i mostly play solo but for people who like to play with friends then this is a big problem. Once these problems are fixed then this game would be better (obviously)Conclusion The game is carefully made and CapCom put a lot of effort into it. The game is really unique and has elements that make it stand out from other games like this (Dark souls) It makes everything you do in the game fun and rewards you for putting time to learn the complex mechanics of the game and taking challenges. This game isn't for everyone though. If you're not into grinds and a challenge then this game is not for you. In my opinion this game is a 9/10. Optimize it more and i will make it 10/10And in case you're wondering what my settings for the game are Resolution 1920x1080Resolution scaling HighTexture quality 1024Ambient occlusion MidVolume rendering quality MidShadow quality MidAnti aliasing TAALOD bias variableMax LOD level no limitFoilage sway OnSubsurface scattering OnScreen space reflections OffAnisotropic Filtering HighWater reflection OnSH diffuse quality MidDynamic range 32 bitZ trepass on,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-17,0,0,231,False,Recommended,"TL DR at the endMHW definitely has its problems in the form of the elder dragon ""Connection Lost"" but the developers are taking steps to fix this and I'd say they are 70% of the way there. I am certainly disconnecting less than on launch. I believe part of the problem was people running mods such as the transmog mod who were therefore on a different version of the game. I had trouble connecting with a friend until he disabled the mod. The game has recieved regular updates which is nice and the upcoming events provide motivation to keep playing. The game itself takes as long as you want to complete. You can pace yourself and try to get every bit of armour which is possible considering the 1000 slots of armour inventory space you are given. Alternatively you can rush through the main questline and get to the 'endgame' as soon as you want. The weapon choice oh boy! 14 weapon types and an expansive upgrade tree for each weapon means you will not struggle for choice. Having mucked around with most of the weapons each weapon feels unique with some weapons having overlap (lance/gunlance) but enough characteristics to separate them from each other.Getting to the endgame is more than just completing the main questline however there are several hunts that will test whether you deserve to progress notably a tempered Kirin which has been the bane of many an unsuspecting player.Now I am going to get on to the graphics. This was done with a Ryzen 5 1600 stock speeds DDR4 Memory at 2800MHz and a GTX1060 then 1070ti. Resolution is 2560 by 1440p.I used to run a 1060 6gb (EVGA SSC if you are curious) and the game looked OK but I had to rein in the graphics in some areas and certain fights dumped my fps to around 15. Now when I upgraded to a 1070ti only then could the game really stretch its legs and more importantly only then did the sudden fps drops stop. The game seems to not be too dependant on video memory but more on other gpu resources such as cuda cores clore clock. IMO if you have a GTX980+ GTX1070+ or their AMD counterparts you will be able to enjoy the game at its fullest. otherwise you will have to compromise.Side note for those not aware a 1060 3gb has had its cuda cores etc cut from the base 1060 6gb so it is a less powerful card not just a lower memory card. This is why I find the recommended graphics of mhw to be a bit misleading since some zones/fights will torture a card with low memory and performance.As for the resolution yes this is higher than most people's 1080p monitors. However with more and more monitors becoming higher resolutions I believe that people who upgrade from 1080p to a higher resolution should see what to expect from their card if they dont upgrade it.TL DR1)Connection is still a problem but much smaller in my experience.2)Combat is great fun with lost of monsters weapons and armour to choose from.3) Plenty of stuff to do from investigations to events to weekly bounties. There is always something to occupy you.4)The game is pretty if you have the hardware to run it (1060 3Gb will probably be fine sub 1440p at 1080p on medium graphics)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-17,0,0,107,False,Recommended,reviews reviews reviews. I just wanna say this is my first steam game.while I do reccommend this game for those who like 'hunting big monsters' genre I dont rate the game however as 10/10...personally its only 6.5/10...not that bat but also not as good as I expected.pros first one of the things I really like about this game is the mechanics for weapons. each weapons has its own unique fighting style that'll depend on what kind of playstyle you like. I really the variety of weapon you can use and how each of them gives different experience. 2. the graphics... 3. the various mechanics to beat the monster (traps turf war lures.). I really like the fact that just perpetually smashing the enemy with your weapon is not the only way to beat them. there's also these traps that you can use to your advantage as well as lure 2 or more territorial monsters and just sit while they go Jurasic park or some sht.. 4. the main story progressioncons. limited range of monster.tbh I expected more type of monsters other than just monsters like the first one but with different colour and design...I mean come on. there's like tons of other choices of design for monsters you could've use other than just changing their damn colour. not only that the majority of these monsters (probably 65%) have pretty much the same attack. the only time I actually felt something different was when I was fighting the 5 elder dragons at the end of the main story quest. those five actually made me to not only learn a new type of weapon that works well for their attacks but also actually care what attack they're about to do. cause each of these 5 elder dragon has their own attacks only unique to them. but as for the rest they were all pretty much the same(atleast for me).and also the the lack of variety of monsters that uses element. I'm specifically talking about water and ice. there's an armor set that is made for water/ice type monster even tho there's only 1 monster where that armor is actually useful. it was pretty pointless to make them as the majority of monsters are fire based or uses some form of fire attack. the serious lack of quests for the main story.seriously this is one of the reason I wanted to play this game. I managed to finish the main story in just half a month..and the only reason it took me that long is because I had other things to do. the main story quest is so short and its really unsatisfying....I expected more for what I paid. this is probably the biggest let down for me for this gameoverall would still recommend but I expected more.my total score for the game 6.5/10monsters 6/10 needs more variety of monster design other than just changing their colours. and also more variety in elemental monsters....other than just fire....the armor that you'll pretty much need throughout mid game is an armor for against fire..cause majority of monsters you'll be fighting mid game will have some form of fire attack.mechanics (fighting monsters) 7/10 has wide range of way to beat a monster but most of them are pretty much the same.mechanics (weapon) 9/10 wide range of weapon with their own unique playstyle. hoping for more,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,435,False,Recommended,Does it have as many monsters as other Monster Hunter games? No.Is it now that te al and connectivity problems are gone a good game? Hell yes. On many aspects (apart from the amount of monsters) one of the if not the best Monster Hunter yet in my opinion.The game looks amazing and it plays amazing the level design is brilliant and has quite a few QoL changes that makes it play really well.Mouse and keyboard works Really well after tweaking the keybinds. Which is a necessity.Soundtrack is really good too. The only downside in MHW in my opinion is the grind for decorations and streamstones. The odds of getting the good stuff aren't the most enjoyable. But that said Capcom is currently really picking up the pace with bringing the content console has already played to pc. And with that in mind the game becomes even more promising. Especially when considering there will be a new zone added to the game after some time too maybe more later (hopefully) and I'm looking forward to it all.So yeah all in all I really recommend this game. I've spent a fair amount of time in the game already and I know I will enjoy what's coming based on what there is now.Have fun pard!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-12,0,0,21,False,Recommended,This is a long review so here s a basic summary Monster Hunter World is an open world action hunting game with a fantasy setting. You choose from one of 14 different weapons embark on hunts assigned to you by the commission and in turn make better gear. The game has 30 main monsters and a few others and supports up to 4 player coop play. Overall it is an amazing and unique game with a fun grind and nice visuals!Now into the nitty gritty boisThe Weapons As I said there are 14 different weapons 3 ranged and 11 Melee. They all play very differently and require a bit of learning but are all hella fun to play. Here s a basic summary of em allRanged Heavy Bowgun longer ranged heavy weapon that can act like a shotgun a rifle a machine gun an artillery piece and a poison varying on how you use your ammo. Loads of fun and does good damage while keeping distance from the monsterLight bowgun similar to its heavy counterpart except faster movement speed less ammo types and lower damage and range. Also has the ability to place mines which explode on contact with the monster.Bow Again how you use the bow depends on the arrow coatings you use but tend to be more elemental damage where the bowguns are just raw damage. Also keeps you closer to the monsterMelee Sword and Shield you can use potions without sheathing it and it s a great attack/defence all around weapon for beginners and veterans alike.Dual Blades same as above but without the defence of the shield. It s a button masher.Greatsword big slow heavy and does crazy damage if you can connect with your target. Hard to learn but fun after you get it. Long Sword attacks charge a meter which when full increases damage. Also has a long reach and has good movement. Beware though it hits teammates if not aimed correctlyHammer kinda like the greatsword but you can run and spin with itLance charge attack shield that takes damage like a boss and a good weapon progression from sword and shield.Gunlance reduced capacity shield and cant charge but has a gun. (why not I guess?)Switch axe sword and an axe in one. Lots of damage and very versatile.Charge blade the longsword but harder to use and way more rapeyInsect glaive allows you to jump like an acrobat and also has an insect that gets you buffs.Hunting horn hammer but can play songs if the right buttons are pressed boosts team statsOverall there is plenty of variety and you will never get bored.Combat Combat in Monster Hunter World is a strange and entertaining combination of button mashing and well timed rolling healing and reloading. Melee weapons have a variety of combos that can be used in different situations and ranged weapons have situational ammo types. Melee weapons need to be sharpened every so often and ranged weapons require reloads. Overall the combat is action packed intense and incredibly fun.Graphics My rig is a 1050 2gb 8gig ddr3 and an i5 3330. On medium settings I pull 50 60 FPS and the game really is beautiful in a different way to every other game. Other people claim to have issues but I have none and I am very thankful for that.Multiplayer Overall I have had minimal problem with the multiplayer side of MHW there was a big patch that fixed a lot of the issues. When a friend joins you the monsters are scaled in difficulty keeping you on your toes. It s a really good game to play as a team requires a lot of coordination and is really fun.Overall great game would recommendAt the moment get it for 15% off at greenmangaming.Finally please comment on any pros or cons ive missed as I need to make this the best review possible including the negativesand they consistently fix the netcode!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,451,False,Recommended,Writing this on my break in between sessions because even if it wasn't for the 'Mixed reviews' it definitely deserves a positive review. Coming from someone fairly new to the series 60 hours in on writing this but expecting an endless amount more. I'm not going to address any of the launch issues or bug it currently has with the new Steam UI because I expect it to be resolved sooner or later so I don't see much point in judging the game or the devs for it.The game in itself is absolutely great and a blast to play either solo or with friends. Fans of the genre will most likely enjoy it thoroughly and MH fans or veterans have probably already played it on PS4 to know what it's about. It runs well on PC loading times are almost non existent (though it can depend on your rig) and the general performance is just stellar. I haven't tried playing with Keyboard/Mouse but some people might prefer it as it may offer more ease for navigation or ranged weapons.Update wise the PC version is behind on console but will get them eventually as free updates in the same fashion as consoles did. Which is something to be commended in this day and age.There's actually so much fun stuff you can do in the game and the littlest of detail they have put in it makes the game so much more enjoyable and perfect for me. I doubt I could write it all down in one Steam review and I won't bother trying. I've played the game for almost 60 hours so far and am nowhere close to being done with this game.I'm enjoying every little bit of it but it has to be said that to fully enjoy it you have to appreciate the hunt weighty combat and the grind of it all. Cause as much as I would praise this game and say that any cons are heavily outweighed by the pros it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a rich story you might be better off elsewhere but if you just want to hunt big bad monsters in rich and lively environments then it's definitely worth a try. The game is more than worth it's pricetag for what it is.Would say it's my Game/PC Release of this Year if not many more for sure.11/10 perfect amount of water.

2018-11-21,0,0,189,False,Recommended,"It's Monster Hunter the Daddy of Monster Looting. Now that it's finally in PC I can finally experience Monster Hunter in the new era. The pros of this kind of MH is that it breathes new life to the Monsters and the world something I personally enjoy seeing and from this I can't really go back to the old MH games now and I've played lots of them it's because I was pulled in to how alive I feel hunting in this game rather than in the old ones this game isn't as unforgiving as the old titles but it feels more rewarding. You can get used to this game fairly easy if you have played games that involved material grinding before so you will have a better handle of this game.The down sides of course is the lacking of content but do not be discouraged fellow upcoming hunter time will nourish this game into a MH worthy of being at top and a gem. Another downside is some time to time server issues but I hardly encounter them now with the dev's updates or maybe my data plan just sucks either way good net good time. The main story in this game isn't much praiseworthy it's decent but lack luster it's like something to give players something to do to get used to the game better because the main focus of this game is to challenge and glorify the trophies of the monsters you battle.180 hours is still a pleb's time im still grinding hard and still enjoying this game (Better with friends). This game isn't something you should spend your whole week on just take your time grinding while the contents grow you'll grow with the game. I'd give this a solid ""Play in my free time and still enjoy when coming back to it"". I advise ya play with friends solo's fine but you can enjoy it better with a party.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This doesn't mean it's perfectly optimized but it's better than at launch. there's an active modding scene now mostly involving assets.

No matter what point you are at in the game if you don't come into each battle remembering everything you've learned or if you treat things too casually you're asking to get knocked out and sent back to camp.I started off with the Charge Blade which felt really clunky and sluggish at first. I was constantly getting interrupted by monsters' attacks and using attacks I didn't want to throwing me off my rhythm. However as I grew more familiar with monsters' attack ""tells"" and practiced more with the Charge Blade battles became more enjoyable and tense. I've reach a point where my clunky sluggish self am now in total control of my weapon and I glide across the battlefield with smooth motion.MHW requires time patience and discipline and will help you hone these things if you take it seriously.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,35,False,Recommended,TL DR The graphics and gameplay make this game the best in the series and you won't regret picking it up and playing with your friends or making new friends.I have been a huge fan of MH since the PSP days. Since then I've seen this series evolve both in a positive and negative way. All the monsters added all the new areas to explore each new title in the series brought me back to hunting and crafting my way to the top.MH W has changed the series but in my opinion it's for the better. Simplifying a bit of the mundane or difficult parts of the series helped to bring in people who were shy about it. A steep learning curve mixed with a super dedicated fan base would have been off putting for me had I not already dipped my toes in long time ago. I feel these changes would likely have brought me into the series or at least really into this game.The graphics the gameplay the new helpful tools and a revamp to the controls really ensnared me into this game. I have only 29 hours on PC but I own the PS4 version (yes I am the fanboy who buys a copy for each console) and I have sunk so much time into it. I do think the PC version is a ton better than the console versions.Also the fact that they FINALLY brought the series back to consoles AND put it on PC that had me roped in right away. It was so much better when it wasn't just handheld. The 3DS ports and versions were good don't get me wrong but the world in MH W just shows how great a masterpiece these guys can make.With all that said this game gits a big YES for recommendation and I hope you will enjoy it as well.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,205,False,Recommended,This is a game that's primarily about hunting monsters. Each monster is basically a boss fight in most other games and since most of what you'll be doing is fighting these monsters you're basically doing boss fights all the time. Between a bunch of different weapons that all handle differently and the variety of monsters to hunt and make equipment out of which lets you go after stronger monsters the gameplay loop is a lot of fun and the combat is very good. The combat itself is very good with some weapons that are very powerful but committing to an attack can leave you vulnerable to fast and agile weapons that are more about a lot of smaller blows and continuously attacking the monster as much as you can.Monster Hunter as a series has a lot of grind to it and this one is no exception. I'm not someone who enjoys an extreme amount of grind but the amount of variety of options in this game lets me switch things up when I want to if I ever get bored of using the same weapon type. On top of that there are a bunch of additional monsters that have been added to the console version of the game that PC players are steadily getting (and it's all free and more recently becoming more frequent) so every so often there's something new to do once you've hit the soft end of the game.Overall I really like this game and I've been playing it on a Steam Controller which works great as well. This was my first monster hunter game and I look forward to more content being added to this game as well more Monster Hunter games being released on PC!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,121,False,Recommended,The launch period was a bit rocky but for once Capcom actually put in the work to make things right. The network issues have been fixed (for me at least) and I've been playing online with friends and randos with no lag or disconnect. They've also made a number of bug fixes quality of life updates and free content drops to bring it up to par with console versions. The gameplay is very much a Monster Hunter game but with some modern conviences that make the experience more accessible and fun without compromising the core challenge of the hunts. The game looks great and the port offers plenty of options to tweak.Don't let the early mixed reviews dissuade you if you like Monster Hunter you will like this game. My only gripe is with the scheduled events that require you to check in on time in order to experience all the content. I hate being forced to play a game on someone else's schedule and since I missed the first Kulve Taroth event I'm locked out of some of the best endgame gear until it happens to roll around again. Other than that I'd say this is totally worth picking up though. Just ignore the Deluxe Edition the little bit of cosmetic DLC is lame and not worth the premium.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,585,False,Recommended,My first game in the series was MH 3 Tri for the Wii and I also extensively played MH 3 Ultimate on the Wii U. I'm not much of a console gamer but I liked my outing with Tri so much that I basically bought a Wii U just for 3U.Thankfully capcom's PC dev team has fixed many of the issues that plagued Monster Hunter World at launch on PC. The occasional online disconnects were fixed shortly after a launch. And just as notable proper mouse support was patched in about a month after launch. Before the mouse camera was sluggish and sloppy like the mouse inputs were being mapped to an analog stick scheme. You can ditch that horrible implementation and use a 1 1 mapping scheme now. This means the camera now works like you expect it to on any regular PC game.I can t speak to any performance issues as I have a i7 8700k and a GTX 1080 Ti. The game ran fine for me.I ve had a ton of fun playing MH World and it s definitely been worth the $60 I paid for it on launch day (I refuse to preorder).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The main story was very intriguing and I loved how your character was involved in all the cut scenes.I do wish you could have staying in a group with others while watching the cut scenes but it wasn't too big of a hassle.The grind isn't too bad I felt everything was easy to get if you put the time in and RNG wasn't so terrible that you'd become frustrated trying to get materials or gems.Most players are coopertive and friendly but as with all online experiences you run into someone that feels they can either get carried or that they are in an operation that the world is counting on to succed All in all if someone where to ask me if the game was worth the asking price I'd say yes without hesitation,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,129,False,Recommended,This is a grind game! And it's fun especially if you're with a group of friends.The only downside of this game are the graphic optimisations. I can run GTA5 in '4k/very high' and hold a steady 50fps but this game in 4k even with graphics in low I get so low in fps that it's barely playable. And it's pretty much impossible to play at a lower resolution on a 4k screen without hurting your eyes even with AA...So I have to play it in 1440p but can never hold it for too long.But if you have a good GPU and a 1080p screen go for it.

2018-11-22,0,0,589,False,Recommended,"This game is a huge improvement for Monster Hunter Series. I'd recommend to bot hlong term fans or newcomerws who don't know anything at all about the game.I'll arrange in topics the highlighted features i think are great on this game and then go over some downsides.* Graphics Simply a huge leap from previous games the ambient the characters and creatures look fantastic and theres nothing like seeing high res glowing geckos running on trees. I must also add the style of the new and unique weapons armor and creatures look fantastic.* Weapons moveset reworked Some weapons had very clunky movesets or weren't that fun to use. The way they reworked made most weapons not that hard to get what it is about. I even managed to try and enjoy the hammer and bowguns in world while i'd find it a pain on wii or 3ds controlls. Theres a miscellania of small utility stuff i won't list as a thing but not needing a pickaxe collecting on the run and the circle pad item shortcut are very welcome additions.*Multiple platform While you may not play with your fellow PS gamer i find it good that Monster World games expanded their horizon and therefore will be able to impact more ppl. it helps the game grow in popularity and it's not close to nintendo (still love you) only players.*Seasonal Events previously you would dowload events and from that point on you could do them anytime. When you add seasonal events its like giving more of a lifespan to the game making it more interesting to go back to the game you've already beaten (there's some sick looking armor such as dante's going on right now).* Seamless Open Maps It's just beatifull. It's a small breathing world very detailed both graphically and logically. The interactions with hazzards or between monster are so satisfying. It's the future of monster hunter.* SOS Precious Life saver.* Slingshot The best mechanic added. You can play spiderman or Diablo's Demon hunter. But seriously it helps a lot with the move around and also for non ranged weapons(specially short ones) have a shot on specific parts. Bomb and Pierce ftw.OK so now lets highlight a few bad things or rather disapointments. I'd like to add that most of these i kinda expected ina a sort of pioneer Monster Hunter. Monster Hunter games are known for making an expanded better ""Ultimate"" version later on which i hope for.* Few Weapon models There are simple a lot of weapons that are just the bone/iron versions with some details that remind the monster in question rather than each monster have an unique weapon of their own.* Few Fan favorites There are a lot of new monsters and that is good. But some of us would love the return of some VERY iconic monsters such as zinogre lagiacrus nargacuga tigrex amatsu. This is something small and the continued series for monster hunter world will likely add those.* Few maps Or rather im more disapointed with the lack of a tundra map which has always been a thing why would we have hot drink and not cold drink ? ( ) there are a lot of nice ice monsters that were waiting to pounce on us but were denied because of this. They have potential to add more very interesting maps (they've already blwon my mind with coral highlands so i wouldn't be surprised) and we 'll have to wait for the future.*Bad distribution on monster types The game is crawling with Fire Blast and Dragon elemental creatures but if u ask about sleep paralyze poison ice thunder and water they have one to two representants. Future games with more creatures will likely smooth this out but it's damn frustrating have girros and radobaan as THE para and sleep monster in the game and thats it.All my downsides i find them very little or more like impatience to wait for a new game but it's garanteed to get you a few hundred hours of fun.I do hope you try this game because it's absolutely a great blast. Go for them 4 player hunts and enjoy try lots of different weapons and if you find it hard to get look up Arekks or Gajin Hunter guides theyre both awesome.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,60,False,Recommended,Although the beginning is a bit slow figuring out the mechanics of every weapon or monster and the wonky controls can be a hassle for the first hour or two once you get into the real meat and bones of the game it really starts to make sense. The gameplay lore and graphics all tie in to make a purely gorgeous game.Main concerns of most people A lot of reviews here are complaining about FPS however even with the minimal specs the game looks pretty good and runs at a usual 35 50 FPS at low setting. But if you have a stronger computer mid or high setting look absolutely gorgeous and usually run at 60FPS unless you hit a FPS drop while hunting.The connection has been an issue once and a while during gameplay however it is very easy to reconnect and almost never causes problems while on a hunt.Bottom line this game is just fun. It's turned the usual boring grind of most games and turned it into a refreshing system that really gives the Monster Hunter title the glory it deserves. Pros Great graphics for such an old title Runs fairely smoothly even if you only have the minimal specs Very fluid combat they have mastered the rewarding feeling while using weapon you can both feel and see the inertia and technique behind every weapon (You'll fall in love when you find the weapon that fits your style) Multiplayer runs fine no rubberband lag or anything of the sort Gameplay. The game rewards smart unique or creative thinking nothing is more satisfying than dropping a rock on a monster and being able to dish out insane damage. It's a game you can play for fun once and a while or it's a game you can spend hundreds of hours on mastering it leaves that decision to the player The game is challenging in a good way if your first plan didn't work out then think of another. Lure your hunt into the way of a larger more powerful monster and wait until it is weakened or learn the map around you and turn the enviroment into a series of trapsCons A few disconnects while in lobby. However each lobby has a specific name and message so it is easy to reconnect and not miss anything Frame rate drops happen sometimes while hunting in large parties (unless you have a very beefy PC) Although this could be both a pro and a con grinding is just embedded into the game. Especially when you get to difficult monsters you are not equipped for (However the multiplayer makes beating difficult monsters very enjoyable) Clipping. The game LOVES to clip it's built into the core of what it is. It usually isn't too much of a problem but can seem a bit wonky at timesAll in all though whether you want to get this game while on sale or even want to dish the extra money for the deluxe edition it is an extremely fun game. No matter what games you are into MMORPG's FPS Shooters or just casual and fun games. Monster Hunter World will reward you with very deep and thorough gameplay and lore. It is a definite must play for anyone who has the money!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,188,False,Recommended,The world around this is interesting and a little weird. The open world idea makes it a little tricky in spots. However the greatness of Monster Hunter is there. I feel its dragging at the end a fair bit and there is a lack of monster. I found the weapons look a bit boring this time around. I bit to simular looking on a lot of the weapons. I find getting decorations are also a complete pain in the but. I mean it was random in the other games but the huge amount of time spent one just getting one is not worth it. However I did like how you are able to augment the weapons a little bit I wish there was a little more options to the augments. Now being one of the few to play the game with key broad and mouse its a bit harder to play then if you use a controler. I find it is harder to play seeing you lose out a bit on the quick crafting and other options.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,699,False,Recommended,Although it had a rocky lauch with tons of connectivity issues Capcom put in the effort to fix it as well as adding tons of options that makes it a worthy PC game instead of just a simple console port.The updates are coming fast as well in what I assume to be after they fixed most of the technical bugs at the start and looks to be on track to catch up to console's progress soon.TLDR One of the best games this year playing solo or with friends get it and have fun!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,70,False,Recommended,"For the first true Monster Hunter experience North American players have received on PC it is a hell of an inauguration. I've played past MH games always dreaming of what they might look like on next gen hardware. When MHW was announced I nearly had a heart attack then they said it was coming to PC the following year and I nearly myself. I have a PS4 but wanted to wait and experience the game in all its glory on PC and oh man was it worth the wait. The game feels exactly like MH should but with amazing visuals and sound and I think it provides the most satisfying MH package to date. I'm just creeping into HR quests now with over 60 hours to go and the hooks are set deep. I slowed down playing a bit so I could play with a friend and because real life took priority but now I've got mroe time to play and enjoy it again and I'm loving every second. The game has a few rough edges but they are very minor for a game that overall has a lot of polish and substance. These ""rough edges"" I refer to are some of the launch issues that are now resolved and the way that the Rotten Vale can tax even a good rig (that being said my machine is finally starting to show its age). This game is a must have for any self respecting Monster Hunter fan and its first major foray into PC gaming is my game of the year no contest.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-14,0,0,233,False,Recommended,I have been playing MH games for years since MH freedom on the PSP I've played 'em all after that and I have to say this is by far the best MH game so far just like pretty much most reviewers have already said and will be a contener for game of the year.So why is the steam score so low? Well first of all the PC port has some terrible connection issues it's really hard to maintain an online session so if you want to play this with friends or just any type of multiplayer wait until that is fixed which can't take that long. If you're reading this a couple weeks after launch it will most likely be fixed already.The second part of bad reviews come from the usual entitled morons complaining it's a bad port becuase their toasters can't run it at 4k/100 FPS so yeah just ignore those just the fact that it can run at 1080p/60 FPS it's already better than most console versions I have a GTX1060 been playing with whatever Geforce experience set as Optimal and I think the game looks good and plays smooth haven't got a single error or anything like that graphic wise and if you came from past MH games like me it's a huge upgrade from the 3DS P.To sum it up if you're like me and just like to actually playing the game as long as it's fun runs fine and smoothly then this is a great AAA game. If you're a little picky jerk who's gonna cry on forums 3 weeks because the game dropped to 59FPS one time or that the controls are not like the ones from an MMO for PC (even though it's a game meant to be played with a controller just like Dark Souls where they probably cried just the same) then just stay away and go spread your poison somewhere else.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,276,False,Recommended,It's monster hunter on the PC. World is a great intro to the series with lots of quality of life improvements and a very easy challenge curve. Although I am disappointed with what they did to the bow and the new stagger animations which allow movement but take twice as long to recover.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,192,False,Recommended,While Monster Hunter World is a rather large deviation from the combat formula the series has used thus far it still captures the core of what makes the monster hunter games compelling. Killing every larger and more dangerous monsters and making hats out of their corpses.Jokes aside MHW has made the monster hunter series far more accessible to wider audiences while still providing the core gameplay of the other games in the series. The combat still retains its depth while being more forgiving in the earlier stages of the game. The areas are now far more of a focal point than they have been elsewhere. In what has been a series with very flat and slow movement options the dimensions of the world have opened up with midair and mounting attacks being a interesting and very satisfying addition to the series. Few things feel better than lodging your fully charged switch axe into some monsters head and letting off a barrage of elemental attacks ended with a enormous explosion which often knock the monster to the ground. If you enjoy action RPG's and dont mind the grinding inherent to a game of this nature then MHW may be the perfect game to add to your collection and can easily last you hundreds of hours.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,247,False,Recommended,Amazing game (and a decent port after some problems early on). They've gotten on the ball with content updates and the patches seem to be helping but it's still not quite 100% (occasional disconnects). Lots of fun both solo and co op and the early hunts are easy enough that most people can pick up this entry. Endgame content is starting to get difficult so veteran hunters will have a challenge to look forward to.This game is very CPU intensive though so if you are running an older CPU you might have trouble getting 60FPS.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,274,False,Recommended,A franchise that I grew up with and constantly surprises me in each installment. Monster Hunter World focuses on improving the quality of life of the game the feels and looks of monster and the fluid animation of the weapons and character movements.Currently the game still follows the model of free content that releases new equipment new monsters and new contents.

2018-12-07,0,0,186,False,Recommended,although I only have about 170 hours in game I can definetly say that the game is worth the purchase especially with the sales that just don't stop coming. The game itself is still catching up with the console versions but they should be finished with that around the start of spring. The games scenery and soundtrack are simply amazing and with the great gameplay experience that the game provides it makes the former look like icing on the cake. Also the game is a bit grindy and stuff once you do hit around HR 49 but so far i have felt that the grind has definetly been worth it. Overall I believe that the game is seen at the $40 sales that it's been having you should definetly consider picking it up as it's just an overall great game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,233,False,Recommended,I bought this game 4 god damn times so i could play with my friends after playing 350 hours on ps4. CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF CONSTANT DISCONNECTS. As it stands i can't recommend this game because of the dc issues the xenojiva save file delete issue and denuvo because denuvo. Other than that the game is amazing. Fix the DCs! *UPDATE* 8 26 2018* Soooo Capcom released an update that actually fixed the disconnects but now you can't find a session to join at all. matchmaking won't work searching with all parameters set to ANY will not show any sessions. The only way to join a session now is to create your own or have a player send you their session ID. Then you can actually play with other people. SOS's don't work for me either but they work for others. They still have a lot fo Fixing to do.*UPDATE* 12 07 2018*So most of the game is pretty much fixed and i don t get DC'd when I'm playing with other people across the webs BUT when i play with my room mate we get DC'd every other match! other than that i guess i can sorta recommend the game now since PC version is almost caught up on updates. behemoth is releasing this month as well as USJ quests and a few ither things to keep yuh busy.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-28,0,0,300,False,Recommended,It released in a pretty bad state but don't let that mixed rating fool you. The game has gotten so much better with the recent patches and it rapidly catching up the console version.

Most of the time you need to do the quests alone nobody ever talks nobody ever tries or helps for something. Well even if they are talking i ve no idea yet. For now game feels so single player then online.Edit Now im around 60 ish hours of gameplay and i learnt how does the multiplayer system works and as far as i know 999 is the last hunter level to go.

2018-12-20,0,0,119,False,Recommended,Gameplay 8.5/10Port 5/10Content(Pre G Rank) 7/10Gameplay is fantastic World streamlines a lot of tedious features that previous MonHun games have had and in terms of fluid gameplay it's probably without a doubt the best feeling entry in the series. Weapons feel good most armor sets do look very flashy and it has a gorgeous setting. The story like in most MonHun games is a bit forgettable and is only there to unlock new areas and monsters. Co op is seamless and great but also crap at the same time. Instead of being able to just play the story mode together with some friends you all need to progress it in your own instance and watch the cutscene in each mission before even being able to have anyone join in requiring you to do the same story missions 2 4 times depending on how many people you are trying to play with. that's honestly my only major gripe with this game. This review is also being written prior to the release of the new expansion Iceborne which is going to expand this game even more with easily another 100 hours of major content and Geralt from the Witcher franchise.(A Witcher! Hide your women!)Port wise Monster Hunter World is a bit messy and needs a lot of tinkering if you want it running at a decent framerate. Luckily there is a couple mods floating around that helps with some CPU sided issues but still trying to achieve a stable &amp smooth 60FPS is almost impossible. I have a FX 9370 &amp GTX 1060 6GB combo and I average 40FPS 60FPS in any normal situation so I leave VSync on to avoid ugly screen tearing. Stuttering is very rare on my machine but I have read on others this game stutters like that weird kid that lived at the end of the road. Older hardware will have absolutely a much harder time running this game unless you can handle omega potato mode which this game does have plenty of settings to turn off or on.I can easily recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid 3rd person action game endless grind style of game and an all around fun co op game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,169,False,Not Recommended,As a MH lover to the bone it hurts me to give a negative review just for this specific reason BUT until the moment every network connection issue disappears I discourage everyone from buying the game. EDIT(08.10.2018) All the network connection issues are no longer present(at least for me and everybody I know). The game despite the lack of actual end game which is both good and bad is very enjoyable. The quests usually fill up instantly while going online so rest assured you will get this Tempered Kirin done. But russians... oh boy... abandon the quest if you see'em joining. Deeply recommend it even though there's not really more conent than in all the previous MH games which I loved to the bones. I wish there was more. EDIT(20.12.2018) Garbage network connection issues again. Same old,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,1310,False,Recommended,Criteria Score Comment/Description Gameplay 10 The game is really fun especially when playing with friends. It's kind of getting repetitive in late game but it still fun. Content 8 The number of monsters we get in the vanilla game is less than what we get in the previous Monster Hunter game. Fortunately dev said they will release new monsters with free DLC. Controller 9 KB+M and Controller support is really good. I must say the Keyboard and Mouse in this game is kind of weird but once you get the hang of it you'll get a hard time getting back to controller. The only downside with Keyboard and Mouse is that you probably can't walk slowly (dev please fix). Story 5 They could've done better but IMHO the story was meh. To be honest this is the first Monster Hunter games that i really enjoyed playing. It's not that the older MH was hard or anything but the problem lies in how the dev decide on how the controller works especially in old handheld console. With MH W the way controller works feel really smooth and not clunky.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The story is sub par but you don't play Monster Hunter for the campaign. Unfortunately I have to give this game a negative review for the timebeing because of the abysmal network issues I've been suffering.

2018-11-25,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game for fans of action rpgs and loot based games. The core loop of slaying monsters collecting resources and upgrading armor and weapons to make you better at slaying monsters is fun and the variety of weapons and equipment available (almost all of which are viable and effective) keeps the game fresh and fun. If you ever feel like you're getting bored of hacking monsters to death with your Greatsword you can easily switch to one of the other 15 weapon types and experience the game in a completely different manner. Each weapon type has skills combos and movesets to master and while some weapons are more simplistic than others all of them have relatively high skill ceilings allowing players who put in the time to learn a particular weapon to shine. There are a wide variety of monsters in Monster Hunter World ranging from the stranger monsters like Dodogama or Pukei Pukei to the more conventional like Kushala Daora or Anjanath to even the Raid like fight against Kulve Taroth. There are also a variety of different environments in the game from the beautiful Ancient Forest to the dark Rotten Vale each of them offering different monsters flora and fauna. My main complaints with the game are mostly around quest and material grinding. For me personally I enjoy the grinding loop and the combat so it's not too bad but grinding materials and resources to craft gear can get tedious once you reach the end game. Monster Hunter games have always been grindy however so it's important to keep that in mind. If you like grindy games like Destiny The Division or Diablo you'll probably like this game assuming you are a fan of action RPGs.Overall Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game and an excellent way for the franchise to emerge on the PC platform. If you are interested in the type of game MHW is I would highly reccommend it. The amount of content the game offers and the longevity it can provide is worth the price of admission alone.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-03,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"Only 10 hours in Game is a lot of fun beautiful to look at and has a good ""pick up and play"" style by which I mean I can turn the game on and play for 30 minutes and then leave. Personally that has become so much more important for me as I unfortunately get less and less time to play games now. I find myself gravitating towards games like Diablo 3 or Overwatch that I can play for a little bit and then leave or games like Stellaris and Civilization that I can turn on and leave playing and come back to for a few minutes at a time.So with Monster Hunter World I appreciate being able to just jump in and run out into the wilderness for a quick quest. Whether it's progressing through the story trying to complete some investigations or bounties just running around killing stuff or grabbing crafting material it's all very fun and you get a decent sense of accomplishment just wandering and enjoying.For people who can invest a lot more time than I can this game will also scratch that itch as there seems to be endless amounts of replayability not just in hunting the monsters and getting mats to craft but also in perfecting the various weapons and styles of fighting. I'm barely scratching the surface there and I can see that there is a lot of room for growth skill and fun.I should touch that a bit more and say that the actual combat gameplay is very entertaining. It's not just locking on and spamming the same key over and over. Each weapon style (and I think there are 12? Could be wrong) comes with a very different way of playing and there are combos you have to learn similar to a fighting game like Tekken or Soul Caliber albeit much much less complex and timing technical. So there's a lot of skill that goes into it and a lot you can learn if you're willing to really put the time in to master them all.Overall it's so far a very easy thumbs up.The only downside I will say is that it markets itself as a co op game but the multiplayer aspect is not nearly as intuitive as it would seem. I'm not saying it's difficult but if you are starting out I'd say play the first 10 15 hours by yourself to get through some of the storyline before trying to co op. A lot of the game aspects don't open up until a few quests in and also a lot or maybe even all (I'm not sure) of the storyline quests can't be completed with friends. I was pretty shocked at how clunky the multiplayer aspect is... you'd think you just join a group like in Diablo or something and can go ham on random quests or monsters but.... no. That aside it's not that difficult to play multuplayer so don't let that dissuade you. Still a great game so far.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-03,0,0,140,False,Recommended,These opinions are from someone first time playing Monster Hunter.What a joyful 100+ hours it has been. There has been pain and suffering but also joy and accomplishment. Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game where you hunt or capture monsters for your island research team to study. While doing all this you are discovering a world where danger lurks behind every corner. I've heard that this game is in fact the easiest one of the series and there is lots of hand holding in place here. While some of this might be true it doesn't mean that the game is bad or unplayable. The game itself is very grindy but offers content long after you finish the main story. There are also seasonal events and special goodies that players can obtain. Pros+The concept hunting/exploring is really fun+Large variety of monsters and even some cute ones+Large variety of weapons and armor +You get your own hunting partner (Palico) cat which will help you on your hunts!

Despite those being annoying the game itself was still really well madeNow that a lot of the bugs have been fixed this game has become a huge favorite of mine to play with friends. The grind may get a big annoying but there's still a lot for you to do. Whether you're hunting a specific monster to aim for a powerful weapon working with your friends to slay elder dragon or tempered monsters or grinding hard during an event to get limited time gear this game offers a lot! The developers are constantly dropping new events and exclusive gear for you to try and get which helps anyone who's gotten through the main campaign and is looking for a reason to continue playing.The monsters themselves are super well made. Each feels like its own boss fight with their specific attacks status conditions and in the case of Elder Dragons different battle stages each is a breath of fresh air. Also the variety of weapons in the game allows for a variety of fighting styles.The story itself is kind of weak and you can complete it rather quick if you play a lot but it doesn't take away from the appeal of the game very much. Plus the cutscenes are really cool!If you got a couple friends to play this game with you'll all have one hell of a good time!Gameplay 9.5/10Graphics 7.5/10Story 6.5/10Controls 8/10 (using a controller in my opinion is a lot easier)Multiplayer/Community 8.5/10Bonus This game DOES NOT HAVE LOOTBOXES OR ANY KIND OF GAMBLING!

Friends have to wait to join instead of watching the cutscenes with you.Replayability meh.If you can manage the grind of fighting the same cast of 20 something monsters fifty or more times a piece to get every single weapon and piece of armor this game'll last you several thousand hours. If you're not an insane person it'll take you about 100 hours to get everything you want 100 more to complete a few select builds (ALL FROM DECORATION GRINDING) and about 50 to polish off the updates and events released thus far.As compares to previous games meh.It's gorgeous both its sound design and graphics are better than in previous games and combat is much smoother now than in previous games but it lacks the major and big end game monsters like Alatreon Amatsu Fatalis Akantor etc. that really pushed your ""holy cow this is epic"" buttons.

2018-12-13,0,0,77,False,Recommended,A truly beautiful new entry in the series that improves alot of the game's systems and mechanics and shines with a lot of detail in the various areas giving you enough reason to sometimes just stop and appreciate the scenery.The game lacks in monster and weapon design variety with an underwhelming end game but provides a new more streamlined experience to most of the systems so that new recruits and veterans alike can get enjoyment out of this game under the condition that grinding is no problem.The large amount of different weapon types however gives players enough reason to come back to the same quest several times to try out a new play style or maybe tackle the monsters together with up to 3 friends.World's online features allow you to quickly jump into a random quest with strangers to help them out or shorten your grind but sadly this hurts the series' iconic guildhalls which are essentially the online lobbies where you can drink chat and prepare before your quest. These are empty almost all of the time meaning a big part of the online experience of past games (namely the social aspect) is gone.If you can overlook the shortcomings the game provides you with a fun and rewarding hunting experience that can keep you hooked for a while.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,"!!!I LOVE MONSTER HUNTER!!!Monster hunter worlds however is a terrible game the changes they made to make it better relate to mainstream gamers has completely ruined many of the excellent features of the original game the new monsters while interesting and well programed seem way to easy to fight and the town itself is way to big making town running tedious and annoying. The forced tutorial is also a terrible feature as the tutorial in all original monster hunter games from sony were always optional. If this is the new direction monster hunter is going. I'm hanging up my oversized weapons taking my palico and leaving the monster hunter universe forever.PROS Very well programed animal AI responds how you would expect actual animals to react amazing world feels like it's coming to life around me interesting characters make me enjoy engaging in the story diverse and engaging monster lineup New mechanics for traveling made moving around the world much more engagingCONS town is constructed terribly forced excessivly long tutorial daily logins and forced online mode very displeasing and far stretched away from original designs of monster hunter changes to appease a broader demographic alienates true monster hunter fans monsters far easier to defeat then previous games WEAPON AND ARMOR CREATION TERRIBLY NERFED absolutly the worst change they made town farm and palico training arena removed previous games had this feature which helped extremely with the daily grind Gather hall has no reason to exist anymore as the whole game is online now gathering hall missions share main game missions seriously the best part of the gathering hall was it was a training ground for getting ready for the campaign and it was a multiplayer havan how do you mess that up?! HOW?!!!! My final notes would be to say to the developers ""go back to playing monster hunter games on the PSP see what the best and worst traits are there and improve on it. not change it""for me.

2018-12-20,0,0,238,False,Recommended,"I love this game to death. Heard a lot of bad things about it when it was first ported to PC but I was busy on the ps4 version so I didn't care. I've staked close to 1000 hours in the ps4 version and I'm only beginning my journey on the pc version. Only ten hours in though I can say this version is equal if not superior to the PS4 version. Whatever problems plagued this port are long gone.About the actual game now. I'm not going to go too into detail about everything just enough so you can be informed enough to make a choice but not spoiled if you decide to buy. If you've played a monster hunter game before you'll love this. Besides overall making literally everything better this is by far the least grind heavy monster hunter game that's ever been made. You want the rarest item on a monster? 5 tries is about the most I've done for a material but you can easily get it sooner. When I saw literally everything? I don't mean that to be an exagerration. The combat the graphics the feel the storytelling the inventory system the crafting the list could go on. The ranged weapon controls are so smooth that before I wouldn't dare touch a bowgun and now find myself rocking the heavy variants frequently. No more ""1 set of armor for melee another set for ranged"". Where as before the melee would have more armor and the ranged had more elemental resistance those bonuses are now added as an after effect. Auto crafting system for items while you're on the field means if you know the map you'll never run out of your favorite bullets or potions. Any issue you could've possibly had with monster hunter they done fixed it (unless you're a massive baby like one dude I knew who said the whole game was trash because of the monsters not having a health bar).If you've never played a monster hunter game before? Strap in cause you're about to waste hours on end doing one of three things. Screaming in success screaming in pain or screaming cause you didn't get the drop you needed even though it's the last item on your list. This game is all about hunting monsters bigger than yo momma all in an attempt to carve off their bones and foreheads to craft better items just so you can kill tougher monsters all in an attempt to carve off etc etc etc etc. There's a huge variety of weapons each with an entirely different style of play. From the slow moving but super damaging greatsword to launching yourself through the air with the insect glaive or even using the hunting horn to smash baddies and heal your daddies the beautiful bastards who made this game somehow balanced these weapons so you never really feel weaker using one weapon or another. They ease you into the game quite nicely a very smooth learning curve the only real spike in difficulty is after you beat the main storyline. This game I feel also gets you into the real fray quicker than previous monster hunter titles. Whereas in MH3U you'd have to undertake what felt like 25 gathering or small monster missions before your first ""big"" fight (big meaning he's maybe twice the size of the baby enemies) This game throws a tutorial at you in the form of explosions and a giant volcano monster a gathering quest a small monster quest and then the real game begins. You jump from fighting komodo dragons the size of a big ol pupper to fighting big papa gator 5x their size. Side note you're gonna be wanting a lot of plants and bugs and the like for crafting consumables to help in your hunts. Healing potions defense and attack buffs flashbangs and screaming bombs all kinds of goodies to enchange your quality of life during the hunt. Luckily there's a farm right in the hubworld that'll do 98% of the gathering work for you it's just up to you to remind them to fertilize and pick up the loot every so often. There are a few items that CAN'T be farmed but usually those are for the more powerful items that are useful but not mandatory for a fight (Stamina doesn't decrease for some time health/stamina completely restored and their bars get maxed out that kind of stuff). I have three complaints about this game one only matters if you're trying to do EVERY story mission with friends one you get over after a few shoulder shrugs and rolling of the eyes and the last is literally cosmetic.Issue one being that you're not allowed to join a mission until the player has seen the missions cutscene (if there is one) at least once. Usually this cutscene ends in ""Big monster is right in front of you the fight starts now"" so it'll take a few minutes for your friend to ready up and find you in the map before he can help you fight. Now if you all are starting fresh? That means you all need to go see the cutscene then quit the mission and start up with the whole group. It's honestly not that bad but it's a minor complaint.Issue two. Expeditions. Beat a monster? Go on an expedition and scout the area some more. Finally beat another monster and mapped out the whole place? Go on an expedition and scout a new location. Rinse repeat rinse repeat. Finally you've unlocked every section of the map have every location completely scouted out and they say ""There's a new monster go on some expeditions to get some tracks or clues about them"". Again it's more a minor annoyance than anything and the later ""Go find tracks"" can be completed while running normal missions but if you lack any sort of patience whatsoever you'll find yourself groaning everytime someone mutters the word. Issue three. A lot of variants of the same weapon look nearly identical. When you're upgrading weapons you use monster parts for materials and the weapons take on traits of said monster. Some weapons and this was the standard for nearly all weapons in some previous games change so much they don't even resemble the original weapon. That pair of dual swords you were just using? They done got turned into axes when you upgraded them with a certain monster. Same great taste new great look. Now a lot of weapons in this game simply don't get that big of an overhaul cosmetically even if they are potential end game gear. Sticking with the theme of dual blades those iron swords you were using just got upgraded and now they look like the same swords with some feathers near the hilt. I'm just spoiled because I miss swinging a giant coffin/accordian around in MH3U but a little more variety would've been nice. As I said before it doesn't effect the weapons at all I just see how gorgeous the weapons that DID get changed become I just wish they would've done it for more of them.Please don't let those paragraphs scare you they really are VERY minor problems and simply an annoyance at the end of the day. Once you get past the first half of the game? Doesn't even matter anymore really because you're either past it or have just accepted it as life. Let's chat about the monsters in this game. Outstanding. New monsters added in are very fair and you never REALLY feel like you've been cheated (you're only lying to yourself if you do). And if they have gimmicks? They aren't bad or are easily solved by wearing the right armor/using the right consumables. The returning monsters have been made far more fluid strategies and moves mixed up just enough to they remain faithful but will absolutely catch a returning player off guard. No health bar as per the usual but I always felt that'd remove the tension you feel at the last stage of the battle. At the end of the day you're just as likely to die or win against any of them and you're gonna be just as happy either way.There's a lot to love about Monster Hunter and even more to love about Monster Hunter World. If you've never played a game from this series you should definitely start with this one. Not to say that the originals are bad far from it actually. But this is by far the most friendly introduction and later play the old games if you wanna check out its roots.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you are looking for an action packed and thrilling experience this is it!I have only recently gotten into the Monster Hunter franchise with Generations Ultimate on the Switch. Seeing as how World has better graphics extremely cool looking armors and many new monsters I knew I had to get this game. And I am glad I did.Good stuffs+Wide variety of monsters with their own traits and behaviour (A couple are quite similar however)+Improved many parts of the older MH games (Monster tracking gathering is faster and ability to move when consuming things)+Great graphics+Cool events/ collaborations (Witcher 3 Devil May Cry Megaman Final Fantasy and so many more)+Constant updatesStinky stuffs The upcoming content are slower than the consoles (Iceborne expansion and updates),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It took all that I remembered and loved from playing monster hunter back on the play station portable many years ago and upgraded it. There's a lot of quality of life additions that improve the experience and I love being able to use my entire mouse + keyboard or ps4 controller to play this game. Its beautiful the group play is fun and welcomed and I'm excited for all the updates and mosnter additions. I recieved this game as a bday gift from a friend I used to play MHFU on the psp with and it is great reliving those hunting experiences again.Added bonus even if you miss an event no worries they cycle around!

2018-11-24,0,0,195,False,Recommended,As a huge fan of the Monster Hunter franchise I can safely say that as far as bang for your buck goes this is a great game even at $60. There isn't as much content as was in MH Generations Ultimate but few (if any) game could match that game. What this game does better than MHGU's sheer variety is the complexity and care put into each and every monster. Every monster behaves differently and has their own little nuances. There's enough content that you can get 120 hours in before you even realize you've faced each monster a dozen times. Be warned though the things this game does to your CPU is not pretty. It will break into your CPU's room at night and do very naughty things to it. I was never worried that my CPU would overheat during a play session before I got this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I'm guessing they either rushed it or didn't give two about making sure things ran smoothly but it's a real headache figuring out how to make the game run smoothly all by yourself.Don't get me wrong its a great game.

There have been some bugs along the way but the dev team has done a decent job with most of it. At the start there was a disconnect bug that friends and I would run in to rather frequently but as of this review it has been 80 or so gameplay hours since my last disconnect.The story is enjoyable and if you take your time to do will give you plenty of hours in game. The visuals are definitely beautiful though I do have issues with my FPS due to I believe some sort of bug. Audio side the game is amazing. The handler can get pretty annoying to some but you don't really hear her enough for it to have been something to bother me.Post story is where the majority of the challenge comes into the game. There will be advanced difficulties of each monster that will give greater challenge in the way of higher health and dealing more damage. This can be a bit draining at times as you will eventually make a mistake and the entire group of four shares three lives. Sometimes a failing mission will just happen.The variety in weapons and armor is good. Though you will have to mismatch your gear to get best stat bonuses and this can at times lead to you have a less than desireable look. Getting weapon and armor pieces is generally easy not requiring much work but that is where things can become tedious. You have augments and gem slots that you are able to make pieces of armor and weapons more powerful with. These items are purely RNG (Random Number Generator) based and can take an extraordinary amount of time to aquire. Which is where my second biggest con for the game comes in. If you are looking to just play for the story and casual with friends to enjoy it No big deal. If you would like to go for faster times and push the more difficult fights it can require lots of grinding to get what you need.The biggest con for me in the end of everything is that the game has a great amount of released content for the consule versions. However players have long since hit the endgame and are unable to play further (other than farming more gems with RNG pushing them down) until the developer's decide to give us the next thing. We will probably be waiting on PC for some time before we are given the rest of the monsters. I myself saw the trailer of players fighting Behemoth and as a Final Fantasy 14 player I was very excited. However after starting the game I learned that first we need to go through the other updates of X number of monsters before we will get that one released to us. Even then there will be more updates. This will mean PC will more than likely never be caught up with Consule players on content. This also means that guides/meta's that you will find on the internet are more or less tailored towards those players with all content released though this has become better over the last month or so.TLDR I would recommend the game with its beatiful audio and visual immersion. The gameplay is great but will require lots of grinding in the endgame. There are still some optimization configurations that need to be done on the part of the dev team but it is nothing game breaking. If you do not like grinding through RNG in the endgame wait for the game to go on sale and get it for the story and casual play with friends. If you enjoy grinding and RNG you will likely get hundreds of hours playing the game.Edit Giving us a new monster and only for a short period of time. This is unacceptable when it has been released on the other platforms permanetely. Throttling back the release of monsters to not ""overwhelm"" the community. Content has run dry. Done with the game till they give us more to do. With the lack of new monsters that have already been released elsewhere and the horrid grinding needed for gems my recommendation is to stay far from this game.System SpecsAcer Oredator G3 710Processor Intel i7 6700 CPU 3.40 GHzRAM 32 GBWindows 10 Home 64 bit",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-15,0,0,97,False,Recommended,The mixed reviews actually pushed me away from purchasing it on day one but I finally bit the bullet and bought it and I have to say I think this is the best Monster Hunter game yet. I played 4 Ultimate and Generations but nothing compares to this sprawling landscapes the monsters all have their unique ecosystems and behaviors and the customization for you and your palico is top notch. I feel like I'm living all those cutscenes from previous entries! Yeah the controls are a little difficult getting used to but it's not unbearable. The only complaint I can think of is for some reason it keeps saying I can't use SOS in the middle of a battle because of a lost connection perhaps it's something I did but I haven't needed to use it yet so I'm unsure if it's going to ruin my experience when I do try and use it.

However this port is just a flat out scam with nothing redeeming of it. Constant fps drops gamebreaking bugs and a broken multiplayer that constantly shows an error message. This port is a scam and I recommend you just buy a ps4 and play it there because at least the game is playable to a degree. I am furious at capcom who already made immense profit from the console market alone and had 7 months to release a poor port like this. Judging by Capcom's habit of rarely touching a pc port after release I can assure you that these issue will take atleast a couple extra months to fix.

Loading times are definitely superior and makes for good game pacing as compared to the PS4 version. Looks amazing in PC as well The connectivity issues were definitely quite the plague to deal with upon launch. Seems fixed now. Patches are rolled out too slowly for my taste.

2018-08-09,0,0,355,False,Recommended,If you've never played Monster Hunter game before this is a good one to start on as a lot of the features from last games have been streamlined along with a gameplay update and a visual overhaul... Finally Monster Hunter doesn't look like something from PS2 era.Gameplay This is the main meat of the Monster Hunter. The game has 14 different weapon types to choose from with each of them with different movesets and varying complexities and quite a few even having choices on how you want to play particular weapon different kinds of armour with different weaknesses and skills that come with them along with different items that you can craft to help you in your hunt there are a lot of options for tackling problems. There are not as many monsters to hunt as in previous games though. The areas now are a lot bigger with more elevation and environmental hazards and no loading screens between zones... Everything here makes the game feel really great to play.Visuals While PC has for most part parity with consoles the game still looks stunning. Everything has been updated from previous games to look like a modern title finally.Story Now this is something Monster Hunter games aren't great at and even here it's mostly to serve you more monsters to hunt.Problems If you're playing through the story with friends you'll often face a problem where you need start a mission alone go watch a cutscene and then back out which gets tiresome. The game doesn't run the best on a lot of machines and while there are so many people playing the game at the moment the game still feels deserted at times with game reporting that there aren't hunts for certain monster when you check SOS signals and the lobby usually having only couple people in it.Conclusion In short if you like having a gameplay that feels great and many different options in a world that looks great and don't really care about the story this is definitely worth playing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-24,0,0,101,False,Recommended,It's a HD monster hunter for the PC and though the game isn't perfictly optimized it still runs very well. If you've ever been interested in the monster hunter franchise now is a better time then ever to try it out. This is essentally a rebuilding of the core engine of the series and is likely the start of a new chapter. It has many quality of life improvments compared to older games and offers a less harsh learning curve. My biggest comlaint is that there is a less diverse offering of monster fraims the older games though that will hopefully change as new content is added periodicly. This game is great for both a casual couple of hours every here or there to multi 10 hr play secions. The end game content can get stale after some time but you can always pick up a new weapon and need to look at old fights from an entirlly new perspective. Definatlly worth the money and even better if you get it on sale.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Yet to see issues even with lower technical specs on my steam link based HTPC gtx 780 stock i7 2600k. low/mid graphics yet to have an issue constant over 60fps not seeing any of the issues players seem to face in reviews even with higher based specs. My Gaming PC in the office is running higher end and maxed graphics and yet to see any issues with game. That is not to say there is no issues a small handful of connection issues in the first few days not being ideal however no resolved for the 99.9 percent of players. All in all a great game a great challange and contender for game of the year. Even taking into account some of the simplifying of mechanics from previous games.

I wanted to go in completely blind.And lemme tell you mang this was and is a incredible experience.Its got enjoyable multiplayer interesting monsters fun events that bring you back a HUGE arsenal of to keep trying and changing up many armors that bring perks and just a crazy amount of builds to keep you going at this game. The downside which sucks is the story restriction its slow and honestly just boring.

Connection issues from day 1 game is so badly optimized that gtx 1070 cannot run it properly. Textures and graphics are rough i mean really rough. Environmental effects are blurred it just felt draining looking at it. my last game was witcher 3 you can imagine the graphic shock that my eyes need to get used to. If there are signs that these issues are getting looked at I don't mind the wait but come on Capcom you need to talk to us or at least let us know whats going on. cannot recommend this game in its current state.Edit came back to the game since last week.

2018-10-23,0,0,171,False,Recommended,As the newest release in the long running Monster Hunter franchise World had some big shoes to fill. As someone who has experienced EVERY Monster Hunter game to be released here in the states I can safely say that I think it did a pretty damn good job. World streamlines a lot of the more annoying mechanics from previous titles. Gone are comsumable whetstones bugnets and pickaxes. Gone is the need to carefully weigh positive and negative skills and turn to an outside program to optimize armor sets. Gone are the tedious loading screens in the middle of a hunt. All of these are great changes. Not so great however is the roster of monsters. Don't get me wrong folks I REALLY like all of the beasts that World gives us to hunt. But the variety is a bit...lacking. Dinosaurs. Lizards. Dragons. That's kinda it. Previous games gave us giant bugs crabs spiders apes...and more. In addition the speed at which new content is being ported to PC leaves a lot to be desired. I've reached the point where I've killed most everything upgraded my equipment to almost the max and started learning new weapons. The vastly different combat styles do add some longevity but at this point hunting anything but tempered monsters and elder dragons is kind of a waste of time. Speaking of tempered monsters...I don't like them. All the system does is make them hit harder. They don't have more health they don't change their tactics. They just deal more damage and even that is no big deal once augmenting becomes available.Monster Hunter World is undeniably a great game. It's gorgeous to look at fun to play and challenging enough without being unfair. But it needs more content. It needs a way to make the weaker monsters relevant again.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,410,False,Recommended,this review is coming from someone who is completely new to the game never touched its previous versions and was heaviliy recommended by friendsearly game is boring af. how you have to track down monsters whom you have no idea about their habits and/or locations. granted there are actions involved here and there but for me personally i felt like constantly looking for monster tracks instead of actually hunting them. this can be crossed out if you have friends to play with but in my case they were already around hr100 some 200 which instead of playing together would just feel like skipping through the story because hard carry.this point is kind of going against the first point because after all that tracking you finally get to hunt a decently difficult monster (in my opinion) our favorite fire breathing t rex. which is a pain in the to fight against alone as a noob.although after you pass Anjanath in my opinion i began to be able to enjoy the game. the amount of monster tracking is equivalent to monster hunting which is a good thing.elder dragons are awesome and the first one you encounter is no exception. they took an interesting direction with the first elder dragon you encounter. btw the rest of the elder dragon is handled as you would a regular monster in a way.finishing the story is not the end game of monster hunter world. after you finish the story there is a whole lot more to explore mostly based around increasing your hunter rank (hr).monster hunter world is a game that is worth the grinding. i only wish we can customize our character more regarding their body shape.tl dr its a good game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,678,False,Recommended,For someone who the last played MH was Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G this one one is way easier alot less grindy and you don't even need to manually track the monsters because theres a ingame feature that do that for you. With that said unlike in 2nd G u can kill any monster with any type of weapon on 2nd G i had to have one blunt weapon for some monsters one slicing for others and one ranged for others (to break/cut parts and/or not run of time because the monster fly almost the whole 50 min). So in the end i just did specialized on 3 weapons because i had to do that to reach the end game. Making the game less grindy and easier made me feel like they did enable the full game for me because now i can just play any weapon that i want against any monster also i do not feel discouraged to build all the weapons the game offer me. (i remember taking 3 or more days to just get one Rathalos Ruby while my friend i played with had a dozen trying to help me getting mine and he just played the same quests i did).Its a really good game if you never played Monster Hunter before and is a good game to play if you are an old hunter but never feel was worth using all weapons you didn't specialized because it was too grindy to forge them all.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-07,0,0,129,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Overall game is pretty good. The best thing(s) I like about this game is the creature design and the enviroment interactions. Being a new player to the Monster Hunter franchise (This is my first Monster Hunter game I have received.) I look back at some the older titles and want to try them out. I am a big fan when it comes to creature design in certain games this game is a good example for creature creativity. The way the monsters interact with each other in a turf war is awesome to watch and its also helpful for hunters to research. The styles of how the monsters fight is good and unique for each one enough so you don't feel like your fighting a clone.I give props to the people that were part of the art design and creation of the monsters in this game. My ONLY complaint about this game is the weapon designs on a good chunk of the weapons seem underwhelming. (example Hunting Horn and Hammer etc.)Graphics are great ambient sound in the game is awesome soundtrack is awesome. I recommend this this game for anyone that likes playing with friends its still good going solo but the game seems better when playing with others or at least a partner.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-06,0,0,513,False,Recommended,It's a really good game and great entry point to the monster Hunter series. What was once a niche game that appealed to people with a penchant for spreadsheets comes to PC and you don't necessarily have to use a spreadsheet sheet anymore. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what new features and content will be added. I hope to see this game become a living and thriving community.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-06,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Oh my god I love this game. I know it's got denuvo and port issues but it is really fun. I've beat the game and finished almost everything on the PS4 version and that version has a lot more content. As much as I like more content the smooth 60fps makes me love the pc version. If you don't mind performance dips get the console versions.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-06,0,0,318,False,Recommended,I never touch previous game from Monster Hunter series this is the first. I'd say it's a very good game. Graphic is pretty good (although there's some optimization problem) gameplay is great as well. Build customization is awesome too. Although decos farming is hell but it was expected anyway.I was frustrated by the connection problem when it was first released but they've fixed it. Although PC version was released later than consoler version it seems they've been speeding up the patches for PC to catch up the schedule with console. I appreciate this.One thing I don't like is the BGM is bad. Idk maybe it just doesn't suit my taste,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,243,False,Recommended,This game is incredible. In fact it is so great that I am writing a review before even finishing the game because I want to recommend it to people as fast as possible. Great graphics action and a lot of it a decent story ( I prefer gameplay driven over story driven games all I want from the story is to not ruin the immersion) fun gameplay and a lot of content and variety. I cannot recommend it enough to people. The only bad things I can see in this game are 1) The crazy useless girl aka The Handler which is always talking and never helping ( Somewhat like navi from Ocarina Of Time) and 2) Relatively high requirements for high settings 60fps. If you like action get this game it is well worth the 60$ and if you ever find it on sale DO NOT EVEN HESITATE GET IT. Also have fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-12,0,0,300,False,Recommended,"Update November 12th Swapped to a ""yes"" as they have now fixed the majority of the outstanding issues. Some took much longer but better late than never.The game itself is good but there were some glaring issues that prevented me from suggesting it to people at release. Upon launch the game was plagued by connection errors bugged low res textures for months a slow content release catch up to console and limited options for DoF/motion blur (since patched in) Multiplayer / Matchmaking No ""Join Squad Session"" for online. Squads were in the console version but have been replaced by Steam Groups. Guess what there's no ""Join Group Session"" either. (Options available on console)There is no option to create a session that only allows your friends / group members to join. The only options are ""Private Yes / No"" (people can join a private session if they have the session ID but you can't invite them to it) Port Optimisation Performance optimisation is not stellar. Running with a 1080ti 16gb ram and an i7 7700k 1440p and the game does not run as smooth as it should. Particle effects in particular can tank FPS.""Volume Rendering"" makes the game look washed out and negatively impacts FPS probably good to turn that off.Uses Denuvo anti consumer DRM that punishes the people actually buying the game. Hopefully this gets removed.For some positives the loading times stomp all over the console versions (didn't even bother putting it on my SSD and they are still almost instant) and when the game is running properly the 60+fps is great. PS4 Pro averaged something like 45fps by comparison.My review of the actual game as a whole (PS4 version) https //www.youtube.com/watch?v QW4cytVHFFQ",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,407,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is culmination of everything right about monster hunter games. A streamlined tutorial to help new players intergrate themselves with seasoned hunters. A soundtrack that escalates during monster encounters and is soothing while roaming the environment. Tight controls on both controller and keyboard and mouse. A slew of terrifying cute and dangerous monsters to hunt capture and kill. An endgame that surpasses that of Destiny 2. A bevy of DLC content all free and all adding to the grind that many veteran hunters hope to have. A world that is both beautiful and mystifying. But I did have two qualms with the game. The multiplayer for story mode is absolute garbage. Waiting for your friend to hit a cutscene just so you could join them? It isn't an issue later when story isn't a thing anymore but it is annoying when we should be able to experience the story with friends. And the story itself was flat. Not to say Monster Hunter ever had a compelling story in the first place but it is in the spotlight as other Monster Hunter Systems have been improved. Overall an experience everyone should have however. Easily my game of the year for 2018.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

At times the monster part carving brings back some of the same feelings I had collecting loot in games like Diablo and MMOs in the early 2000s. I know it got a lot of negative consumer reviews when it first came out seemingly due to issues with the multiplayer integration. Though getting multiplayer setup does have it's issues that is definitely not a reason to look past this game. The game is polished the combat feels great and the hunting parts for gear is the loop that keeps it going for me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Amazing new addition to the series but an underwhelming pc release with loads of bugs and error messages. Improved monster ai. Better visuals. Annoyingly bright pest that follows you around offering subpar assistance that can easily be accomplished by either yourself or the fleet and takes up your screen at obnoxious times that I wish I could either mute shoo away or both.

2018-11-25,0,0,126,False,Recommended,I usually don't write reviews for games but for my favorite series i'll make an exception. I've been playing monster hunter since the first game came out in 2004 (still remember the terrible stick attack controls ugh thank god they did away with that.). So i've had alot of experiance with all the games and i can say though they've spruced the graphics up the core MH game we all love is still present. My only complaint is the lack of monsters compared to other more recent titles (4U/Gen) But they are adding more as they go. I haven't tried the multiplayer aspect yet really as i like to rely only on my own skills but thats only by choice. i'd definitly give the game a 9/10 and hopefully we'll see many updates and new monsters moving forward in the future or even an expansion pack for a snow biome.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-07,0,0,135,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I bought this game the day it came out on PS4 and uninstalled it instantly. I hated it 100%. It felt clunky grindy and just unfinished.But me I got gifted this game Christmas of 2018 for PC and it's an absoute masterpiece. Whether thats me being a PC fanatic or not this game is incredible. Despite the grind learning and mastering the weapons feels SO rewarding. Almost like beating Soul of Cinder over and over and over and over. It looks amazing all of the areas looking incredible. I've never written a review for a game on steam before despite putting in 1k hours to CSGO and Rocket league both. This game seems to get some hate because people want to go in and button mash to kill monsters. I started like that I imagine most people who never played a Monster Hunter did but this game isn't DESIGNED that way. You need to be 3 steps ahead of the monster at all time. This game rewards smart players and can punish people who want to button mash. Hell its one of the most rewarding games I've ever played. Knocking a monster over with a well placed hit hitting a full charge with the great sword or getting that perfect aerial dodge with the kinsect blade. TLDR If you haven't picked it up take it from someone who HATED it not even a year ago. Once you get past the fact you cant button mash its one of the most beautiful looking games and rewarding games you can play.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I'm giving it a good review for the reason that I think they did a decent job porting this game tbh you've seen worse launches if you really think about it. I was honestly expecting much worse considering the stuff I read and watched about it. it is a bit of a cpu hog but it's something you won't really notice with the right hardware.... tbh idk if i'd try for now with less than an i7 (cpu makes more of a difference than gpu) but as long as you have a new(ish) i7 and a gtx 980+ you should get a decent enough framerate with some tweaking performance wise In about 40hrs I've had the game crash 3 times but I havent experienced less than 60fps (i7 6800 &amp gtx 1080) and it actually runs decent at 60fps unlike other AAA games.I know that other people have experienced issues but other than the 3 crashes I've had in 40hrs I've been enjoying it... the original person that convinced me to play this ended up having a crumb mun cher with his gf (mistake) and she can't seem to let him sit alone or play any vidya game without nagging him plus theres a wedding and all kinds of other future regrets coming up that he has to plan out with her so that was out... but bc of that i've ended up making a bunch of new freinds playing MHW and had lots of fun.Overall I'd def. reccommend this even if not at sale price or w/e imo the fun you'll get out of it with freinds and whatnot is well worth 60 bucks or so.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-24,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Before buying this on steam I had previously played about 200 hours on my xbox. Upon the Steam release i was very excited to see this game updated visually and it was great to play back through with the updated graphics and all. Though originally online was an issue being most people had issues connecting and staying connected finding friends sessions and all. After a while the updates came in and online connectivity got better dont seem to have any major issues recently and finding friends sessions is no longer a pain.My only concern for this game was when we would be getting the content that consoles got (Luna Arch tempered ect.) and while at first I thought that we'd be waiting a while for them to catch up mostly because I stopped seeing many updates on when they would try and release more after they released Deviljho. This last month they came back strong to crush any concern I had before about this content catching all the way up to console by releaseing Kulve then Luna and telling everyone shortly after we heard about Luna that Arch tempered was coming by the end of this month catching up to console completely besides Behemoth (as far as I am aware). Capcom has definitely put work into making sure this game keeps going strong.This game is tons of fun. It can be grindy but you usually have something to do whether it be farming for jewels needing to set up a new build or simply wanting to try out new weapons and reinvent your character. I always find myself having atleast some reason to continue hunting for things.My only real want for this game going forward is to start getting new tiers to work toward whether they eventually bring in the much talked about G rank or just simply add more rarities and sharpness to the gear. Overall I reccomend this game to anyone that likes RPG's but dont mind the story not being amazing or long or to anyone that likes to just beat the crap out of big monsters.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-24,0,0,791,False,Recommended,"Gameplay 5/10 (Compared to the previous titles)Graphics 9/10 (Compared to the previous titles)Controls 7/10 (I played on keyboard &amp mouse)Story 2/10 (Where's the Story I mean Dragonator)Singleplayer 7/10 (Pretty easy to solo)Multiplayer 5/10 (Obvious server instability)TL DR Monster Hunter World is a good game in general but it is best played with friends throughout your grind!I have been a Monster Hunter fan since Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii and Monster Hunter World on PC is a great addition to the franchise. GameplayLike the previous titles Monster Hunter World is pretty similar to them in terms of fighting the monsters (Point A to Point B Done) Rinse and Repeat until you get the weapons and the armor that you want. Monster Hunter World is Open World for once (Previous titles all had loading screens to get to different areas). Scoutflies + Tracking is decent to some extent although it is better than throwing paintballs in the previous titles. Endgame content is the same as the other titles as once you are completed with the latest content you are just there waiting the next one until they are out of it then you think to yourself why....why'd you buy this game. JK during endgame I tend either make my character look ultra stylish or make another character from scratch and then you rinse and repeat. It's also best to try a new weapon if the game gets stale. Lance is the best JK I love them all GraphicsThe graphics are good in general but it is really the best when compared to the other Monster Hunter games. The fact that it is open world makes it even better as seeing the lush environment and the weather system is great. My only gripe is that even though it is open world to me it feels very small and some locations in the game are just tedious to be in although it looks very good. (*Cough* Ancient Forest) ControlsSince Monster Hunter World is the first Monster Hunter title to come on PC I wanted to play on keyboard and mouse to see if it can be played at all (Looking at you Dark Souls). So I'm here to tell you that keyboard and mouse is playable right now isn't that great! The thing I don't like about the controls is when you're on the hunt with any ranged weapon and you are using the mouse wheel which for melee it is used to scroll for items it is replaced with scrolling for the ranged weapon's ammo and that they substitute thatStory Without Spoiling anything in one two a couple of words I would say UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES and DRAGONATOR enough said.To make the story short you are the ""Main Character"" and you start to have awkward conversation with a random hunter and your cat that you created. At some point something happens and your flying five fleet ship breaks in the sky by a gargantuan bungo monster pops up and the Handler comes to your rescue and takes all the credit while you pretty much do all the hunting and all she does is eat by the Canteen. The keypoint of the story though is listening to the Commander in all the unskippable cutscenes about his stories of making the best Dragonator and polishing the Dragonator everyday. The best part of the story is when you do use the Dragonator in battle with the god of monsters and seeing largest damage number known to man nay history as the Commander and the random cast of unmemorable people talk about how big and sturdy his Dragonator is. End of story. Did I mention Dragonator?SingleplayerNot much to say here as there were no problems although I would like to mention that if this is going to be your first Monster Hunter game I would say that the beginning is always hard. I say that strongly as you start the game with ""all"" the weapons so you can try them all in the beginning but they all do minuscule damage hence the part of the game where you spend your time forging and upgrading your stuff. During the endgame content phase however that same monster that you fought in the beginning can be finished in under a minute. Apparantly it can be finished in under a millisecond coming from the world records but I call that heresy!MultiplayerThis can be a blast and a frustration sadly. As told by other reviewers the multiplayer servers are at times unstable. I want to say with a 99% accuracy that every Tuesday the game will kick you out of the room all the time and that still happens constantly. To me I declare Tuesday No Monster Hunter Day because I can't think of a similar game on Steam that does that. For the ""blast"" part I've enjoyed playing with my friends and the cool randoms that I am able to play with. OpinionAlthough I recommended this game I liked Monster Hunter Generations (X in Japan) on the 3ds better because they added Hunter Arts which are pretty much Skills and Styles which were technically play styles that added more to the gameplay experience. Had they ported Monster Hunter Generations U (XX in Japan) that is on the Nintendo Switch to PC I would've played that instead. Also I didn't like the endgame bosses Zorah Magdaros and Xeno 'jiiva that much as compared to in MH Tri when you encounter something like Ceadeus (Underwater Fights Suck) or Jhen Mohran for a similar fight like the Zorah one .That being said Monster Hunter World is Great and I hope that they keep updating the game to keep the playerbase going!Hopefully this will help with your decision on purchasing Monster Hunter World or not.Good Luck out there Hunter.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,176,False,Recommended,I have not purchased a Monster Hunter game since MH3U on Wii U and I actually play that actively till this day. MH World is everything I love about monster hunter and more on PC. When I first purchased the Wii U version back in 2015 I dreamed of a PC version because of the sub par framerate and dated graphical fidelity. I have a feeling this game will be very active for many years to come on PC definitley worth full price or the 20% off discount you can often find from key sites.My performance 1080p Highest settings with Volumetric Fog set to Low or Off 40 60FPS averaging 48FPS in heavy combat.Specs R5 1600 3.8ghzRX 580 8gb 1425 mhz8GB ddr4 2400mhzloaded onto an SSDUPDATE Pros The gameplay in this game is simply fantastic. The world is also very immersive and definitley sets the mood. Customization is also nearly endless and there are so many different ways to play that you will never be bored.Cons The online is just too archaic for me it works fine but its just so tedious to find people to play with that are looking for the same general thing to do as you. Hell even the Wii U version was more specific and easier to find what groups and people you wanted which is pretty sad. Inviting friends is easy but the lack of an actually useful in game chat just makes no sense on PC.TLDR Game itself is astounding and even though the online co op works you need to spend more time and effort than you should to find people that aren't your friends that you want to play with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,139,False,Recommended,"I used to play MH on PSP back when I was a kid and man the magic hasn't left the series since then. The devs clearly took a good long look at all the things that made the game fun and brought them back in MHW bigger and better than ever. More importantly they did away with all the negatives. There are LOTS of quality of life updates and some people are keen to claim this makes the game more ""casual friendly"". While it certainly makes things easier I cannot honestly believe that's a bad thing. If you want to run around slowly collecting rocks for hours just so you can sharpen your sword be my guest I'll be over here playing the fun part of the game. Standing out from its forebears the setting of MHW feels alive. The biomes are full of life and add a layer of realism onto the fantasy making your actions feel worthwhile and effective. If you like games where you take on huge varied beasts with massive bizarre weapons in beautiful settings get this game you'll have a blast. A word of caution though don't expect much from the storyline. MH has never been particularly good at that side of things but truthfully it's not why you play. Happy hunting.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The first time I got to the canopy of the ancient forest I was blown away by how detailed and interesting the level design was not to mention how ALIVE each location feels.Weapons monsters and gameplay are all top notch and the fidelity of the graphics allows for a lot of nuanced detail that was unavailable before.I understand people have had numerous issues with connectivity for multiplayer and that has informed a large number of the negative reviews for this title on pc. I can only speak from personal experience it was never a huge issue for me. Things have massively improved since launch and they've made an effort to add more time for time limited events like Kulve Taroth in the wake of connectivity issues.If you want it BUY IT NOW WHILST IT'S ON SALE.

Combat seems smoother and more intuitive and it is easier than ever to experiment with the weapons and find a style that is right for you. Satisfying monster parts gear progression and build variance with an RNG factor for decorations that straddles the line between rage inducing and highly satisfying when you finally find the 1% chance deco that completes your build.Solid online experience without sacrificing the ability to solo every encounter if you want (Besides Kulve Taroth)The only negative aspect of this game is the overall lack of content compared to previous installments (less monsters) however this is slowly being addressed with free content updates that even after 250+ hours of playtime i am excited every time to jump in and experience.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Upon later examination I became egstatic with joy of how much fun I was having from the very beginning. The Combat is more complex than Dark Souls and is far more rewarding. I was stunned by the MMO style item system and equipment gameplay. When I gave a little time to figure it all out i was enfatuated with how diverse and customizable your playstyle can be. The story is solid but not great. The gameplay gets a 9/10 from me where I can fight the same monster 100 times and enjoy each fight equally.

From the ""under"" water experience of the Coral Highlands with its floating jellyfish and its sandy floor to the toxic waste land that is the Rotten Vale. Each map has its own unique views that are breathtaking and fully immersive. Not only is the environment spectacular the game play is one of a kind and multiplayer friendly.

Whilst it may be lacking in content compared to its predecessors there is still a tonne of it and what there is is of a higher quality.Yes there are still MANY strange design choices and lots of niggles to get around but if you've ever tried a Monster Hunter game in the past and been turned away by its obtuse design give this game a shot. It is highly possible that the new changes have remedied your issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a very fun game all around! Most of my play time had been on PS4 (sorry Steam) since I wanted to play it right away. I have always enjoyed playing the past games in the Monster Hunter series so this one was a must have for me. I will admit that Monster Hunter World does still seem to lack a lot of what made previous titles so great but it holds its own even still. The game does still have plenty of monsters to hunt and a lovely open world! I could go on and on...but in the end I think it best for people to simply pick this game up and try it out!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,135,False,Recommended,One of the best iterations yet. Incredibly fun combat with a lot of depth tens to hundreds of hours of fun grinding. Apparently missed some features at launch but was fixed later and developers keep adding more and more content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-22,0,0,158,False,Recommended,Great Game but has it limitations content wise but it give hopes for next monster hunter titles since this was the first game on this new engine and monster hunter as a franchise showed masterfull proficiency in developing their engines the next game is bound to be even better.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-20,0,0,243,False,Recommended,I originally gave this game a negative review due to technical issues with networking and constant crashing but I feel like there has been sufficiant progress with these issues to re write my review.I love this game it is a welcome change to the monster hunter formula in every way grappling around in vertically expansive environments is easily one of the best moments of 2018 the environments on their own are amazing the coral highlands and the elder recess have got to be some of the coolest looking areas that monster hunter has ever had. The new monsters are a ton of fun to fight and may just be some of the most memorable yet.I will never get over Rathalos breaking a dam and falling off a cliff while i grapple to safety before jumping down after him and slashing him on my way down WITH NO LOADING SCREENS!!The constant events give me incentive to come back after ive already spent hundreds of hours just in 2 months somehow I am not burnt out yet. The new ability system works perfectly you no longer need an insane amount of stats in one skill to make it worth it making builds is actually fun now!Armor looks great every weapon has been given an extra layer of control and moves to keep things fresh and every single one plays completely differently.Just get the game!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,84,False,Recommended,I've been a long time fan of the Monster Hunter series as a whole. Attempting to grab up every game to get the experience of each and every title. While MHW was quite different from those titles it was nothing short of being downright enjoyable. I've played solo and played quite frequently with friends which make the hunting experience a ton more fun. With constant title updates and event quests released the fun never stops and I hope to see a lot more in the future. I highly recommend MHW to anyone who's been a longtime fan of the series and wants to try something a little different and for new players introduced to the series through this launch.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,62,False,Recommended,This is a terrific game it's a improvement over older games in almost every way. There may not be every weapon or combo from other games but it doesn't need them.What it does have is a good variety of weapons to suit anyones personal tastes great gameplay much better visuals than any previous game. Every corner of this game is also filled with character and charm the main base is filled with various different characters decorations palico's and of course Poogie. That's only the main base as well going outside of that you'll be create with terrifically made areas with their own monsters and enviroments. Except the rotten vale. No one likes the Rotten Value...The only downsides I'd give this game is that the optimisation really needs some work. But given this is the first MH game they've ever done on PC and how great it is to have it on PC now in the first place. I can live with that. My PC is not very good anyway so it could just be my hardware.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Using their parts you can craft stronger gear to fight deadlier monsters and craft even better gear. Eventually you'll look back at the path of carnage you have chosen think of the corpses you have butchered and skulls adorned and wonder if you should try using a bowgun next time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-01,0,0,159,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter has always been a series to improve upon itself with new iterations and MHW is the most astounding entry to ever grace the series. As a bit of a veteran I ve have never found hunting monsters more engaging.There are so many sweet conveniences added in World. The removal of loading screens and the addition of interactable environments adds fantastic depth. The series has never been so accessible. The game supplies information and tutorials on subjects that once had to be researched thoroughly via fan wiki sites. Previously Monster Hunter was more of a cult series that required the helping hand of a friend to move into. With World I ve had several friends independently start with no prior experience and they ve delved deep into the game. A training room is another great accessibility option. Getting the hang of weapons outside the heat of battle assists is highly appreciated. The upper right hand button tutorials while frustrating for some are invaluable for getting beginners more confident with the admittedly strange input options.Monster Hunter games are at their best with buddies and without communication the endgames is extremely challenging. The SOS flare is an outstanding way to find hunters with the same objective as you. There are no more awkward and slow 4 hunter lobbies in which you type using the 3DS s touchscreen keyboard to ask to get carried.What remains of the endgame is a little awkward as play time starts to depend on your cash and less abundant drops. Setting personal goals gets tougher since there aren t any more short term surprises for motivation. Unless you re switching up how you re playing high rank can get stale. The game becomes far less binge able. To keep things fresh it s important in this stage to try out and master new weapon types experiment with armor sets and make your own goals. There s something missing from high rank that can t be filled by slightly angerier monsters.A strange change made in World is the move to weapon trees. It makes getting higher level equipment unnecessarily grindy. As an example I didn t realize I were short two low rank anjanath parts when building up to a vaal hazak weapon. Weapon trees make sense while naturally progressing through the game but they make for quite an inconvenience later on.There s a reason that Monster Hunter World has become Capcom s best selling game. Nine month wait for a PC port and an initial two weeks of server errors at launch aside MHW is a must have for any fans of 3rd person action RPGs. If you're already a fan of the series and you re looking at the steam reviews how are you being indecisive about this?Please make MHWU capcom. Do it you won t.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,491,False,Recommended,Great Monster Hunter game and a welcome addition to the franchise. Despite it's differences to previous mainstream games if you're a Monster Hunter fan you should get this. It's worth it. It's a more relaxing experience due to a wide addition of anti frustration features such as the ability to move while using items quicker gathering specific quests to farm rarer items easier etc but the game still has Random Number Generator elements.Keep in mind that I said 'Monster Hunter' fan. Not everybody will like this kind of experience with an endgame that's pretty much just farming for a chance of gettting the next thing that will make your equipment just that little bit better. I consider it fun as the environment and great variety of weapons and allies you could get makes every quest feel unique but if that's not an experience you enjoy then this series isn't for you.Sure it might have a shaky launch but at least Capcom showed they cared by fixing it as quickly as they could.

2018-08-20,0,0,215,False,Recommended,It took me and three friends nearly 80 hours to finish the campaign. Could we have done it faster? Sure. Probably can be done in 30. But to play the game get good equipment and finish the story line (as its meant to be played) will take you well over 50 hours of game time. Very enjoyable game time at that. I have only 2 complaints First the multiplayer servers are really iffy and sometimes work fine while at other times disbanding your party instantanously ruining a quest and wasting resources.My second complaint is that this game is MUCH to difficult to run at high settings. I had to upgrade to a 1070TI just to be able to play at high setting with over 60 fps. If your system is baller however fret not this game is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING visually especially on the higher settings. Don't let my two complaints discourage you this feels like one of the most polished and complete games I've played in a long time and while not perfect It sure as hell felt like I got my money's worth even at full price and I'm the type who only buys games during steam sales. Overall excellent excellent game. Thank you Capcom for in a time where companies like EA and Ubisoft are nearly scamming us with their pay to win mechanics and content purchase walls making a game with so much content so much replay value and so much overall quality. You can really feel that the creators put their all into this game and that's not something you see very often.EDIT Game has been optomized through updates and so has all the controls. Beautiful update after update keep the game alive. GOTY IMO.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,281,False,Recommended,as a long time fan of monster hunter i'm very happy with this game as the only other monster hunter on pc is a chinese exclusive and is hard to get into (but not impossible). fans of previous titles will feel immediately at home and the streamlined gameplay doesn't mess with the core game just eases new players into the world more gently.The difficulty is noticeably easier than previous titles and personally i wasn't seriously challenged even in the endgame but it's not the end of the world as it still remains one of my favourite series and the combat is still just as satisfying.As always however the games core mechanic is about rewarding the long grind so stay far away if that doesnt appeal to you,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,510,False,Recommended,I've played this game on PS4 over 1k hours. I really love this game. I am joining my friends so I bought another copy on PC.Things getting better after the MHW game update and steam client updates.I have to say a few shortcomings still need to be addressed Teostra hunting is a terrible experience. Sure you can find some workaround fix that fps drop regarding to the particle effect. Still we are waiting for an official fix. You will encounter some cheaters in matchmaking. Infinite traps One hit kill One hit cap...(Some are subtle some are...) It seems no consequence for now? SOS flare search works now and then sometimes you get pages result instantly sometimes you get only one or two after seconds. During the night the Error 83 still bugs me now and then. Even when you offline the steam friends UI. The guild card bug irritates most players (Capcom you should test it before you make some changes the network problem the hunting group logo crash problem...) which makes the achievement Spread the world the most difficult to achieve at this moment.The PC version seems to be a WIP.The final opinion is if it not necessary DO NOT BUY this game on PC.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I just can't stay connected long enough to even complete one hunt. The connection constantly crashes with different errors everytime even though my network works fine my connection to the web is stable I have a high bandwidth. No fix that I tried could solve this.

It has never looked so beautiful and had so many new additions to make the game smoother from simple quick gathering to quick radial wheel shortcuts to keep hunters in the action.

I recommand waiting for a patch to come out before purchassing this game.Great grafics immersive story and combat mechanics great variety of movesets for each monsters and even greater variety of monsters themselfs.So eventhough i do recommand this game i also think that with the bugs this game is not worth it's price.As soon as it's fixed i can easily place it in my to 10 favorite games!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,31,False,Recommended,The game is grindy monster slaying and giant weapon bashing fun.Take out the ridiculousness of a sword that's twice as long and just as thicc as I am and this game has a genuinely interesting biodiverse area. I love monsters mythological creatures and cryptozoological finds. So this game is perfect for me. I find it genuinely fun to just go around all the areas available and explore and watch everything just live.I mean I also love smashing a giant ugly bat in the face with an axe that turns into a sword that also turns into a smaller sword and shield. So there's that tooPersonally I play alone but there's a great community out there (if you know where to look) of hunters helping each other out and just killing big ol' dudes together. It's fun either way and if you like the idea of ridiculous fights with fiery Tyrannosaurids and Lightning Lizard Wolf Things. Then you'll probably like this game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-25,0,0,86,False,Recommended,Pros Sort of Dark Souls Gameplay you need to learn your enemies movements to improve Good customization and loot Freedom to change weapons at any point Beautiful scenarios and monsters As a biologist really liked the Ecology studies in the game Collecting plants bugs minerals etc. is really easy and fluidCons PC is always a big step behind from consoles (which is the reasons for most downvotes) Sort of repetitive track and kill monster loot improve track and kill bigger monster loot improveIf it fits your style it wont let you down its a damm good game,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-18,0,0,196,False,Recommended,Best Game i played this year. RUINED by the dodgy multiplayer. The amount of disconnects in a multiplayer focused game is not justifiable. FIX IT! Will change the review to positiv once your game is playable.Edit Looks like the last patch fixed all the problems me and my party had. Sure there are still some frame drops but as of now i can only recommend it. Awesome game! Now even in multiplayer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Autumn Sale Update Change to recommend forgot to do before.Wegame version vanished what a shame.MHW disconnect with steam friends system but as a P2P game wouldn t fix it s disconnection XDReally if this game don t have kind of first story line of series I wouldn t even play it repeatedly play just for better item? Not my kind of game. As a Monster Hunter game still the (Not one of the) best monster hunt game. Autumn Sale Update Good Game bad optimization F*** S*** Network service.1. OpmtimizeReally with my own test and manual touch around High Highest Preset I can get a 44 60AVGFPS on the field 75 at cut scene(G sync Cap FPS at monitor framerate.) with i7 5700HQ GTX980M. So compared to Final Fantasy 15(No Optimize at all) it s optimization is great! 2. Network ServiceMaybe I think Capcom just use 1 sever for every corner around world after all 4 player coop is using P2P that hoster as server. Network service cut every few minutes my longest record around 30min 60min? Than you get a nice Network Eorror and become a singleplay game(With Denovo DRM singleplay? Really?). AND ITS WORSE THAN PSN THE END.3. Bad PortWell the final release is not good at all maybe Devs thought they can make a good port PC game. Add a lots of grahpic setting not just pre sets for PS4. Well they just made it bad post poessing effect not changeable at all the none pre sets are GPU or CPU hungry it s good but motion blur we hate it. DOF(Deph of field) is GPU hungry not that hungry like God rays(volumetric light) But every bad port game just don t want you close it I know it s good for cut scene for player to focus at main character but it make mostly bad impack during playing. Bad PC control maybe with more button PC can handle accessories more convenient but this game still just using button mapping keyborad and mouse to controler again like any other bad port game. Smooth and acceleration for mouse is unacceptable.For a most good online singleplay MH game it s good for you. Or maybe they will fix most of them? Capcom are more serious about this game even than Bioharzd(RE4HD DMC4GOTY unplayable for notebooks with none 60Hz screen they just don t care anymore.)Or maybe you can come to China play wegame version it s using a official sever for COOP if you yanks can past GFW D,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,311,False,Recommended,A significant change from the old titles of the series. However one disadvantage is that the game feels dead alot quicker than it used to. In the past there was Low rank High Rank then G rank with new tier of equipment weapons and monsters only in G rank. Tempered monsters (similar to frenzy) makes it feel kinda repetitive. I just wish the game had a longer playtime feel without being too repetitive. Other than that I still loved the game while it lasted.

While it's true that World is definitely easier than previous titles the decrease in difficulty is in my opinion due to the many QOL changes they made. Though easier the game feels so much better to play compared to older titles. And while this game has some issues namely a lack of content there's still a decent amount of things to do. So solo or with friends I highly recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-22,0,0,160,False,Recommended,Game is absolutely amazing.I've never played a MH game before and personally hearing recommendations from personal friends I was estatic to finally get a chance to play one of these game. Coming from playing all three souls games with only keyboard I have always ignored the mouse and from what I've learned it is terrible. After some tinkering with the keybinds I finally got a decent setup to actually play the game. The first thing I noticed was the large difference in the camera system. Although it was initially difficult to get used to it doesn't take long for a normal human being to figure out that hard lock on is actually detrimental since hitting weakpoints is a major gameplay aspect. MH requires precision and learning weapons is part of the charm. These initial hurdles are daunting at first but the rewards are well worth it. Hunting monsters feels epic the map design is stunning and even what seems like menial farming is rather enjoyable. Personally I had very little issues with multiplayer issues but as far as I am aware these issues have little to do with Capcom and more to do with Steam. Although many people have been saying that they have encountered serious bugs I have had only one serious bug and it was solved with a simple restart. In fact most of the people complaining don't seem to mention the more awful parts of the game like the Zorah Magdaros fights which serve no purpose but to bore players the ridiculous plotline or how annoying the handler is although none of these things have a major appreciable effect on the overall experience.tldr please god stop giving this game poor reviews without at first trying your best to get into it. It is understandable if you are frustrated with the shaky multiplayer launch but this is honestly an excellent introduction to the MH series for new players like me and I'm inclined to try further iterations beyond MHW.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

(Autumn sale makes it easier)Compare to older titles there are less content and less over the top weapon visual styles.The controls may not be for everyone.

2018-11-24,0,0,173,False,Recommended,My last Monster Hunter game was MH Frontier in PSP. After years after years the localized series spent exclusively in Nintendo handhelds World was a huge surprise.The world is presented as a living breathing ecosystem than just segmented stages. Massive amount of playstyle choice from the weapons. Playable in single or multiplayer with cute companion that actually useful (the palico).

Sure some of the ""charm"" of the older game is missing but it's not completely gone that's for sure. And it would be nice to have more monsters. But otherwise graphically it looks amazing controls are much smoother and less stiff than before the crafting UI is easier to use the levels feel much more organic. And it's just plain fun to take down giant monsters with a group of hunters. It's not perfect and if you care about story in games it's not going to be anything amazing. Just remember the game isn't really about ""beating"" the game it's just about hunting more monsters in order to get more loot to hunt more monsters.

2018-08-22,0,0,570,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is a great franchise. That being said the franchise has almost always been on a handheld(PSP 3ds) or on a console(PS2 Wii) and the Monster Hunter dev team while under Capcom decided to try porting this game to PC. It's not a great port it's enough to play it but I can understand it since Capcom's porting team may be busy with other bigger titles(DMCV RE2 Remake) coming(which sucks because Monter Hunter feels like it's treated as a black sheep). Hopefully there will be better optimizations for this game and a more stable server(since the disconnections are really bad). Yeah I appreciate their effort porting this to PC but I do hope that they improve further.EDIT F*CK THIS Y EYED SERVERS(September 5 2019)! Disconnections are still there(it got worse). I hate wasting my vouchers and investigations. SO F*CKING FRUSTRATINGEDIT2 As of December 18 2018 the connections have been getting better because now multiplayer matchmaking is somewhat restricted per region and there are somewhat more content(catching up to the PS4) for endgame. Performance is also getting slightly more improved with patches(still needs work but atleast they do address some of it).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-27,0,0,254,False,Recommended,If hunting gigantic monsters with massive weapons in order to craft more weapons and armour from their body parts sounds like fun to you then definitely look into this game. It'll make you question who the monster really is.Having played 4U on 3DS just prior to this this game obviously doesn't have nearly as much content but Capcom also didn't have the benefit of being able to reuse models and textures from previous games here. Things had to be remade from scratch and I think the overall improvement in quality across the board was worth the trade off. Aside from the graphics I found World much easier to get into and understand compared to the handheld titles. Mechanics such as the skill system were streamlined and the UI in general is more user friendly. As a whole it doesn't feel quite as obtuse as the older games though it still takes a little while to get used to.The PC version has been catching up quite nicely to the free DLC consoles have recently. Kulve Taroth set the schedule back a bit but that was understandable given the scale of the fight and the unique mechanics involved. The planned accelerated DLC release plan for PC is back on track as of now. Plenty to come yet with hopefully even more in store past that.It launched on PC with some issues but they have been fixed over time steadily in each patch and some people didn't go back to change their negative reviews afterwards. Connection issues have been fixed raw mouse input is there now for those who want it more graphics option toggles etc. Overall it's in a much better state than at launch but still rather demanding hardware wise if you want to keep at or around 60FPS at a fixed resolution.A solid entry in the series and a decent first effort at a PC version. Looking forward to possibly seeing a G Rank expansion of sorts for this in the new year. There's a lot of room to expand on this excellent base for sure beyond the existing free DLC.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-27,0,0,46,False,Recommended,The story line was a little fun adventure but the combat and hunts on ridiculous scales were what made this game.

2018-08-11,0,0,258,False,Recommended,This game is worth every penny!You pay $40 for a Great game plus all free upcoming DLCs Free DLCs. The only thing you have to pay are emotes but that is not essential. In all the game is free of the pay2win factor that is common in a lot of games nowadays. I've played over 200 hours of this game and i still can't get enough especially with all the new DLCs. Although the Launch of this game isn't great at all CAPCOM sure did learn from their mistakes and fixed everything up fairly fast. So my conclusion is if you wanted to play a game from the Monster Hunter Francise this game is a good starters because it's easily the easiest game of all the Monster Hunter games. And for $40 this game is worth every penny. The only thing that's causing so much hate in the community is the server status but CAPCOM is improving it every time. That's all i can say about the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-28,0,0,17,False,Recommended,This game is an example of a great game but a bad port. Its not well optimized for most pc and its a wonder as to why? The games graphics are stunning but it shouldnt demand as it should as it is a console game ported over. Its a poorly optimized game not the worst but poor the setting puts it at 60fps but if you have a fps meter whilst playing the game you know that its actually 40+ fps most of the time. and frame drops are a usual thing Its a nit pick as its a full price game but such is life. Either way i still recommend and commend Capcom for the pc port its a much needed thing in the MH community it just needs furher tweaks to make it GOTY. They patched how the mouse works in this game which shows they do care for the port. Overall I think this game is a great game. Its Monster Hunter on PC what else could you want.

Some weird design choices in regards to playing co operatively like needing to play story bits solo before you can leave and rejoin the quest with team mates but apart from that just a fairly unique type of game where combat is somewhat slow and deliberate but with a lot of room for both pre planning as well as tactics in the fight itself.Lot's a charm in character expression and decent world building. Semi big zones each different from each other with monster that ramp up both in size and difficulty. Finally lots of depth in regard to gathering materials hunting beasts for parts in order to upgrade gear and armor as well as finding about about weaknesses of your foes in order to craft the right kind of weapon for that fight. Story is more or less in the background and honestly it's not the kind of game you buy for that. The game is in the name.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,199,False,Recommended,Don't let the mixed reviews scare you. Most of those were from optomization issues that have been fixed since the games release. Now to get into the game itself.StoryThe story of this game is nothing to get excited over. All monster hunter games have terrible stories so don't go into this game expecting a good story.GraphicsThis game is a major step up from the older games that mostly appeared on handheld devices so the graphics were terrible. The graphics aren't that detailed so most people can run this game using a decent build but I'm not promising anything.GameplayNow this is where monster hunter shines the most and because of the immense amount of gameplay options in this game I'm going to split this one up.CombatSo the main premise of the game is you kill monsters (duh) and you do it with weapons the size of you. The game has the combat style of dark souls and has tons of weapon choices. It has 14 weapons to choose from each with their distinct play styles. Example being a lance you're going to usually tank the monster and block more than dodge because the lances shield can negate high amounts of damage while using dual blades you will most likely be dodging attacks excessively because of the weapons short range and high dps. I still haven't used all of the weapons in this game because of the variety and skill needed to use them. The combat itself is extremely fun as you hack away at the monster but this game is NOT a hack and slash. Each monster has seperate weaknesses but most have the normal weaknesses head and tail. And some weapons deal more damage to certain parts than other weapons. That's what makes monster hunter great. You're not just beating the life out of a monster in every waking moment. You use quick reactions to dodge monster attacks or block an incoming fireball (I'm looking at you rathalos).MapsThis game does not have a large quantity of maps like the older games did but what makes these maps different is that they are connected to eachother and have immense detail. Other monster hunter games featured boring maps with flat open plains with a couple of ledges. Now in world there are all kinds of obstacles and environmental traps you can use to stun or KO a monster. The maps aren't massive but they aren't small.GearThis game revolves around you constantly updating your equipment beacause there's always something better (until you hit endgame of course). You make gear out of monster parts you either carve off of monsters or recieve as rewards for completing quests and some parts are rarer than others. There's not a large quantiy of craftable armor sets and weapons like there was in the older games but this game simplifies it by making each weapon tree different from eachother. Example being a sword made from a monster that breathes fire would have elemental fire damage while a monster that lives in water would have a sword with water elemental attack.EndgameThis game has a good endgame. Once you are done with the story you can complete quests given to you as your hunter rank increases (basically leveling) or you can do investigations recieved from monster tracks. Investigations differ from normal quests as some things will change and depending on the changes it increases your reward rarity. This gets into the endless RNG grind that comes with this game.GrindingThis game is all about grinding. The endgame consists of grinding jewels basically little things you can attach to armor pieces to level up certain skills. You need some jewels to level up skills you can't get from your armor and so you need to grind these jewels. The only way to get jewels is to fight elder dragons powerful monsters or fight tempered monsters to get better chances at recieving rarer jewels. This is where most people lose interest in this game. If you don't want to fight the same three monsters for hours on end hoping to get lucky and recieve a rare jewel than this is not the game for you.SkillsThis game has a large variety of skills that you level up by equipping certain pieces of gear. This is where customizability comes into this game. You can make tons of builds with every weapon that cater to certain playstyles. Maybe you want to make a build focused on healing your teamates while weilding a sword and shield. Maybe you want to tank the monster while weilding a lance. Or maybe you wan't to be like literally everyone and create a build focused on high dps.So I think I hit almost all the points. I might have missed a few things but this is all I could think of. All in all this is a great game and personally my favorite.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Especially earlier in the game when strong monsters can ruin your day.Are you hunting multiple monsters at once?Are you under a strict time limit?Are you on your last ko before failure?I didn't become interested in the decorations grind assembling a set of elder dragon gear was enough for me.

While overall its not as challenging as the older games and it doesnt have as much monster variety the detail in each monster and enviroment is astouding and blows me away avery time ive played this.

2018-08-26,0,0,344,False,Recommended,I don't think my initial review did this game justice. This game is immersive and engaging in a way that most games simply just can't match. I don't think I've enjoyed and stuck to a game this much in a long time. The skill ceiling is nothing short of incredible but the game doesn't kick your teeth in along the way making it a constantly engaging experience. The only real issues this game has are its absurd hunger for CPU usage and the sometimes underwhelming updates. Having said that though this game is definitely well worth its asking price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,91,False,Recommended,I had never played a MH game before this one but some of my friends were fans of the series and they told me to try this game. As a beginner I wish the game had a better a tutorial it does a poor job of introducing but the Hunter's Journal is extremely useful as it is basically a in game wiki. Despite that I got the hang of it in a couple of hours but the mechanics and variety of weapons and mechanics were a bit overwhelming at the start but in the end that is what gives the game depth and keeps you interested.If you don't mind grinding on a game where the gameplay is very deep and engaging i suggest you give it a go especially if you have a group of friends to play with.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,644,False,Recommended,As a huge fan of MH since 3 Ultimate I absolutely love this game. Despite some talk of the lack of content and stale end game the weekly bounties seasonal festivals and event quests help keep the game alive. Even when I feel i've done it all it still feels fun to play and it is a joy even up to that point. It is also a great MH game for beginners because of the somewhat simplified armor skill system that gives even greater set customization than mixing sets in previous games. In response to the talk about it lacking content 4 monsters have been added to World since it's first release Deviljho Behemoth Kulve Taroth and Lunastra (Kulve Taroth and Behemoth being brand new). The only other time I can think of that a monster that was not present in the base game was added as DLC was White Fatalis in MH4U. and that was the only one. Speaking of DLC one of the other great things about the game is that all DLC is F R E E. The only microtransactions are for cosmetic gestures stickers and outfits for the handler. All events and equipment are free so there is no pay to play or pay for an advantage here. There is also a very high chance that they are working on the G rank expansion for World considering Capcom had said in an interview that they might if the game did well and World is the best selling MH game of all time. There is a possibility that the expansion costs money since the amount of content in G rank usually warrants its own release but we'll have to see. Either way Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game from a fantastic franchise and if you are already familiar with Monster Hunter or think it looks interesting I encourage you to get this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-22,0,0,118,False,Recommended,In my opinion it was worth full price.I didn't no life the main campaign nor did I try to speedrun it. Taking time to explore and do optional stuff I felt as though I was keeping up with the natural pacing the game was going for and I got decent longevity out of it.Found out about the game back in the console beta phase and despite owning a ps4 I decided to wait the extra few months for the PC release. I honestly haven't experienced the issues with the port that many people are reporting. However I cannot speak for users on lower end machines. The network issues have been a very minor hindrance to me. I solo'd the whole game first time around (which admittedly was at launch when most of the connectivity issues occured) but going back through it later with a friend I think I only dropped out once.The game pretty much hits all bases in terms of visuals audio atmosphere and technical aspects. I honestly struggle to find any faults despite perhaps a shallow difficulty in certain areas.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,120,False,Recommended,This review is just for the purposes of covering what's new/improved in the Monster Hunter series over its predecessors. So if you've never played Monster Hunter before you should probably just youtube it and you'll quickly get an idea of what it's about. It's basically hunting monsters to craft gear to hunt even stronger/larger ones.I played almost every iteration of Monster Hunter released in the US beginning from the PSP installments. And yes I even played the Japan only Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. Unfortunately I did not get to experience Monster Hunter Frontier.This latest installment in my opinion is the best one so far. Although this version does not have as many monsters/content as the previous (Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate) there is still a lot to play through.+The graphics are a huge step up and the elimination of area loading is a big relief. +They've removed some annoying tedious issues like forgetting to eat for buffs before embarking on the mission while also introducing some quality of life improvements like fast traveling. +Being able to consume items while moving makes it that much safer and the slingshot is useful addition to every hunter's bag of tricks. +The item wheel is such useful UI upgrade and makes selecting the right item that much faster.+Although Monster Hunter never really had rich storylines and characters this is the 1st time NPC characters have a voice instead of the usual grunts in the previous installments so at least you some kind of meaningful connection with the characters. +In some of the past games they excluded some weapon types in one installment and then some other ones in a different installment. It's a shame to see one of your favorite weapons go missing and you're just forced to try something else. But this time around I'm glad they've kept all the weapon types. They gave each of them some new and interesting moves while also providing a balance between the weapons like having more flexible methods of doing jumping attacks (this mechanic was mostly exlusive to the insect glaive in the past games).What I would like to see is more variety of weapons and armor and for them to bring back is the ability to control your Palico and go on missions. I know a lot of people did not like the underwater mechanic in Monster Hunter Tri but I would also like to see that come back as well but only if they can somehow improve the movement/camera. And finally of course more monsters from the previous installments.I am glad the Monster Hunter series has gained an enormous amount of popularity as it was a very niche game in its younger days. I hope even more people discover and enjoy this series as it is truly unique and wonderful game. Happy Hunting everyone!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It was a very different experience from the beginning to already have a solid grasp on mechanics and the patterns of the monsters.Still I enjoyed it just as much even though in a different way. I never got tired of the world. The various locales and their individual arenas keep fights interesting and fun. Even when things seem to get too easy you can always challenge yourself to use a different weapon you haven't used much before.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,102,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is probably my game of the year. I bought it for my ps4 and sunk over 100 hours in it there and then once it finally launched on PC I happily put another 100 down on the table. The game has its flaws e.g. the fact that the end game is very weak but despite that the ride to the top is fun all the way up. This entry in the series is extremely beginner friendly and fluidity takes center stage in all of the quality of life adjustments made for a wider audience. While these adjustments may make the game easier in comparison to the previous titles most of that ease is derivitive of many small mechanical tweaks as opposed to actual monster dificulty. If you were interested in the Monster Hunter series before but found the older games tedious and hard to get into and understand I would HIGHLY recommend picking the series up again here.All in all this game is a lot of fun and a good time with friends especially. And just to be clear on the coop when it comes to story quests multiplayer IS possible but the ability to have others join your hunt is based solely upon whether or not everyone is caught up to the host story wise. To get around this most people will play a mission solo and once the game tells them the the SOS Flare is ready to use they abandon the quest or return to base. The game will more or less checkpoint you past the cutscene and you can then play the rest of the mission with friends.TLDR Its good. I would say its worth it at full price but slapping this into your wishlist for a sale later wouldn't hurt.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-14,0,0,294,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World has many things going for it to make it equal and in some aspects even better than it's predecessors. Mechanically the game has many quality of life choices such as easier gathering of materials which make it less tedious to manage items and materials. The combat also feels slightly smoother and there are many combos and finishers to use so it's hard to do something completely right or wrong only better.Design wise the monsters are fine. In Monster Hunter Generations for example there were soap scrubbing foxes lightning dynamo wyverns and a freaking rocket powered dragon. Compared to that MH World has a lot to prove and while the newer monsters are certainly not boring most don't leave as big of an impact as the ones mentioned before.The new scoutfly mechanic isn't so bad either. It doesn't really make it any easier to find a monster compared to earlier installments with their paint ball mechanics it's again just less tedious. I'm hoping for some special quests where the scoutflies can't directly track the monster even after finding its tracks and the player must actually follow the tracks and their intuition to follow the creature. But as of now it's good since the meat of the game is in combat.Visually and sensationally the game is stunningly beautiful. The lands feel large believable and alive with its little animals many pathways turf wars and day and night cycle. It also feels dynamically interactive when the player can pull many tricks besides flinging a sword such as dropping boulders on monsters and jumping from liana to liana to topple the beast. Never have I felt more to being in the game world as a hunter insted of controlling one.Currently the game lacks the (in)famous G rank (AKA ultimate end game) but it's supposed to be released Autumn 2019 (for consoles later for PC). Either buy the game then or get it now and start preparing for the future challenges.I recommend this game as a small time veteran. It is a Monster Hunter game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I really liked previous games and this one really was a change of pace especially because it was on PC chich was a relief for me because i didn't want to buy a console just to play one game. Anyways the game is really enjoyable weither it is hunting alone with friends or just with any other player i'd really recommande it for anyone.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-14,0,0,185,False,Recommended,Monster hunter world has been one of the top games for me in 2018.Definitely a game to play with friends DHere are my thoughts of the game after 161hrs of gameplay.Positives The environment can be utilised when fighting monsters which is something i dont often find in games similar to this. For instance some trees can be used to make traps and some boulders can be used to knock out the monster. All of the monsters in the game have their own personality which means that each encounter is different. This allows for different reactions when playing of which could be from the type of weapon used or the amount of health left. The game is under constant development which means that there are alot of fixes in the game which allows for a smoother and better expereince. Events are a fun way to introduce different monsters werapons and armour into the game. They appear quite often which means that you are always doing something differnt in teh game instead of grinding the same monster over and over again. You can choose to play alongside others or play independantly which allows for a change in playstyles (i.e. parts breaker (Hammer) attributes booster (Hunting horn) etc...)Negatives You need to put a fair amount of time into the game to get to some of the more powerful loot which means that you have to be prepared to fight the same monster over and over again. If you want to play with your friends make sure that you go through the cut scenes first. I found this quite frustrating at the start of the game when i wanted to encounter the monster with my friends however had to either leave or slay the monster. Getting decorations in the game can be quite envigorating at times. I wish I could get more attack jewels but they are so hard to come accross. When you start fighting high tear monsters you get a chance to get jewels which can enhance your armour and character however there is a very low chance of getting what you want. Admittedly the game can get quite boring if played alone. This my personal opinion but i found the game to feel quite repetative when playing alone.Overall I would highly recommend the game and give it a rating of 8/10.For anyone new or returning to the monster hunter franchise i would strongly recommend giving it a go!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-22,0,0,117,False,Recommended,By far one of the greatest games to play with friends. I have been a huge fan of monster hunter since monster hunter 3 Ultimate for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The monster variety is pretty good and they are still updating to bring more and more. Even if the menus look cluttered they have a very good structure and pretty good control over everything. There is a lot of talk about the keyboard + mouse not being great but I've used it since it launched I only tweaked it a bit and it worked without any problem.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It might be because I don't play it alone..my boyfriend plays and although my friends play on PS4 and we can't play it together we still talk and share in our experiences over it. It had a bit of difficulty and frustration in the beginning for me but after experimenting with the different weapon type choices and landing on one that worked well for me the gameplay felt massively different and better. I definitely advise testing out all the choices! The Palicos are cute AF and don't forget to pet ol' Poog miester when you see him.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-31,0,0,455,False,Recommended,"Been playing Monster Hunter since Freedom 2. Gotta say mechanically speaking this is the best and smoothest Monster Hunter. This is also the most beginner friendly Monster Hunter as the learning curve isn't as steep as previous titles and the game cuts the crap and throws you straight into the action!The Good +Visually beautiful. Finally we aren't staring at small screens with low poly visuals anymore.+Some of the music is quite memorable.+Armor designs look awesome.+Character creator is quite stellar.+Monsters look feel and move as if they were alive.+Gameplay controls of movement and combat are tight much more responsive than previous titles.+Weapons have new movesets or have been reworked and feel so much better now!+Level design of each map is amazing. Areas are seamless and have multiple elevations. They are also packed with ecology and wildlife. The maps feel alive. Big props especially to the Ancient Forest cause that map really gives off them Jurassic Park vibes. Even after over 200 hours I still get lost in that map.+Many quality of life changes making gaming experience smoother.+UI is actually quite nice in this instalment.+Tonnes of replay value.+Many armor and weapons to collect to create builds that fit your playstyle Play how you want basically.+RNG for monster parts is generous as you can meld rare drops such as plates and gems if you're unlucky.+The grind is fun. It's not the tedious mmo type of grind but the ""hard work pays off"" type of grind.+Palicos themselves have quite a few options for customization including weapons armor and skills.The Bad Online was broken at launch (however it's fixed now). Unintuitive online solution (If you're just starting you'll have to wait for your friend to finish watching the story cutscene before you can actually join their game). Much less content compared to previous instalments. The amount of monsters is poor compared to Freedom Unite. There is also a severe lack of monster variety as most monsters in World are reptiles whereas previous games had giant bugs such as Seltas Vespoid Queen Nerscylla or apes such as Congalala Rajang or crabs like Daimyo and Shogun Cenataurs and the list goes on. Weapon designs need a serious overhaul. Most weapons look boring and the same design wise and only change a few times within the weapon tree. Decoration RNG is pain and Hero and Warrior stone drop rates are too low. Some lategame monsters are super cheap with their roars or tremors where they will get a free cheap shot at you since they will finish their roar/tremor attack before your recovery animation finishes forcing you to spec at least a few slots in Tremor resist or Earplugs. Story if you're a gamer who plays games for the story then Monster Hunter is not for you.Conclusion If you like methodical combat and a gameplay loop of grinding and earning better equipment on the go while learning the monster and culling it faster next run then this game is for you. There is tonnes of content and it's definitely bang for your buck.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Ignore the first hour negative reviews do a little research then hopefully enjoy the game.If you have an old CPU you're going to have problems. It's unfortunate but that's the case. I have an i5 7400 and an RX 480 and don't have any issues whatsoever and the game looks and plays about on the same level as my PS4 Pro on a 4K TV after adjusting the settings a little bit.I will say I have a measly 16 9 monitor so I do understand the frustration with no ultra widescreen support. Controllers work fine. I used my Steam Pro and Xbox One controllers and neither had any issues working complete with button prompts on screen and everything. It's all good.Even the mouse and keyboard is serviceable. The mouse camera works just fine. It's definitely not optimal overall but I can't imagine enjoying this with M+K regardless of how optimized it could be.Anyway the actual game is fantastic and I've played over 300 hours on PS4 already and still had no qualms about double dipping here at full price. Well worth your money if you're a fan of MH or Phantasy Star or other similar co op questing games.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-10,0,0,198,False,Recommended,As far as these grindy loot table based crafting rpgs go MHW might easily be the best one.Effectively it's a boss rush game with like 30 or so bosses you fight over and over again under increasingly specific parameters. There's usually 2 4 monsters that spawn everytime you load into a map and you go out there and gather and explore and hunt. What makes it great is the mechanical variety and complexity. It's an action game your weapon has a moveset associated with it sorta like Devil May Cry. You try to use your weapon and the environment around you to so as much damage as possible while not dying. You can fight with a bow. You can fight with a bigass buster sword. You can fight with a polearm that lets you fly into the air and do anime moves. You can fight with a sword and shield that then transform together into a giant axe. You can fight with a set of bagpipes and play music. There's like 12 weapons here. They're all awesome.Did I mention you literally fight monsters by playing bagpipes? This is literally the only game with a viable bard class. There's 4 player online coop which is very easy to get into. The only problem is with story missions where you won't be able to group for one until you watch a story cutscene. Bizarre limitation but most of your missions won't be story ones so not too big a deal.... just pretty annoying tho.Highly recommend. It's not very well optimized. My 10 year old build only gets 30 45 fps on this even with everything turned down. I can run mid high settings without changes to framerate. Kinda weird tbh.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If you go into this game not wanting to grind then you're just gonna drop this title in a matter of hours or days.RNG isn't friendly and you'd swear it was psychic and designed to specifically give you things you don't want. So if you want to make the perfect set tailored to your favorite play style you may sink in a couple hundred hours.Anyone new to the Monster Hunter franchise should solo each boss to get a general grasp on the movement patterns and find a play style they like. However if that doesn't sound appealing you could easily just whack monsters with friends. But learning the monster's attacks would take longer.I personally would give it a 7/10 and I really like this game but giving it a higher rating might be bias.There's just not much to do after you reach the end game other than farming stuff you want which is fun for me.

It's a great game The gameplay is nice The Story ? pretty much none ofcourse there is some only that you gotta know why godzilla is there or some The game focus on you in killing things over and over again.Because the 5 stars goes for the gameplay its the most repetitve yet fun thing ever.You dodge you strike you eat you die.At first ofcourse you fight your sponge bread enemies that die quick and they show you how useless you are when you die by one hit in a mistake early with tougher enemies.There is no level system Your armor is your Level. You want to look cool and be good at the same time ? Nope.There is this skill set armor that you gotta have two or three or even the entire set of armor to get such skill.It might be good but every piece of armor as a unique set of skills with them too. And they may or not suit your build.Some of their design will want you to puke but if you wanna be good at the game You gotta turn your character into a disgusting mess of fashion. Pray that they implement Transmog for free in the game ( which they did for console but not PC for some BS reason )There is early mid and HighEnd stages and gear. Meaning that there is a scale of dificulty for some it's hard as bricks others a walk in the park if you followed the guide of Piccolo over his years training Gohan.( Dodge ) The ending of the game ? Yeah... What ending ? That doesn't exist here its Monster hunter bro what did you expect !? Darksouls criptic storyline ? Nooooo that doesn't exist in Capcom.but its nice of them to update like every month or so with a new thing or event every week.Lets not talk about the DLC or the emoticons or VOUCH TO CHANGE YOUR CHARACTER LOOKS !Personally I make my characters as UGLY as I can but if you spend 600+ hours in a game you would like to see something you like than something you regret.But to make something as simple as changing character looks be locked behind a pay wall is just discusting of Capcom.I expected better And with a better understanding that going GLOBAL with this franchise means that their methods might be flawed but in one word... Japan... It's monster hunter it sells but their idea of everything even the emoticons should be behind a pay to get just tells me that my 60 bucks for them wasn't enough. Also... I thought the word ""WORLD"" meant All the monsters of the franchise... yeah no that is not happening it seems.Gameplay 4/5 ( flaws here Flaws there its not perfect )Graphics 4/5 ( Lack of vivid colors yet nice )Story 2/5 ( it's really a 1 because you don't give a damn after the half of the game in you are just in to kill monsters)Future content 5 / 5 ( really they are events every week and every month or so a new monster )Replay 5 / 5 ( You are in....

2018-12-31,0,0,66,False,Recommended,So i recently bought this game like 3 days ago and been playing the hell out of it. The combat is so smooth and you can feel the weight behind the weapons and a variety of class/weapons to choose from (More to come hopefully in the new Ice World Expansion) When i first found out that you can have pets wondering around in your very first room i was very happy about that just the little things that make the game fun The housing system is pretty neat. If you just want to make your own class up you pretty much can just make traps for monsters then capture them which is awesome. The graphics are 9/10 Only reason is the half As*ed looking Sky box. I only had 1 probaly getting DCED from a match due to Alt Tabbing so don't Alt Tab. This game can be frusterating at time but feel so rewarding after you come back and whoop the monsters as* that's been killing you. Also as a person that had a PSP when i was little and had (I Forgot which Monster hunter was on PSP) But i had no idea what i was doing But now it's on PC i can experince those fun times once again. The controls for keyboard aren't the best but as a fast learning person i got use to them in no time (I Use a Orb Weaver Chroma). I can write so much more why this game is simply amazing. I'm going to continue playing the hell out of thisALSO Ignore the people writing negative reviews and complaing instead of finding fixes for the game then refunding it They're the type of people that play a game and find a bug and don't report it to the devs.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-29,0,0,411,False,Recommended,Avid Monster hunter fan. Played Monster Hunter on PS2 along with a few PSP versions and then quit. Picked this up later thanks to a friend and have been enjoying it eversince. I'll make this a list of pros and cons.Pros Variety. You have so many weapons to choose from and they all play different nothing feels the same. You have to relearn monster movement patterns for every new type due to different attack timers. This on top of the different monsters and their movements makes this game feel new every time. You have so many different sets you can build depending on what you enjoy.Amount of content The amount of things you have to do in this game is absurd. The monsters you can hunt armor sets you can get and the free added content while at times lackluster brings you back to this game over and over again.Visuals While the old monster hunter games have a more cartoon y esque style. This one comes with updated good looking visuals fit for the pc. CONTROLLER controls These feel smooth. Steam works perfectly with my DS4 and I never find myself being bothered even by the default setup.Mini game While this is not needed it just adds an extra layer to the already vast world. You can collect pets and have them in your room whilst not needed. It's just additional fun that has come seemingly at no cost to the games quality.Cons RNG I would not be honest if I didn't mention this one. The farming for some decorations is ridiculous and way past what I find enjoyable. You could be playing this game for a thousand hour and never see that one item you need to finish your perfect set. Frame rate drops While this is part of any game. It bothered me mostly when there is a lot of things going on on the screen and your frame rate just tanks. Kushala daora is the prime example of this with his winds although. It's rare.Multiplayer Now this is more of a personal thing. It's a bit of a shame that the amount of times you can faint is the same be it multiplayer or singleplayer. It has been like this in the pervious games but here it just hurts more. If I know I can finish a hunt or at least do better alone. Why would I play multiplayer? There is no incentive past the actual interaction sadly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,104,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter world does not deserve the current ""Mixed"" review status it currently has. On its launch there were a few technical problems for people some optimization issues and the biggest offender was the instability of the multiplayer. As pc gamers the way multiplayer was handled was less than ideal with the vast majority of games being able to use steam to join/invite your friends or a server browser with built in steam functionality to locate friends on servers. I have to respect capcom in thier attempt to finally bring monster hunter to the PC. This specific team was not responisble for PC monster hunter games (Monster Hunter Online &amp Monster Hunter Frontier) and as such it is a solid attempt and I appreciate it. This game will pave the road for Capcom to more reliably release PC games at a higher quality. Think Dragons Dogma 2 which will probably benefit alot from the release of this game whether its on a technical level optimization level or business level. This game does not deserve all the bad reviews it got.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-24,0,0,124,False,Recommended,The gameplay mechanics are extremely tight and consistent. They allow for many situations of emerging gameplay where a player can fine tune their approach to combat by using the environment coupled with their character aptitudes.The monsters are tough but present a more than fair learning curve allowing players to eventually master their strategies when fighting the various monsters.The environments are grandiose and breathtaking. The visual quality and aesthetic of this game is without a doubt in my top 3 of the year.Performance is now extremely smooth after a rough start upon release. Framerate and connectivity issues have been completely stamped out by an evidently hard working and dedicated team of devs.Weapon variety and a classless system ensures players can always look forward to mastering a new aspect of this game.Honestly this is by far my favorite game released in 2018. I played it on PS4 and bought it again on PC to play with different friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

THIS IS THE IN GAME POTION USE ANIMATION DURING COMBAT?!?! WTF!?!?!(this obviously lends itself to problematic combat situations)MANY times you will be drinking a potion reloading or other taskunable to prevent a monster from doing MAJOR damage.YOU cannot stop some animations BUT the monster attack WILL stop your animation preventing potion use or reload.the good new you never 'die' just faint and wake quickly at your camp.the monster still were you left it and it's health still depleted....2) many quest/task you cannot quit save leave or even shutdown.this is likely an attempt to force players to work together and hinder 'rage quit'.most quest are timed many around 50min.so what are your options to 'end' a 50min quest you don't like A. 'faint' x number of times then get a fail...B. or wait 50 min to get a fail.lame annoying absolutely WILL instill some distaste for the developers....multiplayer can be fun and make combat MUCH easier but finding help is not easy. rarely do people answer calls for help....co op play is beautiful and very easy to set up session only for friends....overall a GREAT game.just give it some time engage in LOTS of combat early on to master your combat skills.this wont preven the animation blues but it will make combat more enjoyable.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Specially for big quest like KT or XENO etc. thers always players waiting to join you. I just wish that it would apply to all hunt's cause sometimes it gets lonely out there. Recent updates for PC seems to have turned the game around since the game launched.(Major disconnection during the PC launch CAPCOM has already stated this issue since the launch) The connection issue has been better also CAPCOM has been adding more in game events and festivals. Autum Christmas Cross game quests and out fits etc.I believe there's much more to come for MHW so if you like the game series or just starting out the game will offer you much more.Join a community get in a group have fun and hunt together.Lone wolf such as my self made some friends through this game ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monster Hunter es era y sera el juego mas vicioso de todos los tiempos ya que cuenta con una gran variedad de monstruos y con todos puedes hacerte skins . Empezando desde el principio este juego es un juego trama wow trama black desert con la unica diferencia que no es open world y no hay multiplayer masivo ES complicadito de entender y poco de gustar un juego japones donde todo lo que ves te hace preguntarte 'Y ESTO QUE COJONES ES ' back en psp no havia traduccion con lo cual todo era en idioma japonez y los usuarios como yo y miles siempre estaban en comunicacion ya que en youtube no habia una gran comunidad para este juego y menos en cuba q la internet es un mito Monster hunter es un juego donde la unica mission es matar monstruos de la mitologia japonesa monstruos bien creados para que luzcan unicos con los cuales al destruir al monstruo vencerlo por asi llamarlo te puedas llevar como premio su piel y partes de su cuerpo NO GRAFICA MENTE con esto lo que consigues es mejores armas mejores ropas mejores puntos junto con tigo te acompana un pequeno gatico el cual ayuda en la batalla de cierta manera en los tiempos de antes eran 2 gatos ahora son 1 ya que ahora se juega mas multiplayer y si son 4 jugadores seria algo estupido tener solo 8 gatos 4 players contra un solo monstruo . Volviendo a la forma de crear skins Cuando escojes un mounstro para hacerte espadas arcos ropa etc tienes qu ematarlo mas de una ves ya que una sola ves no te alcanza para armadura ropa y todo lo cual te lleva a muchas muchas horas de juegoe n un solo mounstro y hace que sea un juego mp . En esta ultima version del 2018 yo no vi nada nuevo que no allla visto solo un par de monstros nuevos y mejores graficos pero la trama sigue siendo la misma es un juego lleno de colores y diversion y cosas por descubrir en el cual te vas a divertir bastante jugando con amigos eso es si tienes claro,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I am using a keyboard + mouse because I don't have my controllerPros Game is a lot less tedious compared to the previous two (unlimited resources free fast travel multiple camp locations item box in camp etc) Visually pleasing and optimized to an acceptable level Big maps Voice chat (no more typing on a Wii remote or a DS hurray!)Cons Player lobbies feel disconnected (literally due to the fact that I disconnected from lobbies 80% of the time I joined) compared to the previous two which had up to 4 people max in a room. No one interacted with each other. Confusing minimap. It has too much information and feels crowded. Crashed on me once Main hub should have the essentials near each other on floor one (smith and canteen) I can't believe I almost forgot about this. Unskippable LONG cutscenes are unacceptable!

Pros extensive monster list multiplayer lots of weapons and armor visually appealing diverse gameplayCons menus are a mess keybindings by default are abyssmal option menus are hard to understand can be quite tiltingMy first impression of the game was extremely poor. The controls were a mess default settings were for controller overall the game felt extremely bad. I tried to play with my friend who got it for me but every minute only reinforced how clunky and uncomfortable the game was to play. I tried messing with the settings to fix things but the menus are filled with things like ""Control Layout Type 1"" There are three types and yet none of them have any elaboration as to what's different whats better for keyboard/mouse what's better for controller if one is for left handers etc.In short I hated the game. It was a chore to play trying to work out the controls and reset what needed resetting. The pinnacle of unplayabilty lay in the mouse movement emulating a controller stick rather than being raw input. I searched and searched for an answer and found nothing until I found the small setting for ""mouse camera style Type 1."" In desperation I set it to type 2 not knowing what would change but hoping it would help. Suddenly the problem was solved my mouse was on raw input and I could actually play without hating the game.It's still quite difficult the keybindings are quite tangled up and there are a lot of small changes I need to make before the game feels smooth.

2018-12-02,0,0,104,False,Recommended,This is a review of the game up through the ending creditsPros Excellent graphics and level design. Lots of quality of life improvments from previous MH titles far greater weapon balance then expected from a non pvp game A suprisingly large amount of pure story contentCons Unskippable cutscenes Uncanny valley to a level I had no idea could exist in this world Bad steam interfacing and overlays that pop up all the time multiplayer instancing causes players to have a very limited amount of content they can engage in at any given moment over matchmaking Quests where you are expected to just wander around collecting tracks for an excessive amount of time. This is incredibly boring and frustrating especially since it is clearly playtime padding. Overall Its fun but requires patience and a willingness to engage in game mechanics that may seem unfamiliar to the average player. Rewards preparedness but if you just want to go into a mission and hit things with your sword you may end up having trouble completing the game without a team of people to carry you. Despite its grindiness I felt pretty well rewarded after each mission with each new piece of gear I was aiming for steadily being granted to me without too much fuss. Arenas and events are also quite fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

For those that dont know G rank is not just another difficulty mode it's a whole new game. Usually hundreds of new monsters and maps weapons and armors. I run this game at 1440p 144fps synced frames.

There are some discisions that are probably better off being reversed (like some boring weapons designs to save development time) but otherwise this is a massive technical leap forward for the series.

2018-11-22,0,0,256,False,Recommended,Did you like Dark Souls' boss fights but not the rough slog between them? Do you run boss rush mod and want to fight things with big HP counts and feel awesome when you win? Monster Hunter World is a great game to do so in. There are 14 different weapon categories that all play wildly different from each other and even change your playstyle between weapons of the same category. Combat feels good and you are rewarded for good position and reading monster's attacks to find openings and are punished for wildly spamming attack with no plan.The game is very grindy by design and trying to 100% can take anywhere from 100 hours to over 1000 depending on how lucky you are with crowns and monster size. Only downside is the PC version is not up to parity with the consoles and both versions need more monsters to reinvigorate interest after a few hundred hours of play time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The monsters the weapons the music they alone make this game a masterpiece in which you can invest hundreds of hours and still want to keep on hunting.There where a few issues at the beginning of the release on PC but now it works perfectly fine and we should be grateful to got such a great port for this game.It brought me to the monster hunter franchise and made it one of my favorites right behind Dark Souls.So try it play it master it if you like big weapons epic fights and always want to get better this is your game!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Tapping the sprint button every second or so sees the frametime bursting through the roof and plummeting down again.This bug and the fact that Capcom didn't even acknowledge the issue yet despite many players having it (no fix in the 21 dec update) makes me not want to play this game on PC anymore.Can't recommend the game in its current state.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Negative reviews are due to DRM motion blur and raw mouse movement all petty complaints which shouldnt be a deal breaker for most people. with so much depth in a game the price is easily justified moments such as a rathalos swooping in to attack the monster youre meant to be killing and watching the two battle it out can be amazing to witness. The first few hours are slow but the game dramatically gets better as you start to understand the mechanics. Playing friends is a blast same with simply hoping in a helping a random finishing a boss. However it is tedious to play with friends at the start as story missions are practically forced upon you ( you can only join a friend once you've both seen the cutscene) also the graphics are phenomenal among the best i've seen in a game now you may think this also leads to a beefy PC being required to actually run the game however my friend can perfectly play the game with his gtx 950.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Clunky controls and camera work (alongside some PC port problems such as motion blur always on no widescreen support fps spikes) hinder the fun at times but it's bearable once you put in enough time and patience to get used to it.Do I recommend this game? Yes I definitely do.Do I recommend this game in it's current state on the PC? Not at all.The connectivity issues alongside with the iffy port makes it really hard to recommend this game.Only get this if you're not planning to play multiplayer at all and even then maybe stick to the console version unless you have a really beefy PC,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-23,0,0,228,False,Recommended,This game's gameplay is great it looks pretty good and I had fun with it. So then you may be asking why are you not recommending it? You see there's one big problem the PC port is strictly inferior to the console release. The consoles have had 3 festivals 4 new monsters several new arch tempered monsters new weapons and the ability to change how your character looks. What has PC gotten? 1 monster the Deviljho and 1 arch tempered monster (which is just the Deviljho again.) There is simply no reason to buy this game on PC as of the time of reviewing except for the mods because Capcom can't update their games in a timely manner and the fans needed to fix it. If you want MH go buy World on PS4 or XB1 or go play Generations Ultimate on the Switch. I will update this review if the state of this game changes but until then don't buy this.Edit Since my writing of this review the game has been updated much faster with Behemoth being added on 12/21/2018 finally bringing the PC version on par with the console versions. As such I can now recommend purchasing this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-25,0,0,221,False,Recommended,This was my first Monster Hunter game I have ever played and I cannot recommend it more! It is pretty forgiving and easy to start at the beginning but immediatly gets harder when you face your first few bigger encounters (looking at you Anjanath P).Now why should you pick up this game? You can solo nearly every monster or just have fun as a 4 man party while still being effective! There are a variety of weapons which seems a bit overwhelming at first but getting used to them doesnt take long. The game is updated on a regular basis with new free monsters gear and other kinds of cosmetics. There are a plenty of VERY HELPFUL and cool/fun mods that can make your journey in the New World even MORE enjoyable! The connectivity issues have been fixed a long time ago tho sometimes you might get kicked out of the lobby (this doesn't happen too often!)There are some Cons tho for example The PC version of the game is very late compared to PS4 and Xbox which means that we sometimes dont get a cool new addition as early as the others The game isnt perfectly optimized which makes some scenarios very annoying (too many Tornados &gt Potato FPS)In Conclusion everyone should give this game a try dont be scared to play this Monster Hunter game just because the other entries were different!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I hope Capcom is gonna realize (since the game reached the expected sales for a whole year in less than 2 months on PC) that this game could be the future.

2018-12-21,0,0,183,False,Recommended,"Impossible not to recommend Monster Hunter World is deep action packed nuanced entertaining challenging and also pretty relaxing when you want it to be since you can go fishing bug hunting or plant gathering.The ""leveling"" system whereby you gain advantages mainly by crafting new gear is a fantastic system it keeps you just under powered enough for every fight that nothing is every a straight breeze and there's always a reason to go out on another hunt the monsters themselves are an absolute triumph of sound and visual design with some of the best animations and character of any enemies I've ever faced in gaming. It's fantastic with friends daunting but enticing solo and (depending on your luck) a good jaunt with random hunters. There's a great sense of community here if you look for it and I've regularly been helped on tricky quests by high ranked hunters who clearly just wanted to help out.There's plenty of regular updates with new quests or monsters and even more coming with a huge update planned for the future it does get a bit grindy once you've completed the main quest line since there's an element of randomness to rewards but I personally don't mind it at least not yet anyway as if you're feeling a bit tired of one weapon you can always start mastering another and crafting gear sets to try out new tactics. Incidentally the weapons are an utter blast to use with heavy hitting hammers and greatswords that need careful timing to deal massive damage quick swinging longswords and dual blades that bestow you the immense power of anime lances that can block even the most devastating of attacks or the gunlance that can poke and boom ranged weapons like the bow or bowgun that change up your fighting style completely a sword and shield that you can wiggle your heart out with the insect glaive that gives you a little bug buddy to gather bonuses from the monster and can propel you into the air for maximum monte or the hunting horn which can provide buffs to you and your team through the power of dooting.This is a fantastic game well worth your time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,315,False,Recommended,"Despite the imense and I mean IMENSE hate on this game in the first few weeks/months of launch Monster Hunter World is an amazing game and continues to get even better. With the recent addition of Lunastra the Arch Tempered Kirin (A Hard As Hell Smash Multiple Controllers/Keyboards Enemy) on the way and the Winter Festival just beyond it feels like MHW is really booming. If you've been hesitating to get this game because of some bad reviews about connection/network errors bugs etc. (Most of which I've personally never experienced by the way) don't. Seriously. With MHW's release came a bunch of kinks and screw ups which is understandable considering the game we're talking about here. However Capcom delivered hugely after the fact. As of right now Capcom has released many fixes and patches to get rid of any error players were having previously and at the same time has been cranking out new fresh and amazing content. All in all Capcom has probably made the most incredible comeback for a game in the past decade (I actually wouldn't know considering Insert obligitory ""I'm only an adolencent teenager"" sentence here but I do know that it's quite spectacular nonetheless). Now then if you thought that was the end of my review you have another thing coming A slightly small probably insufficient summary of MHW.Now in my somewhat limited experience with MHW I would say it's a really good game and has just about every good element in a game like this. If you're a big fan of the MH franchise then you are bound to love this. Short intermission first though I literally play this game at 20 25 FPS on basically the lowest settings since I have a potato for a PC (At least for this game) but I loved the game so much that I ignored the bad frame rate and pushed through. I still play the game a lot even after beating the main story dispite this.THAT BEING SAID IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS LISTED FOR THIS GAME AND THINK YOU'LL BE FINE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME. (That is if you can't handle a constant 20 fps like I can)Now that's out of the way. I've actually seen this game on my sister's PC which is much better so I'll use that for reference. Graphics wise this game is GORGEOUS. Seriously. If you can crank up your settings a little bit without sacrificing more than 5 fps DO IT. If not the game still looks pretty good on lower settings. Mechanics. The fighting mechanics in this game. . . don't even get me started. *Clicks Tongue* Noice. There are so many different weapons and styles of fighting that you're basically guaranteed to find something you like. The different attacks for each weapon can usually be flown right into each other allowing for a huge amount of combo opportunity. In short you can always just use Switch Axe and do the infinite attack combo where you can LITERALLY ATTACK AS LONG AS YOU HAVE STAMINA. Why? Because why the F not? (Sorry no F bombs from me. Not even text. Just read it with the ""f***"" if you wan oh sh*t. . . DAMNIT) CONTINUING. If you aren't too happy with how long the battles last (Somtimes up to 30 or MORE minutes!) then this game might get boring fast for you. The first few bosses will rarely take you more than 10 15 minutes but once you get far enough you'll notice that sometimes this game is a reflection of life UNFAIR AS F***. You'll spend 30+ minutes killing a damn monster only to die 3 times or run out of time. (The x3 deaths being more likely) That being said the satisfaction of finally killing (or capturing never forget you can capture too) the monster after that long is like having your first REDACTED . . . and then finishing with an equally satisfying REDACTED only to go again and again because you realized you have to kill the damn monster 5 more times AT LEAST. Got it? Good. Because each new monster you kill and each new height of achievement you reach will feel like that. Seriously though despite my joking around Monster Hunter World is probably one of the most antisipated most satisfying most gruelling and most amazing game of our time. If you aren't sold now I don't know what to say other than you must either 1. Not like MH or games like this for that matter OR 2. You didn't read a damn thing I said which looking back on my review now I understand. It's long as hell and I should have just said this 10/10 Get the game now. K Thx Bye.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-10,0,0,186,False,Recommended,Awesome game with challenging combat and fun to use weapons. Art style and graphics look very good. Sound is great although the Japanese/MHW language is probably the best voice acting. In depth game mechanics that sometimes requires grinding to get the right element matchup on monsters.Had a blast for the first 100 hours of the game completed the story (Xeno'jiva) at 40ish. Started slowing down in terms of fun after that due to grinding for gems armor and a bunch of different weapons. But at that point I'd gotten my money's worth and was starting to min/max builds or try new weapon types.Cons Grinding in the endgame (getting tails or monster gems can be a ) the combat can get repetitive could use more monsters to expand varity as well as more maps and HR grinding to hit HR100 can take a while. (I'm 85 with 170 hours)Solid 8.5 or 9/10. Not a must buy but definitely a pickup for action RPG fans. Sidenote Game is much better with friends/online play.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

As a note on a scale from no grind at all to Black Desert Monster Hunter World sits somewhere in the middle. Gems which are usually the rarest and last thing you need for armor and weapons have multiple chances to drop per fight ranging from 2% 16% under certain conditions To bring memes into the review Monster Hunter World is ""Just like Dark Souls"" when you consider that your skill with your chosen weapon will be the largest determining factor for how well you perform.

2018-11-21,0,0,266,False,Recommended,I've been a fan of Monster Hunter since Freedom Unite for the PSP and after waiting forever for this game to come to PC and putting in quite a few hours into the game I can say even though it doesn't feel like it has as much content as some previous Monster Hunter games it's still incredibly fun. The polish and streamlining of many systems definitely make the game feel like less of a hassle to play at times and while I've seen many reviews and comments complaining about network issues I can at least say that I myself have not had any problems up until this point.You fight monsters alone or with friends get materials and make weapons and armor and that's about the gist of it. You should know immediately if that sounds like it's up your alley or not. Probably half my hours at the time of writing this (260 hrs) are single player a quarter with irl friends and a quarter with randoms and that should be enough time to say that whatever way you choose to play getting through all the content is definitely quite fun and doable. So don't worry too much if you don't have anyone else to play with I still quite recommend this even as a single player experience.All in all probably one of my favorite releases in 2018 and definitely one that I've put the most hours into.

Being pretty new to the monster hunter series myself playing almost only this one and just a bit of monster hunter 4 ultimate this genre really is something. This is one of the best coop game series I ever played hands down.Play with a group of 1 to 3 friend and you'll increase your fun factor for sure.My favorite game of 2018 and still playing it a year later with friends and I can' say I'm bored of it.You'll enjoy your time 100% guaranteed if you want more specific details I would say you can easily get around 50 to 80 hours of story content (looking around/crafting discovering how to trap monster and chase them around) and that is for an ok player at the monster hunter franchise. You can even spend way more time enjoying other parts of the game refining your builds and perks I'd say 100 150hours minimum of fun and discovery guaranteed before it gets to a repetitive grind for jewels and even then I still find it fun.The game is filled with crossover and event from other capcom titles such as megaman devil may cry street fighter and even final fantasy had an appearance and monster to hunt.Honnestly worth a try and a game you'll lose yourself into its immersion a buy worth every cents of its demanded price.Hope you'll enjoy it as I did if you try it but every one has the right to have their opinions on it either way thanks for reading me out Kevin.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,432,False,Recommended,Changing my review from recommend to not recommend. Too much content being rolled out. Its way too overwhelming. I just can't.Here is original review Story 5/10 not much to say its pretty straight forward and linear.Gameplay 12/10 Skill based combat and smart monster A.I. with interesting mechanics per weapon.Replayability 20/10 If you could spend thousands of hours on one weapon and spend thousands more on another. Weapon and monster mastery is your goal here. Create whatever build you want and see if its good for speed runs or group runs on harder monsters.This game will forever have mixed reviews because its not a game for everyone. Its a game for people who like a good hunt. If you want PvP go play csgo rainbow6seige or PUBG. This game is for the hardcore PvE gamer who likes to release some steam after a hard day and beat up monsters to thier heart's content. This game is for build makers who like to mix and match skills and see where their creativity will take them.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-19,0,0,140,False,Recommended,Fantastic game neat zones good monsters tons of content. Some of those monsters attack hit boxes are a bit buggy though the monsters body part hitboxes are done well. Been told that nuggy monster attack hit boxes are a staple of the monster hunter series though. Google plessy hip check.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-01,0,0,381,False,Recommended,This is my first Monster Hunter game. So far I love the gameplay and the universe but the optimization and RNG aren't great. I can recommend but only if you have a very powerful machine or don't mind playing on lower settings.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-30,0,0,99,False,Recommended,"Great game a flawed experience but nonetheless a GREAT game.But the port is barely serviceable.Virtual joystick mouse that feels wrong in every way*hasnt been fixed yet God awful optimization have a modest rig ? steer clear those requirements are no joke. *the game has been optimized somewhat and modders have helped in certain sketchy areasGraphics ranging from good for a console to good for a 3DS * Modders have helped The Radial menu is just atrocious when playing with Keyboard and Mouse*still and still unbindable no modsDenuvo make of that what you will.*still there and still awkward The game itself is fantastic once you finish it there will be no doubt in your mind whether or not it was worth the price.The positives+The gameplay is amazing and wasnt just some afterthought behind the story and cutscenes like with other games.+The combat is incredibly varied with every weapon class being vastly different than the last and taking dozens of hours to master even a single one.+The monsters are all amazing and intelligent hunting a new one is always a blast the first time.+Game isnt for es it can be really challenging and downright insane if you want to test yourself even more.+Great community +A ridiculously complex and varied upgrade system for both your armor and especially your weapons.+Beuatiful world teeming with life and believable eco systems.+There's still a of content and new monsters on the way.Negatives(yes there are some) The dialog is subpar in everyway the writing and things they say can be beyond awkward and cringy Lipsinc is off in both Japanese and English and less than 10 % of the dialog is voiced this might have flown on the 3DS but not here not once you've gained triple A status not in 2018. The GRIND good lord the grind somtimes you will be lucky and get a whole armor set and weapon from a monster after killing it a mere 4 times and other times you could be looking at a number closer to 10 or 15 which is alot considering these monsters can take up to 20 minutes to kill or capture. Then there's the rare like gems 3% drop chance doesn't sound right to me no matter what you say. Some really frustrating design desicions espesially when just starting with the game ""oh you just died to the monster ? here's half your max health back goodluck !"" That very old fashioned mission completion screen telling you how well you did and all the you got after every godamn mission would have liked a skip all and take all option. Trying to play through the campaign with a friend is awkard as hell you'll see why. Game has some very cheap difficulty spikes you spend half an hour fighting a monster dodging and blocking all its heavily telegraphed attacks even when they do hit you it does very little damage and all of a sudden the monster randomly tramples in a certain direciton taking 60 % of your health and staggering your character leaving you incapable of defending yourself for the next 7 seconds. For a game called Monster Hunter there's a luaghably little amount of actual hunting you wander randomly untill you find a footprint or some mucis and then your magical super tracker glowing buggs do the rest while all you have to do is follow like a child you will spend more time looking at these eyesores than any monster in the game. Zorah Migdora is trash garbage the fact that they make you do that boss multiple times is beyond insulting. The ridiculous farm for powercreep is completly unjustified as even barely average gear is capable of getting you through every challenge the game has to offer and since there's no competitive element to the game I dont know why people minMax so much.One of the best games I've ever played no doubt 9/10 dont take any of my negatives personaly I have always been better at seeing whats wrong with a game instead of whats great about it and this is all MY OPINION!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-21,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,This is not a pc game this a playstation port and very poor at that. Controls do not work with typical PC standard controls.As for the game itself in a nuthsell you pay 60 for dated graphics poor controls and camera work and lack of variety of activities to do.The essence of the game is that you chase bullet spongy monsters around you kill them over and over until you gathered enaugh materials for a new set of equipment rince repeat.There are many issues that I don't reallly have the strenght to rant about like poor hitboxes loading times etc you should be wary of those too.I'm not going to complain about the weapons being clunky and slow because they're oversized and you can learn to work around that fact it is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. That is learning your combos and animation lenghts.In perticular I like the hammer and the switchaxe despite being slow at first you learn that they're really fluid... but your character wont turn for some reason. And it's always like that with this game always something wrong.I had great trouble hitting my targets thanks to defualt camera settings which are terrible just tinkering with the camera to work more like it does on actual PC games instead of consoles will improve the experience slightly but it's nowhere near what it's SUPPOSED to be for a working pc game.After all said and done this game is not worth 60 bucks. It's a game with dated graphics and very limited gameplay with little variety and annoying console UI for a full price.At best this game is worth maybe 25 e and I'mbeing REALLY generous here.Be wary Steam won't let me refound this game make sure this is exactly what you wantbecause you won't be getting your money back I will be making business elswere I guess form now on.The tutorial alone is 2 hours long and does not represent the game properly instead youre mostly stuck in cutscenes and don't get to play.SO the 2 hour rule on top of dealing with terrible UI is insanely short time to make a decision. BE ware of that fact to me it's a deliberate scam.Also something noteworthy about this game is that it is not an MMO it's a lobby based co op game. TO be fair it's not advertised as an MMO just something to keep in mind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-23,0,0,201,False,Recommended,Game is quite a bit better than it was at launch a lot of the performance and disconnect issues have been fixed although disconnects still happen for seemingly no reason. C'mon Capcom. Combat is pretty fun and is generally high risk/high reward with an emphasis on anticipating (or at least remembering) attacks/patterns. At times can be incredibly frustrating but the satisfaction of finally downing the monster you've been attempting for the past 2 hours is definitely worth it. Future battles against said monster generally result in incresingly optimal strategies and before long the monster is naught but a speed bump on the road to new weapons and armor.The story is forgettable at best and really only serves to pace the introduction of new monsters of which I'd prefer there were more of since a few just feel like reskins of another.Overall definitely worth it if you enjoy the style of gameplay and aren't looking for a decent story.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-07,0,0,71,False,Recommended,I've put in about 60 hours in this game in the past like 4 days. Safe to say I'm incredibly addicted. It's such a fun game filled with adventure monsters and most of all cute things. It takes me a very long time to get addicted to a game as I get bored very easily but thig ame is very well fleshed out. The monsters are engaging the world is breathtaking and it fully immerses you in the world. Not to mention the soundtrack is amazing. Best game I've paid for so far this year!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-02,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Took me a bit to get into it at first it can be quite overwhelming. But now I'm deep in it and loving it. Definitely recommend if you're unsure about it it definitely helps to have a friend or two that either knows a bit about Monster Hunter or is also interested in MHW.There is a ton of grinding but what is important is that the grinding is fun because the gameplay itself is fun. 9/10 Not enough Big Red Dogs,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-20,0,0,114,False,Recommended,As someone who has enjoyed the monster hunter series of games since it was first released on the PSP I can say that with my 100+ hours (at the time of typing this review) that this game is definitely worth a buy and the title a of monster hunter game. The thing about this game that makes it so special to me is the monsters and how they each have their own personalities and can see this not only when we fight them but also if you just follow them around the world and watch how the monsters interact with the environment and each other for example if you follow Kulu Ya Ku around the wildspire wast you will see him seal an Apceros egg then full on sprint back to his nest to eat it every now and then he will run past the Apceros whilst running only for them to stare at Kulu like he is the literal embodiment of the devil and start yelling what I can only assume is CHRIST COMPELLES YOU whenever Kulu s around. And the thing is every monster has its own little routine that you can observe as you follow them. That is why I would 100% recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-02,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Ofcourse some diehard MH fans will rate this badly I guess. I could never get into those laggy pixelated nintendo DS games cause they ran and looked liked poop.Now this game is another beast. It runs amazingly looks great gamepad controls feel great and weighty. I'm not that far in yet and so far I think I've fought about 4 different monsters that weren't too hard so the game does give you time to get into it pretty easily. Although I'm sure I'll hit a wall at some point but that's the fun of it I guess?,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
