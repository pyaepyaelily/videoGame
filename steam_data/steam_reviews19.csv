2016-10-31,0,0,513,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE I was banned for no reason after 500 hours of game play you can't even imagine all the progress I have made in the game I had spent 40M in game money throughout that time. First I stopped playing the game for about 3 4 months and when I come back I was banned with no further explanation or reason lost the character and that means lost all progress money vehicles and properties which is ridiculous. I would put law suit against the company but suing would be more expensive than what the actual game cost me with all the shark cards I bought together. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AS ROCKSTARS IS RANDOMLY BANNING. Not buying again from you Rockstar in fact I'll support piracy to play your future games.,Grand Theft Auto V

The only reason this game was worth it was because of the amazing modding community. The online mode is boring as heck.Very well optimized game. It works perfectly with Nvidia Game Stream as well.

2015-04-14,0,0,210,False,Recommended,I recommend this game only for the single player. If you are looking for a multiplayer experience where you can just goof around I would recommend maybe trying this game or getting GTA 4 but be warned there is one BIG negative about online. It is completely developed with the mindset of microtransactions first fun later. The singleplayer is a very good time. What really shines is that everything is so polished. The details the movement ragdolls combat it is all there.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-28,0,0,619,False,Not Recommended,So after playing this for a while Grand Theft Auto five is a really boring game.Going to online as a first time I was horrible and I was grabbing money.Never in my life I had ask nor get any money from a modder but somehow grand theft auto is really boring. The game had a grind and was a blast but after that grind for money and reaching level 144 The game didnt feel fun. Even doing missions are fun but after doing like every heist (including Doomsday) It didnt feel fun because having the money to get multiple buisnesses felt real boring because buying supplies or stealing them your just getting money. But theres not that many missions leading to selling stuff for your buisnesses and it is leading to repetition.TL DR Fun at the beginning to grinding to repetition to boring.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,0,0,306,False,Recommended,I will not waste my time commenting how GREAT this game is as many people have experienced on the PS/Xbox already.

2018-01-13,0,0,14,False,Recommended,The story has some fun missions but the plot could ve been better.

2018-10-10,0,0,118,False,Recommended,I finished the story mode for someone and played some online on their account. I give the story mode a 9/10 nothing is perfect but this game gets damn close to that benchmark! Online is a 5/10 there are WAY too many problems and illegitamate bans are a big issue. The community can be cancerouse and menu's can be awful but it's still GTA5 with friends. It's fun to Fail entering the military base get 5 stars and woose out on the train because you don't want to die missions are fun sometimes and best of all is the silly shanagins that happens all the while. I suggest you buy it for the story if you like a fast paced interesting and fluid single player experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are amazing and even with a medium end computer rig the game looks beautiful and runs at a stable 60 frames per second most of the time. There haven't been any issues that I've run into so far and I'm praying that it will stay this way. All in all great game great port and definetely worth the money! Thank you Rockstar!

2015-04-30,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Everyone knows the excellence of GTA V. I could have got it for PS4 but decided to wait for the PC version for the obvious benefits (mod support community graphical improvements... the list goes on). So far I have had a great time in both single player and multiplayer. This is the first GTA game I have played since my younger years playing the top down retro version at the games beginning. The multiplayer aspect could so with some fine tuning in terms of match making and the levelling system which can be a bit grindy in places but this is countered by a huge variety in things to do to gain XP from which makes the grind much more entertaining. When you do get into a decent size lobby of a game or team up with your companions this game comes into its own and provides a unique sense of entertainment that is hard to come by in modern games. The single player campaign has a entertaining storyline mixed with a huge variety of things to do which keep you enthralled and wanting more.

2015-07-05,0,0,552,False,Not Recommended,Pros Trevor.Cons The always online DRM practice is extremely annoying and inconvenient. I am not blessed with an amazing internet connection. Therefore many times I am unable to play the game. I understand the rational behind a DRM business practice but by disregarding the customer satisfaction for profit such a policy does more harm than good. I will not repeat the mistake by purchasing a game with DRM policy ever again.The game menu is a complete pain. For example it requires multiple loading sessions to simply initiate a friends only session which should be readily available on the main menu screen. Vehicle stats are not accurate. I suggest either looking online to see the true car speeds or purchasing them in single player before wasting time/money online. Moreover the vehicle customization options are very limited.Internal housing/apartment and garage layouts often does not correspond with the external structures. Yoga. NPCs and cops are inept.Cheating is prolific online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-29,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,If you want this game for online be ready to face a grind. If I try to play online having fun and not grinding the most money in my wallet at once was 200k while cars and other stuff cost more or around 2 mil. I got a modder to put money and levels in my account and regardless of what others think I had more fun having 500 mils than 50k. Games should be about your journey and not about your destination but being at the destination was more fun. Another complaint I have is the people I play the game for the cars and races and I like to modify cars a lot but there's a 50/50 chance there is that one guy in your server who likes to kill everyone for fun. I know it's GTA but you don't need to be a after I ask you to stop or go into passive.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-14,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Pros The game itself is good fun to play.Unlike Assassin's Creed it fulfills your killing desire you can just kill anyone you don't like on the street(beware of the wanted level).You won't get bored in the big map of Los Santos there are plenty of random events located in the big Los Santos.Your greed will be fulfilled by doing all heist jobs and playing around with the share market.The storyline is interesting.It has many collectables for players to collect.The graphics are stunning and excellent.Cons The handling of some vehicles helicopters and planes is rather a big disaster.The keyboard input lag is an extremely seriously frustrating problem. You press W to drive your car forward after driving your car like 1 min and you release the W button your car still keeps driving forward itself !! Although after some time the input lag stops(if you are lucky it takes a few seconds if not 1 minute or longer) but it totally affects and ruins the smooth gameplay.However as a big fan of GTA I still love and support Rockstar products.If you do too I would 100% recommend this game!,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar's support is nonexistent and their bot will mark all appeals and complaints as solved without acknowledgement. Their support phone number won't even pick up.That said I will recommend this game's singleplayer which is extremely rewarding and incredibly fun.

2017-03-25,0,0,306,False,Recommended,Offline 7/10 Grand Theft Auto 5 is a visually breathtaking achievement with some phenomenal gameplay mechanics but the writing has me at odds with it constantly shifting from smart satirical commentary to borderline cringeworthy fart humor. There's enough room for the main characters to have fun and become memorable in the series but playing this game start to finish for the 3rd time recently I could see that there was a noticable drop in quality from 4 to 5. The plot felt more like a straight to video sequel than a step up. I'm a huge fan of GTA 4 so this purely bias and isn't a big of a deal for most playing this game. I get it some people just want to shoot some pedestrians or get chased by the cops and call it a day. You will find that here without question.Online 5/10 I have never been more spilt on my opinion of an online mode like this before. On one hand I love how addictive the structure of creating your own criminal underworld with your friends actually can be. The majority of missions and heists hold up remarkably well for how much time you spend planning them. Additionally the huge updates and DLC that has been added at no cost to the player is refreshing and makes coming back to the game more enticing. On the other hand the purchase price for in game items are a huge slap in the face made only to promote giving into Rockstar's Shark Card microtransation options (ONE high end car can sometimes cost more than $30). Not to mention the god awful amounts of bugs slow server loading times and the infamous hatred Rockstar has garnered from modding communities. This is a huge problem that NEEDS to be addressed.I enjoy my time with GTA 5 and I'm always happy to come back to it from time to time. But if Rockstar has plans to make another online mode for their next title in this series somethings gotta give.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-22,0,0,925,False,Not Recommended,Contra Most of the things in GTA Online are fun however that EXCLUSIVELY applies if you play with friends.With them you have the ability to wait through the horrible Nightmare of being stuck in a loading screen to join a Race Online Lobby or practically anything that involves the Online Coding of GTA 5. This also applies to the Time it takes to Start GTA 5.Sure if you are in a Session with your friends and you're messing around with randoms its fun because then there is no loading inbetween the fun you have. However even then you have to have an eye on the randoms that only want to you up.About GTA 5 Offline You play it once maybe twice together with friends (with the friends watching not playing coop (thats not possible) and then you never touch it again. Thats because GTA 5 Offline is almost the 1st day version of the game and the updates that did happen didn't aim to make Offline enjoyable they only made it barely playable. Pro However I do have some good things to say about GTA 5 Online (only Online). Like I said playing with friends is fun playing custom maps (which however sometimes are hard af or even virtually unfinishable and good maps generally being rare to find) can also be a lot of fun races just as much as the other game modes. Summary In Summary i sadly cannot recommend this game as it is. Also all of this will probably never change because for Rockstar its not worth the effort to make the game fun again. In my opinion the only option is to wait for GTA 6 and hope they learn from their mistakes especially in modding and online coding.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-20,0,0,200,False,Recommended,Wow. I was on the fence about getting this game for a few years but I recently sold my csgo knife bought the game.Am I ever impressedWhy Buy?this game has so much to offer such a polished rich world full of potential. It is a racing game a FPS a golfing game a crime game...or as I call it a do whatever you want gameIt feels like RockStar spent a very long time making every nook and cranny of this map. You can spend hours exploring the map on a dirt bike finding things that you woul not have expected to have been there this game is full of easter eggs. I won't spoil any here because finding them yourself is part of the fun. There is just so much to do and the game DOESN'T TRY TO STOP YOU! You want to do something? Do it!I haven't played that much of the game but I feel that there will be much to do for a very long time and I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.PROS Pretty slam dunk graphics if you ask me especially with mods Well optimized (60 70 fps on my mid range PC med high settings!) Plenty of missions heists races and COMMUNITY MADE MAPS Lots of options for customization of cars your player guns and now your appartment! Free online DLC (Lowriders executives and other criminals etc) Large well populated and put together map In game micro transactions with Shark Cards are completely optional and not buying them takes nothing away from your experience.CONS Many users of Hacks and mod menus make the game painful sometimes. Rockstar does seem to be pretty good about bans though. Loading times and connection to Rockstar servers tends to be slow and spotty at times. Maybe it's just my internet P Sometimes a very evident console port but this doesn't really take away from the game. Use a controller if you wish. I don't.In ConclusionI think Rockstar has done an excellent job with this game. It has endless thigns to do places to explore and easter eggs to discover. A great game to play with friends. This is something I reccommend. Buy it with a couple other people playing with people you know is much more fun.9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-23,0,0,360,False,Recommended,What can I say? It's GTA. The story is good no spoilers there. It has a lot of features and a lot to keep you playing for a while. Inevitably people will skip the story and go straight to online. The online is jam packed with features new cars new guns new clothes new taunts new gamemodes you get the point. Online seems to get more love than story which is a shame. Online does have its fair share of problems though. Everyone leaving the lobby at once LOTS of modders and hackers glitches like invincibility etc. Did I mention you need a beefy computer to run it? If you want to buy this game go for it I recommend it. If you're not sure maybe wait for a sale.Score 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-25,0,0,73,False,Recommended,Well I didn t like Trevor at first and I didn t like Rockstar for making (SPOILER) Johnny Keiblitz die in such a humiliating way. But Trevor is just too fun to play and hey both he and Johnny are fictional characters.Now that I beat the story mode I m kinda stuck because I just can t believe that any of these guys save Trevor would get into trouble after (SPOILER) pulling out a big job. They would just keep quiet low profile.Anyway It s a very good game to play great graphics great soundtrack compelling storyline (GTA style with all those weirdos in the way and the subtle humour) satisfying gunfights etc.I also liked the possibility of choosing the approach for each heist although the game could offer the chance to play the not chosen option right after completion of the heist because I will hardly go back to the save games to try those.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Oh my god I'm so glad it's finally available. With every new release it gets better. Last gen to current gen consoles and now PC. I wish I had a 4k screen to really test my graphics card. 1080p is still pretty too.Keyboard controls take some getting used to. A few commands are slightly out of reach but you don't need them often enough to be a problem. Supports 360/One controller out of the box and it feels just like the console control.I'll probably use both to be honest. Mouse/keyboard for running/shooting and controller for driving/flying. Analog steering for the win.The load times are near instant for single player and the online is significantly improved compared to the console.First time I joined online I tried to get the high priority export car only to be met with explosions and fire. 10/10 will explode again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-27,0,0,119,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Many are angry over the OpenIV scandal surrounding Take Two and GTA V. I'll give my two cents as well. It's a shame how low GTA has become. The previous entries had great modding communities and so does GTA V but with the death of OpenIV which allows modding (not cheating) of game files Rockstar and Take Two are basically screwing their customers over. I've been a part of the community for a long time. My friends and I played a lot in multiplayer sessions for San Andreas which isn't possible without modders. GTA IV although poorly optimized still had tons of mods which were made possible by OpenIV. Stop thinking the community's your competition. You're already screwing over your playerbase with terrible online mode and microtransactions. Let people enjoy the game that they bought. If cheaters are your issue go after them. Not the modders. Not exactly the strongest GTA story wise. Despite Trevor being memorable and Michael and Franklin both likeable none of the other characters felt developed. But it's still GTA with the same formula even more improved. It's still fun gunplay is the best yet in the series and the world of San Andreas is a beautiful place to explore. While the single player is great GTA Online is a mess. A major disappointment Online loads painfully slow jobs are difficult to start with sessions crashing whenever someone exits. All in all great game. I just wish Rockstar would improve GTA Online and start making single player DLCs again.,Grand Theft Auto V

You grind yourself to death and waste it on superexpensive stuff. Amount of hackers is too damn high. Normal people are getting banned while hackers are running around.No more modding. Great !

2015-07-19,0,0,463,False,Recommended,One of the best games to ever happen. Then Online mode came along GTAV became something even better until a scripthook was made. Modders have ruined everything in the online aspect of this game stealing your money cars weapons etc. Even blowing you up until you decide to not play online mode anymore. Rockstar's anti cheat is a hilarious failure. Hopefully I will come back to GTA Online once modding is banned.Update 1/2016 Bully modders seem to have dissipated quite a lot since I had last played GTA online. I even come across quite a few modders that mind their own business and not throw money or kill you make an unfair advantage against them. I think the communiyt has imporved since the bullies realised that either the game is boreing and dont play anymore or have finnaly gre balls and decided to play with others. Rockstar has had to put down strict modding rules and even taking down onnocents along the way. I applude this to deter modders from atttmpting to go online with theri mods. However with the recent mod servers I feel they should be an expection. I belive rockstar should keep their no modder policy but have mod servers for those looking to use GTA's full potential of customization and the one of the best reasons to get into GTA. Rockstar putting support into seperating modders from the vanilla players can pull in a whole new crowd and save GTA from circling the drain.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar isn't doing ANYTHING to stop the hackers. They don't even care enough to atleast blacklist the public hacks. Seriously for a game big like GTA V is a proper anti cheat too much to ask? A hacker has to be reported 10 times by 10 different people with proper video evidence to make Rockstar look into it.

This game was impressive back on last gen consoles due to the shear scale of the game and now the graphics and gameplay have been updated with first person controls and mouse and keyboard its simply one of the best gaming expenices you can get.First off the game was worth the extra wait. Rockstar really spent that time optimizing this game to its full potential. It doesnt take much horsepower to push this game at 1080p and you can get away with 4k on a single higher end gpu. The most impressive feature about this version of the game has to be the unblieveable draw distance on the world. In the past versions it was as if you were near sighted but in this version you have perfect vision. It completely puts you into the game and i found myself constantly saying wow at the geourgous landscapes. Graphics are the best period60fps is a game changer in itself giving the world increadable smoothness and fluidity to everything you do. Overall Definately worth the money you spend for the game.

This is the very definition of how optimizing a game properly will directly relate to increased sales and a company's reputation. Kudos kudos kudos Rockstar. Thank you for not rushing an unfinished product to us thanks you for the delays most definitly worth the wait. Game publishers take note it is worth the freaking money and time to optimize your games before launch. Rockstar has proven yet again what is possible in the realm that is gaming. i am running an old i7 860 gtx 660ti 8g ddr3 ram and a crappy 5200 rpm hard drive and I am able to play the game very comfortably at a higher resolution than 1080p. This is why I dont mind delays on highly anticipated titles this is why I have bought the game twice this is why I will not purchase anything from ubisoft ever again. This isnt just a game release it is a revolution. A declaration of war to all those greedy companies who think we the gamers are saps to be milked for every last dime no matter the quality of the product.

I'm playing with all settings maxed out and all advanced settings on/maxed and the game runs smoothly. I've yet to notice any glitches and am enjoying the hell out of the game though I haven't got to spend too much time on it yet.On a less serious note until a thorough review can be done Played chicken with oncoming traffic and committed vehicular manslaughter. Got out of car pulled now dead driver out of his/her car and began to kick and stomp it profusely in front of others.Hijacked boat and commenced running over swimmers chopping up their bodies with the boats motor blades and watching blood taint the water..... would definitely buy this again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-15,0,0,98,False,Recommended,I fully recommend this game to any GTA fan. I have played every single one of them since #3 and this is one of the most enjoyable versions of the series. Some of the key elements of the game I appreciate are the checkpoints in missions different playable characters with special action skills save option on the cell phone and the random events. I have not played online so I cannot comment on that other than I wish Rockstar would concentrate on releasing additional material for the single player game and not the online world. while overall this game is very fun it did fall short in a few places. The ability to rob a drive thru should be in this game. They took away the ability to eat food at the fast food chains instead of expanding on it / I think the game needed a better way to earn cash other than stocks. I have seen at least one casino in this game but it is not a place a game character can enter. Next the PoI markers. While the point of interest option is nice it needs a lot of work. Labeling or color coding for PoI would be more useful. The limit of 10 hinders the functionality as well. Finally I really miss the turf wars from GTA San Andreas. There are several gangs in this GTA so that seems like a missed opportunity.I almost forgot to mention...Danny McBride from Eastbound and Down has a character that does a radio show. It is hilarious &gt http //gta.wikia.com/wiki/Duane_EarlFinal Judgment Buy it on sale,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-15,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Good game overall but it doesn't have as much heart as GTA 4. I find the characters in 5 are shallower and less impactful both emotionally and peak interest...

2017-02-24,0,0,367,False,Recommended,I would easily recommend this game for the single player alone. That was the main reason I bought it as my last experience of GTA online was on the xbox 360 when I first purchased GTA 5 and it was underwhelming.Now though GTA online overshadows the single player element in my opinion. There is so much more to do that you can literally sink hundreds of hours into this game. Yes there are players that are tools online and yes there are modders that are bigger tools but its really only a small bug bear. They cant really take away from the fun you will have as you can just join another lobby.As someone who had no intention of playing the mulitplayer element I am very happy with it. I could liteally do stunt races for hours and im not a big bfan of racing games lol and heists with a team that is decent is a lot of fun.From my experience this whole thing that you get banned for nothing isnt true (touch wood). Im guessing that all these people that claim to have been banned for nothing must have done something to flag them up but i dont know.As for shark cards shark cards are for people who value their time more than their money. Thats it. It can take a hell of a long time to grind out the cash to buy certain things in the game and casual players dont have that time so they buy shark cards. Or they cant be asssed with the grind lol. Gives rockstar more money so they dont charge you for all the GTA online goodness they release so its win win. It doesnt give them an unfair advantage as they cant purchase anything that isnt available to everyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,58,False,Recommended,"GTA V The game that had its release date pushed back so many times you thought it would never be released from the consoles glutches. Lucky for you the game was finally released for PC after 2 long years and it was well worth the wait. I have put many hours into the ""Beta Testing"" version of the game on my 360 and the upgrade to a superior system was well worth it. Here is why I think you should/shouldn't buy this game Why it's worth More beautiful stunning and atleast 2 times more ""Cinematic"" as the versions of the game released for the consoles. I can on high settings get an almost constant 60 FPS all well having the game look 10x better. This is a damn good port. Unlike R*'s previous GTA port GTA V is flawless from the start. Speaking of good porting this game has the most detailed and indepth option menu I have ever seen in a game. You can alter almost every aspect of the game down to graphical settings keybindings (for both Kb/M and controller) and way more. Has a VRAM usage bar in the options menu so you can know how far you can push the graphics till you start seeing performance drops. Gameplay is amazing and there is loads to do. But I'm assuming most people have already seen gameplay/played the game so I'm not going to touch on it so much The community is amazing and there is a smaller amount of ""Caw a doodie"" kids that you would see on the consoles (I wonder why there was never a WIIU version...?) Reasons why you might NOT want to buy the game Requires you to sign into R*'s social club to be able to play the game. Which I'm assuming that the game has been out for a day now connecting to this shouldn't be a problem. Speaking of this social club you have to use it to add friends/invite friends/ect. You are not able to use steams handy ""Shift+Tab"" to add or join a friends game. The game does seem to eat up A LOT of VRAM so anything above 4 GB should be fine for all max (RIP 970s) All around I would say this game is worth your money and time.Here are my system specs if anyone was curious!GeForce GTX 970Intel Core i7 4790k CPU 4.00GHz16 GB RAMAlso be sure to update your drivers!Nvidia http //www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang en usAMD http //support.amd.com/en us/download",Grand Theft Auto V

A game that I should be able to max out on my Nvidia 970 gtx with no problems I sadly have to run on normal settings or it will crash. I can get lucky at times and run it on ulta/high for between 1 minute or up to 2 hours before it randomly crashes. But as of now I can only play it on normal settings without it crashes.

2015-12-16,0,0,98,False,Recommended,"In terms of gameplay? very good 100% reccomendedHOWEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!finding online matches is difficult not because of a lack of player base but because of constant crashing and or failing to connect to a host. The obvious solution would be to connect/create a lobby with a friend right? Wrong. The social club makes connecting with friends difficult and sometimes confusing As well as some people simply not being able to connect to one another for various reasons. On top of that the game has alot of texture and enviroment issues that seriously affect gameplay periodically through the session. Long load times and simply staying idle at various screens also increases the frustration level of a player simply waiting to get into a game. Many times if started from the ""play GTAV online"" option the game will try and connect to a session for about 5 minutes claim it failed and send you into singleplayer. This means it is actually faster to get into online by just starting the game regularly rather than using their ""shortcut""dont get me wrong it is a very fun game definitivly the best one in the series for me but with the age of this game these issues should be resolved.

A warning to rocksar and take 2 you might be the one of the bigest richest companies in the world right now but like that is what makes loose your customers loose faith in you the reputation that you build in so manny years doing a good hard work can be thrown away verry easy and will affect your sales in the future Do you remember how EA used to be a great friendly company making great games without all that t that its spewing out now ?

While the unmodified experience for single player has remained largely the same the game has seen significant pushes towards paid aspects of its multiplayer. If you do buy the game keep in mind unless you stick to the now lessened potential for single player the company does expect you to pay more to get a complete multiplayer experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

You rob steal murder and lie your way into fortune in this game and that is a fun enough experience. In addition though there are tons of side missions events purchases characters and weapons that make playing through the game a good time. Are there problems with the multiplayer? Yeah of course there are. There may be some more in this game than in others but it all works I personally haven't had issues with it and even doing online play is fun if far less rewarding. It's a nice addition though. If you're interested in this get it for the gameplay and world you can play around in. Don't depend on the multiplayer for enjoyment.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,21,False,Recommended,Very impressed.While I was not able to run the game at max settings I was able to maximize the graphics to a point where they still exceed the graphics seen in the current generation consoles like the ps4.I am running an aging AMD Phenom II x6 1100T (Turbo Core/CoolnQuiet disabled) 16GB of DDR3 and 2 Asus GTX 760's in SLI (4GB VRAM total)with the latest nvidia GTA V approved driversWhat I was impressed with the most is that the fact that this runs better than GTAIV... on the same hardware! Rockstar did not screw this up and has redeemed itself from that awful port that was GTA IV. While it is disappointing to hear that many people with odd windows account names were unable to install and run the game I feel as though a bug as that should not eclipse what a great game this turned out to be.Graphics aside (but seriously... WOW!) the game itself has not lost any of its luster gameplay wise in the 2 years its been out. GTA games just never get old. The game will have you hooked it's got me hooked on my third playthrough and with mod support expect the game to be even better than the console experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,357,False,Recommended,"EDIT I have since found out that AMAZING mods such as ""GTAV NATIVE TRAINER"" mod WILL GET YOU BANNED FROM ONLINE PLAY FOR USING THE MOD IN SINGLE PLAYER. That they can not understand how essential modding is to every PC sandbox game (such as Skyrim) and not having prepared for this by simply allowing such things offline means I could NEVER recommend such a game for purchase.I was extremely hesitant to purchase a game whose PC release was intentionally delayed 18 months for $60. I feel that anyone with interest should wait until it goes on sale the early bugs are patched and mods are released for it. After all they made PC users wait 18 months for it already why not wait a few more so you aren't funding their poor business practices?The game runs inconsistent and barely smooth at 20 40fps but only on the lowest of settings. This same machine can run Payday2 at 75 120 fps Skyrim at 60+ and any other game from the past few years without any issues. Oddly changing these settings from being all on 'high' to being low/off only provided 5fps increase.The variety of game mechanics present in this world is phenominal. Definitely something that IF openned to modding could be the new Fallout/Skyrim of modding. They made their decision though. You WILL BE BANNED without warning and without recourse if you attempt to mod this game even cosmeticaly in single player. Seeing as how I couldn't read the RockStar EULA until AFTER purchasing the game these bans days after launch leave me feeling cheated and wishing for a refund.",Grand Theft Auto V

I have NO clue how they could have missed this. Moving on I played last night after finding the appropriate graphical settings. The game is beautiful. When you are considerate to your settings the framerates are silk. I sat downtown and just watched things I haven't done that in a game since Skyrim. It's something to see... this is one of those games that will sell a TON of hardware. This and Witcher 3 have made it an exciting quarter for PC gamers.

2017-06-19,0,0,483,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V was pretty much that game that pretty much freed me of my bordem. Playing it on console was nice and all playing through the story a bunch of times but eventually I got bored of it. So once I bought this game on PC I was thinking ""It's just gonna be the same process over again so why not spice up the experience with a few mods"". So pretty much I was trying out addon vehichles trainers (Menyoo more specifically) and just simply goofing around. But one day I was planning on adding a favorite car in the game and OpenIV needed an update. I was actually hyped about it until I saw the message of OpenIV being forced to stop the project due to T2 cease and desist letter. I somewhat cried after seeing that mostly because it felt like my fun experience was simply taken from not only me but from many of the players who were also cranking up their fun on GTA V. So until I can have fun once again on GTA V I'm not changing my review and I'm not gonna uninstall OpenIV until justice is served.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,There must be a lesson learned here. One of GTA's most crowning achievements besides being an iconic franchise is its ability to have endless community support in modding. There are few platforms that allow the level of freedom to be expressed that GTA can have. It is something desired by a great majority of players... Usually after a vanilla completion or five... This expectation exists in all games of an applicable genre. As a business this must be accepted. A wise developer would embrace the community that feeds it. Personally I'm all for them cracking down on aspects that actually taint the atmosphere and market viability of their product. We've all suffered at the hands of people who blatantly seek to ruin the experience... But the OpenIV fiasco weighs in far worse than any hacker troll toxic ever could. I for one have tolerated the blatant cash schemes by the developers because of the amazing community and the clear disconnect between modded and pure versions of the game. I've even indulged in the scheme as a measure of good faith supporting the developers for the future. But if they're going to on the community because of their inability to target the true violators I'll no longer support the model. If you cannot find means to protect your interests without damning the community to labor intensive back channels then to hell with you... It was fun while it lasted.

After what 5 years? you still haven't given us DLC for singleplayer time to cough up something after this t so we can be distracted from mods.

You whent from Positive now down to Mixed learn something from this and TakeTwo as well.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-19,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,If you're going to release a game for PC you have to understand the PC environment. The main perk to dumping ons of money into gaming computers is the ability to mod great games in inventive ways while maintaining a higher level of graphical fidelity. Now there have been plenty of hackers using mods to get ahead in the multiplayer mode but that hasn't been nearly enough of a problem for people to be unable to just switch servers whenever somebody steamrolled through a playsession with a gamebreaking cheat. What this really comes down to is Rockstar trying to sell their Shark Cards (which nobody wants in the first place) but cmon that obvious of a cash grab is utterly insulting to everybody it's 2017 and this should be COMMON SENSE.So... even though I love this game and have always loved Rockstar games they've destroyed the PC experience with recent actions and do not deserve a good review. Right now you might as well go buy a PS4/Xbox One and play on those platforms for a better overall experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,"BEWARE you have about a 50% chance that the game will not run at all. It won't boot up update access the launcher nothing. My PC is well above average and my copy of the game was directly from steam but that has nothing to do with these issues. Basically Rockstar released a game that only works with a HANDFUL of GPU's. They also have provided NO RESPONSE after over 48 hrs of thousands of people being unable to play this game. This is possibly the worst PC game launch I've ever had the misfortune of being apart of. SAVE YOUR MONEY UNTIL ROCKSTAR FIXES THIS MESS!! Otherwise you have an excellent chance of joining the masses of mis placed gamers who have also thrown their hard earned money down the drain.It's been 48 hrs after a horrendous launch and the devs have clearly expressed their ""zero s given"" policy by their complete and total silence on the matter.They had over a year to work out these ""little glitches"" for this release but they never tested the launcher on some of the most common GPU's on the market?!?

2018-01-01,0,0,444,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V review for online and story mode!First off Story Mode is personally my most favorite part about this game. (even though they canceled the DLC for story mode for some GTA Online t.) The reason I love story mode the most because of how they re introduced you to the fantasized version of california San Andreas. Also with the characters. Micheal De Santa is an ex crook who ""retired"" and moved to the richer part of Los Santos from North Yankton to get away from his problems. But then he got even more problems when he moved away. Then comes Franklin Clinton who is hands down my favorite character just because of how much he develops through the game. He lives in the southern part of San Andreas around where Grove Street was in GTA SA. He went from doing grunt work by repoing cars to living in Vinewood hills in an awesome house givein to him by one of his friends. Then there is Trevor Phillips. He is a VERY interesting man. Trevor worked with Micheal back before he retired. When he thought Micheal was a dead man after he escaped the cops in the first scene in the game he moved to the hillbilly/redneck part of San Andreas. When he got settled in he still persued criminal actions and cooked meth. So I reccommend this game for Story Mode. I played it about 1 3 times because it never gets boring.Now for Online. I loved online when I had this game on the xbox. It was just so straight forward and not a grind fest. Do missions get money buy cars and around and have fun with friends. then the game got really cool with the vehicle updates and heists. Thats when the game was still really fun and not a grind fest. But then these new updates came around where vehicles bunkers hangars and etc. would cost over 1 mil. And by the time you got that and got the money u needed the new update would come out with cooler items and it was repetitive grindy and became p2w. Now for my final answer I like GTA online because of what you can do on it. But it sometimes get really annoying when you have to buy a sharkcard for something to be used or for something to be done.But overall I love this game and I reccommend it to alot of people. But dont let CEO/Bunker/MC/Air Freight work get to you cuz then thats when you get annoyed and would want to stop playing it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-07,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is a beautiful and extremely immersing game. Everything about it is top notch with the exception of the story that I felt was very lacking and maybe dragged on for a little longer than it needed to. The gameplay on the other hand is perfect. You can mess around for hours (especially with mods) around San Andreas and do pretty much whatever you want to do. My favorites are jumping to my death out of planes and getting eaten by sharks maybe having a small war with the police... and of course tennis.Sadly when you've done all of that there's not that much to do. You can roam around endlessly do mindless things but it's not that fun anymore.That's where the online comes in. I've played a bit of it and there's pretty much no end to it and it's still being updated several years after release. It's much more fun with friends too.GTA V misses a few opportunities with the story the characters are not amazingly written but the gameplay makes up for it in the end. If you love driving at crazy speeds shooting and blowing things up and everything in between you need GTA V.And if you've got it on PC consider getting a ton of mods for it.8/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Suddenly the teenagers ""dry dream"" comes true after a couple of days of pre downloading lots of swearing due to the process of de cryptation (and lots of data removing not all can have endless space on their HD apparently about 60 or so GB's apart from the original download of 59GB) not to mention the post poning of release dates (was almost sceptical about this game ever comming out).What more is there to say? this is the best GTA to date (great functions from previous titles) AND Rockstar has apparently learnt something from the pc release of GTA IV... It works at 60fps and 1080p in my case since Nvidia GTX 970 isn't really 4k ready (not to mention not everybody owns a 4k monitor either).But here comes the question do I recommend this game to everybody?

When the game 1st came out for console peasants (ty for beta testing) I had no intrest in it becuase it wasn't for pc. Im glad I didn't watch youtube videos or twitch streams because that would ruined the story and ""new feeling"" to the game. As for performance I couldn't ask for more. The game runs like a dream (my computer specs are on my profile). Yes we waited over a year for it but IMO I think it was worth it. As we all know PC games have become this sort testing realm for developers consiting of partially developed games that require patch after patch when in the end these patches usually only fixes minor issues. I can truley say I am happy with my purchase though I have only played this game for a short perisod of time.The work Rockstar put in this game as compared to any other AAA title really shows.

2016-01-17,0,0,1198,False,Not Recommended,1 2016Warning This title uses 3rd party DRM (Rockstar Social Club)Game is beautiful Single player is good very good even. Though i wont go into that because i'm too ticked off by the state of the multiplayer.Essentially it boiles down to the way rockstar has set up the networking part which seems to be very p2p based(both still in closed session while modem is out). They also appear to completely thrust whatever the client reports/does.With the lack of a mods system and with the ability to take mods into multiplayer/online you can guess what happens cheating.There were and are still countless times where people cheat in the public lobby not even shy to set a nice impossible speed record in public events.Things me and friends have experienced so far Getting blown up out of nowhere no name you died.quickly leaving after blowing everyone up so you cant report them.modders framing each other (one guy blows everybody up under somebody's else's name)caged within un movable propsforced out of any vehicleforced out of your car and explosion placed at you so you and/or(passive mode) your vehicle die.getting killed by explosive bulletsgetting my car thrown around while im inside by a invisible forcegodmode playersprops or people attached to youall weapons taken from youpeople teleporting around the placeThis ruins the game for anyone who just wants fair play.The only way that you can at the moment is a closed friends or crew session which do not give you the full experience and its pretty ridiculous to be forced to play privately to avoid cheaters.Passive mode disables a lot of gameplay and is not an excuse for cheating.Playing with friends who have not played online before is a disaster.The updates so far have not resolved anything of this only added very pricy content you can purchase online.Not Recommended.6 2017 Update 1 051 hrs on record not much has changed(in SP nothing at all).The updates that were added are just more vehicles guns or buildings that cost millions.now next to cheaters you have hydra griefers people who abuse the game mechanics to stay out of reach and ruin your gameplay.Basically they go into passive mode call for a hydra get into the hydra while passive fly away disable passive blow your up repeat if died.with the gunrunning update you might be able to stop it with the exposve rounds but as i pointed out earlier it costs millions to get there.People still blatantly cheat in your face with godmode and if you point it out people in the lobby start to beg for money.Take Two(not R*) tried to fix this by attacking OpenIV and Force Hax while i support this action it gives a mixed feeling as i support mods while Take Two also turned Gta Online in a Free2play like cashgrab where most of it is so far out of reach that grinding for it isnt worth it.So when money is acutally dropped upon you you cant really complain as it would validate Take Two's shareholders hunger for money.on the latest update alone i already managed to spend 30 million and still not own everything that came in the update.Outside of heists using the MC businesses its possible to get a bit more than a million a day on your own but that requires your whole day and if someone decides to blow your up for a neglegible reward while you're selling you get nothing. maybe even loss.you would need a month of non stop grinding to maybe earn it all and thats just this update costs for setting up MCbusiness(millions) excluded.GTA V costs 59 99Their biggest shark card(Megalodon Shark GTA$8 000 000) costs 74 99.8 mil gets you 1 useless yaught or a building with garage and a few upgraded cars.let that ing sink in.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm less than 5 percent progressed through the main story line and I already own a sports car and a house in the hills. I have a million and a half and I'm saving for a golf coarse priced at 150 million dollars. This is basically a RPG based in a gangster film.

2015-04-15,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Yes I would Recommend this Game. A couple things first. (I can only vouch for AMD) The game is not optimized for PC yet. It crashes randomly I get ballz fps drop when driving flying ect (I have an AMD 6970 in Crossfire. Thats 4gb Video Memory) around 30 45 fps and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. It needs more options and locations on how to change this. I can't even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where it's installed. I love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized I can't even play it! Rockstar please fix this. I know its all softwear sided.

2017-03-02,0,0,142,False,Recommended,This game is ok 7/10 one star goes down to the toxic player community second for the overpriced ingame items in GTA Online. The clothing vehicles guns are overpriced almost forcing one to buy Shark ingame money which will never happen. (also the Exchange market for Online seems to be down).And third to the abysimal loading times it requires to do anything in GTA Online. I have it on a M.2 SSD should load instantly but still takes the same time as with a standard Hard disk. My Internet is 400 Mbits down 20 Mbits up.Hats down for the really nice optimisations the Developers did the game runs like a charm on about any modern PC configuration even Dual Core CPUs have no problems running it.If you can get it for 25 30 Euros its an OK price but not worth the 60 Euro Price tag.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-27,0,0,386,False,Recommended,Yes there are cheaters. But if they are passive I don't mind because i play like in single player for missions for properties gameplay and earning money. I don't care about random scums who get everything via modded money because you can do the same in singleplayer if you wanted. And the game looses the fun with modded money.The online gameplay is not like SA MP or MTA SA. Someones says there is no singleplayer extending updates but the whole point of GTA O is to extend singleplayer with fourth character.GTA O should be treated singleplayer with friends. It's not like SA MP roleplay where you can own some property in server while the others don't. In my opinion many people are confusing this.Peace.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yet the inability to create custom servers with seperate money/settings all of the dlc based on having to buy shark cards or spend lots of ingame money to even gain anything is absolutely disgusting. I've cheated I bought things for 20 milion and never had them removed. There are people who bought 150 eur worth of shark cards that were banned for being in a lobby with a cheater. If TAKE2 would provide dedicated servers and more gameplay features rather than just different models/colours of cards i'd change the review. Build up on the heists create better lobbies make people join different sorts of events than just mindless money making because you can't afford anything.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-17,0,0,179,False,Recommended,I last played this for about a year fairly solidly on the 360. It has definitely evolved a fair amount since then. Love the extra filling out of details and the 1st person mode. Took a long time before I could get it cheap enough to justify getting it again but glad I did eventually. Online is great fun with a friend but can be very frustrating with the large amount of hackers and trouble getting certain match types started. Also can be a time and money sink for a lot of unneccesary but fun items. I will always recommend this game despite all it's issues. The single player is fantastic immersive and detailed the controls are gnerally pretty solid for driving and shooting and there just isn't anything quite as good in the open world genre as this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-29,0,0,946,False,Recommended,I have played this game since 360 I have liked this game for a while and putting in around 1k on xbox 360 to around 800 on PC this game has a awesome single player story about a washed up hiester to about the new blood hiester and the crazed manic hiester. Its well done and the re play ability is there since this is the PC verson you have the ability to mod the game singleplayer whitch gives it more re play ability. i just love trying to 100% the game from time to time it's really fun to do and worth the grind. now my views on the online part of the game went to getting real board of the game things kept getting more expensive and grinding the same thing made me just not care for it anymore But there is free DLC and this is beacuse of the mircotransactions in the game. you have access to everything and if you are a new player you will not have to worry about the grind as much do to you playing all the missions for the first time and if you save all of it till your hiesting missions and do all the challages you could get around 14 million to spend on what ever you want. the game online gets stale real quick when you become max rank and own all the OVERPOWED stuff. just going around to kill other players is fun for like 1 hour then its not that fun and gets stale. The game modes are fun for like 30 mins and the freemode jobs get boring quick aswell and even could make a player mad if he/she is not good at PVP do to the fact that you need to be in a public online game to do the CEO or MC work. To be real the game is Fun to new players but if you just got a PC and already had Gta for Xbox 1/ PS4 then its only worth for the mods and the Five M stuff if you want more of the New kinda fun apart from that its a good game online gets stale if you already had the game but if you are new you will like it.,Grand Theft Auto V

All updates with new cars planes weapons and more are adding to game automaticly as DLCs and you dont need to pay anything else if you dont want to. Because of all those memories with friends and because new friends what I met in GTA V game was worth it to the last cent. I recommend this game to the group of friends because especially with more friends game is really awesome and you will never get bored.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-09,0,0,61,False,Recommended,I can't speak for the online portion of the game as I haven't played too much of it. However the single player aspect gets a thumbs up from me. While the story itself is nothing to write home about the missions itself are mostly fun and varied. What I truly love about this game though is Los Santos itself. I actually enjoy taking a relaxing long walk through the city often times exploring the alleyways and hoping to get mugged (Sadly not possible). The con for this game is also the city itself. Even with its great attention to details Los Santos can feel empty at times. I always wish things would happen like uh getting mugged. Anyway if you're looking for a game that's not too hard to beat and offers a lot of ways to relax I totally recommend this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-14,0,0,163,False,Recommended,There are many aspects of this game to consider so I will break it down into two obvious catagories pros and cons PROS 1. Extremely entertaining2. Massive community3. Tons of content4. Large but static map5. Very complex6. Very diverseCONS 1. By no means is this game PG 142. Heavily a Pay to Play game or a lot of grinding3. Many modders to screw up your day4. A bug here and there that resets your entire account5. Faulty cheat detection system6. Normal difficulty is quite difficultAll in all with the five years it took Rockstar to make the game it is very professional. It has quite literally THOUSANDS of hours of content while keeping the controls and UI simple. Great leveling system minus the matchmaking system. In my opinion the game is worth the full $60 and even more at that but the game goes on sale frequently. So if you are wanting this game just wait a couple of weeks and buy it on sale. Also do a little looking on what the best way to get money is because it is a definite grind!,Grand Theft Auto V

But.. if you are only in it for GTA Online then you'll get roughly 20 hours of fun out of 130 hours of playing because of all the grinding you have to do to afford something thanks to Shark Cards as well as a lot of cheaters.. because Rockstar don't know how to combat online cheating. Literally look up ""GTA Online Cheaters"" into YouTube and you'll see what I mean. furthermore I guarantee that if this game did not have SharkCards (Microtransactions aka Something I've hated since 2012) then it would actually be fun to grind. Because it takes so so long to make any money unless you play for around 4 hours everyday for 3 weeks.

2016-10-19,0,0,2537,False,Not Recommended,"As this game is still being maintained and updated my review changes too... 26 Mar 2018 I do not recommend for now Singleplayer is fun but Online with friends is better. However I do not recommend playing this Online right now because everyone is getting banned for no reason. R* clearly has a problem with its anticheat system however they do not seem to fix that any time soon since it goes on for over 3 days. Another great thing from R* is their ""customer support"" where some bot closes your ticket with no solution and predefined message after 3 days of waiting.TL DR you pay 60 for game patiently grind money for hours never cheat get banned for that and tech support is non existent. 19 Jun 2017 I recommend Gunrunning update and mods banAfter some time Rockstar gave us new update which added some new stuff and missions. Some content which was in past few years added to multiplayer is now available in storymode too. And even vehicles which were exclusive for returning players (Dukes Duke'o Death Blista Compact ...) were made available for everyone. Altough these new bunkers and vehicles are still expensive it's not that bad as it was in Import/Export update. You still have to pay at least $1.2M for bunker and similar amount for a truck. Most expensive vehicle comes at $3.5M which is still better than $6M as in previous update.Also if you figure out how NPCs and missions work you can avoid much trouble. For example as I described in second update of this review (see lower) how NPCs keep shooting or ramming a car you try to import or supplies you want to deliver you can avoid damage by killing them off (not in case of cops coming after you). After you travel approximately 400 meters (1/4 mile) the game generates 1 6 waves of enemies. You simply park your car somewhere off the road go far enough so it wont be damaged wait for the enemies and shoot them down.Next point Rockstar must have had a weaker moment. A few weeks before update they gave us double RP &amp GTA$ bonus on contact missions. We made some nice money. But what no one expected they set potential takes from heists to double. Based on this I expected much higher prices for updates content.And finally to the ban of the mods There were times I played GTA SA and SA MP and I can't imagine these games without mods. Then the GTA IV came and it was somewhat hard to mod it (in 2009 ofc). After some time I get used to original game. And in GTA V I never felt any need to mod this game. It's perfect as it is. Sometimes I look at some mods on modding sites and youtube but almost everytime quality is not there. And mods 'just for fun'? Nothing was that awesome I had to have it. Also there is that factor I am primarily Online player.Of course this is just my opinion for mods. But I don't understand behavior of majority here. You are reviewing and judging whole game just by one single point ability to modify. I think that this step was unnecessary and is not fair by Take Two however don't tell me you bought 60 game with rich story great voice acting awesome graphics big open world with many details various people vehicles animals biomes and even somewhat great multiplayer just to install crappy mods. 4 Jan 2017 I do not recommend Import/Export updateActually story mode is great. Nice story lots of fun many side activites a lot of details.However online is not so great anymore. Someone will say there are free DLCs but the truth is that any new content is made to force people to buy shark cards. Since adding Yachts the game was transformed to R* money extractor.Yeah new missions are being added but what is it for? You play it 3 times and it's boring then. Additionaly you get paid only + $20k. And then you get 10 minutes cooldown for it and every other mission in same category. Well that's something like $100k+ per hour. So if you want to buy some of the new stuff (approx. $3M 6M) you have to grind for money at least almost 30 hours. Great huh? Or you can buy a card more expensive than game itself that will give you $8M. And you can buy another when next DLC comes out.Last DLC Import/Export brought a new element which ""pays"". After you buy Office ($1.5M) and vehicle warehouse (another $1.5M) you can steal selected vehicles. You have to pay for all the damage the vehicle have taken on route from the place of theft to warehouse. And here comes the nonsence created by R* to prevent players from getting some good money. NPC know exactly where you are and go after you. Yes there is a tracker in stolen vehicle but why do NPCs damage the car and keep ramming into you? Another thing when exporting vehicle you remove tracker and change completely appearance of vehicle including license plate. NPCs still know where you are and where you are heading. I know there should be some challenge for player but this is just frustrating. And if you still do not think R* is money milking players. Ask yourselves why there are no new heists? Vehicles ""missions"" adversary modes etc. are still coming. 19 Oct 2016 I recommend Pre Import/Export updateIt's ok...",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Fantastic game I played it for 6 hours and decided to get the refund for it. The reason? I already owned the PS3 version and decided that $60 wasn't worth the small amount of upgrades in this version plus my computer can't run it with max graphics. When in about 4 years when it goes on sale for like $10 and I have a better PC I will defintley buy this again. So if you're someone who already has this on PS3/Xbox 360/PS4/Xbox One then I recommend waiting for a much lower price but if you've never experiences GTA V before then buy this now don't even wait for a sale just spend that 60 dollars.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,219,False,Recommended,"A great game I really liked it.In comparison to any other GTA game you have more than one playable character (as you should already know) which is a real nice idea You have an explorable map! You unlock every part of the map by being in the place this is something which surprised me and I REALLY liked it because it makes a lot more sense than having everything from the beginning. and the game becomes some sort of exploration.I liked as usual that it's Open World and stuff you are free to do whatever you want. I really liked the car customization here and it's better than GTA San Andreas which are from what I know are the only games where you can actually customize your cars and not just respray and all that stuff. The NPCs here are smart finally they actually try to dodge your car when rushing towards their car but sometimes they by ""dodging"" actually hit my car sometimes I mean they're dodging in the wrong direction but it isn't that bad. The Heists! of course it is a real cool thing they added here you can rob shops and prepare for heists. I still didn't touch the Online game so I won't say anything about how it works there. I also really liked the way you have to avoid cops. It is a lot more realistic but if you drive into a ""Los Santos Customs"" and wait there for a while the cops won't look for you or wait for you to come out. It is something which should be fixed (here I'm not sure maybe I got it wrong).The overall gameplay is pretty hard for me it took to somewhere 25% completion to really understand how the game works and the 25% took me around 8 hours of gameplay which is a long time for an average gamer like me.There is one thing which just has to be added to the game Remote Detonator for Sticky Bombs! (Here I'm also not sure if there isn't but I was searching the web and the keyboard assignments and didn't find anything useful)Overall I'll give this game an 8.5/10 mostly for the hard time I got understanding how the game works.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,2586,False,Not Recommended,Story Los Santos is gorgeous and fun to just cruise around and look at. Beautiful lighting. Music is great. Great voice acting. Game runs good. Good vehicle dynamics handling and selection. Story was very unoriginal with unoriginal characters I completed 70% before I lost interest. Online MMO play style with an economy. Peer to peer netcode. No server browswer or community servers. Endless connection issues freezes and session timeouts. Matchmaking is terrible for races deathmatches etc it's very hard to find a lobby with more than 5 people. Repetitive gameplay. DLC is extremely expensive and requires lots of time grinding the same missions over and over or buying sharkcards. They released a car that was $60 in shark cards! Every update has lots of bugs. Are currently banning players for no reason and the customer support is non existent. No community engagement or communication. Not mod friendly.It can be fun to just mess around in freeroam with your friends but that gets old after awhile.I spend most of my time racing with a group of people which I do enjoy. I like the vehicle dynamics there are lots of vehicles to chose from and they all have unique handling. And vehicle mods are pretty damn solid. User created tracks are awesome. But we still have constant connection issues where the entire lobby will freeze because one person dropped for example.Even though I have 2 000+ hours in the game and there are many positives about the game there are too many negative aspects for me to recommend it universally.

2018-01-06,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Very underrated game with excellent combat. I love the hack 'n slash elements with warrior. The only game i can compare the epic combat goodness to is Vindictus which in my opinion is very repeditive. The artstyle in this game is very beautiful and with a level 40+ character on the europe server i can guarantee you that the maps are very unique to eachother. The terrain combined with the enviroment and monster designs I'm truly impressed. You do see some enemies that are recycled BUT they differ ALOT from their other models. As you progress in the game you see variations of the mobs you have met before. Depending on the environment and level they have their unique style. There are only a few monsters that get evolved like this and they are iconic to the game. The rest of the mobs are also very detailed even though you only see them for about 30 minutes 2 hours. That can be said the same about the environment. The lighting + the art and particles really makes you drop your jaw when you travel through the landscapes. There are all kinds of environments but one thing I really wish to see is a little bit more modern factory of some sort. Other than that you see all kinds of enviroments. Mines forests with unicorns fields underground dungeons cathedrals grasslands woodlands you name it! Some people might think that this game is repeditive and in the start i think so too! But once you get started and get your own mount and get past level 25+ the game really shows it true beauty.I'd give this game a 8/10 but it's FOR FREE AND THERE'S NO PTW SYSTEM (except for cosmetics but that ain't PTW) SO I'LL GIVE IT A 10/10 THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND ITS LITERALLY 500+ HOURS OF PURE EYECANDY NOT TO MENTION IT'S MULTIPLAYER AND YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITH ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS MAKING IT SO MUCH MORE FUN.10 OUT OF F*CKING 10,Grand Theft Auto V

Money is a problem too with all the new content that is being released many of these new vehicles and items are very expensive. The grinding for money is insane when playing solo.

The game is an absolute grind fest and filled with hackers that Rockstar never fix. They release DLC fix small hacks new ones come out rinse and repeat. because with those new DLC's it intices you to buy more shark cards and so they temporally fix hacks to stop from gaining more cash so you can't spend it for real.

2017-06-20,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,I bought the GTA V for Xbox 360 then Xbox one and now PC. The only reason I even had the slightest inclination to do so was for my interest in single player modding. Not a single interest to bring it in to the GTA V Online portion of the game as I am sure millions of us do. I am sorry that a few bad eggs can ruin it for everyone but those that wish to cheat online are still going to do so. It would be one thing if the Online DLC was even worth it but honestly every pack that comes out sucks. And nothing has come out for single player in years. I would not even be playing GTA V again if it wasnt for my ability to enhance the single player mode for my enjoyment.All in favor of boycotting GTA 6 say 'I'.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"Finished the game on PS3 a while ago but for the PC version + I expected first person mode to be a gimmick that wasn't really functional but it works well. Even taking cover during combat works in first person mode. The movement controls also become ""standard FPS"" controls e.g. your character moves at a running speed by default and sprints when you press shift whereas in third person mode your character will walk by default rather than run.+ Performance is surprisingly good. On a single GTX 970 I am running the game maxed at 1920x1080 and the frame rate has never dropped below 60 FPS. If I remove my 60 FPS frame rate cap it's usually hovering 70+. Seems like Rockstar learned from GTA4's poor optimization on PC. The graphics quality performance ratio is very good.+ Lots of graphics options.+ M+KB controls are much better than GTA4. All menus work well with the mouse.+ High frame rate support for high refresh rate monitors. Mouse input seems to have no acceleration but is tied to frame rate so you need a constant frame rate for consistent mouse input. If your frame rate changes your mouse speed can become stupidly fast or very slow. Rockstar Social Club is still a thing rather than being fully integrated with Steam.Haven't had any crashes or issues yet but I've just started.

The moment to moment gameplay is both fantastic and totally wasted on the online component single player especially with mods is where the loving detail and dynamism of this game really shines.

2017-06-16,0,0,85,False,Recommended,TakeTwo s recent actions have been appalling where Rockstar have actively engaged in the Modding community for nearly a decade going so far as to showcase many mods on their official blog their parent company in TakeTwo have just destroyed all that hard work and effort and forever soured the relationship between the modding community &amp Rockstar Games.This has nothing to do with game hacks and even if it did there are other ways this could have been dealt with and the OpenIV team would have certainly treated the misuse of their program as a priority &amp worked to patch any exploits hackers may have found to misuse on GTA Online. The unsurprising truth is that it boils down to TakeTwo not making enough money ($700 million from Microtransactions alone GTAV has made over $3 billion and counting since release on a budget north of $250 million) and it seems that they believe that through this heavy handed approach that they ll somehow safeguard microtransactions. The worst part is this has done nothing to stop hackers at all because most (leaving as most until evidence to the contrary has been provided) hackers don t use OpenIV.The game is good mods made it better and TakeTwo is run by Satan.Edit Rockstar have finally convinced TakeTwo that prohibiting OpenIV was a bad idea and they have have now reversed their cease &amp desist order.

Here's a summary of my online experience Spend a lot of time getting killed at low levels by people in helicopters jets armored cars basically anything because I can't afford better stuff. don't understand how the companies / warehouses work so I didn't get a good warehouse and gaining money is slow. making money takes a stupid long time.. spend like 10 hours of grinding at least for one car or gun. community is full of trolls and a*holes. open lobbies are mediocre at best... just sort of an annoying way to get from one job to the next or do side missions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-16,0,0,419,False,Recommended,As someone who had never played a GTA game before I can say that this one is worth the money.Graphics pretty for when it was released realistic and well optimized (the game doesn't let me run in native resolution on my machine for some reason but it looks fine and still looks better/runs smoother than Fallout 4)Gameplay rewarding fun and versatile. You can hire a hooker then beat them up and take a selfie with their corpse or chase down a purse snatcher on foot and return a handbag to a sweet old lady. The coice is yours.Mechanics easy to pick up doesn't really feel like anything is missing and there isn't aything that feels unnecessary either.Environment the world building is excellent. It sort of feels like the opposite of Saints Row whereas in that game you have a wacky cast of characters amid people trying to go about their daily lives in GTAV you play as an array of deep realistic fleshed out characters as they navigate a world of ridiculous cliches.Really my only complaint with the game (apart from the fact that the online mode is a little buggy) is that some of the controls are confusing. What a certain key does can be totally contextual every type of vehicle has a different conrol scheme and when the game mentions a new control it basicappy tosses it up on the screen briefly then assumes you'll remember it forever.

2017-06-15,0,0,226,False,Recommended,I said I would and I am one to keep my word. Rockstar you've somehow managed to turn my view of ya around in a single year. Getting Take Two to back off only solidified my respect for Rockstar.. and only Rockstar in this case. Now if only everyone else will follow suit that participated in the review bombing to change their review to a more honest one. Rather than just leaving a review to spite Take Two.As for an actual review I couldn't give a less about the story. Everyone I know enjoys it but I just can't be bothered to go through it again after going through most of it on the 360 God knows how many years ago. I know just stick to Online with friends and flying around because the flight mechanics are ing brilliant. They aren't Flight Sim levels but it strikes a perfect balance for me in being mechanically thoughtful while being forgiving enough to be consistently fun as would be expected in a GTA game. The recent updates to GTA Online have been nothing short of amazing. The Gun Runner's update is solid though I wish content like this would have been added months ago I can't complain too much as they are still supporting the Online component this far down the line. The Online may be difficult to get started with. They make it exceedingly difficult to get worthwhile amounts of money without farming heists. If you have friends like mine that don't have the patience or care to grind out heists for multiple days then progress will be far less than stellar. GET UR TUNA CARDZ HUR! I never review games. I think this is the first I've ever done and this really isn't even a review.This is a ing amazing piece of work. GTA Online has it's flaws but for those like I that have a passion for growing numbers and or ing around in the vehicles this is perfect. But... TAKE TWO! I don't even use the mods created by or in part by Open IV but this turn of events is ing insane and the publisher can very much get a sense of the community's reaction with this and many other reviews. If and when this show gets sorted out I will then change the review to postive or even remove it and leave a genuine review.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-31,0,0,253,False,Recommended,Nowadays I'm mostly involved with playing online rather than the story mode if only because so much of the content that was released online was never released for story mode. That said unless you have hundreds in disposable income to spend online or you have at least six hours a day to spend just grinding for the next vehicle/property I really can't recommend GTA online. It's really unfortunate because I do think that if there were only a few improvements on the game shorter loading screens missions that didn't end if even one person leaves or disconnects and cutting down on the excessive cost creep of new additions to the game this would without a doubt be *the* best online multiplayer out there bar none. GTA has the unique attribute of being whatever type of game you want it to be a flight simulator a racer a builder an fps you name it. The developers did all of these things well. In the single player mode you have a damn good story the only downside is the lack of new content that ended up going to online only.The online community is somewhat deprived invariably because of how difficult it is for someone with less than half the day to play this game to make progress at a steady clip. In general I very rarely see subjects pertaining to whether there's a modder in the lobby who can give cash not part of the conversation in the chat. There's just enough of a thrill in killing and griefing in freemode for a lot of players that ends up making freemode a crappy place to be in most cases. If you find this game on sale get it for the single player campaign. It's a beauty. But as for the online multiplayer I would be wary unless you have friends that play this game with you.,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player is good fun (just like the other gtas) and humorous.The multiplayer is where it really shone out for me as I loved playing gta 4 on multiplayer admitedly no team mafia work but lots of crazy special races survival and businesses to run as you slowly accumulate hoardes of wealth and real estate (it's a long grind but great with friends). Heists are probably the best part of multiplayer I've found so far at level 89.The loading times to get on servers can be a bit frustrating at times (5 seconds to several minutes) but then they have a rather large online player base for the servers to cater for.There aren't many games I can play for more than 300 hours and still come back for more! Totally got my moneys worth out of this gem for 20 given the time I've had out of this I would almost pay full price for it!It is a bit cpu intensive my old fx6350 struggled to run this in 1080p at 60fps while my new ryzen handles it well.Highly recommend this to any gta fan.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Rewriting review because of update on OpenIV situation and some things I had wrong in the previous review.Singleplayer OpenIV is now legal again! Along with that ScriptHookV was updated! This game has so much you can do to the single player with mods and the mod loaders (such as OpenIV and ScriptHookV) actively prevent you from going online so nobody using said loaders can mess with other people! The story is great and mods let you do SO MUCH MORE once you've completed the single player!Multiplayer It's a really REALLY long grind to get stuff unless you buy shark cards (don't... just don't. It's not worth it). Once you get to higher levels and get a lot of money it's a lot easier to get what you want and to get new cars/weapons as they're added to the game. That being said there is a major problem with cheaters in online (note this is not due to OpenIV or ScriptHookV as those mods prevent you from going online if they are installed). This wouldn't be a huge deal if R* didn't ban some users for picking up money cheaters drop and leaving others alone (including the cheaters /). People also care VERY LITTLE about you and your vehicles in public lobbies. In private or friend only lobbies though online is pretty enjoyable! Had some funny things happen in a friend only lobby that I doubt would happen in a public lobby.Overall GTA V has an amazing single player that is infinitely expandable with mods and a multiplayer that is pretty grindy but lots of fun once you get yourself going.,Grand Theft Auto V

When I tried leaving it at 60hz or 99 hz the inital crashing stopped. Then i started getting intermittent ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT crashes to desktop sometimes combined with nvlddmkm error telling me to reboot or reinstall the game every 10 minutes to 2 hours. Also I was seeing a lot of screen tearing with or without v sync no difference. After looking around for troubleshooting advice I found a solution that worked for me here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v TjEQmZrRmtEIt turns out that some cards' max boost clocks don't match the standard boost value being reported. Since I adjusted the values low enough I've been playing crash free for 15 hours or so.Now that I have been able to enjoy the game a bit it's turning out to be a real work of gaming art.

2015-05-05,0,0,49,False,Recommended,GTA V (Or GTAV whichever you perfer) is the new console ported entry to the GTA series. Given that GTA was a predominantly PC first series the console only focus of GTAV really shows in its various buggy or poor implementations of graphics and controls. For one thing cursor movement speed is usually inversely proportional to the actual framerate which means that a workaround involving VSync and various other settings (usage of TXAA is recommended if you have Nvidia) are needed to lessen this effect. Technical issues aside the game has a few new things like improved physics engine (still as funny as GTAIV) and the like. In the grand scheme of things these features are not important. Let's get to the real part.GTA V Solo You act out the life of various shady characters trying to make their way up in the world starting with Franklin an ethnically black American who is sick of all the gang violence and wants to become big in a legitimate way. At the player's behest Franklin can do such things as make his dog fetch live grenades cap supposed 'OG's with his pistol (not a glock not held sideways thankfully) and do repo jobs to make some dosh and get involved in an exciting police chase. This part is kind of fun and has a decent storyline. You can find the story elsewhere this isn't what most people go for.GTA(V) Online This is what most people buy GTAV for. If you were expecting it to be like the older GTAO implementation then you are d e a d w r o n g exactly right. A lot of players who play GTAV have never played GTAIII or any of the classic GTAs and are liable to be the same people who bought Payday 2 when it was on sale a year ago a year after its first release from beta. What does this mean? Well...Some players think they're 'all that' and try to do drivebys on unsuspecting players in their armored car. If you see one of these wanna be gangsters do everyone a favor and launch a rocket at it. Anyone not being a jerk with an armored car will thank you for it.Older players a r e p r a c t i c a l l y n o n e x i s t a n t m o s t l y d u e t o t i m e c o n s t r a i n t s . T h e y t e n d t o b e m o r e r e a s o n a b l e a n d t e a m w o r k o r i e n t a t e d b u t d o n ' t t a k e t h i s f o r g r a n t e d . are sometimes the same people who griefed others with jets and kurumas (the armored car) sometimes repeatedly spawnstrafing/camping the same area nonstop for hours. They might also call you a noob if you used the Homing Rocket on their fancy jet.Passive Mode is supposed to be a counter to random deathmatching in the streets but given that Passive Mode also means cops can shoot you to death for nudging their patrol car this is a terrible idea and makes no sense whatsoever. Why R* felt the need to disable weapon usage against NPCs is l e f t t o s p e c u l a t i o n probably something to do with how vehicles work in game currently.If you use a microphone somewhere in a public match keep in mind it's not restricted to your friends alone. Everyone can hear you and there's no proximity limit for this.Do not DO NOT play GTAO without friends. Doing heists with pubs is exactly the same problem as doing heists with pubs in Payday 2. Why the comparison? It's not the crime related focus of both games it's because both have the same kind of players. Playing GTAO without friends is like having a social affair (pun intended) with random people who broke into your house. Chances are someone will start the blaming game for why the heist went wrong or someone will get the wrong idea and kick other players to get ALL THE DOSH Done only in PD2 does not work anyhow or some stupid misunderstanding will occur and nobody will have fun. Don't play without friends. If you have to buy 3 other copies and gift it to your friends and make them play it with you because playing GTAO alone is a dumb idea. You've been warned.In short GTAV plays well it looks nice but it has a huge slew of problems. If you're not easily swayed then don't buy this game. If you have friends who would actually play with you the result might be enjoyable. It's only by 'similar socioeconomic factors' that I actually have friends who own GTAV so the experience was quite fun apart from the punks who keep shooting me when i'm trying to get an apartment invite.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is okay on its own but not worth the 18 month delay.""Since this review Rockstar have came out and said the Mods are welcome on the singleplayer part of GTAV but they wish to protect the Online portion. Install as many mods as you please but remember to remove them before heading online. Forgetting to do so will more than likely result in a ban. I still feel this game was not worth the 18 month delay and it is okay on its own but it is still a quality game a good port and is open to singleplayer modding.

The way i play is i like to cause as much mayhem as possible by blowing things up shooting cops and seeing how far i get before dying. but now i have to manage ammo make sure my car is not impounded and when i die i lose a good hunk of any money i have on hand. i understand that in order to have most of the fun things in online the money has to exist but its just a bummer having to manage my finances while blowing up cop cars.Edit (1/5/18)My veiws have changed and its a beef with the company not the game. GTAV is still the recycled title its always been. Rockstar needs work. Im sure ill get tons of and hardly anyone will belive me but here it goes.Around july last year i think I decided to join my friend on an empty public server. we normally play on private only and i personally hate the public scene but it was the only way to play those corprate missions the ones were you own maze bank tower or something. so he invited me to the company. this was also around the time this monstertruck that tied in for xbox owners or something like that i dont care he had a monstertruck that was exclusive. we drove that around and ended up at his company building. we walk inside and he was looking through warehouse missions. i sat in the chair on the other side of the desk and changed positions. i did it rapidly because it looked funny to see my guy spaz around in a chair. then i got suspended just cut to black ""you have been suspended"". i dont mod the game dont even know how if i wanted to. i have never come into contact with a cheater nor have my friends.now i tried to contact rockstar i had worked on this character for quite some time and did not want to lose it all because i was finding a grain of fun in desert of meh that is this game. i naturally went to the fourms and filed a dispute. i was instantly and with no human involvemnt denied. ticket closed they wont even give me a reason. i called number after number i filed more tickets under diffrent catagories all getting the same genaric response. rockstar needs to remove the golden in their and at least give a reason provide a small bit of proof on why people get banned. rockstar is a huge comapny with billions and yet they can find the funds to have a quality system in place to resolve issues like this. i lost everything and now me and my 4 friends dont touch this game.

2018-01-06,0,0,106,False,Not Recommended,To start with I purchased this game solely to play it online with friends and while private sessions are ok and the general idea behind the game is great it does not work as intended due to the overwhelming number of hackers and abusers.GTA Online requires the player to grind for money so they can unlock stuff and a neat feature I thought was the CEO missions which you can do once you get a CEO office and warehouse. Sadly though the missions require you to be in a public game to do and they missions are designed so that other players can attack you during them to earn money for themselves and this is where the entire issue comes into play.So I have to invest money into a mission and if it fails I lose that money but if it succeeds then I can make profits. Since every game lobby you go into has a hacker running around slaughtering everyone this becomes impossible. There is no way to get any of these CEO missions completed in a profitable manner and the game forces you to join public games before you can do them. This means you are forced to do boring events like the slashers game or races over and over just to earn money and to me its just no fun.It would of been much better to just have actual NPC driven missions the player has to complete for the CEO missions and then allow them to play them solo or with just a group of trusted friends.This game had potential but there doesn't seem to be enough being done to stop the abusers and hackers.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online got boring quick for me but thats because all of my mates played it on the console when it first came out so i had noone to play it with. The game is way too casual and hand holding just to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Missions feel so streamlined and scripted game is way to easy no challenge at all game prompts every 5 seconds telling you what to do so you never have to use your brain overpowered abilities aim assist on controller is literally press fire button to win you don't need to move that right stick at all and the game actually lets you skip missions if you fail over 3 times.

First got it on PS4 and really loved it but started to get bored by the vanilla content. Also seeing users on youtube playing it with mods really made me decide to put some extra money into the game to get it on PC. Now if you haven't heard recently Take Two has decided to get rid of Open IV which is the foundation of lots of these GTA V mods. The only reason I bought this game on PC was to mod. I don't play online and I don't plan to. Them getting rid of Open IV will just stop me from playing this game. Give me long enough and it will be a distant memory that I couldn't give two about.

This is honestly just Rockstar trying keep in line and not standing up to this t.This is fully at the control of Take (ing the Two. and Rockstar is just bending over like a to themThey found out that mods can take the content that's restricted for online only and put them inn single player and because they don't want that happening to their cash flow they decided to basically ban all types of mods just so that they get more money. T2 and Rockstar.Looks like they finally eased off and let OpenIV be free.Moral of this story don't with mods. This has happened before and will sadly happen again.Anyways gettting that out of the way this game is actually really good.It's a very fun open world experience with great characters and a beautiful world to explore.While Online is just stocked full of mircotransactions it's a blast to around with friends.and when that's still enough for you you can MOD in additional content for the singleplayer.So at the end of the day it's a good game just has a bad publisher,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-13,0,0,1473,False,Not Recommended,GTA 5 would be an amazing game if it had a better supported single player component as well as better balancing for their much lauded Online as well.Currently single player simply feels more like an extended tutorial meant to teach you how GTA Online is played. Any new content that comes out is strictly for Online save for a few extra vehicles that manage to make their way back to the SP content.Tie into that the lack of actual balancing in the Online mode updates a mostly toxic community consisting of griefers and modders (not the good kind either) as well as the entire gameplay experience being tailored as a playable commercial for Shark Cards and what used to be some beloved has become little more than an extended scene of torture and sophmoric trolling on the part of Rockstar and it's parent company.It's bad enough that Rockstar even censors it's own name in Online chat.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,421,False,Recommended,This...game...is...AWESOME!Rockstar has lived up to its name of providing us with some great gameplay experiences. The wait was well worth it. Controller support is great for those who like to use controllers. The graphics are stunning even not at their highest. The options are very customizible so you can change things to what your graphics card can handle. Mine can handle most stuff on high and even at that setting I am blown away.GTAOnline provides a great experience where you can meet other players from around the world. Having seen the failure of GTAIV's limited online play I must say that Rockstar outdid themselves to make improvements. I like that so far the updates to Online have been free. Way to go Rockstar! Also there is no fee needed to play Online. I would recommend using a microphone with GTAOnline. It allows for certain jobs to proceed smoother when you don't have to type out communication. This is especially important for Heists as teamwork is key. There are a few glitches that happen ocassionally but they don't ruin the experience and Rockstar makes sure to address them after they are made known. I would score this game at 10/10 5/5 5 stars... or whatever other scoring system you use.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-25,0,0,519,False,Recommended,A definite upgrade from its predecessor. Rockstar took a massive leap forward with GTA V. The storyline is a non stop Hollywood act of explosions and chaos in the best form. The characters all carry unique personalities and their reactions to the environment is well versed to match their personas. The online though is where GTA V truly shines. I've never had a dull moment in game when I've played online and it's the best experience I've ever had even when I achieve nothing besides a hospital trip and a hilarious story. With world events adversary modes heists and a huge list of missions I've yet to run out of things to do in that alone.However there's quite a few things wrong with the game in my opinion. The police's reaction to your crimes is horribly exaggerated and while often it's humorous it's mostly just annoying when I can't drive a few feet without instant 3+ stars. The hackers are a hit and miss in the servers and often they're causing rampage and just trolling because they're bored. Which this has led to several incidents of spontaneous death while I'm trying to do simple things like turn my cash into the atm and such. There's also the issue with the servers themselves. Lag is frequent even on hosted games involving only a few friends and I've yet to hear anything about a fix lol.Overall though a great game and a wonderful experience. Nice job on that.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,114,False,Recommended,"Okay for the mature audiences of course let me start by saying that this game is truly amazing. The graphics on this game are amazingly beautiful and I am not even playing it at 1080p. I have a whole 720p resolution and still think that this game is gorgeous. The gameplay is smooth and highly addicting. This game though has two complaints from me. A.) I play this game with an Xbox One controller and from time to time I have to unplug it and plug it back in because it will begin to not respond but simply stick as if I were holding RT or LT. It's minor and something that a patch down the road will probably fix so no worries there.B.) The only other complaint that I have in this game is that when using the self radio feature (note that I have the music option turned all the way up) the music is very difficult to hear it isn't as loud and nice as the other channels I am not sure if this is just for me or anyone else but that is just a minor complaint. I give this game a 9/10 only because of my two complaints. Strongly recommend one trying this game out because I can almost guarentee you will greatly enjoy it with great satisfaction. And if you are wondering if you can run this game probably so. When I asked everyone said ""you will only get low seconds 30ish fps even though it is at 720p. Well I can prove them wrong because for me this game is running at 45 50ish fps at high settings at 720p. Here is my system specs if you want to compare to if you can run this game. I strongly recommend you have something close to this at a minimum.SPECS AMD FX 6350MSI GTX 750ti TF OC EditionMSI 970 GAMING MOTHERBOARDG.SKILL RIPJAWS X 8gb (2x4gb)320gb WD CAVIAR BLUE HDD",Grand Theft Auto V

Shut down modding presumably because they're out of touch and thought it was an online cheating tool. Despite that either unwilling or incapable of permanently deterring cheaters. The higher ups have nothing but absolute giggling contempt for you and have used this game to find an equilibrium point between keeping customers willing to pay and charging for as much as possible.

2015-04-15,0,0,92,False,Recommended,At first I had rated this game poor due to constant crashes and lock ups with it. I had thought it was the game itself but after some trouble shooting I found the root cause was an outdated bios on my motherboard. Seems GTA V is the first game to push the CPU hard enough to expose the issue with the older bios. After the bios update the game has yet to crash or lockup.If you have an ASUS Maximus VI motherboard with a bios older than rev 1603 installed and have lockups / crashes. Install rev 1603 it will fix the lockup and crash issues.This is by far the best GTA game yet and the PC version was worth waiting for. The graphics are insane. Being able to jump between mouse and keyboard and 360 controller is awesome. Drive a car on the controller get to a roof top then jump to mouse and keyboard and use a sniper rifle.My PC can run this on max settings and rarely see FPS drop under 52 fps i7 4790k16 GBGeForce 980GTX500 GB Samsung 850Windows 10 Pro,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,20,False,Recommended,As I promised I am changing my review from a negative one to a positive one following the reversal of the decision to order a cease &amp desist to OpenIV's modding team. I'm glad they have rethought this decision and made the right call. I do enjoy this game but I did get a little bored with it after a while. I really do need the mods to stay interested and even then it gets a bit stale. The online portion is a hellhole filled with microtransactions and people doing annoying stupid things so I say stay away from there unless you're into that. But I would recommend the single player game for sure.Below is my previous review I referenced above.Take Two has made a very consumer hostile decision in deciding to issue a cease &amp desist to the OpenIV team who make (or I guess made) a platform for modding GTA for the past ten years. The only reasoning that can be pointed to is that Take Two has decided that they have not been getting the in game micro transaction revenue they want from the multiplayer portion and so are actively trying to cripple the singleplayer portion to drive people over. This move essentially disables the majority of mods made for the game and their future development. I know I am not alone in buying GTA V on PC in part for the ability to mod the game. Modding is part of what makes gaming on PC intriguing and is something that should never be made illegal which is what Take Two has done in their attack on OpenIV and their own player base. Shame on Take Two. I love the game but it's better with mods. I am leaving a bad review of this game in protest of their actions and will gladly change it back to a positive review if Take Two reverses their decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-23,0,0,1479,False,Not Recommended,"At this point I can only be angry at rockstar for their online support. Don't make an online game if you aren't going to do it correctly. I mean people being banned for being in the same session as a hacker? And on top of that you decide to wipe out players that you have any suspicion of hacking as well asnot allowing you to even try to get your account back. You'll get on the phone with rockstar support and they will be like ""Hello this is rockstar technical support how may I help you?"" Then you say something like ""Hello I would like to ask about my player's ban and would like to understand why you banned my account"" Even in a nice and polite way (Depending on the person you talk to) they will be completely angry at you for no reason. Another issue that really makes a lot of these innocent people mad is when you post on a forum and you have these stuck up people that think they are too good for anything that tell you that you shouldn't even be playing the game and that rockstar doesn't ban people for no reason. Technically there is a reason but that reason is completely and it pisses me off to see that rockstar allows this crap to happen. I just would like to let anyone know who is looking at this review if you even had the time or interest to read it all to take these words into consideration and don't fund these money greedy scumbags even if you think the game is cool or whatever. People need to see this and understand that rockstar may make cool games but they really need to be hit hard in the support industry to try and make a change.",Grand Theft Auto V

The story mode's plot will have you well immersed with the characters and getting to know their past and true colors. The massive open world gives you tons of areas to explore along with gun fights and combats that are action packed.The main con I have is that the game lags sometimes especially when you explore a new area in Los Santos that wasn't walked upon before.

Graphics are absolutely stunning gameplay is pretty solid for GTA (except for some combat bugs like the AI firing 10 rounds into you in the span of 0.3 seconds.) and the customization is decent. Other than that its pretty much run of the mill GTA. Story mode is buggy and stutters a lot on my 980 SC but that was fixed with some files from the GTA V modding site. As for online typical 12 year old nihilists plenty of non english speaking people and griefers microtransactions youll probably end up buying if you don't have time to grind and HACKERS ARE RAMPANT. Expect to be blown to bits at random intervals along with everyone else in the lobby from some random with a mod menu. Menu's for reporting and kicking are hard to get too which means no one ever gets kicked from the lobby for hacking because half the player base doesn't know how to get there to kick.

They keep adding content to online but to enjoy it you either need to make grinding the game your life or (their preference) hand over all your cash for Shark cards. Then you have to partake of the griefing murder party that is so much of public online if you want to engage in most missions as they are unavailable in private servers. The peer to peer structure that enabled so much easy hacking of online is part and parcel of GTA a deliberate design decision made by Rockstar that sacrificed player enjoyment for Rockstar's convenience.Now adding insult to injury Take Two have shut down the offline modding that allowed the community to continue to add life to the forgotten single player game. They would have you believe it was because the modders were enabling griefing in online despite the tools being expressly designed to prevent such use but the real reason is clear Take Two want to destroy the remnants of single player and drive everyone to online where they can be squeezed for Shark Card money.

Don't know why it's there because I'd happily throw hundreds of dollars at cosmetic microtransactions due to the amount of fun I get from playing this game online or singleplayer.Connectivity issues require you to jump through a few hoops on your router's control panel to not be kicked an hour after joining due to what I think is a slight disconnect between you and the host that immediately boots you without attempting to keep you in.From what I've read it is a p2p connection but your character is in the cloud so you need to connect to that.In the end it is a buy for me feel free to correct me if I was wrong about the online stuff and I'll correct it.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's been year now I never join public lobbys 10yo kids and hacks all over place I seem to only have fun alone or with friends in a private lobby setup. Pros* Story good* Play is ok some FPS issues on low end cpu* Solo lobby/firend lobbys are fun but get dull real fast* Public Mods are a plus but read rockstear TOS this is a gray area * DLC been free so far waiting for pay for DLC to be added.. won't be shocked if they add itCons* Rockstar support are usless blame own PC for half stuff thats broken server side* Social club only in place for cash grab waste of ram use* Notice buy now button says Shark Card under it yes Rockstar let you buy fake cash..* Hackers all over in public lobbys * Forced into public lobby after a mission is frustrating* Shoddy business practice I must agree with others who say this putting game on sale then uping price wtf* In house servers (To control your purchases) Rockstar love your extra cashMy opinion is borrow the game don't buy it! I requested a refund.. big shocker I was ignored this was before new refund system came in.

2015-11-15,0,0,140,False,Recommended,For all the fun GTA V offers and it's worthy praise I'm going to be critical about something this and other open world sandbox games have a bit of an issue with.They made the landscape and environment quite vast but also very empty. There really is only so much to do and interact with in the game and it actually would have improved things to condense the area you are playing in. I started to get rather bored because of the wide distances and stretches of time between events for you to engage in.And some of the structures are just there for show. Example there is an entire sports stadium that just seems to occupy space. They put in the time to design this thing in detail... but there is zero to do there. I mean there's a random baseball bat laying around but... overall it was another example of a lot of work being done on the background scenery that could have gone towards more important elements of the game.I'd love to see game developers tighten up their focus and stop with unnecessary window dressing that crops up in open world games.,Grand Theft Auto V

A lot of people asking them to drop money. Lol. It's pathetic. You should do races setups heists and many. That's why Rockstar added these for fun and to make some money.

2017-06-19,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Late review but it still stands. I've played GTA III GTA San Andreas GTA IV and of course the most recent installment GTA V and I have to say it's just.. not as good as the others. Infact it's not even close to as good as any of the others. It's not a terrible game but it doesn't do much for me. Grand Theft Auto V is a great game with an exciting cast of characters! . The single player along with it's three main characters are extremely boring. They're not interesting at all and I feel nothing for them. I don't care that Michael's family is falling apart I don't care about Franklin at all (I genuinely forgot his name because he was that boring and had to look it up) really and Trevor's physcho/crazy/evil character has been done so many times before. The missions are boring and repetitive and aren't really motivating. There wasn't anything pushing me to keep playing. Mods are pretty much the only reason I know that people play singleplayer . Might I also add that you can go in about 5 ING BUILDINGS outside of a mission. The whole game is outside with hardly any indoor segments aside from the heists and some other missions.Now you might be thinking the multiplayer surely makes it atleast a bit better. That is only the case if you have a friend to play the game with and I myself enjoying messing around in Los Santos with my friends but I only do that in an invite only lobby because GTA ONLINE IS RIDDLED WITH HACKERS. It completely ruins the expierience when some retard comes along and drops you money and you get banned because Rockstar doesn't know how to handle hackers so they just say 'ah screw it ban him'. One good thing is they do update GTA Online a bit and they sometimes even make the expierience a tiny little incy wincy tad bit better. This game is absolutely nothing compared to previous titles. I would actually prefer to play GTA IV with my friends and I would have 1000x more fun than in this. PC Gamers had to wait nearly 2 YEARS for this.SUMMARY IT'S NOT VERY GOOD,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,258,False,Recommended,This game is obviously one of the best GTA's ever created. Rather than tell you what's good about it (because the list is WAY too long) I'll tell you where the game is lacking. The story for this game is very cliché. There are no exciting twists to the story and it's very predictable. Think of an action movie from the 90's and that's your story here.The story started to pick up in the middle but then it seemed like they forgot about the buildup and they just went straight into the game. I didn't feel that transition I always felt with other GTA's. Another thing that this game forgot was activities. There are no police car missions and not as many interior buildings that GTA IV had. I personally enjoyed walking into a Burger Shot and I was disappointed when I realized you couldn't visit any food places. Sprunk machines are still there to give you health but I prefer eating at an establishment like in San Andreas or GTA IV.The map itself is a decent size but one thing it lacks is dead space. I'm talking about the empty desert we experienced in San Andreas that feeling of being lost in the middle of nowhere. You don't get that with this game. Every single part of the map is populated with roads buildings or people. The only secluded areas I could find were the mountains (which weren't that big to be honest). The way the map was made removes a bit of the realism for me it's just a big island in the middle of the ocean. That and the lack of dead space was unfortunate but one thing they did right was the underwater segment of the game. Ever wrestle a shark? When you can in GTA V!Don't be dissuaded by my pessimistic review. Keep in mind that this game is freakin' amazing. So amazing that I just HAD to point out some of the flaws of it. The flaws are few with this game. GTA Online is still somewhat buggy but if you can get past that you will enjoy another 50 100 hours off that. 8.5/10 a technical and artistic wonder of the gaming world on par with Skyrim.,Grand Theft Auto V

Especially with flying bikes with rockets and stuff like that. Nevertheless it's really amazing with singleplayer mods if you want to have loads of fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Take Two revoked the Cease and Desist. Review still not positive because T2 did this t in the first place.Original Review You know I really enjoy playing this game.GTA Online is pretty fun when you're ing around with friends. But by far my favorite thing to do was mod this game in Single Player. One of the tools I use most to do so is OpenIV. And guess what Take Two has just done they've just killed off OpenIV by legal methods.Therefor I can no longer support the developers of this game to any degree unless this action is reverted. you Take Two. On behalf of thousands of OpenIV users.,Grand Theft Auto V

Had this game on the playstation when it first came out and now moved to PC and wow its superb in 4K resolution game runs sweet on max settings too. Rarely any trouble.

2017-06-18,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,This is a fun game really both on PC and on console(got it on PS4) GTA online mostly. But given the publishers' stance on mods though my current PC can just barely run this game I cannot recommend anyone to support this publisher at this current time unless they change their stance. So here's my laydown of this game...Pros Very fun multiplayer Very diverse and 'interesting' single player campaign(looking at you Trevor) Endless hours of entertainment just tormenting the NPC's.Cons Currently the publisher has banned all mods for this game Sometimes the GTA Online aspect gets tiresome with most players in public lobbies just wanting to kill you non stop. The money publisher makes things way too overpriced in game making sure you buy the GTA Shark Cash cards for in game GTA Online(much Pay 2 Win microtransactions I hate)All in all great game bad publisher.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,The game is pretty decent ok but really not something I think I'll go back to play. My playtime is split between two playthroughs and I got bored at the same part of the story each time and stopped playing. The online function seemed pointless to me because it takes WAY too long to load in. Seriously expect a 10 minute loading screen just to get into a game. It seems that this game is riddled with micro transaction greed especially now that they have gotten rid of Open IV and the modding capabilities that came with it. This greatly upsets me as modding was one of my favorite parts of the game. I wouldn't recommend this to new buyers.,Grand Theft Auto V

Solid driving shooting flying running indept customization and great pretty open world. The multiplayer Its full of hackers/cheaters 30 percent of the time you are not playing game is loading you get kicked out by the servers load some more. This games biggest issue that it doesnt have a menu too many loading screens to deal with and uneccessery questionable design decisions. Online portion of this game DOES NOT RESPECT your time and no amount of free updates can make up for that. They need to fix the core game first. But there are some fun to be had in online it just sucks that you have to deal with alot of crap to get to that bit. GTA 6 is gona come out and its gona have 10 times better online and story I guess the reviewers need to give it a 11 out of 10 because gta 5 got 10 out of 10 from most reviewers.

2015-04-14,0,0,79,False,Recommended,What can I say? It's the game that I've been waiting ever since I finished it on PS3 1.5 years ago and Rockstar didn't disappoint me. The game is obviously great which we already knew since it's been out for so long but the way they made it for PC just stands out. It looks fantastic runs smoothly and should run well even on some mid end PC.If you have not yet played the game on the consoles then I'd suggest you to buy it. And if you already own the game on one of the old generation consoles then I would still suggest you to buy it. Not only it looks and runs much better but you also get the first person view and quite a bit of exclusive content that's only available for the returning players.I have not tried the GTA Online on PC yet but I'd imagine it's better than on the consoles where it's already great.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,Usually I wait for a game to be out for a while so I can buy it at a discounted price but I made an exception for this game. I should not have done that. The game keeps crashing and as of now there is no fix. I have researched online trying to find a fix however the internet is simply filled with people like me who cannot find guide that actually fixes the problem. I will say my system is not the greatest however it gets the job done. I have read plenty of reviews of people with computer specs that far exceed those of my own who have the same problem as I do and they cannot find a fix either. For those who are wondering I have a i5 2.67 ghz processor 6 gigs of ram 500 gig hard drive and a gtx 460 graphics card. This is the only game that has actually caused my pc to crash so this is not a common problem with other games only this game. I suggest you wait till summer time because this game will mostlikely be fixed by then and will probably be on sale as well. As for a game review I cannot really say since the game crashes before I can really get into the game. Hopefully Rockstar can fix this issue so I can change my review to a more positive one...

2015-04-20,0,0,393,False,Recommended,Where's the 'it depends' button? GTA V for PC is very akin to GTA V for console. Owned it on 360 playing PC with an xboxone controller which intergrates perfectly. the first person mode may delight keyboard users but the applied vingette effect and what I'd call clunky positioning of the characters hands means it's a less than desireable experience. 3rd person with controller works as expected. People online never change on platforms. good players trolls idiots. they're all present.Honestly if you have this game for a console and aren't playing with friends. don't bother it doesn't bring much to the table. if you've never played the console version but have a PC compatible controller sure it's a good story. if you have friends to join with it's a good enough experience just make use of the private sessions in online.For a game delayed to 'add polish' my mid range PC can't make use of it. looks no better nor worse than the 360 version. the rockstart matchmaking system still loves to mis match parties and friends into different sessions. and the smallest niggle that I want to really whine about Vanity plates / license tags in online. fix the app or let us do it in the mod shops rockstar. ignore perfectly unique plates filtered by a moderation system let us type what we want and fit it to any car we can shoehorn into those sheds. c'mon.overall 7/10. a solid game with a lot to do for new players but hardly a standout for returning customers. edit 21 04 2015So the iFruit app ( Android / IOS ) has since been updated. you can now change your cars license plates / tags / rego it's a little fiddly but works. did they mention it's 100 000 in game dollars to do it?,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,131,False,Recommended,This is a great game. Definetly needs the CPU requirements or you'll be playing with some lag and some missing roads. I can't say it's not interesting though. But I would definetely recommend a highend PC or gaming laptop to get the full enjoyment of the game.I have to say that I was not happy how long it took to load just based on it crashing and I constantly had to re load the installation which I'm glad it continued in the same place each time. The Social Club issue is best to reinstall if you have it already and if you don't have it it's best to install that off Rockstar. The installation basically is the huge stress to see if it actually goes through or not but in the end it should work. There's many ways to fix this launch problem. There's definetely installing the game then set up and updates that must be taken care of before launching. The graphics are nice as always. However this is much more fun than GTA 4 because it's more of an open world map and it's fun to see places in real life that are modeled after the game once you start playing if you live on the west coast.I say it's worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is solid and having three characters that you switch from keeps it interesting to the end. everything runs smoothly from the vehicles the gunfights to the cutscenes. Iaughed out loud (a lot) and im only 30% through the story. Tons of stuff to do aside from the story giving the offline a decent replay value. Online is a lot better when played with people you know. Otherwise it feels like you're being raced to the objective and left behind. Instead of an empty free roam like IV. You can take on missions and other activities throughout L.S. giving you an actual reason to play other than just messing around. Speaking of just messing around... you will get a lot of people trolling players trying to complete certain activities. for example i was holding up a store for some quick cash. The clerk emptied the register and i exited the store. Little did i know a player had been waiting the whole time to kill me as soon as i stepped out. He didn't get anything for doing it other than the satisfaction of killing a distracted player. there are repercussions for doing this. the more you kill civies or damage property a mentality meter will rise. the higher the meter the bigger the price for your head. players can hunt you and gain xp/cash for the kill. Continually killing other players (other than competitive matches) will earn you the title ""bad sport"". As long as you have this title you will only be able to play with other ""bad sports"". Having the ""good sport"" title will earn you rewards randomly. In other words... Don't be a Online matches are very diverse. from all kinds of racing to deathmatches tennis darts arm wrestling and the list goes on and on. If you are returning from the PS3/360 version. There isn't a lot of new things so if you played the game thoroughly theres a good chance you will get bored fairly quickly. If not than this title will surely amaze you.",Grand Theft Auto V

I was fortunate enough to be able to max the graphic settings out on my PC and whilst I walk across Vespucci (Venice) Beach killing helpless civilians with my golden minigun I daze off into the beautiful sunset.For me personally there were some buggy moments throughout the game but honestly I didn't mind them as they were very minor bugs.Of course however I had to install some mods to see if Rockstar had kept up their standards (as well as the modding community) and sure enough there was no let down. I had so much fun as I flew across the sky as Iron Man or testing out custom ramps on a 'Dump Truck' and changing the Adder skin to a Bugatti Veyron.$75 may be a little extreme for a game thats 2 years old now but it was worth it.

2017-06-15,0,0,106,False,Recommended,So after the recent events of mods being royally screwed over this game is no longer entertaining. Single player was basically good because of mods much like earlier GTA games. The online is not even close to worth as you're met with a micro transaction ridden hell hole as soon as you enter. Being met with an instant pay wall is not fun especially when you've payed for the game already. Therefore this is definitely a negative review untill either mods are allowed (in single player) again or untill the paywall is demolished preferrably both.EDIT OpenIV the modding tool in question has officially been reopened and as promised I'll change the review to recommended. This does not mean that the online is still infested with microtransactions and a pay to win hell hole but at least modding in the single player campaign is now posssible again!

Hell I even wanted to contact you guys for an opportunity for a job. But on behalf of the Cease and Desist letter sent to the OpenIV Team I am determined to never buy another Take Two game. They are also completely ruining somewhat half of their income because practically all of the fans of GTA buy the game for PC for the sole purpose of modding. Nonetheless OpenIV isn't at fault for GTA's online security (Which was why the C&amp D letter was sent) as there are multiple precautions from the modding application itself to not let players with mods onto online mode. An idea that could possibly save OpenIV if Rockstar ever gets around to reading this is to make an asi scanner so if the OpenIV.asi file is found during loading you may only enter singleplayer. What's next Take Two FiveM GTA5 Mods.com etc...You ban our mods we ban you income...Save OpenIV Petition is here OpenIV Petition www.change.org (BTW don't hate on Rockstar IK we are downvoting the game but Take Two is still reflected by this it is Take Two Interactive's sole fault for this.

I do not condone hacking not do I partake. but the game requires an unrealistic amount of grinding with little meaningful payoff.

2015-04-21,0,0,322,False,Recommended,Finally made it to PC! With improved draw distance and textures this game doesn't need another review. However I like it so much here we are. I'm not sure if it's because of the 60+ fps or if they further refined the controls but the controls feel better than previous versions to me as well. Of course any PC gamer will love the fact they can now use mouse and keyboard when gunning down their foes. I still use my old trusty 360 controller for driving but this series has never felt better on mouse and keyboard. I would ignore any minor issues with online play at release as this is fairly normal for AAA releases when the servers are flooded. Rockstar has a great reputation for patching and improving their products well after release. Last but not least the new editor is a blast to play with. You can set scenes record and edit footage all right in GTA. With a little creativity you can basically become your own movie director.

Mods have kept me coming back to GTA for years and now but now 2K has decided to take all of that away and nullify thousands of hours of work put into the mods and tools created by the community. It's a move all around and does nothing to fix the problems with multiplayer like they claim it's pure greed as far as I can see. Sorry Rockstar your publisher is ruining this great thing you have made.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,"I used to love Grand Theft Auto V. Both story mode and online. Now it sucks. I used to want DLC for story mode but that didn't happen. Whatever moving on. Online however absolutely sucks the utmost crap EVER. Nothing but more adversary modes and more dumb missions to make little money. I stopped after the Import/Export stuff. Just nonsense to have people lose money by destroying each other's crates. As most know you can only do these missions in open sessions. There is always someone coming in to blow your crates up after many hours of grinding and hard work. Rockstar did that cause that would be a decent money making method if it could be played in a closed session and they of course don't want you NOT buying their shark cards.They really try to force shark cards upon everyone as everyone knows by now. I might have bought a shark card if it wasn't the worst rip off I've ever seen. Paying $100 for 8 million dollars in game cash. That's ridiculous! I will NEVER pay for that! Anyone would blow that in like 15 minutes tops. Maybe if they increased it to 50 100 million dollars in game but I think 50 million would still be a rip off. I give Rockstar credit where they're due though. They've gotten players so hooked to the game to want in game money so bad that they'll blow their money on tons of shark cards. I was one of those people who wanted all the new stuff Rockstar came out with but could never afford. I never was dumb enough to buy one of those cards though regardless of my desperation for in game money.The next thing I hate is the character creation. Really Rockstar? Really? After all this time you would think that you could get the character creation right. Everybody is skinny. Females look like men no matter how hard you try. I made a decent female but wow was it hard. Still has some manly features. They saw all the npcs but were like ""Screw it we'll just make everyone the same size and height for the character creation."" I have a male character as my first. Maybe I want him to be fat. Maybe muscular. Or maybe I want to be shorter. Same with my female character. Why can't my female character look like them strippers? Why can't I make one of them fat short ugly ladies? Anything but the same as everyone else. Poor design Rockstar. Poor design.Last but not least police stuff. I was waiting so long but they added everything else from lowriders to biker DLC. Why can't I own a cop car? Why????? A tank yes. A jet yes. Armored vehicles and military ones yes. But not a single police vehicle. Not even a police uniform. You had to do a glitch to get a police uniform permanently. People like to say ""Well it wouldn't be realistic "" or ""You can buy a tank in real life."" Oh really? Buy it maybe. Do you see civilians in tanks going around in real life blowing stuff up around the city though? I didn't think so. How is that realistic?I also started modding in story mode a few months back. I come from the xbox one where all my stuff is on. I was dumb enough to buy it on pc for modding. I had some fun where Rockstar hadn't impeded yet. Then I recently learned they took down Open IV. I understand not modding online but wow. Rockstar eventually makes sure that as long as they aren't milking every last drop of money from us the gamers can't have fun. I even found out they patched the Pacific Standard heist glitch where people used to use Kuruma's during the final part. Rockstar really doesn't want people to make good money do they? I'm done with this game. I might replay story mode again in the far future but forget online. I'm done with the game altogether for now. Time to get back into Skyrim.Kudos to Rockstar for making a great game (that they still make money off of) and then taking a long hard dump on it (which they still haven't stopped doing). There's plenty of other complaints I have but I think that's good for now.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,Edit Rockstar seems to have convinced Take Two to retract their cease and decist. Very pleased with this decision. I have decided to switch my rating back to 'Not recommended' as I don't want to play into Take Two's game. While the Grand Theft Auto V is no doubt one of the best games available to date recent actions by Take Two have have made me reconsider my purchase. Their money grabbing anti consumer practices are not actions that would gain my support. Banning mods is detrimental to the GTA V community and in turn Rockstar games.Please do not buy this until Take Two reconsiders their stance on modding this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now GTA online is still a broken P2P mess with no proper anti cheat and almost everyone is a uncooperative madman hunting and killing everyone but I feel like if you somehow haven't played the single player despite that fact its already 3 years old and available on 5 platforms plus the ability to mod the single player I think makes this game worth it at a sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-28,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,6.5!havent really play the online game yet but i have to say i finished the story mode in couple days. its not as well as the previous ones. The story is simple and short mixed up by three different characters. I am not sure who thinks that 3 main characters will make it better but I can tell you it doesn t work. In story mode you can t buy house the stock thing they design is pretty much a joke too.Upside of it is that the cars are a lot better the guns and all the modification you can do to them. Ill have to give the m score on that. On the other hand the online version I am really not so interested in it. And all people do is up each other. Sure its fun but not so fun after three days of that. Money is pointless after a while the level system is ed and I think it s a failure design of a game tried to concentrate on their online part. overall. get witcher 3 or Metal Gear.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-07,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,This review doesn't cover single player GTA V.I have played only multiplayer version. And all I can say it's useless waste of money.Almost 40 EUR been paid for countless amount of cheaters which set you on fire spawn loads of vehicles onto your head and explode you as soon as you respawn if you are not quick enough to click multiple buttons to find new session. And constant connection problems.About sessions system it's completly undeveloped. You can't choose the server you want to play on. The only difference is if you get into server with cheaters or not. If not then they will come sooner or later.Multiplayer gameplay is extremly tiresome and monotonous.A whole gameplay inclines towards 1. Long loading (althought I have top end PC)2. Waiting for players.3. Mission itself.4. Someone died loading.6. Trying again and again... and AGAIN.7. Finnaly mission complete so you choose if you liked it or not... Waiting for others so they press the button if they liked it or not.8. Voting for next mission and waiting.9. Loading waiting loadingwaiting... Endless process of waiting for others.10. Repeat.Missions or you race in a bike car plane parachute or you rob something.The rest of time you just run/drive around kill red dots and buy property.Graphics physics interaction with NPCs and optimisation yes it's at highest level.Gameplay versatility hell no.This game doesn't worth even more than 15 EUR.These series died after San Andreas.I'd like to get my money back but can't because spent too much time for nothing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-07,0,0,1008,False,Recommended,I will score the game based on a rating system.Let me explain GTA V is a GREAT and I mean GREAT game. There is a lot of activities to do in the current stage of the game. Personally I do kinda remember the price being a little out of hand when it was the steam sale. But I did already own the game by then so there was no need for me to look at the store page. Yes it was a stupid decision on Rockstar's point. The game is still amazing. I do hate the condition that GTA Online is at now. I will just say...HACKERS A LOT OF THEM. I do love online when i'm playing in a private match with friends. Also singleplayer is a great part of the game as a whole. The game doesn't need online for a $60.00 price tag. You could just buy the game for singleplayer if you do try online I would do a private match instead of the normal servers. Graphics simply amazing. Gameplay is fun and weirdly relaxing. Online fun only on private lobbies.Online score 7/10Singleplayer Score 8/10Story score 9/10OVERALL SCORE 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

The Story mode has a great story and many missions to keep you going.ONLINE Online has had its problems but many have been fixed. I personally don't run into hackers as often as the other reviews say they do. I go online and have an amazingly fun time with everyone else and hackers are not and issues as they were when the game released. WIth the new freemode event online has had a new life to keep the actions and fun going.

2015-10-01,0,0,262,False,Recommended,it is a good game... if you have internet... good internet. if you have no internet then you can't play. which sucks. also rockstar support does a really crappy job with listening and responding to problems. you can't have multiple accounts or even sign out. i have had so many problems with things not working right many other people have the same problems and there are no fixes. in my opinion to have multiple accounts (because something is wrong with one) you would have to buy another game on another pc this seems to smell like greed. however i do recommend the game solely for the great gameplay. if only rockstar would communicate with the community.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-01,0,0,1052,False,Not Recommended,This game is amazing! You can do sooooooooooooo many things in this game! The graphics are awesome the solo mode is ING FANTASTIC! But then... there s is this horrible online experience.. The game has a various amount of game modes missions and a few heist which some are more fun than others BUT you will have to wait in a lobby FOREVER!!If you try to do a heist you will actually need to scrape together players (if you re not playing with friends) to do HARD missions that require a degree of teamwork and patience Something people dont often have after being in a bazookafight with each others in freemode And there are missions you have to do before the actual heist missions that pays bad and may even be longer and harder than the actual heist. AND if someone leaves the heist you re threwn into freemode having to set up the heist/mission ALL over. but from the mission you ve come to! Which is a MAJOR pain in the . Now if you re actually trying to join a gamemode thats not in freemode (the open world with players) you will enter a loadingscreen.. Which not only takes long but if something goes wrong You ll be tossed into another loadingscreen loading Singleplayer.. Then you have to load online mode again from singleplayer!!

This game is just a dead horse that the devs are squeezing as much $$$ out of as possible. I will say it's worth getting on sale for the single player and mods but try to stay away from GTA Online.PROS R* put much more effort into making sure the game functions on PC after the awful GTAIV port Great performance Huge map filled with life Lengthy single player campaign Multiple characters to play as with their own personalities More universally friendly driving and shooting Plenty of modding potentialCONS Map can get boring after so much playtime (a bit too many hills/deserts) Single player (and Online) story isn't written very well regardless of how good missions can be The 3 characters aren't very good from a writing standpoint and their gameplay is basically the same Modding the game outside of single player (common in the previous game) gets you banned from Online Lack of promised single player content (new content from Online isn't even available for the campaign) Devs focus solely on making money off of microtransactions instead of a solid experience with overpriced items and getting players to buy their way to getting them with $$$ Very inconsistent amounts of players online leading to dead lobbies for any modes that aren't the latest Plenty of players using mods to cheat and getting away with itSeriously don't bother paying full price or buying Shark Cards.

Therefore you'd have to spend real money on Shark Cards that give currency in the game in order to buy the items you really want.If you only want to play the story mode I'd have to say it's a great experience.

GTA 5 is a game that I bought on Xbox 360 Xbox One and now PC. I've played a ton of it on all three platforms and it's only gotten better with time. The PC version is by far the best version of Los Santos. The jump from Xbox One to PC is actually bigger than the jump from 360 to Xbone. If you like liked or even thought about liking this game on console then the PC version is a must own. Beautiful visuals smoother gameplay and for some reason an even better sense of scale makes it the Pinnacle of Rock* creation. I've played 200 hours and can't wait for the next 200.

Then you have the awful deathmatch layouts and getting spawn killed from behind boring missions with useless checkpoints and failed heists because someone disconnected right before the last objective marker.GTO only has a small portion of content worth checking out aside from the freeroam emergent gameplay experience left entirely to the player and it carries an otherwise unplayable 60 gigabyte anchor.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-04,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,Every one will happily complain about the modding team being shut out. Meanwhile the game has more issues then expected. first off. if you dont have intel products. just refund the game dont even try to play. does not support AMD/ATi componets. secondly if you do have AMD/ATI components you may spend 4 7 hours troubleshooting which counts as playtime and steams automated support WILL deny your refund within an hour. third. the community is utter trash 9//10 you will meet a hacker. 9/10 the hacker with get banned for a month then be back to do the same thing again. from forum posts you have to be actively hacking for 5 10 consecutive bans 1 just inst enough to justify breaking the terms of service/EULA or anything else. which mind you is illegal. fouth. the gameplay is great the game play is very well optimised. but actually being able to play the game even with beefy AMD/ATI components. it will stil run like dog 4/10 would not recommend to a PC gamer. hacking is the only positive thing you can do. will purchase on console again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,100,False,Recommended,I have returned to the world of Grand Theft Auto after about 5 years away and boy am I pleased to be back! It has been such a long wait for this title but to be honest it was worth the wait.First off if you don't have a decent graphics card I am afraid you will have to stump up the cash to get one. Secondly you do need a decent PC to run this as this isn't your second grade port from a console a lot of work has gone into the PC version of this game and it does show.As I have a 360 controller connected to my PC it has been very useful. However there are very few hints to help you master the controls from the start of the game. You have to fumble around and experiment for a little bit to ensure you know what to do and how to do it when the time calls for it. It took a few goes on the first level of the single player part of the game to get used to the controls. However once you master the controls on a gaming pad it is a very engaging game and it really does pay dividends.The single player version of the game is incredibly engaging you can play a number of different characters and work your way up the ranks (just like any GTA game). The cars are beautiful and the AI characters are wonderfully unpredictable. I do like the way you can stumble into a fight or pickpocket and you can save the day. It is great and you do feel part of the GTA world. The story keeps you hooked and the way you can interract with the other characters is fully rewarding.The multiplayer part of the game can be a bit hit or miss. You join servers with people from all over the world and you can see other players stutter across the map. However once you find a good server you can either join various missions and games or you can explore the GTA world and shoot the other players that have joined. Once you work your way up the ranks more things are unlocked and you can do various other things. The multiplayer version of the game is really geared up for players to connect and help each other. You can join gangs and cause a lot of chaos.To wrap up this review a lot of issues that PC gamers may have could be related to inferior PCs or operating systems but to be honest I have had very very few technical issues with this game. It is a solid console port and I am really glad that I waited for Rockstar to deliver a fantastic game which I will enjoy in years to come.,Grand Theft Auto V

When you get this game MAKE SURE that you have the right rockstar account all sorted with a username you like and with any previous version data on it such as from PS3.Your account will be PERMANENTLY linked to your steam account unless you do some ass support ticket and your game will PERMANENTLY be linked to your rockstar account.I do not like this DRM crap at all and I ended up using the wrong rockstar account because I couldn't be bothered to wait for their support.This shouldn't cause you any problems if you're not an idiot like me but be warned.,Grand Theft Auto V

Then every couple days its bugs out again reinstall then it's fixed.Easily could be a 10/10 if online ran smoother between stuttering and how job system should back out to the lobby instead of kicking to free roam if someone leaves during a heist.But overall it is a great game and hopefully the bugs get worked out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,725,False,Recommended,I LOVE this game. It is a piece of ART along with all the other GTA's. Everything about it is absolutely incredible. So much so that I have replayed the story 3 times and have well over 500 hours. But TakeTwo the publishers of this game have ed it. They have now taken to banning single player mods which have NO influence over GTA Online. I can fully understand and support the removal of multiplayer mods as they're annoying as hell but when you take to destroying the community of this wonderful game you have f*cked up TakeTwo. Even Rockstar the people who made this masterpiece like modding it really brings this game to life. It is purely out of petty greed and spite that TakeTwo have attacked the hard working and loyal team behind OpenIV the mod in question. I cannot let this stand and because of this I am joining many other in protest of TakeTwo exploiting this beautiful game as a cash cow and not recommending this game. Join us and show TakeTwo that they cannot do this to such an amazing game. Downvote it and flood their support emails and media contacts. And for the love of god do not buy any more shark cards and allow them to profit from this. Thank you Rockstar for your work on this game and f*ck you TakeTwo for ruining it. Thank you for your time. EDIT Rockstar have since convinced Take Two to drop their legal action against OpenIV and are in constructive talks to improve the future of the game. OpenIV is back! I have altered my review as such and now RECOMMEND this game stronlgly so long as you don't buy those damn Shark Cards! Anyway if you haven't bought this game yet what are you doing?

2017-12-25,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a beatiful game with a great storyline and even better characters. The map is top quality and is a great improvement from Grand Theft Auto Four. Although everygame has their flaws and this game defiantly has it's flaws.As you cal tell I don't really have much hours on the game. I bought this game last Sunday the 17th of December and only racked up around 25/28 hours of ontime. Although I have played this game throughout the years throughout many different types of systems. So I have quite an understanding on the game.The story mode is great very good in fact I have played it many times and still in love with it.Online.. that's another story. Pretty decent just go there to do some setups and grind some money and other times just play in private sessions with friends etc. Grand Theft Auto V is full of modders so be ware. Also online to me now feels like it is pay to win. Sadly..The add ons to online are AMAZING but I don't recrommend buying any Shark Cards don't let those tempt you.All and all game is very great and very well made. Would recrommend just be careful online. ),Grand Theft Auto V
2016-07-02,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,Edited the review because Rockstar decided modders suck. The single player portion of GTA V is damn good way better than GTA IV and very well done. No annoying cousion calling you every 10 minutes to go bowling! Anyone buying this game for GTA Online is simply an idiot. As someone who bought GTA V at launch on PS3 and then again when it launched on PC GTA Online looked like a pile of back when Rockstar delayed it. And what do you know it's turned out to be a horrible grindfest designed like a mobile game. Sadly given how much money Rockstar made off the Shark cards you can be assured GTAVI will either be entirely online or at the very least the online porition will be a terrible grindfest designed to part money from a gullible idiot's wallet. Also screw Rockstar for thier terrible DRM that obviously doesn't stop hackers but just like all DRM only makes PAYING CUSTOMERS miserable. It's a huge stain on an otherwise excellent PC port. Overall I'd still recommend the game to people as it's well optimized and runs very well I'd discourage people from using the ripoff microtransaction hackerfest known as GTA Online and don't be an idiot and buy Shark cards.Update 12/25/2017 GTA Online is still a pile of junk!,Grand Theft Auto V

Get it together Rockstar.Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece. The story of the game is thrilling easily followable and very developed. Along with the developed character structure and impecable voice acting its also really fun and enjoyable. Player choice adds a great level of depth to the game and the open world is pushing the entire industry forward. Rockstar left nothing untouched in this amazing world the level of detail is unmatched and very well done. Although it originally was a problem Rockstar has done a great job patching the engine and allowing GTA V to run on less powerful systems while maintaining an amazing graphical standard. This is the only game I have ever bought full price and I don't regret it. This game deserves every penny of the price. Rockstars constant updates also keep the community and the content thriving. Overall GTA V is one of my favorite games and it reflects what I look for and anticipate in every game I review. It serves as a model for what publishers and what the industry needs to live up to. If Grand Theft Auto V defines the future of gaming I am excited.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V is not a bad game i enjoyed it on the xbox had a level 80 character nice cars apartments but it wasnt ready for PC after how many years of working on it? also after how many set backs?.

2015-04-14,0,0,58,False,Recommended,The definitive GTA V experience which for me was the ultimate multi player game of the last generation. Granted it's been a bit of a wait for the PC crowd and the online facet of the game is not without it's glitches (Abominable lag despite having a +100 Mbps connection jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason weird vehicle damage modelling loops just killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server side assets etc.) but when you compare it to similar games in the genre I still think it's way ahead of the competition. Yes the delays should have meant a more stable launch and I agree that the whole Windows Username thing whilst not affecting me personally is a pretty big oversight but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified.Then again I'm one of the jerk's who's been playing it on XB360 and PS4 for the last year and a half so I'm probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average PC user.Either way it's a 09/10 from me now we just gotta wait for a PC remake/sequel to Red Dead Redemption.,Grand Theft Auto V

I had many fun hours messing around in singleplayer but as of 15/6/2017 I do not longer recommend this game becouse of the closure of the open IV modding tool. This is a exactly dumb decision from Take two and I hope they come to their senses becouse the only reason GTA 5 was popular on PC was becouse of mods that is the only reason and I give it a couple of months before GTA 5 is dead if take two does not roleback their decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

Great story and plenty of stuff to keep you busy for about 50 70 hours if you do everything. Online play is still alot of fun has it's own storyline and a rediculous about of extra and random stuff you can do. Hackers are only an issue if you let them be if you find someone spamming vehicles or killing a lot of people at once or with godmode on just press ""esc"" go to online and find new session. Hackers will always be in games that don't have the entire game on servers that R* controls and moniters. To do that though they would more than likely have to require a monthly subscription or a ton of microtransactions. Even with hackers just driving around and chasing players whether they be higher or lower level than you and doing anything you can think of from getting and killing hookers to going to the strip club to punching random pedestrians until you get killed by the cops to riding on the train or Tram off the cops and having helicopters chasing you the game is still a lot of fun.

2017-06-15,0,0,403,False,Recommended,OpenIV is back ScripthookV has updated and the modding community is mostly back on track! We did it! Now for my real thoughts on this game.Grand Theft Auto V is fun and addicting and mods extend the experience tenfold. The story is good albeit a bit short with main characters who are pretty shallow in my opinion but overall an exciting adventure. Compared to Liberty City Los Santos and Southern San Andreas is vibrant and colorful packed with diverse settings and rich detail. Like any GTA game fun can be had just by driving around aimlessly getting into police pursuits and gunfights with various gangs. However I've found the money is pretty hard to earn once you've completed the story and I also wish that things like car insurance would be brought to the singleplayer from GTA Online. But many of my problems I have with the singleplayer can all be solved with mods.As for GTA Online it's a boring grindfest where the only real way to get ahead is to spend real money on microtransactions or be given money by a hacker. Although once you've achieved CEO or MC President status you come the the realization that you've come all this way just for a higher tier boring grindfest. Freemode is usually fun save for the few players that go around trolling and killing for no reason but I've met some actually friendly people in GTA Online. For me racing in Online is great fun and the lobbies are populated around the clock. Heists are another way to earn big money but only really if you've got a group of dependable friends otherwise they and other multiplayer missions can take forever waiting on one person to stop immediately getting shot to death. All in all GTA Online can be fun if you know exactly what you want which really isn't a good thing.In conclusion I recommend GTA V but on one condition moddability is a MUST.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,74,False,Recommended,GTA nub here. Well I've played 4 and the Episodes. Main thing on my mind after 69 hours and 78% completion on the Campaign is a lingering feeling of ever so slight disappointment. The Story could have been more unified and epic if you ask me. It's a grand medley of this and that and the pure scale of it is an amazing feat. I guess I'm too much of a RPG fan these days for V to be mind blowing. Did not try Online. If you're not a full blown GTA nutter get it on a sale. 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,4058,False,Recommended,I'm sure everyone knows what GTA is so I will skip right to it. The PC version is extremely well optimized. I have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer the game still runs smooth. I may update this after I install my new GPU. I love the Self Radio station where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist or as an actual radio station with DJ commentary in between songs. The Rockstar editor tool is also amazing allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube and you can upload your clips directly from the in game menu. You can seemlessly switch between using your game pad and your keyboard/mouse without needing to change any settings. This helps with navigating menus and editing your Rockstar Editor clips. I can't say much about the graphics for reasons I have already stated but i'm told it's amazing with a proper GPU. If you don't already have it on your console I highly recommend it.That said if you already own this game on a console I would not recommend buying it on PC. The main reason I say this is because honestly the PC community just really sucks. You can easily spend 20 30 mins just trying to get people to join a job. And then if you are lucky enough to get people to join chances are someone is going to quit as soon as you start it. If they don't quit as soon as you start the job don't get too excited because they are probably just trying to waste your time so they will wait until you are almost finished and then quit or fail on purpose. To top it off it seems like 3/4 of the PC community are communists. What I mean here is on the heists missions you have say 4 5 setup missions that you have to complete first before you get to the main mission and you do not get paid for those. So the way Rockstar has it set up is that the host of the mission gets 55% of the reward because the host completed all the setup first. Each person who joins on the final mission gets 15% but the game allows you to adjust the take if you want. Well most people will demand at least 20% if not 25%. If you pay them 25% you also get 25% which means all your work is really for nothing you would be better of doing regular missions. If you pay them 20% that means you are getting 40% of the cut for doing 80% of the work. If you don't raise their cut they are probably going to quit as soon as you start the mission. If you do raise their cut you are getting screwed and they are probably still going to quit. I'm not sure what makes these people think they are entitled to 20 25% of the heist rewards they are only participating in a small part of the overall job and even at the default 15% reward for them they are already making 3x the amount that they would get from a regular mission.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-27,0,0,1312,False,Not Recommended,"A really fun game.IF YOU PLAY THE SINGLE PLAYER.And mainly the reason behind me stating it's only fun if you're on singleplayer is because of the support Rockstar gives it's customer base. It's ironic when a company treats it's customers like the criminals after paying 40 (how much it was when purchased) and then having the nuts to add microtransactions for cash in a game where you play as. ""Criminals"".Rockstar support consists of 1 of these few replies 1 ""I have a problem perhaps i could get help?"" (Their reply) Insert extremely generic restart game and make sure you save page filled with other generic ""fixes"".2 ""I have a ban How come?"" (Their reply) Insert ""You obviously cheated and all bans are final"" comment and give generic ""It's your fault it's final"" ban reason page.3 ""Rockstar support is bad"" (Their reply) Goodbye to your post! Cos dat just got deleted son!Anyways Rockstar support is a awful joke and it's great when you can't support your customers so you get the community to do your job for you.Now lets commence onto the actual issues of online shall we? BUSINESSES! Biker business I'll just say best to not invest if you're doing it for money if you're just doing it for the fun lil side missions then all power t'ya. But for actual money and business? No. You can spend about 2 mil or more getting a business and find out it was a massive waste. Weed business is not worth the time/money ratio and delivery missions often consist of being high as a kite and attempting to drive a van full of weed ONLY worth about $50 000 swerving in a uncontrolable drive whilst players try to kill you. Fun right?Document forge? Nope. Just. Nope. Yet again. Money to time ratio it's a waste.Only business i can reccomend is going into cocaine or meth. But problems with the cocaine industry consist of selling missions glitching and rendering half of your product undroppable via plane and failing you the whole sell losing everything unless you quit fast.Resupply missions are tedious and often result in tons of death and annoying sidequests like ""KILL ERRYONE IN DA BAR WID YA BEAR HANDS"" oh wait... they have weapons... like bats and bottles. Well you're screwed! CEO business Sinking 2 mil and more into CEO is the only business i can reccomend grind crate buying and selling fill warehouses sell. Repeat. Oh and lose product when yet again. Selling product fails to deliver or drop. Losing your whole sale. Keep grinding till you can get a car warehouse for import export. That way you can make tons pretty easily. However import export is tedious at times too with awful AI enemy spawns in the middle of the roads cutting your sale car up and of course players loving to tw t you out of the cash you spent modding the cars before sale as lets face it specialist buyer is the only profitable way to go. ONLINE IN GENERAL it's not a nice world. On online be prepared to be killed a lot for absolutely no reason as players aren't punished for being d***s and people who are friendly and don't kill one another constantly get a joking $2000 for being a good boy. Being a random deathmatcher pays off via a bounty or killing players with businesses selling cars or crates or simply resupplying and players being good only get $2000 nothing more. And of course. The part you've been waiting for. CHEATERS.Yep hacking and cheating after all this time is still rife whether it be superjumpers godmodders aimbotters teleporters money cheaters and general nuisance hackers who fill your appartments with objects or somehow manage to delete or modify your vehicles in a way that makes them permenantly broken. Don't worry. They're still here! And rockstar's best retort?We'll remove the hacked money. Reset people's accounts. Commonly get innocents involved and give them bans. And that's about it. Working on anti cheats system? You're dreamin kids.But there ya have it folks.My 5 penneth.",Grand Theft Auto V

For example there aren't many FPS giving the option to see your own feet (it's something that is always nice to see in a FPS in my opinion). However the feel of some weapons is just horrible (rifles) compared to other FPS. Most weapons are also not looking so good.

2015-08-17,0,0,107,False,Recommended,I've purchased GTA 3 VICE CITY LIBERTY CITY STORIES SAN ANDREAS (twice) GTA IV (twice) and GTA V (twice). I loved the GTA franchise since I was 10 years old but I do have to bring up that I do not like the practices that Rockstar is keeping with mods such as Fivem nor the faster updates for bug fixing (stuttering issue). You've accumulated billions of dollars off GTA V but cannot invest it to hire more workers to help fix the issues? I understand game programming is difficult but it just feels like we are being ignored and frankly being defecated on when it comes to how we would like to play the game we purchased for. I planned on buying this game partly for dedicated servers to mod around in but if you do not support this to the point of banning mod creators I may be unable to support rockstar games or even any Take Two games until these issues becomes resolved.I cannot recommend the bad behaviors of taketwo/Rockstar but can recommend it if you just want to play a vanilla GTA experience with better performance than console.edit eh it has been a year since I left this review but seeing T2/R* take back the OpenIV stuff I think I'll turn this into a recommended game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I however find it to be a repulsive sesspool full of minors on their parent's computer and I avoid it like second hand smoke. However I have been playing the single player with graphics mods added cars and some realism mods/ weapon tuning. Rockstar for breaking mods using the exscuse that it's to prevent people hacking their online lobbies. Maybe you should find a way to Police that on your own without breaking mods for people who play single player. This was a lazy solution from lazy devs. And to the devs What's the matter? Jealous that an ametuer coder can make your piece of game look better than you could? Bummed out that a 16 year old improved Police A.I. or driving physics or weapon handling better than your team of dozens of qualified professionals? Or that some random can tune an ENB package to make your shader work look like a joke? Lol!I'm gonna with you the only way I can. Enjoy this anti reccomendation from YET ANOTHER dissapointed user. We're going to drag your rating down to the level it deserves. And there is no WAY I will even CONSIDER paying money for your next title. Learn from developers that embrace their modding community. Go have a look at how many people are playing Skyrim on steam right now. Do you want a game with staying power? Embrace your modding community. You want a game to fizzle out into nothing? Keep doing what you're doing. Think about the thousands of people you've already put off regarding your next game release.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm sure some of the players are actually that skilled.Most of the DLCs are of no value. The only decent one in the entire game is the CEO update and that one requires far too much grind to enjoy without wasting actual cash.The only good DLC is the car theft one as you can actually have a few moments of Zen driving around. The moto DLC is only good because of the bikes picking up product and managing the business is entirely garbage. Only the deliveries are enjoyable and you need to spend so much time to get to them that they have well worn out any glimmer of the hope of fun that they once held.Bikes are fun choppers are fun. Most of the cars aren't terribly impressive.You people need to take the grind out of this game and a lot of the trash. The torture scenes were a joke it was like a shill piece for the waterboarding 'debacle'. As if to convince me that well sometimes torture is just a necessity. It was a petty bald face attempt at desnsitizing people. The whole game is like those scenes white washed garbage with a little bit of fun thrown in.Shills make your game great.

2015-05-25,0,0,142,False,Recommended,This is a well done game. The single player campaign was not ridiculously long and was interesting and entertaining. The online is great and provides a great time with fellow criminals.All I have to complain about single player is how far they went with some of the missions. You will witness a gruesome torture scene several sex scenes and other things that may make many people uncomfortable. If you can overlook these things you should have little issue playing.In GTA Online I do not understand why Rockstar felt that words that the non player characters use consistently are not allowed in the in game chat or when naming things. It also blocks words like gay from being used anywhere.Overall this game is worth playing but all I can say is player discretion is advised.

2015-12-05,0,0,994,False,Not Recommended,Shockingly Poor!As a huge fan of a stunning GTA4 I had high expectations for #5. Yet despite 5 years work by 1 000 developers the game which seems potentially large enough for 300 400 hours of content has at absolute best 80. The content that there is feels....rushed and slapped together. Most of it consists of 'go to this place as fast as you can.'The story script unlike the rather tight and compelling GTA4 script was again weak as if scribbled together hurriedly and without much concern.There are many inconsistencies in the game as well. Worst was the police reaction to player actions sometimes they were on sight instantly other times they wouldn't even react to a crime. There seemed no rhyme or reason to it.I never thought it possible but I actually have to give this 2 out of 5 stars. It's actually somewhat unlikely at this point that I'll plunk down money for a GTA6.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-07,0,0,273,False,Recommended,What can I say it's been my favorite open world game since GTA liberty cities came out. With GTA V it has one of the greatest single player stories ever imo. The gameplay is awesome there is so much to do you will never get bored. I'm on my 4th or 5th time through the story I just can't get enough. Multiplayer is great too with heists tons and tons of other modes and robbing gas stations is always fun. The updates online are very frequent it never gets dull. The graphics are one of the best. There is a ton of mods for it too. If you are into open world games this one is a must! I highly recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you have a decent computer. I run this with a FX 6300 o/c 4.5Ghz 8gb ram and a GTX 750ti 1080p mostly high settings and I barely ever dip below 60fps unless I'm in a very crowded place than it dips to 55fps.

2017-03-28,0,0,1190,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 9/17/2017 Since the Smuggler's Run update the game is practically unplayable. More than half the time the (incredibly boring and time consuming) missions don't reward you with any payment and instead give you an error asking you to contact Rockstar Support. Support in typical Rockstar fashion are either completely unable to help you or are outright rude to you if you contact them. Of course events that cost you money such as respawning car insurance and utility bills all go through without any issue. UPDATE 8/30/2017 GTA Online is basically a freemium phone game at this point. Everything is so expensive it takes dozens of hours of gameplay to afford and that's assuming you are never messed with by griefers or cheaters or run into any gamebreaking bugs all of which are unlikely. This is by design. Rockstar want you to get so frustrated with the grindy monotonous gameplay that you buy Shark Cards but if you do that it means each ""free update"" actually costs you several hundred dollars. Of course you could just cheat the money in Rockstar doesn't seem to stop anyone from doing this. On top of all that Rockstar Support is absolutely useless even when they aren't being blatantly rude.UPDATE Game is currently unplayable online. Modders are now capable of adding and taking away any of your money at any time and they are absolutely everywhere.EDIT I feel like I should put this first. Modders online can edit your characters stats and get you banned. They can crash your game. They can bluescreen your computer. This game has been out for years and these problems have not been fixed.*I don't often write reviews but I feel like I need to after just finishing up with a Rockstar support ticket.Before I get into that let me just say the singleplayer is great. Great atmosphere the city is cool writing is great charaters are memorable and fun. But surely by now you've heard all of that.Online is absolute garbage. Rockstar treat this like they're some indie studio making their first Steam Greenlight beta except they've got decades of experience and this game has now had two releases on multiple platforms. Balanced gameplay does not exist. Even without the rampant cheaters and jerks you can not possibly have a fair competition with anyone else. Players who have been playing longer simply have better stats getter gear and more money than you. You are completely helpless unless you hate yourself enough to whether the storm of nonesense for dozens of hours and level your character up and all that awaits you at the end of that is the realization that you have wasted a tremendous amout of time.The game really shines in the cooperative missions but no proper browser exists for finding people to play with so if you don't start these missions with friends you can end up playing with anybody. Some level 1 nooby a guy who doesn't speak your language some troll just joining sessions to intentionally mess you up a horde of blatant cheaters these are all more likely to join your missions and heists than competent cooperative players and you can do nothing to stop it.You can report the massive mount of cheating modding and hacking all you want. There's even a button in the menu for it. But it doesn't do anything. Years in it's still a problem and isn't getting any better. And if all that cheating ends up costing you a ton of in game money Rockstar isn't going to care. But they will offer you some Shark Cards to buy. That's all this game is after all. An enticing hook followed by a pile of frustrations and then a promise that forking over more money will make the torture end.

2015-06-05,0,0,2043,False,Not Recommended,I love this game but it's like a bad relationship I keep coming back expecting it to change and it doesn't. I can even look past the shark card nonsense and over priced free content but the lack of support and modding has finally after so many years gotten so bad that you literally cannot find a session without a modder turning a server into their own amusement park. Reporting these modders has been laughable for years and they even brag in public games that it will do nothing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,3652,False,Recommended,Rockstar themselves seem to treat Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online as separate games despite being inextricably linked to each other. As such I'm going to treat them as two separate games for review purposes.Grand Theft Auto V is a very solid game. It's that GTA formula we're all familiar with 'shoot guys and drive cars and shoot guys while driving cars'. The gunplay is engaging and doesn't feel arbitrary the driving combines a realistic sort of physics with the arcade y driving of a pre GTA IV era a world that stays true to Rockstar's attention to detail missions are fun and interesting with only a couple exceptions the heists are engaging and encourage multiple playthroughs to experience the alternate routes characters that are interesting and interact in interesting ways (or they're funny at least) it's got it all basically. The PC version is essentially the definitive version especially with a robust modding scene it's an extremely good game that I would personally recommend to just about anyone who's got even a passing interest in video games as a whole.Grand Theft Auto Online... not so much. The same mechanics are there for the most part but the core focus shifts towards an interminable grind. The player is going to spend a lot of time grinding for the next vehicle or business that they're going to practically need in a public session unless they purchase one of the Shark currency cards. The problem with these currency cards is that they are valued extremely poorly since many things in Online are going to be out of the price range of the $50 cards with a few even out of range of the $100 card (a yacht will run most of the $100 card and leave little room for upgrades). Combine that with a community that's rife with hackers/cheaters/modders (whatever you call them they're basically just 'guy with mod menu and a scripthook that runs in Online') and Rockstar's bizarrely opaque banning practices (if someone else runs a mod menu and drops cheatmoney on you it's possible you'll be banned this rule seeming to change with every update) and you've got a recipe for disaster. Online is (evidently) more fun if you're in it for the PvP aspect but I can't attest to this personally.Basically if you want a solid single player experience this game can't be beat. If you want an online experience that lets you simulate the dreary grind of a 9 5 job GTA Online is the game for you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,2108,False,Recommended,Watched the pre order deals until what I wanted was available. I F***ing love this game. I know a bunch of people have been upset with the sales tactics and I get it but it didn't affect me. Also a lot of people are going on and on about how it's a 2 year old game. It really isn't. You can't compare PC to console. I played GTA IV on console and then on PC. I will never do that again. I should have just waited. It was sooo much better on PC (despite all the critics). Hence why I waited for GTA V to make it to PC and I'm glad I did. Online Yeah I see the reviews. No I haven't played online yet because of the reviews. Besides I have a job and a wife so I don't get to play that often as it is. I haven't even beat the story yet. I won't be spending any additional money on this game until the complaints are addressed. The game is exactly what I was hoping it would be since GTA IV. If you've played previous versions you shouldn't be disappointed. I love the detail on everything the size of the map the stupid mountain lions and the random police chases (not involving me) that I follow to watch the resolution and then collect whatever is dropped. I hope to see more random events in the next title but for now there are a ton of great MODs to try and expand the already awesome game that is Grand Theft Auto V.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have tried EVERY SETTING UNDER THE SUN.Issue 1 CPU usage GTA V is using 60% minimum of my CPU at any one time and yes it maxes out my CPU.I have tried setting every single graphics option to the lowest setting including populations and car density and distance scaling. It doesn't matter what settings I use the results are the same at MAX settings and MINIMUM settings.I don't know why this is happening but I want it fixed. It only happens with this game.Issue 2 Memory Leak GTA V has a huge memory leak. It's affecting a tonne of people yet there isn't a solid fix anywhere.Appart from this for the 15 minutes I get to play the game runs beautifully on any setting.Unfortunately since I only get to play 15 minutes (the length of the mission I have to do) and then crashes due to maxing my memory out losing all progress I cannot in good consience recommend this game until these issues have been fixed.TLDR CPU usage is too high on minimum settings and there is a massive memory leak.If and when these issues are fixed I will re evaluate my review.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything script handled must go through rockstars servers so why in the hell can we use scripts without administration priviledges? It's painfully obvious that they care only about shitcards I mean shark cards.I'll be honest I modded all of my wealth because online is a grind. Not a good grind but the type of grind that feels like your face is being pressed against a belt sander. Anyways I never hurt the players and when engaged in battle I would play normally. But because I do that doesn't mean others will. I heard they started handing out bans and have not modded in over a year. The real issue is blackhat modders or asshat modders as I like to call them. They will attach to you blow you up aim hack god mode ... the list goes on.Online is trash I'm not afraid to admit it. I have over 500 legit hours played online and the only thing I can say is Boring grind fest. When the grind is over you can subject yourself to killing randoms over and over because you may be better than them. OR you encounter an asshat modder and die a lot. You can switch lobbies but that doesn't fix jack for the player base. I still play online but only in a sandbox manner as I have everything unlocked and I enjoy the character creation and DLC vehicles that stuff is great.The main game is forgettable as with all grand theft autos. These games were never meant to be taken seriously. From the time I was a child it was the thrill of playing it at the behest of our parents and once we could all we did was gun down hookers and hit jumps in vehicles.

2017-08-29,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,Honestly for the price this game is complete trash and considering it took them an extra year to get it to PC it's a crashing badly coded peice of This game is so poorly made that it crashed ans freezes all the time and sometimes things just don't work. Rockstar has not stopped the problem of actual hackers in Online lobbies but focus on single player modders. Everything in this game is ridiculously expensive and all the buisnesses that make it easier cost so much that a lot of people will never own them before they stop playing the game. Especially because lower leveled players are constantly getting ed in online lobbies. If you don't have all the armoured and high damage vehicles the high levels do they'll just constantly kill you when you try to do anything. You need to grind heists and activities endlessly to buy one of the buisnesses/buildings that give you access to more funds and even then it takes even more money to work them. Rockstar wants you to buy the incredibly overpriced shark cards for 11.99 I can get 1 250 000 in game dollars. Sounds like a lot right? No it's jack That will barely get you anywhere in game and it's not enough to buy anything that will give you a return on it. I bought a bunker when they first released and I STILL haven't even got to HALF what I spent on it. Don't get this game you'll get addicted and it's a game and a massive waste of your time. Play the older GTAs or Saints Row. You can get from them all the good aspects of this game at a fraction of the price that is still 39.99 after being out on PC for over two years when it's riddled with bugs and issues. They expect you to pay so much for in game money like this is a free to play game. Rockstar you done ed up. Don't buy save your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

As for the online yes it's fun there's lots to do but if you want to buy nice cars start a business or buy anything over one million. Then you may as well either quit your job or drop out of uni and never leave the house because the amount of free time you will need to be able to afford expensive items in this game is beyond what most people over 18 have. If you want those things prepare to purchase ""sharkcards"" which are in game microtransactions in which you pay certain amounts and get GTA cash.You either need to have more free time on your hands than you know what to do with or have lots of money. Honestly GTA Online is the only game where I would say it is justified to accept free money from hackers not that I have done it myself which is why I still don't have enough money to afford nice things despite selling some cars that weren't even that expensive to begin with.With all that said I would reccomend this game as it holds one of the best single player stories I've ever seen.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,0,0,1272,False,Not Recommended,It's absolutely horrifying how Rockstar managed to turn this once great game into such a pile of garbage. Where do I start? First of all the in game economy is so poorly balanced that you have to grind missions for days upon days to earn any money for the new DLCs. And what happens after you do that? Rockstar applies a blanket money sweep to remove millions of dollars from tens of thousands of innocent players under the false pretense that it is illegitimate money. I myself lost 2.6 million that I grinded for several days due to this moronic decision made by Rockstar. This was cleverly done right before an expensive DLC. Then they great you with a screen that desperately advertises the all new pricing of shark cards (pay to win MTX). This is pathetic for a game that I paid 60 dollars for. The new DLC is a horrible unoriginal and buggy copy paste of so many past DLCS (pick a crate up deliver and sell it for pennies).Also all of my new aircraft upgrades that i paid money for are now gone due to yet another ridiculous bug.

The modding community is important to this game without it I would have never bought 2 times on the PC I would not even be playing the game anymore. I would have never bought GTAIV in 2017 when the game released in 2008. I support the effort to rid GTA Online of mods but OpenIV does not even let you load Online with it installed.

Holding me down making me wonder why i have it in my life but still there haunting me with its monotonous prescence and making me crap my pants knowing i paid a decent $36 for it when i could've realistically bought 40 games with that much money as steam usually does have decent prices for good games. This game is just not what i expected to get with $36....... Now for the record. I have not even fully installed the game it has been 4 millennia since i have begun my journey into the realm of downloading GTA V but i cannot but think to myself why i wasted 4 enternities on this large and daunting game. If i wanted to go and steal peoples cars feel like a bag and take money and other valuable items from other people i could've joined the bloods a long time ago. Meth mixed in with Grand Larceny and many other things just doesnt need to take a entire chunk of human history to be installed onto my computer. Rest assured once i play this game i should be able to actually take back everything i have just said about this game being crappy because of how awesome it will probably be. But still i wait. I wait for the dark ages to end in my downloads and for the light to come again as i await my ascension into virtual crime and pleasure of running over old ladies and not feeling a single negative emotion because it is a video game. Ah i have waited for that moment. Guess i have to wait for a few more life times. Buy this game however if you do not care about anything i have said because that is probably the case. It is a good game. That is all you need to know.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,229,False,Recommended,"TL DR after spending three days trying to get it to work i succeeded and had the most fun I've had in agesSo it took me a while to actually get to play this game due to problems which to this moment i still think were graphics related and i had to uninstall various programs to get it to finally run. once i did however it ran so smoothly and as far as i have found so far there are is one game breaking bug on the first online heist that required me to restart the game in order to progress which considering that this is a port of a game that was released about a year ago does mean i take issue with especially with the delays to ""polish"" the game. personally i still think they were right to delay as i dread to think what condition this game would be in had it not been polished and optimized as i have criticized developers for releasing a clearly unfinished mess on several occasions and it shows the care they put into this game if anything. Game play wise i haven't gotten far in the story yet as most of my time has been spent online with friends but from what i have played it is fairly entertaining so far and i can see it being more entertaining as the game progresses.Online however is a blast and if i was to recommend any part of this game it would be...the whole thing the single player is fun enough but when you add friends to the mix and random people it gets a whole lot more hilarious",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-15,0,0,422,False,Recommended,The base game is very good! It delivered most of what it promised. First person is pretty good physics is very good flying school was fun and the story heists are awesome! I would've wished that the story mode was longer and contained more missions than it did.Multiplayer drove me crazy (metaphorically)! Loading time aside you cannot play online missions alone or with AI and some heist missions require 4 players when only 2 could do it fine (I get it since it's a team from start to finish and the heist finale needs 4 but that wouldn't be a problem if you can actually get players to join in your session). If Rockstar updates the game with an add on where you can use the people you have in story mode (heist characters) within multiplayer then I would probably increase the rating.The life invader and social and crew pages are a nice touch to the game. They are well made to the point that if you go to the right places on life invader you'd get discounts in game. Crew emblems pent houses garages and the lots are a great add on as well.Rating 9.32/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,140,False,Recommended,"You all already know what this is it's GTAV. It's the biggest video game like... ever. We're here to talk ports.tl dr It's good.I'm running an i7 4770k and a EVGA 4GB Superclocked GTX 770 and I'm running at a consistent 60fps at 1080p on a mix of high to very high settings. I have not tried them but from what I understand 4K 3D and triple monitor support are also in and unofficial fan made VR drivers are looking like they're coming along well. The game also natively supports the Dualshock 4 without any need for an XInput wrapper. Here are some tips for performance Install the latest graphics card drivers. This should really be obvious but I see so many people complain about the game's performance without having done this. They help so much. I remember friends reporting weird stuttering and black lines on characters before installing the drivers and now everything is butter smooth. Leave grass on High not Very High. Lighting is affected by grass so adding more of it stacks performance issues exponentially. Turn off MSAA and rely on FXAA for your anti aliasing. 4x MSAA is similar to essentially playing the game in 4K. No bueno unless you have a Titan X or something.You're probably also wondering about GTA Online. Yes it was when it first came out. It's not now. Honest. Heists are the kind of mission that GTA Online should have had since the beginning and require honest to God coordination and teamwork to get done on a reliable basis as well as massively alleviating the grind. Unfortunately there's only five but running the regular missions and races/deathmatches/etc. inbetween help alleviate the repetitiveness. The regular missions unfortunately are mainly GTAIV quality of ""go here kill these guys take this thing back here "" but the heists are VERY well put together and the roles of the four players are utilized very well. The added quality of life updates also make just about everything about GTAO's general gameplay well... not a pain in the like it was at launch.I've had no issues connecting to GTAO even on day one and I still have connectivity issues on the PS4 version sometimes. Driving cars with the keyboard is better than I thought it would be but still not as good as using a controller but helicopters and planes are damn near unbearable on M+KB. I'd definitely consider switching to a controller on the fly when you enter those the game supports it. I've also had no issues with Rockstar Social Club and the entire thing is fairly seamless inobtrusive and has some neat stat tracking stuff. Still would have preferred Steamworks for GTAO connectivity but... whatever.The PC additions are pretty great on their own too. The video editor is well implemented and has a ton of options and Director Mode doubles not only as a way for staging your own GTAV video fanfiction but also as a general around tool that lets you play as Flying Lamar With Explosive Punches. You can also use your GTAO character in single player with it for maximum self insertion.Is it worth $60 if you haven't played GTAV yet somehow? Oh Jesus yes. Is it worth it if you have? If you really love GTA like I do yes. If not that much waiting for even a 25% or 33% off sale would probably work best. It's a great port for a great game and it and Max Payne 3 show how Rockstar is really turning it around in the PC department.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,127,False,Recommended,"After years of waiting a GTA game finally comes to PC after a very long time. The question is it good?Short Answer YesLong Answer When I heard that Grand Theft Auto V was gonna come to PC I was really happy. The console version in my opinion was good but didn't have any potential to expand sure it will have various DLC's such as Heist the PC version in the other hand will have a lot of potential copared to consoles for instance PC will have modding tools that will allow the community to make changes to the game brining custom changes for example there will be various car mods which will make the game more realistic but there can be other things such as funny mods where you can be superman and there will be realistic mods where you can be a police officer or a medic. Another reason I have bought GTA in the PC is because of its graphics the PS4/XB1 have very limited graphics power the PC in the other hand has a ""next gen"" change every year heck every month. This will enable Rockstar to make the game more graphically better and be more appealing towards most PC gamers and I am happy to say they have done that they also have made the game very optimized my PC which might not be the best in the world can run this game over 90 fps+ in high very high setting.

2016-12-28,0,0,1262,False,Not Recommended,Majority of negative reviews are just modders who finally got caught one way or another.Majority of people still playing are modders as well.What ive been doing the past few months when i want to play online is keep joining a new server until i find one with less than 10 people. and dont play on weekends. Just like COD most people who play this are just kids who get no attention at home and are being babysat by the tv.Im WELL over level 200 achieved it legitimately and get called out as a hacker every time i join a new session. But i know not to feed the trolls talking to clearly mistreated children only gives them what they want. what they cant get from their parents.The game is amazing. I have very little complaints about the product R* is selling us. The community is whats plaguing this game and destroying is legitimate player base.Less and less legit players come back because of modder trollsIf R* took away All the mods that seep into online gameplay it would become a more enjoyable experience.I cant recommend this game to new players. It is extremely difficult to level up online since most like to kill the low level players since they probably dont have decent weapons or armored vehicles.It would be nice to see R* do something about the game but we all know its never gonna happen.The game is like 5 years old now? Devs have made billions upon Billions from this game. If they havent spent any of that money on repairs to the few bugs or removing exploits then they never will.Posting negative reviews such as this wont make a difference. Coming together as a community and no longer paying for their product will finally wake them up. when the money runs out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,192,False,Not Recommended,I pre ordered this game like many of you did when it was first availible on steam. A friend and I waited the 3 months for it to be released did the pre instal and on the launch date we both promptly started a skype call and clicked play. My game started up no problem however he has had a countless number of issues and ever able to get passed the rockstar launch screen. I was able to play for the past few days but then just about an hour ago it refused to open. I have no fix for this and there is no reason for it not to open. So no i do not suggest buying this game until literally all of the updates and glitch fixes have been released.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,250,False,Recommended,When the game first launched back in 2013 I instantly knew that it d be one of my favorite games of all time. And it got even better once they launched (and fixed) the multiplayer. So far I ve probably put around 600hrs in to this title across all platforms only being beaten by San Andreas and Minecraft...When they finally launched the PC version it was a no brained for me to buy the definitive version and experience the amazing single player once again.I ve spent around 150 on this title so far yet they want me to buy cash for the multiplayer unless I want to grind it for forever...It s not even micro transactions but macro...I d rather have a freemium model introduced 10 / monthly for 5x cash from missions and other perks...TL DRThe single player is simply stunning amazing even.But the multiplayer needs some serious tweaking to still being enyoyable after 100 hrs.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-11,0,0,597,False,Not Recommended,Mods are back. Doesn't change the fact that the multiplayer is a broken grindfest full of cheaters though.

They would just repeated the accusation of those affected player illegitimately gained the in game money in question and shut down the conversation by barring them from replying.

This being the case they added abilities to get money. However those abilities are time consuming and in the long run barely pay off. you Shouldn't need to spend 10hrs of work to get enough cash just to buy one below average Item. Rockstar's Solution to modding shouldn't be to remove on of the biggest SIGNLE player mod providers. It should have been to rework there online so that people had to work for the items but didn't have to work as hard. One more thing a Triple A title should rarly have microtransactions and the player shouldn't need to pay almost double the games value just to get about twenty minutes of fun.$8 000 000 for $100 is not a good ratio.,Grand Theft Auto V

It sets open world games to a new standard from the buzzing city of Los Santos filled with stuff to do to the amazing graphics that are displayed as you skydive from a plane in the skies of the wilderness in Blaine County. Even something as simple as driving from one end of the island to the other is filled with tasks to accomplish in any way you wish doing whatever you want on the way.

2015-05-05,0,0,406,False,Recommended,This is an amazing game that has been fun for years. I have waited a long time for the PC release as I still feel modded GTA IV is the best game that we have ever had available to us. GTA V proves promising and I've already played for 200+ hours without loosing interest. Needs more mini games and such for just screwing around with friends online.The FOV slider at max akin to a 90 year old lady with binoculars taped to her face. It's abysmal without the FOV mod and makes 1st person completely non functional for a large sector of the PC community.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can't think of a better game in this industry. I'm not that fond of free roaming do anything games because sometimes they grow thin in scope and script but men this is the quintessence of videogaming!Maybe is just because I can run it flawlessly (no technical issue whatsoever) but the amount of details they crammed in it are overwhelming I really can't wrap my head around how much time people money making such a game must require. It's monumental! Skyrim is empty in comparison (and I love it too).Depth script acting missions collateral quests graphics... everything is astounding! Never have I seen such a vivid breathing replica of a whole town where you can do almost anything to anyone. And holy cow first person! Some scenaries are actually moving I feel like buying a ticket and fly to somewhere in the US now!The acting in particular is superb. Those characters for how obviously exaggerated they are still look real! Voice over is of cinematographic grade. Trevor sounds like a terminal state Scarface while Michael looks like taken out from the Sopranos while his family comes right from The Osbournes... Lot of fun! But again details are everywhere. Wherever you look whatever you do you always discover something new. Apart from the ""usual"" stuff (pimping car buying clothes food weapons...) there are tons of other cameos everywhere.There are cinemas where you can see actual movies (10 minutes each one) there are TV where you can watch whole shows there is an Internet you can surf (and tons of activities inside like watching videos buying stocks...) there are rides you can...ride sports you can practice strippers you can touch... And you can smoke some weeds just to find yourself in a minigame where you must kill ""aliens"" (hallucinations) with a minigun!And on and on and on...Boy can't I say how I'm glad I forked out these 60 bucks.

Take Two just ordered a cease and desist against OpenIV GTA V's most popular mod next to ScriptHook. This mod is necessary for almost any mod to run.

2017-03-25,0,0,544,False,Recommended,On the subject of OpenIV Take Two has caved to our demands and OpenIV is alive once again. I hope people update their reviews for that eventually.If you're not getting ganked by a 10 year old who's dad spent enough money on shark cards to get him a jet then you're getting bent over by a hacker. I have screenshots of an instance of hacking where everyone on the entire server got bent over by identical body builders and we just took a real rough ramming for about 10 minutes straight at which point the hacker dropped everyone from the sky. That released some of us but a few were still being rammed after they respawned.I honestly don't know whether or not to recommend this game. I suppose it depends on your patience level and how much you are willing to accept that Rockstar will never bother to resolve the issues this game has when it comes to morons wasting money on random murder sprees and hackers cheating in money alien spaceships giant bowling balls airliners soldiers endless copies of your character's corpse or even a body builder that doesn't take no for an answer.,Grand Theft Auto V

But after this i'm not so sure anymore.You took away something that I highly enjoyed along with everyone else that loved modding their game.Please reconsider your decision on this!https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv?recruiter 54515494&amp utm_source share_petition&amp utm_medium copylink&amp utm_campaign share_petition,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,140,False,Not Recommended,This game is very good when it comes to the story gameplay and characters. I changed my review from negative to good because it turned out that rockstar banning people for modding was false the whole time. I felt like a dumbass and I will apologize to rockstar for giving it a bad name like mod haters.if you want to buy this game for the story and not the multiplayer then i recommend it if it's the online portion you are after i don't recommend it due to hackers and crashing issues. P.S i wish steam added a mixed button if you feel both positive and negate about a game at the same time instead of giving a game a positive or pure negative scoreupdate after playing online nobody's playing the gamemodes (racing team deathmatch) online is very dead at this point it's too late for rockstar to revive the online portion of the game unless they sell this game super cheap on the summer sale so poor people with decent PC's who wish to buy this game can playt too.edit 6/19/2017take two decided to ban modding for gta v by taking down the modding tool called Open IV prevent modders from modding single player.i'm disliking this for being anti choice and anti fun. if i made my own game and people wanted to mod the single player mode id let them,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,388,False,Not Recommended,The sad thing is it's not that the game is bad it's the actual game infrastructure and servers that are apparently so easy to hack and mod. Take Two and Rockstar have already taken down the most widely used cheat/exploit providers which have nothing to do with openIV. OpenIV specifically gets you to create a mod folder that will only be used in single player. As far as I remember trying to mod the game files within openIV without a mod folder for single player means the game won't even launch or it will crash on start up in online. I was also speaking to a modder on the gta online chat the other day asking him not to give me money etc and I asked how modders could mod online so easily and he told me it was script injection which I'm pretty sure has nothing to do with openIV. If you want to add scripts you need an asi loader and so on and those files go into the game directory manually not through openIV. I've only ever modded single player and not for a while but that's how it used to be. Yes modders are annoying as hell but how much money do you really need to make? I bought gta5 on ps3 and pc specifically so I could mod single player as i had done with gtaIV and san andreas for years. Plus the pc community for gta5 is surely smaller than the console community who have no option but to buy sharkcards and so on so your revenue isn't going to exactly fall off a cliff. I think last year gta online through microtransactions alone had made over $1bn since it's lauch without taking into account purchases of the game. As a short term solution this might make sense to take two interactive but the ammount of negative community feedback will surely hurt them long term especially since they don't exactly have many big new games from big ip's out at the moment.

2017-06-19,0,0,967,False,Not Recommended,GTA V online is a scam to get you to use micro transactions to make money because doing any activities to grind the money takes too long. Heist are not possible to do since they require multiple people but no one ever completes them due to Quitters discconnects or overall bad match making.

You will play all 3 guys and that also kinda sucks for alot of reasons you will change their clothes save cars etc log on to play they will be in their starting clothes and the car is gone.Happens alot and its random cause they have random things that happen i guess while you are not playing? no idea.Also its another bad guy turns good guy kinda lame game. With end game being running Legal shops. YAWN This is easy mode gta.The easiest gta i ever played.I did beat the game and found it not worth 60 bucks.Cause story mode was garbage. Annoying playable guys imo.Playing as mike and cant play him till the intro of his family and kid mini intro almost everytime you log in is annoying.Same goes for the crazy dude being chased by police or waking up in his panties is lame.etc Storymode is 3 guys fighting and bickering in every cut and threw out the story it becomes like playing a nagging wife simulator.I would say get it on sale or for less then 40 bucks and yeah then it would be worth it.Almost all my time is played online hanging out in the stripClub getting lap dances or driving around at night picking up hookers for 70 dolla jobs.&gt and that is a bit better but i feel bored and burnt already.Online mode is a hackfest or a total grind that becomes very very boring pretty fast.If my bro did not have this game i would have less then 100hrs easy.The gfx for this game MADE this game.

Heists are cool if you know 5 6 ppl if not expect to wait hours and hours to get one done.I mean its a game for kids i played gtas as a kid.Picked up gta 4 and laughed and uninstalled half way threw(pc version total garbage imo) this one i picked up cause my bro wanted to play it its a huge city nice looking gfx but very boring imo.I will still get hours in cause i do like driving around and picking up hookers and such and shooting gangbangers with a shotgun in the face and i like the police shootouts...that is all.",Grand Theft Auto V

I'm now happy to recommend this game again!Great single player experience that's worth the price of entry with a great story and characters but also set in an expansive open world sandbox that lets you do whatever you want between missions.The online mode can be fantastic too when you can find a game that doesn't have any cheaters stick to Private games with friends if you can because running the online heists with a decent crew is . That said many have complained about the need to grind for money with expensive vehicles and other items to try and coerce you into buying ""Shark"" cards with real money.Previous review Take Two/Rockstar actively attacked the single player modding scheme by taking down OpenIV rather than opening dialogue with the OpenIV team with their concerns regarding online cheating or heaven forbid spending some of their impressive profits from the game to implement an anticheat system to prevent it as they've failed to do since its release means a negative review from me.Sorry Rockstar you done goofed.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-18,0,0,139,False,Recommended,This review will be speaking of GTA V from a PvE perspective as I am not a particular fan of going around blasting other players heads off surpsisingly.Yet it will not be a review of the 1P Mode as i still play this game with friends.GTA V as an online PvE experience is worth the purchase at least. You get dozens of quests as well as several heists each unique in their own ways. You have a reasonable amount of customization via clothes weapon choices and parental choices (Base Character design could have been a lot more intuitive however)Along with quests and heists you have Horde Survival. It's for the most part very basic but still fun and has enough variety to use your entire array of weapons.The Pros of multiplayer PvE is it's a fun mindless experience. Pick a quest pick horde pick a heist...drive somewhere and go guns blazing. You can choose a variety of weapons and cars and in most missions more powerful vehicles will be hidden throughout the city.The Cons of multiplayer PvE are a lack of things to do once you've gotten bored of these things. In partciular as you get more money these experiences can become painfully easy as vehicles can make certain quests and heists almost effortless and impossible to lose in.After a certain point it becomes one of those games where you need to challenge yourself rather than have the game challenge you.If you still find the game fun then more power for you. However don't get me wrong. For the single purchase price the experience will last for for a good time and perhaps you will find more fun in the 1P and PvP than i did. There's enough to hook you in for a good long time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-21,0,0,1118,False,Recommended,Hello Folk this is my personal review of GTA V and Online.First of the Story side of the game is SPOT ON perfect with no major issues.Just on occations i've had pop ins and a few graphical glitches yet nothing major to ruin the game.However the GTA V Story is standing above the horrific part known as GTA Online.Not only does online have alot of hackers and modders using godmode everytime they want to kill you or using instant headshot hacks.Passive mode is there wich sets you back to not being able to use weapons yet hackers can kill you by causing explosions around you. I have a recording that is very faint of a guy talking to another guy that he BOUGHT his mods or hacks on a website wich grants him the ability to spawn money set their level Godmode instant teleport fast travel unlimited ammo and so on.GTA Online has suffered from these idiots ruining other peoples experience of the game more often then not they try to frame legit players.Personally GTA V Online reminds me of the hell that was APB Reloaded full of hackers and non stop t all over.GTA Online is becoming this unless Rockstar decides to spot these people.I know that Rockstar is not an MMO based game developer by far as they don't have the needed parts for it to work seems legit ? What do i base this on you might ask ? well let me explain First of they don't have Anti Cheat or Hack software yet most modders and hackers use a third party software that runs in the backround of the game so it can't be deteced directly. I suggest a software that scans a users PC and banns them that way.Second Most modders and hackers spawn cash and a bunch of useless crap all over the map.Such as UFO's Swat with stunguns and so on. On occation it's fun when they spawn animals to run over with a moped or something. Come on ? who doesn't like a fresh cow beef ?Reguardless if they do harmless stuff i don't care as long as they don't ruing the gameplay for others.Rockstar has said that they are WORKING on something to catch cheaters and hackers.Well i call that A load of t why ? cause this kind of system should be IN THE GAME to begin with.As i did mention Rockstar is not an MMO developer yet they try and fail.But the content they bring out is mostly clothes and cars no heists no missions. i do understand that it takes time to program these things but if you aim for an MMO fan base you need to be ready to STATICFY. Giving content catching hackers cheaters and modder. but nope they bite the dust.If you play in a solo inv session with your friends sure the game works and you might have some fun but not the full experience as you lock away people from the outside as well as hackers.To be fair play APB Reloaded instead of GTA V Online as it stands right now.Don't get me wrong i love the GTA Series of games ALL of them but this ! This takes the top cake for not being a solid product as the MMO portion of the game.Graphics Exellent.Sound Good sometimes it flips out.controls Awsome for keyboard and controller.Content bad two things to do mainly 1 Missions and 2 heists.Anti cheat of any kind Doesn't exist it's based on player report other player with proof and nothing else.If you want a singleplayer experinece to blow you away ? Go for GTA V Want a good multiplayer experience ? Stay way from it and play APB Reloaded it's just as fun if not more now since they got rid of cheaters.My personal score GTA V (Story) !0/10 GTA Online 6/10 duo lack of content and full of cheaters.My judgement is based of singleplayer so i vote recommend but if you want the game for multiplayer ? become a cheater and it might be fun for you. You judge that portion.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is engaging and interesting the multiplayer feels great (although the community doesn't but I won't deduct anything because of a community) the guns are all diffrent with their own strenghts and weaknesses. I'm a big fan of the GTA franchise and this is obviously their best installment of the game. You get warmed up to each of the characters because of their personalities they each posess. They don't feel cookie cuter cardboard cut outs etc they feel like genuine people which is something many games have. I have an absolute blast when I play this game.

I bought this game with such a hope and excitment. Today I had the worst day firstly I have problem installing the game. It crapped out my hard drive had to increase the partition space so that the game could be installed. What is this ? It needs 150 GB to install 50 gb game. What compression or decryption are you guys running. Now that the game is installed it wont start. It just keeps crashing. Now I read these articles about User account names WTF is that. Why cant my game start in my windows account. So still I create a new user name then again try to start the game. Still crashes. I reboot my system around 5 times. I updated my graphic card gave all the exes Admin right. But nothing works. The launcher keeps crashing. I am bloody well not a developer but is this is what you call a product. Creating a ton of hype for the game and then you finally deliver it this poor execution and sell us this What is wrong with you guys cant you guys test it better. I am really dissappointed. No point of pre ordering. This is a real shame. BTW I wanted to gift this to myself on my birthday. Thanks rockstar and steam for ruining it for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-02,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,Storyline is great and the PC version plays excellent. Now I've already beaten this on the PS4 I bought this purely so I could play online in full 4K at 60FPS. Game performance is excellent and my single 980Ti runs this beautifully maxed out in 4K while achieving well over 60FPS consistently. Now the down side online is completely useless and unplayable unless you're playing on a friends only server. Every single public server is riddled with hackers/script users that will utterly ruin the experience. Because of this the game ends up being a letdown. Rockstar has seemingly no plans to combat the widespread cheater problem and seemingly only cares about removing player's in game currency.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-18,0,0,64,False,Recommended,This is how the game was meant to be from the start. The PC version is by far the definitive version of the game.

The single player is fun with an interesting story but Trevor is... uncomfortable to play. Updated review The service has improved over the past number of months and now it is much more stable. There are still some very strange quirks with the interface (load automatically online into a public game with no option to default to a friends only or crew only game) but the game has been very well supported and is very fun.

2017-06-21,0,0,335,False,Not Recommended,Anyone who wants to buy this game for GTA Online should DEFINITELY reconsider. Folllowing the Gunrunning update I was caught in a massive ban wave and my account was suspended for seemingly no reason at all. All of my progress and characters will be reset meaning that everything I have done in the game will be erased. If that isn't bad enough I reached out to Rockstar Support to seek help and find out why exactly I was banned. All I got was an incredibly vague and generic response that sounded like a default copy and paste answer. In conclusion do not play GTA Online on PC as there is a higher risk of being banned (even if you are innocent) and Rockstar support will only give you the cold shoulder if you try to reach out. If you want to buy this game for GTA Online I would definitely advise against it. Just stick with the current gen consoles if you have them and if you don't well it's not worth it since GTA Online is kind of a boring grind for money now.,Grand Theft Auto V

Nvidia graphics cards are the best for this game at the moment in time as they have releced a dedicated driver for GTA5 (AMD have a beta driver). Online sometimes crashes for me this may be because of my slow internet or just my setup. The game has an option for multipule moniters and other graphics settings. the only real complaint from me is that it is 60gb and with my internet it took me 1 week to download but aside from that i would recomend this game to anyone with a 350 setup or more,Grand Theft Auto V

Is there a safe mode for kids? My kids like to fly the airplanes and helicopters. And when they like to drive my car that is fine too. But I fear for them finding the stripper bar. I know that there is an age requirement for this game but being in a household with children where your pc is in a common room it is hard to not allow the kids to try. Please no judgement. So it would be cool to able to have a Safe Mode for just in case measures when you have to leave your game to go flip a burger on the grill and come back to your game to see your kids flying your airplane off into the sunset!

2017-06-16,0,0,28,False,Recommended,https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv I may not play this game very often and there's a good reason for that. Campaign didn't interest me bu the multiplayer did now that it's basically fallen to the hackers I can't enjoy it anymore. I've thought about doing some fun things to the singleplayer to at least enjoy the game I purchased but I guess I can't do that anymore and I refuse to join the hackers. Please sign it and help people who did nothing wrong get something they love to do back. Currently switching this to a positive... for now. Rockstar is trying to do its best by the looks of things to make take two get the broom out of their and stop going after singleplayer mods and to focus on those who's modding the online experience in the game that's hurting players. (IE Taking their guns and money and stuff like that.) So it's a thumbs up for Rockstars sake they're apart of this just as much as Take Two and shouldn't have to suffer for this Rep Bombing they're getting.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,I still do not recommend this game. Even after the whole mod fiasco I don't. ONLINE It's been a grind from the start. To even get a car and modify it it'll cost you big. Shark Cards are too overpriced too. Almost a hundred dollars for eight mil that barely buys you a yacht. (No wonder people hack the out of it.) Their anti cheat bans innocent people for just playing the game and even if they try to talk to support for it it won't ever help. Children are all over and you'll probably get kicked from heists if you're low level by the most toxic of players. Two thumbs down and a blown raspberry to that.SINGLEPLAYER &amp CAMPAIGN If you are considering buying GTA V for SP mods I'd suggest it*. Personally the campaign was a little slow for me looking back and also quite grind like again. (I've played it fully through on XB 360 and then some) Money in the SP is a bit easier to get but of course half of the stuff that is actually fun is on the online. Unrelated to gameplay but the graphics are pretty awesome if you're able to afford a good titan of a PC but even mine (Cyberpower Thermaltake with a 1060 GTX) slugs with FPS on recommended settings.OVERALL* Unless you're buying this for the first time or buying it for mods I don't suggest buying it for full price. And even at that don't buy it for full price at all. Buy when sales come on or maybe a third party. Online is crappy on many points and Singleplayer depends on the player's style and mindset. A solid 7.5/10 from me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,92,False,Recommended,Update The developer Rockstar is working on the side of modders. They are changing their publisher/owner's minds and working to protect the community mods. Unless Take Two buckles down and shuts down all mods this game has a single player that is fun again.I only ever played the single player the multiplayer wasn't really down my ally. The campaign was fun but once it's done the end game is slow and repetitive. Mods were the only thing keeping the single player end game fresh and Take Two went and killed them so that it could force players into multiplayer where they can charge you out the butt with micro transactions. If you're like me and only play single player don't bother with this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm not a fanboy saying this F Rockstar.I got the game as an early Xmas gift... two weeks I played up until Xmas... put in the grind loving it racking up 700K in game and a couple low level properties...Then on Christmas Rockstar offers everyone a free ""Hermes"" muscle car... all you have to do is order in ingame from the dealer ""free"" on the site and it will be delivered... well myself along with countless others clicked for the free car... YAY!But then the game deducted the cost of the car 535K (70% of what it took me two weeks to earn)...It's a cool car but I would have never spent that money on that... 500K in game is 10$ real life money in their microtransacrtions... I wouldn't have paid 5K in game for that car cool as it is... Well now Rockstar is apparently making it right for some and not others... I sit here days later waiting along with many others for the refund that they said on their support site was coming...Well it comes for some and not others... as I type this people are posting screen shots of their refunds...I don't know why this is so hard... If I drop 10$ on a card shark that money would be in my account right now... why can't they do the same for a refund?And is that refund ever coming at all?Did they somehow determine that only some of us actually deserve the refund? Did they determine I did something wrong? (I don't mod clean install and have a perfect VAC record in many years on Steam)...This whole things is BS...This is no way to run a company.Again not fanboy anger... this is empirically wrong.It's a fantastic game... I've loved every minute of it... I'll keep playing it... but I'm not spending any of the other Xmas money I have on steam on these guys...I won't give Rockstar another dime. Ever. Fantastic introduction you guys made to me... On December 28th Rockstar corrected my account for the amount that was taken for the 'free' car... some people are still waiting... It's absolutely BS to be working so hard on a mission only to have some kid destroy your cargo from the safety of his office with one button...Stupidest mechanic in the world... there is no defense for it. Just a blatant griefing tool. Still playing it a lot a month plus after getting the game... I love the game but You have to do things to make a session conducive to playability... griefers are everywhere on every server... so you have to fudge the game to get a private server for you and your friend to get 20 minutes of grief free play...You can save up all your money or spend on sharks to buy that tank to attempt to slow down the griefing only to be met by some kid with 134253561 billion hacked dollars who can destroy you instantly with the game's legit magic button...I'm sure you will think someday I'll have the toys and beat those griefers... but you won't... unless you hack too. It's unlike any other game it's absolutely a blast when it goes well... but you're going to have to bend the rules and research tricks just to get some decent play time in. And don't fall for any of the ""we'll give you X amount of money if you do this..."" promotions... I'm still waiting on the 200k I was supposed to get for signing up for their mailing list... and I'm still waiting on the 1.25 million I was supposed to get for buying a single 20$ shark during an exclusive promotion that was available to me in a loading screen...They're a clumsy company with a great product... unfortunately the company is entrenched in the gameplay so does affect you.I play this game a lot... more than any other game I own right now... but I only enjoy it because I bend the mechanics of the game to play without grief. If you cannot do this or if this is a pain for you you will not enjoy this game.Unless you like grief I cannot recommend this game. I did end up getting the promised promotional money after I sent in a ticket and a little wait... but by then I just didn't care anymore...I'm not really playing the game anymore.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-12,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,I really hate to give this game a bad rep based on something not game related but I feel compelled to warn those thinking of purchasing and losing $60.00. I bought this game after it came out for PC as an upgrade from my PS3 version. Graphics are crisp and beautiful the story is excellent with tons of extras after you finish the main storyline. My problem is with the Rockstar Social Club and their TERRIBLE service. They will not respond to countless emails I have sent to them about how their Social Club launcher will not let me play my game if this was one of the cheaper less new games I probably would not be so passionate about this but for this I feel completely jipped and ripped off. My experience with Rockstar has been one with months of not being able to play the game I spent a lot of money on and after this awful experience I will more than likely be searching for other games to spend my little amount of time one. Social Club is complete garbage and I'm shocked that such a well respected company treats their customers in this manner. Will more than likely not be purchasing another Rockstar product that I cannot even play.,Grand Theft Auto V

The flexibility for mods as well as the performance/optimization is great. It runs smooth as silk on my rig at a steady 60fps on very high and some settings on ultra (i5 3350p 3.1ghz 16gb RAM EVGA GTX 970 SC 4gb stock clocks and it is installed on a mechanical drive at the moment) Tons of options to tweak the graphics settings and custom tailor them to your system.

2015-04-22,0,0,71,False,Not Recommended,Before I start this review let me make one thing clear. The game runs fine good graphics and everything. The single player is just as fun as always. This review is focused entirely on the multiplayer. I ve also heard about the shady business practice of bumping the price up adding a shark card that gives in game money putting it on sale . The shark card caused you to not be able to refund it. However I want to talk about the multiplayer in general. For starters good luck getting a good server. In most cases you ll get into a server with maybe 2 to 3 people. The loading times are unreasonable. One time I counted (no joke) 10 minutes to join a server with only 1 person. Most of the time it would just kick me back to single player but it didn t. Then there is the people themselves. Yes I know the game is rampant with hackers right now but that s not my issue. Seriously people when they made the PC version you should all have expected this to happen. Anyways the online for GTA V encourages you to be a jerk. No really I mean it. You gain more XP for killing other player than playing with them say robbing stores together or going on a cop massacre. It s okay to kill people but once you attack their car then YOU are the bad person not the guy killing you. Then you have the issue with matchmaking. Want to play a regular team Deathmatch? HAH! Good luck. Ever map is player created with an exploit that allows the original creator of the map to escape the initial zone and kill people without retaliation. The heists are cool but trying to get into one with random people is a chore and almost not worth it. However the biggest offender is the racing. In order to get car upgrades you have to win races. Simple enough the issue is YOU HAVE TO PLACE FIRST. So this means that you have to win tons of races in first but here s the issue it isn t balanced. In most scenarios a person will have a decked out vehicle far better than my noobish car and leave me in the dust while I struggle to keep up. This means if you don t need skill just a good car.Almost every issue in the multiplayer could have been fixed with a little thinking but there was none. Rockstar if you read this or better yet even care about us here is some suggestions (once this hacking problem is fixed). 1 Matchmaking with Rockstar ONLY maps and an even playing field. No level requirements for specific maps and no bonuses to higher players. Everyone is treated the same and everyone can play the same map. And having only Rockstar maps means people can join matches quicker rather than having to dip in and out of matches looking for a good server.2 Allow 2nd and 3rd place winners in races and the same rule as number 1 so people with no vehicle upgrades can have a chance to win rather than get slaughtered by the high level players.3 Have a reward system so when players play together in free roam they earn more. Not the stupid 100 xp for cruising with other players. I played GTA V online to play with people not avoid them.4. Enough with the being a bad sport. It s GTA V for God sake. Being put down because I blew up the jerks car that has killed me repeatedly over the past 20 minutes is ridiculous.And finally number 5.Try and see if you can work things out with loading screens like a single screen for matchmaking and so on so we don t have to constantly go in and out of loading screens. (I know this one is more complex and probably can t be fixed but it is an issue.)Again if you want the game for Single player then buy away. But the online is a mess. I wish I could get my money back then I d go back to the PS4 or 360 version.This is just sad.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,102,False,Recommended,"Would I recommend this game? Well yes. It's good very good. Rockstar did a great job with optimizing it. It runs smoother than I could have imagined! GTA Online is very fun especially seeing as in most online PC PvA games like DayZ for instance the first person you meet shoots you in the face. This does not happen unless you meet someone who's player icon on the map is red for if that happens your gonna have a bad time.One gripe I have though and it isn't just me and it's not limitted to this current GTA either is the Vehicle controls. Car controls (Keyboard and mouse) Your standard WASD system with Spacebar to use the handbrake. For some strange reason though E is not the ""Activate Car"" button as it is with EVERY OTHER GAME ON THE PLANET. It is instead F and E is the horn or fire weapon/activate boost. Slightly petty I know but still.Plane controls (Keyboard and mouse) Took a bit of getting used to but once you have got the hang of it its livable. WASD makes you accelerate brake and turn. The NUMBER PAD makes you do all the special plane stuff like pitching and rolling etc. Now that would be acceptable if they gave you a tutorial on ""How to fly a plane for Dumbasses"" like myself. But they don't. Instead you are left to repeatedly crash into the mountains until you work it out.Helicopter Controls (Keyboard and Mouse) Ah the Helicopters. I'm not gonna lie they are PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to use with a Keyboard and mouse. When I first tried to fly one I spent most of the time crashing and saying ""I just want to go forward why wont you let me go forward?"". There is no clear button to go forward. W makes you gain altitude while 8 (on the numberpad) makes you pitch forward. Holding these two together and you hurtle forward uncontrolably. Why you can't JUST go forward is beyond me. The rest of the controls are not much better.So to round off. The game is great there's no denying that. Just please for the love of God and your own sanity get a controller to fly aircraft otherwise that computer you got in order to run the game might just find itself on the ground outside in small pieces.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-05,0,0,74,False,Recommended,I really love this game at first I hesitated to buy it for all the bad comments from people who said that online there were many hackers / modders etc etc etc. But since I am a fan of GTA V and I have been playing it since I have the Xbox 360 I decided to buy it in an offer and I must say that I do not regret buying it since people are right from time to time I find myself with a hacker but I just change my session and problem solved. So if you want to buy it buy it people are right to say that there are many hackers but that has never affected me much. I must say that it is one of the best games I have played.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you want to play this game online you risk having hackers steal all the stuff you worked for or you're going to get banned for driving around having fun with a friend. I got a 10 day ban for playing with a friend in a crew only server. I don t cheat mod or hack. Rockstar games will not help you when they falsely ban you. After a ten day ban I played a couple hours with a friend and got banned again this time for a month. First ban 10 days and Rockstar stole all my in game money. Now thirty day ban called Rockstar they refuse to fix anything hung up on me. Game was fun lots to do but now I m out the real money I paid for this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-11,0,0,298,False,Recommended,Base game is amazing. Love the gameplay. The lack of proper support to rid/prevent the game of hackers during online play is a BIG BIG BIG problem. It's so bad that it seems most who do play online welcome the hackers. Some cause crashes and others give out tons of cash imbalancing the game among other problems. The online support for a female character is a nice add on. Recommend future GTA games to have at least one female lead option or a gender selectable option from the start as a added feature but is not required (just would be nice). Game generally runs smooth and save features work well too. Any chance for a rock climbing/rappeling option to be added into future games?,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,305,False,Not Recommended,"This was a good game.Key word ""was""Rockstar is a fantastic developer who created a masterpiece with grand theft auto V. Diverse enjoyable gameplay great characters wacky story and a vast alive open world to explore with thousands of easter eggs and such to find. Even the online was a good concept. Put thirty people into the already wacky world and just let them do whatever they want.But then we get to Take Two.Ahhh Take Two. The worst ever thing to happen to one of the best things ever. The greedy scummy money grabbing of TT had a licence to print money in their hands. The most profitable video game of all time on 5 different platforms and it was all theirs.And boy did they ruin it.The history of GTAV since its release has been a long line of screw ups one after another leading right up to today and probably going on. And all because someone decided it would be a clever idea to add micro transactions to GTA online.This lead to many problems. First was the cancellation of any single player DLC in favour of purely multiplayer expansions. This meant that there would not be any expansions on the rich engaging world of GTAV instead focusing on the shallow world of GTAO.Then there is the GTAO expansions themselves. Rather than adding to and enriching the gameplay (which is riddled with awful load times lobbies and player dropouts resulting in automatic failures of missions) they instead just kept adding more content which players had to pay for with in game money and forever increasing the cost of this stuff (which is mainly just vehicles and properties) meaning that to continue players would either have to grind for hundreds of hours or purchase the microtransactions.Then when players were fed up they instead understandably just modded in the new content into the singleplayer to enjoy it. Of course this meant less income from micro transactions so of course TT had to put a stop to that. So now if you do mod in any of this content into the single player it is automatically removed.But the icing on the cake came just a few hours ago when TT issued a cease and desist against OpenIV one of the main programs for making GTAV mods and basically made modding illegal somehow stating that Open IV allows ""third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take Two's rights"" which is bulls***.I don't really have anything else to say. If you have even a shred of decency then you will not buy this game nor any other that has any link to take two (i.e. any rockstar or 2K game). Please do not allow things like this to continue. It is harming the industry we all love and will only serve to further the ever worsening reputation the gaming world has.TLDR F*** Take Two and F*** this gameEDIT Rockstar seem to have now overruled TT and allowed openIV to operate. HOORAY. However these business practices cannot be allowed to happen so my review stays negative.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-12,0,0,143,False,Recommended,"I'm recommending this game it's awesome. What's more fun that an open word with fast cars guns planes money and hookers. However here's my beef.To those of you that will say ""You don't get banned for nothing."" You're wrong.(bitly because removes links) 2aSildIHere is a video of me minutes before receiving my first ban email. Dropping out of plane into the middle of the ocean onto someone's yacht just screwing around. At 30 seconds everyone on my server leaves/is kicked at the same time. The exact same thing happened the second time I was banned. The second time I was just driving around aimlessly. I wasn't harassing or interacting with any other players including friends definitely not spinning some slick mods to people off no offensive chat to get me reported just banned. I hate hackers as much as the next guy.The worst thing is the next time I'm banned I ve read it's an 18 year ban for a third offence. Okay well 2/3 of the last times I've played I've been banned running a totally vanilla game. One month of no GTA online that sucks but essentially permanent ban that s a problem. What do I do online? Nothing really. I'm low level and mostly do racing if anything outside of free play. When racing I always finish in the back because I have crappy non custom cars. Best hacker ever.""But you probably took money from a hacker"". No. The only money I have ever received from outside of jobs/races/etc I got 1.x mill for buying the game during a promotion through Steam.""But you probably modded the local game"" No. Never done anything but click play and...play.""You probably have other modding software on your computer"" Only if Skyrim workshop counts but I don't think my extra high detail grass would trigger a GTA V ban.What's the point? Don't waste your time calling support. The following is part of an email I received from support rockstar.com. We generally do not overturn temporary bans nor can we guarantee individual responses to any temporary or permanent ban appeals however we will review any evidence you submitted and take it into consideration. No further information is required from you at this time and this ticket will close on its own. I've called them 3 times because I kept trying to come up with new evidence of me not hacking. Asking them what I can submit to them to prove I was not hacking. It was the same experience every time and they wouldn't even consider looking at my evidence. (For those of you reading this saying Look at this hacker noob just wants to get back online and hell with us. This is way past my effort threshold if I personally knew I had done something wrong)So anyway here's what WILL happen when you call Rockstar Support.1. You'll sit on hold for 45 minutes while feeling like EVERYONE has to have the same problem as me.2. A person reading from a script will pick up the phone.3. You'll tell them your sob story while they do a terrible job of sounding like they care that you've been on hold for 45 minutes responding to an email that came from support rockstar.com. (But let s be honest these guys have a tough job)4. You'll be put on hold while I'm guessing they take a swig of schnaps from their coffee cup and hyperventilate into a paper bag. (tough job requirements)5. Your friend the support guy gets back on the line and will repeat over and over again as you ask more specific questions that...""GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors including modding in GTA Online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience.""(Thank you I understand but I'm being persistent because apparently you refuse to understand that I have never done anything but PLAY this game)(repeat step 5 8 10 times)6. You get transferred to a manager the only difference is they (probably) have the ability to hang up the phone after you continue to be persistent. No matter what evidence tried to provide even the manager would just repeat the same line over and over.7. The manager (or other) will try to push the conversation to ask you if there are any other support questions not related to banning they can assist you with.(Well Sir your security scripts banned me while playing a totally completely unapologetically vanilla game. TWICE. That sounds like a solid support issue. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I do have some software on my machine that is causing this. Probably not but that sounds like something you should help me troubleshoot. Instead just repeat your scripted answer.)8. (I wasn t actually being a just persistent) Thank your support engineer/person. Make sure you use their name and understand that they have done all they can for you. I m telling you right now they can t do anything. Apologize for that time when things got heated and you called them a filthy (you not me I didn t do that). Clearly this issue is out of their control. They do not have the power to fix your ban or the scripts that caused it and they are not allowed to connect you with anyone else that may be able to fix this. Don t waste your time calling support when this happens to you because they just can t help. Stir up the community and see if you can get Rockstar s attention. They make great games but as someone who has never violated their terms of service in any way but yet am one wrongful ban away from permanent ban and a loss of the money I spent on the game I am pretty disappointed with them. I am seeing these same stories all over the Steam community so I know I m not the only one and it just sucks.Tldr Got banned from GTA V online 2/3 times of playing a totally vanilla online and offline game.

2015-04-15,0,0,173,False,Recommended,GTAV runs great on my machine. I enjoyed the game back when it released on last gen consoles but as a PC gamer myself I found the experience was hindered by low framerate low resolution and screen tearing even on the most recent Xbox 360 model not to mention a online fee for a console I rarely dust off. All the qualities missing from that experience I now have on PC 1080p60 running on my personal rig configurable settings to hit that perfect quality/performance ratio and FREE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. The only negative comments I can make about this game regard the tedious and inconsistent menus. Some GTA Online menu items are missing in the online menu when compared to the single player menu and there are seemingly three avenues to accept and manage friends and game invitations. Loading screens are long partially because it is too large to justify installing on my SSD but it is made worse by the fact that one must load into a random online session just to join a friend's session and load again. Thankfully these issues are easilly forgotten while reinacting 9/11 with fighter jets.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,45,False,Recommended,3 years ago GTA V came out on console and I was sure I'll never get to play it as I'm a PC player exclusively. When it was announced on PC and next gen I told myself that a simple port of the game was coming like many other games and that PC players will be once again treated like something that don't matter with minimal options and improvement. How wrong I was. The amount of work that have been put in this release is phenomenal. The optimization seems top notch and even the Next gen console version looks bad versus the 4k beefed version. I'm not playing in 4k few people can but I have enough horsepower on my rig to play it on ultra 1080p and I have to say that it's amazing. Mouse &amp keyboard controls are good (mostly for shooting!) but are a little clumsy in vehicle phases. Good thing I have an old x360 pad at hand.Technically speaking I dont know what to say. I'm speechless. There's so much graphical option than even the best PC games pales compared to this. For once we have a true PC version and not a quick cheap port with few to none options for us PC Master Race Overlords who loves tweaking everything D I have only played 2 hours but I can already say that I don't regret one bit to have paid full price for this game. And considering how much copies have sold already I hope more editors will be willing to make true PC version of their games in the future seeing the huge potential it represent.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-07,0,0,380,False,Recommended,Despite having issues getting the game to work the first weekend this game is great. I'm over 100 hours in and I still have things to do. The single player was amazing the story and missions were some of the best I've seen from the series. The main reason for this are the heists. The game hypes you up using setup missions and lives up to it with intense escapes from the scene. Personally the Paleto Bay heist was the best with tanks and helis at every corner (Strongly suggest doing the whole thing in first person). The ending to the story was great and was completely worth the two year wait. GTA Online provides more content to the already amazing game. Missions are slightly bland and easy to cheat with the Karuma but enjoying the open world with friends and cool vehicles is great. One of the greatest additions to the series to give it the respect it deserves.10/10 Would watch that lawyer get ripped to pieces by a turbine again,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-07,0,0,97,False,Recommended,I love this game however there are many many many many problems with it and it's community. I am constantly recieving social club connection errors and crashes. The community is also very unfriendly on the most part with many modders/hackers and trolls who love to constantly blow up you and your vehicles and ruin your heists. The game is fun but these problems are making it hard to recommend this game to others and to continue playing it. as an example of the hardship I deal with I just got off the game after spending hours trying to do a single setup mission and constantly having to restart because of players who decide to leave halfway through or purposely suicide right before the mission's end causing me and my friend to get nowhere in our heists and to waste hours upon hours of hard work.,Grand Theft Auto V

From the new immersive first person mode that allows you feel like the world of Los Santos is more personal to the highly detailed and sophisticated graphics that the PC version has to offer I would definitely say that this game was able to do more than what a remaster can do.

The multiplayer though is mixed between great and horrendous so I won't purchase this just for multiplayer. Performance/visual wise it runs and looks well enough on low/medium settings for a mid/low range pc.There are tons of mods available unfortunately Rockstar does not support mods for this game. So never use mods when in multiplayer or you will risk getting banned. Installing mods is quite technical (Do your research before modding!). Using the OpenIV tool will save your life/time.Basicly an excellent story multiplayer is a bit mixed and modding is technical but worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

So some parents accuse murders that their children submitted to a game far as it being to them to concede that their children might've had a PROBLEM. It's only a game to amuse people not to promote violence and anarchy etc in our federal nation. Overall one of the best games ever made and since its debut there have been numerous Grand Theft Auto 're models' and what I mean by re model is by a damn ripoff that are more terrible than GTA yet there was NO debate yet at whatever point a GTA game turns out they have a prob.

If anyone played the boring missions or actually did heists together. The current state of the game feels like so much of a grind that making any progress just means more replaying of the same missions.ps The only way to make a good amount of money in online is with shark cards and you have to use the stock market without spending any money in the main game to become rich at the end.Please let this game die so rockstar will focus on making rdr2 playable.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything online is crazy expensive which in turn makes you have to buy a sharkcard which is the only way their still releasing DLC's and new content which is honestly pay to play in my book. If it takes over 10 hours to get a decent amount of $ to spend it on cars helis ect. Then you can spend that in seconds. Then again a sharkcard if you want more stuff. If they made it that you could do a heist or a job then have millions to spend all night with your friends instaed of a money war which is like the world today!

Oh hey reckon we can get to the top of that mountin over there on push bikes.... ""30 minutes later"" TTTT police helicopters chasing us as were on the back of a train.

I still have enough cash to get along half the fun is saving up for a couple nights to buy that brand new super car which will be outdated in the next update have not touched my adder in years. So when I hear Take twos CEO is complaing players arent paying enough I think hey thats me. Shark cards I only paid for the game twice cause I wanted to move from xbox to PC but obviously thats not enough. And now theyre trying to kill off the modding scene which is one of the best parts of GTA ahhh the carmageddon mod good times. Dont forget these mods are for single player.

I cannot speak for the console crowd but I can definitely speak from a PC gamer viewpoint. I get that you do not like the PC for your games since you can't control peoples hardware like on consoles. That is the reason you most likely will not release RDR 2 on PC.Its so obvious that your actions speak for themselves. And to add insult to injury you have the audacity to lie to our face about it. Open IV was not a threat to your online portion of the game people could still hack in to you game and will continue to do so. You used Open IV as a scapegoat to justify you actions to coax players to jump on to GTA Online and squeeze every penny you can from them. I understand you need to generate revenue for your product to keep your ship afloat but greed can only get you so far before it destroy's you from within. You have made a pretty penny from this and enjoy it while it last............... Because you have lost the PC market with you draconian policies and behavior. Stick to the console crowd if that is your attitude towards mods. Because that is the main selling point of PC gaming its MODS!!!!!!!Most Publishers and Game Studios support mods for their game. You are solo on this stance well of course if its developers that develope exclusively on console and or EA then you have some folks behind you. You will regret this decision for a very long time. Kiss goodbye to a lot of your fans including me whose been playing GTA Since 2004 First game being GTA Vice City for which I adore alongside San Andres GTAIII and GTA IV etc. Rockstar I bid you farewell from my life...................... It was a good ride while it lasted.Goodbye!Adios!さよなら!P.S. If you were to revert you Anti Modding Stance then you might be on the path of redemption with the PC crowd. For which i highly doubt. But feel free to prove me wrong.End Of Transmission,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-25,0,0,808,False,Recommended,As a player with over 500 hours on this game (because I used to play on disc) GTA V is a somewhat decent game to play. Story is great 3 playable characters each with rich backstories and unique personalities. The build up to become a multi millionaire is exciting. However the story is a bit short. It took me just about 5 days to finish the whole story and probably under a week for most players. If GTA V starts to get boring you have two choices. First choice is for you to know that story mode of course is also mod supported so you can add as much herbs and spices as you want.GTA Online however is where it's at. This mode is very well developed and still developing with customizable characters levelling system missions weapon upgrades property heists adversary modes free DLCs and much more. The downside to GTA Online is the community. Expect griefers flying in jets driving tanks flying motorcycles called oppressors modders and salty players (my favourite). Once you have a fair amount of experience in GTA Online it will begin to get boring unless you play with friends.Overall it's a 6/10 for me throughout my play time there has been a lot of dissapointments here and there but not enough of one to ruin my day.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now the point of online mode is spending all your hard earned cash on shark cards so you can buy all their outlandishly expensive flying motorcycles and super cars and tanks not to mention the continuous corporation type updates they release every few months. The amount of game time it would take to make that much money even for a high leveled character is ridonk.

Now i'm not one to write a review or complain about things however Take 2 Interactive's latest and foolish act to ban modding in an attempt to forcefully press their microtransaction hacker ridden online portion of their otherwise fantastic game has left me fuming.

2015-04-30,0,0,160,False,Recommended,"GTA Online In open world most people are constantly running around killing each other. Missions most people rush in and get themselves killed or they stand back and leech XP or it's disorganized chaos. It's only fun if you can talk your friends into playing with you otherwise it's a mess. There are also a lot of non English speaking players people who keep their mic's hot or people who scream and cuss almost constantly. But with friends doing missions it's one of the coolest online experiences I've ever had and that's the honest truth. So playing with randoms? 3/10. Playing with friends? 8/10. The missions are still a little repetitive until you level up.Character creation is okay but I've seen it done better. You choose a lineage mother and father and you can slide over from one to the other to choose which one you take after more. That's okay but the character models are pretty ugly for the most part. After that you can adjust a few sliders like chin jaw eyebrows cheeks mouth nose but it's still nothing even close to the options in games like The Sims or Saints Row. Outfits are unlocked as you level up but even the starting options aren't too bad at least once you manage to get to a clothing store.I'd still pick Saints Row 3 or 4 as better games overall but you can only do 2 player co op in those. If you want to play with 2 or more friends GTA Online is just about the best you can do. You do have to be level 5 before you can unlock PVE missions but it doesn't take long to get to 5. You can either join missions you get invited to (and you get invited to stuff constantly) or you can just do PVP missions or races until level 5. Beware though if you see a deathmatch type mission advertising unrealistic amounts of RP (rep points basically XP) or money most likely it's an exploit. You'll go in there and end up getting killed over and over like fish in a barrel. Just stick to the normal missions.GTA 5 The story is a little better than GTA 4. At least in this case you can kind of sympathize with some of the characters. It's still a sausage fest no strong female characters and overall a very ""dudebro"" tone. The world is amazing though very well crafted. There's just so much detail everywhere it's like nothing I've ever seen before. It's practically a simulation very immersive.I haven't experienced any of the crashes hitching or technical glitches like others have described. But I'm running an i7 3770k with 24GB RAM and a Geforce 670 w/ 2GB VRAM. I have to run textures on Normal high or ultra high requires over 2GB of video ram. It works seamlessly with gamepad for driving/flying or kb/m for shooting. It doesn't seem to have aim assist like GTA 4 did when using a gamepad.Collecting and customizing cars is more intuitive and you can upgrade weapons too. They took a page from the Saints Row series here but I still think it's better done in Saints Row to be honest. In that game you have more granular options for vehicle and weapon upgrades both functional upgrades and cosmetic ones.Overall I'd give this game a 7/10 but that's just my personal taste. The online experience is very hit and miss and the single player mode is a little too gritty and depressing just like most GTA games. If you enjoy PVP and games where you play evil characters this game is an easy 9/10 I think. But if you're more of a carebear like me and you enjoy a more lighthearted tone Saints Row 3 &amp 4 are still the best open world urban mayhem games ever made.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-13,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Been playing since the initial release on PS3 and Xbox 360 played on Xbox One and came to PC had to start completely over due to the player transfer function being removed but oh well. Lets get started.The Pros Very well optimized Fun experience with many hours of gameplay The great GTA experience everyone loves GTA Online is funThe Cons GTA Online It has seriously turned into a massive cash grind costs to afford even small things have gone up so dramatically you will need to grind a few days to get something small incentivizes shark card purchases or the starter pack both of which will honestly not get you far. The community is very bad comparing to the console versions I've seen very few modders on the console releases however they run rampant here as if R* care very little for the PC community it can make gameplay unplayable at times. Especially when you may not even know if they are modding and just make it look like they are superior to you in any way Controls Some controls are good lots are bad even with adjustments being made. I had to use Synapse to get the sensitivity even close to usable combine this with the fact the gamepad has more options than the KB+M for example the ability to change accuracy between aiming mode and looking mode. Operating helicopters was awful however it was fixable. The jet however I was unable to fix I have auto center mouse activated for jets and my mouse refuses to follow the jets POV making it nauseating to operate a jet and almost impossible to actually combat enemy players in one. Overall I reccomend this game because despite its problems I continue to play it even though I hate it with every fiber of my being.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-16,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto is a fairly fun single player experience and you will likely enjoy it however you like many people are hoping that the multiplayer is good I can assure it is not while playing in a closed friend session it is very clear that rockstar wants you to spend mroe money as almost vehicle of any value is priced at a range where you will have to grind way more than you want to as shown by teh fact that 95% of my hours in GTA online is just grinding the fastest way I could find. However if you can get past that closed sessions can be quite fun wiht your friends. The real problem with GTA online is public sessions which you often have to be in for certain jobs and such. Almost every single public session has at least one hacker that goes pretty much completly unpunished unless they hack in money and if they don't ruin the experience then the griefers will people that will almost never be punished because they didn't hack but will work as hard as tehy can to use all of their resources to kill you over and over again. You may try to report hackers as that will at least increase the chance of one being punished however GTA follows a premise where you cannot report more than one person every at least 10 mins in my experience so if you are dealing with multiple hackers you canreport one of them and leave the server or stay in the server getting killed every 30 seconds for 10 minutes while you wait to be able to report the next person.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-09,0,0,609,False,Not Recommended,"Update They have recently come out with a patch that fixed the fps problem by a huge ammount for the most part. The bugs are still there though. The content packs that they keep adding are keeping the game alive and I can respect that. I'm also glad they're free. Yes it's a given they should be but with many other companies they wouldn't be.There are many unsolved problems with the launcher and little bugs that just happen from time to time. I'm not the only one having them either as R* forums would prove (when I have gone to R* forums looking for answers it is a pretty terrible experience only to find generic responses like ""Uninstall and reinstall."" or ""Have you tried restarting?"" which hasn't fixed anything and with a game this big! that!). With the money gouging stunts they've pulled in the past (lowest of the low BTW) I'm skeptical about the next rockstar game being added to my cart anytime soon. Rockstar was on my ""evil/corrupt"" list for a while but now they're just on the fence. Get rid of those nasty microtransactions and you've earned my trust for the most part.",Grand Theft Auto V

Moders The online experience is full of those avoiding you to have some actual fun and making you die from the nowhere.2. Stupid Baning system Okay i understand it take a bit of time till you can ban every single moder in the game but really baning because of being rude? seriously rockstar you need to fix this and hire actual workers and not kid to decide who gets baned and who doesnt.3. Stupid missions and heists The concep is good (taking in count that its just a huge copy of Payday) but after doing one mission and another you will find out that they are all the same same concep of going to one place to another collecting a key mission prop killing 2 or 3 enemy hordes and thats pretty much everything in every single online mission.4. Servers and bugs Now i know its hard to make a perfect online experience since its a massive multiplayer but servers constantly crashing kicking you out of games lagg every 10 or 20 seconds and lots of game exploits (things that if you use could get you baned as well even thoug its rockstar's problem to be fixed) its not even a bit close for a good online experience.So yeah if you are a GTA fan like me and like the game story go ahead and buy the game just dont expect much for the online wich is just ridiculoss and garbage.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-19,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,It's a Ronseal game does exactly what it says on the tin. That's not neccessarily a bad thing but aside from a few nifty gameplay mechanics it's fairly weak sauce compared to earlier efforts.The switchable three characters work and work well. The script and story is excellent. And the world is... sublime.But... so many buts. The single player campaign is really all there is. Once that's done so's the game. Oh you can be all completist and collect bits of scrap or bits of letters and the like but that's kind of rubbish. You can do some races if you like. Maybe visit the 10 or so locations in this vast sprawling city that you can actually go into. You can buy different shirts. Cars. Surf the net and get all meta. Superficial crap abounds.But other than a whole lot of diet coke there's not much there with caffeine and sugar you know? Also Rockstar still can't make flying as effortless as it is in say Far Cry which is baffling. You can go online but if I wanted to associate with my fellow man I'd go to the pub. Oh you can do that in GTA V too.So yeah recommended but it's nowhere near as good as FC4 and that was basically just a copy of FC3 with a Tuk Tuk and ridable elephants so it's not like they raised the bar into the clouds.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-06-21,0,0,427,False,Not Recommended,Online portion of the game might be fun at first but after a couple of weeks of gameplay you'll come to the realization that there are more hackers than non hacking players in the game. And hackers tend to f**k up the game by exploding you or traping you and general hacker stuff. But don't count my word for it there are hackers that are nice and will give you money.I personally use to be a hacker but I only used it to give my self money and turn off cops but not bother anyone else's gameplay (maybe some rude poeple). I personally never played the story mode so I can't give my opinion on that.and a word of advice if you want to play GTA Online but don't have money to buy Shark Cards and you don't want modded money don't even start to think about buying this game because the items in the online part of the game are rediclously expansive. In a short sentance money is king in this game. And when rockstar was developing GTA Online money making was their main intention (real money) not the player experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

There are always curveballs that throw what you thought was right into what was the wrong choice.

2017-06-20,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,Ok so in the light of Take Two essentially banning mods from the game by sending a cease and desist letter to OpenIV (the modding tool used for all mods) i'm going to write an actual review on this game.Singleplayer Single player is genuine fun and has loads of content to actually play. Not much to hate there. If you want to get this game for it wait till it's on sale you would just be wasting money.Multiplayer Multiplayer is the reason I bought this game for the third time once on XB360 second on PS4 now on here. I don't regret my first two purchases for I've had a load of fun and met some nice and interesting people but I am starting to regret getting it for the third time. The height of GTA Online was when they released the heists update. People started playing the game due to the availability to get enough cash to buy the new vehicles and toys to play with in a fraction of the time it would take to do actual missions. After that it's been going down hill. Almost every new update comes with ridiculously overpriced vehicles apartments and to start some of the new missions they could've added comes a nice pricetag that if you were to try and get the money for would cost you around a minimum of four end game heists. These updates come with such ridiculously overpriced items so you would be tempted to purchase a shark card (wich I admit to doing and to those who are feeling like they would by one for the new update DON'T. It is genuinely NOT worth it). This marketing scheme feels way too much like a Clash of Clans scheme where you can get the stuff the hard way and use up alot of time or pay $100 to take the next step foward. This kind of marketing needs to stop it's an unethical buisness practice and it's an attempt to get the people susceptible to buying overpriced sharkcards so they can get just one of the new cars (most new vehicles cost from $1mil $2.5mil but the newest ones cost from $1mil $5.7mil and you can just look at the price of the shark cards to give you an idea of how much you could spend). Not to mention the bannings of random accounts (from reviews I saw when I bought it on here) and accounts who have received money from hackers either willingly or unwillingly.Modding As most people browsing the reviews here would know Take Two Rockstar's parent company has sent a cease and desist letter to the lead developer of OpenIV to stop the distribution of OpenIV. If you don't already know what OpenIV is it is the tool used to create mods for many GTA games. Modding is what I would say as the backbone to a game and it's community. Mods keep games and communities alive for years after the game as come out (e.g. Fallout New Vegas The Frontier mod which is STILL in development even after seven years of the game's release). Seeing Take Two take it down is horrible and a real scum bag move. Overall If you want this game for singleplayer wait till it is on sale. If you plan to play this online don't buy it it is a huge cash grab. This is a petition to save OpenIVhttp //store.steampowered.com,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,0,0,224,False,Recommended,SP is freaking amazing. The world characters and dialog are so superbly developed. It all feels so genuine. This game has the most consistently entertaining missions of any open world game I can think of. None of the frustration and repetition you find in most open world games. My favorite part is that Los Santos is so varied from one area to the other you get a real feeling of travel and exploration. From the bottom of the sea to the top of Mt. Chilead Los Santos trumps every virtual world you've ever visited in almost every regard (unless that virtual world has dragons and stuff that's kind of an unfair advantage). Seriously if you like exploration this game is a must have. The story and missions are just a bonus. That said screw the MP. I do play it and enjoy it to an extent but it is riddled with problems. Matchmaking is a joke. The open world has very little to do beyond shopping and robbing convenient stores. Much of your time will be spent respawning after some knucklehead runs you down with his car. If you choose to fight back it will cost you a good bit in money and ammo for absolutley no reward. Freeroam fights are a waste imo. Sadly if you go into passive mode you can't rob stores or shoot cops. So you either take the greif or stand there with your hands in your pockets. Missions take forever to fill. The unexperienced can cost you the whole mission since your team is only allowed a single death. Communication is rare. I've only ever heard a few souls on a mic. A few more people type. Most people don't communicate at all. The missions especially heists are set up in a way that makes team work pretty important. So obviously playing with randoms that don't communicate can go south pretty fast. Unfortunately teaming up with friends is a chore unless you set up an invite only session. That said the missions can be VERY fun even with some randoms.The biggest issue here lately is the lack of mod support and the subsequent banning of many players. On one hand I totally agree with banning the people who add money and use godmode and all that. Maybe R* should allow private sessions to be used that way but since they currently do not I don't feel sorry for the people who used those cheats. They should have known better. On the other hand being banned for a FOV increase is completley idiotic and unjustifiable while any kind of mods/cheats used in SP should be fair game for everyone. R* definitely needs to be more selective about what they do and do not allow. All in all it's an amazing SP experience well worth the $60 I paid. The MP will surely be worth it for many gamers expecially ones with a regular group of friends they play with but others may be left feeling pretty disappointed. Of course if you are planning to mod the hell of this game so you can ride a BMX as a cow or Gaben forbid play in first person without getting sick don't waste your money. Not yet at least.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,0,0,2320,False,Recommended,An excellent game which has been ported extremely well. You can tell that Rockstar has taken care to ensure that the PC version works as it should. I picked it up immediately on release and it felt solid. A blessed relief in this world of shoddy console ports and massive day 1 hotfix patches. Those delays were worth it.The storyline is very well written and probably the best in the GTA series so far the characters are well considered and memorable (the acting is v. good). I got approximately 60 hours out of the main story mode missions alone and many more after they were over. The game is typical GTA an exaggerated take on the real world that while crazy never seems disjointed or overly far fetched. It all fits and feels right.Add to this the built in mission replay features (something the series hasn't had until this point) and a well executed online portion which possesses a level of quality in its missions that is on par with the main story mode content and its very hard to find fault with this title. Only the magic vanishing 'Dukes' problem I seem to have with Trevor has annoyed me in any measurable way other than that its me sucking badly in online deathmatches. Not Rockstars fault. )Pick it up you'll at least get your monies worth even if you never touch the online portion. However be aware that the download is around 60 gigs so be prepared if your internet connection is based on wet string.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,0,0,388,False,Recommended,This is the definitive game of Rockstar's series in the world of GTA. Although their release schedule upset a few people due to the huge time scale difference between PS3 to PC I can assure you it was worth the wait. I've personally had this title on PS3 PS4 and now PC and it is clear that they've spent a lot of time (and money) improving each release.Whether you want to cycle down a moutain photograph wildlife cruise along a beach or skydive from the heavens this game caters for all needs without forcing you to partake in everything it has to offer. However if you decide not to take up all this game offers then you're missing out. The storyline is well told but does lack a little edge unlike the story of Nico in the last installment of GTA but what does make up for that is having multiple interlinking stories to play through from the hoods to the highlife. You will encounter 3 characters who you'll learn to love despite their flaws and at the end the future of the open world is in your hands with specific storyline decisions. If you're thinking of getting the game purchase it. If it's not your type of game try it still.,Grand Theft Auto V

Or WAS.Have a look at this. http //openiv.com/?p 1324OpenIV was a modding tool which allowed people to enjoy new creations and do whatever the they wanted. Be a policeman? You can do that. Make an armada of planes chase you down and actively hunt you wherever you were? You could do that too. What about add additional scripts to emulate actual physics behavior? You could even do that.And now Take Two wants to bury that in the sand and consider it ""Illegal.""You know what? The base game wasn't that fun either. It got old FAST. This game is stripped of many of the nuances GTA IV had and GTA Online is a ing joke riddled with microtransactions. So basically the modding scene was the only reason I ever played this game after I finished it. I liked playing around with what people came up with. And now I guess that's illegal? Modding is the ESSENCE of PC gaming. It's what defines us as players while also being creators in our own right. If you want to consider that illegal go right ahead.

Well they could've become investment bankers in the first place but they chose the thug life until the story gets turned around completely and all you can do is subconciously accept that there is no way to get past the Govrnment. The same Government whose cops you constantly escape from which is actually no gameplay part at all anymore.While in San Andreas you were able to steal stuff from the military and use it later on in GTA V you actually have to return the stuff you stole from the military.

2017-06-16,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,This has been one of my favorite franchises since I would sneak out of class in eigth grade to play GTA3 at a friend's house. I saw Rockstar and Take Two as developers that had earned my respect and loyalty and I looked forward to everything new that they put out. But the direction GTAV has gone has disappointed me. I played it and beat it on PS3 and I bought it for PC because I wanted to try it out with all the mods created by its loyal fans. I was also looking forward to the the single player DLC we had been promised. Now the game is nothing but a swamp of microtransactions and cheap content updates designed to milk more money out of players.Rockstar's actions against the modding community was the last straw for me. Mods give games unlimited replay value and help create a thriving and loyal fanbase. If their goal is to push people away from single player with this move it has backfired in my case as I'm uninstalling GTAV today. I'm going to skip future titles by these companies as well unless they change their stance on this issue.,Grand Theft Auto V

Personally I think they should change this just because this game has been out for almost 4 years and sales won't go up much more.Multiplayer is trash. There are SO many cheaters and modders their anti cheat is terrible. Overall Buy this game if you love modding and messing around like any other sandbox game.

Yet if you don't your left trying to defend against an army of hackers that cannot die. Rockstar cannot keep thier servers free of hackers for more then a day with a new update. I can say this much my support wont continue. I hear the shouts of a gta 6 but why pay money for a game you know will be hacked 1 day after release.

I will be reviewing both the Online and Offline expirience.(Online)Majority of this has been playing GTA Online and I still have hardly progressed. I own a good apartment and thats it. If you are looking into buying this game for its online its too late you will join as a new player and either get kicked from the lobby for being too low rank and no one wanting to play or if its a race you wont win because you dont have a good car you dont have a good car because you dont have money which you wont get much of if you dont win. Forget about all the Online additions like Bunkers Airstrips and insurgents etc. you wont ever gain enough money to buy them and if you do spend all you money you had saved (Like i did) on a bunker not only will rockstar release a much better DLC for the online later but you wont actually be able to do anything in your bunker unless you have an extra million lying around. Not only are the items in game overpriced (online) but the shark cards also are so if you plan to say ""screw this grinding"" you cant buy shark cards without cutting off you own arm. So overall the online is a hectic mess thats if it even works in which case you will have to play offline.(Offline / single player)So most people (like me) will buy this game for the mess that is the online play. But you will come across your computer not being able to connect to servers for no reason every now and then leaving you to play the offline. I have been playing the offline single player for quite some time (2 days over the weekend literally doing nothing but playing the single player) for the fun of it. It must be said the campaign is amazing interesting funny exiting and overall and enjoyable experience that is of course until the game start to glitch out for god knows what reason leaving you no choice but to close the game of which you cant even go to your house to save the game because of how rampant the glitches are with roads disappearing and of course this game decided to turn auto save off for whatever reason and left me unable to turn it back on making me loose all my progress in the single player game and thus me finishing the weekend with no progress whatsoever.(Overall)Overall GTA V is fun exiting and enjoyable but only if you have a beastly computer and a miracle of an internet connection at all times and god help you if your game just decides to hell with it and just glitches / breaks / crashes for no reason what so ever. Leaving you to wait through the minutes long loading screen as you boot the game up questioning if your progress has been saved or if you have been banned for leaving online during a mission. Only to find that exact thing happening to you (note i have not been banned off online yet nut right now i am just sick and tired of pouring hours into this game and still have bugger all in online and only be past the Prologue in single player)",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-15,0,0,193,False,Recommended,I buy GTA games exclusively for the Story Mode. While I might give the online mode a go it is at best an added bonus. Rockstar have once again delivered an improved version of their GTA series with GTA V. The graphics the city the landscapes the vehicles the characters the story the soundtrack the mini games all improve every time. I was initially skeptical about the whole 3 playing characters thing and switching between them I found it gave the whole story much more depth as it allowed Rockstar to develop more characters further than if the extra 2 had been NPCs. It also allowed the right missions or roles in missions to be given to the right guy rather than doing a lot of stuff that was out of character.Already looking forward to GTA VI or to some nice DLCs for V.Edit Disappointed that all development is focusing on GTA Online and the single player mode is neglected and without any DLCs to date. I know Online is a cash cow but a large section of the player base would love a single player DLC.,Grand Theft Auto V

Changing vsync or mouse input didn't help. Settings didn't save after quitting the game and restarting Display calibration screen on every start Benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen FPS tied to sensitivity (not this crap again sigh)I run a i7 4790K 16 GB R9 290X machine and from what I could see from my short experience the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. This is the first refund I've ever requested and I'm glad it was still an option. Fully priced games in this case even more should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. One thing Steam could learn from Origin. I hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because I am certain the underlying game is brilliant but I just can't support it while there's so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-31,0,0,748,False,Not Recommended,The physics in game is AWFUL compared to gta4. Gta4 had understeer brake lock visible weight transfer and so on while in 5 every car handles the same and supercars are better on offroading than those proper 4x4 offroader which is ridiculus. Crash deformation is HORRIBLE you can crash cars into a tree at 100mph and it barely takes any damage at all they are like ing tanks. Suspensions on cars feels non existence. Tyres pops and donezo instantly when shot where in 4 you can see the tyres deflates slowly. At some places the texture of the ground isn't even matched up properly with the model so it makes the car look like floating in air. Water and explosions in 4 also feels more realistic and there can be disintegration of planes in 4 where in 5 you brake a single part the whole plane explodes. Fog in 4 when raining was so much better as it can be dynamic (cant find the correct word here) like gust and you can see water vapor breathed out of the character's mouth. To make things even worse unlike gta4 where all the interior of buildings are accesible in multiplayer only stores and barber shops can be entered. I do like the graphics and the map and heist and the huge number of different vehicles in 5 but there are so many bad things about it. Physics engine is inferior online mode is filled with cheaters and COD kids less details than previous gen stupid AI and LOTS of bugs. An off topic story Last week I spent a good amount of time describing a server bug me and many encountered in game and reported it to R* hoping I can get a response of them looking into the problem. However it seems that their staff didn't even bother to read my complaint and just copy pasta'ed a tutorial of reinstally directX driver to me. I love it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Far better expectation that anticipated. I was assuming EA like response to these things and practically no resolution so that is a massive plus that they have been listening and pulled all stops to resolve.As far as the game itself.Day 1 Got two lapdances with Sapphire then she brought in Tiffany.

I then sendt an email to Rockstar about it and they refused to help me. Then March 23. came and I got back into GTA Online drove arround town robbing the kiosks and doing small jobs for an hour while I waited for my friends (also after the ban my character had been reset). About 45 minutes after I launch the game again I get a sudden disconnection and the game crashes. When I then boot it up again I se one message on the screen ""You have been permanently banned from GTA Online"". Thank you Rockstar and Take2. So I contact Rockstar support and again they refuse to help. I send them 3 more emails and they are completely ignored. I can not play GTA Online anymore but this also brings me to my next point.Since I can't play online then I might as well start modding the damn game so did. And guess what it was fun. Although I couldn't play with my friends I had fun just going arround and essentially being silly (and a bit perverted if I am honest). But now Take2 have anounced that the modding will go to an end.

The single player campaign is fun and the mechanic of switching between 3 characters was actually well implemented for the most part. The only problem is that the solo campaign is too short and there has been almost nothing added to it since the game came out. There is also a notorious bug in single player that makes many of your purchased and modified vehicles just disappear. Rockstar has known about the glitch for a long time but has done nothing to address it. Kinda sucks when you spend a million or so on a car getting all the mods right and it just up and dissappears on you. The multiplayer is very fun once you figure out how to do much of anything.

2017-03-02,0,0,82,False,Recommended,"Review only concerns the Single Player Even if you've already played this on console I feel it's worth it to experience it again on PC with lovely mouse controls and a framerate that isn't a dipping 30 FPS. I myself succumbed to being rekt and bought this game 3 times once upon its inital release in 2013 again for the Xbox One in 2014 and AGAIN this time for PC. But I don't regret it.The story is a blast if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple hours at a time and ignore the utter ridiculousness of everything that's going on in this otherwise very ""real"" city. Follow the A plot story missions religiously saving the side missions for after the main story or exhaust every side mission before continuing the main story it's up to you (I also admire the way the side missions are written in such a way that they can be played at any time during the story and still make sense dialogue wise but I guess this is standard for open world games.)Do keep in mind if you're an 100% completion type of person that this game's idea of 100% is not in fact 100% at all. There are a LOT of things you can completely ignore and still get the ""100%"" achievement and still see 100% when you check your in game progress tracker.(PS I'm gonna chalk this up to the fact that I am just awful but I absolutely can't use KB+M to fly in GTA.

2016-12-17,0,0,5,False,Recommended,"Edited review after getting some much needed help getting the game to run at full resolution without killing my graphics card.+ Amazing graphics on both laptops and desktops but be sure to spend a good 20 minutes setting up your preferences or you could see FPS drops or shoddy graphics when you could be running on higher settings.+ Still has the best selection of ""radio"" music in any game to date. There is a genre station for all tastes.+ Classic tongue in cheek humour remains keeping that classic GTA style whilst still feeling fresh and new.+ Has controller support but a PS4 controller also works as well! Button prompts still display as XBOX controller but it is easily excusable.+ Very wide selection of mods (though not officially supported so don't use them if you plan on using GTA Online).+ Multiple characters each with their own personality and styles plus customisation for each one.+ The missions are fun though some feel repetative. Heists are the crown jewel of the list of missions though there are not many unless you engage in GTA Online.+ You can play locally in GTA Online so you don't have to play with strangers and can enjoy the experience with just friends/family. Takes a while to set up preferences in graphics.ect to allow it to run at its best without FPS drops. Mods have great community support but not much in the way of useful installation instructions. (You will need to be adept level or higher to know how to install many mods.) Update sizes are huge and only add to GTA Online...which is no good to players who don't plan on using it. These updates are not optional. GTA Online is notorious for bannings and character resetting. Do not use mods that edit RTF's on GTA Online or a ban happens instantly.Overall it is good on a laptop but I recommend it more for a desktop. Laptops can run it even those with Intel HD Graphics but be prepared to have it run only in windowed mode.8.5/10 (I love the game but still find myself playing it more on console than PC.)",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-07,0,0,1917,False,Recommended,I'm gonna start off this review by saying that once the singleplayer has been completed (i.e. to 100% game completion) the only real reason to ever return to it is because of the mods. Speaking of the singleplayer the campaign in this game is definitely 10/10. The missions are engaging fun and at times challenging (especially playing through the entire game in first person). But yeah once the singleplayer is done the only saving grace (and I use that term very lightly) is the Online. Since this game has been out for coming up three years now the rest of this review is more for the Online part. So...The Pros A wide range of vehicles to unlock and customise Penty of apartment space to store your collection of vehicles A variety of activities to play with randoms friends or crew members If you have a creative mind you will never find yourself without something to doThe Cons At least 3 in 10 players are hackers Rockstar Made content (missions races etc.) do get repetitive after multiple playthroughs Earning money in Online does require a lot of playtime Only three of the Heists are worth playing (the first three)There's probably more detail I could go into but for the moment I'll leave it here. If you're looking for a game with a good campaign and fun online mode this is almost definitely the game for you. Although I gave the story a 10/10 the game as a whole falls to an almost solid 7.5/10 (maybe higher if a singleplayer DLC is ever announced for release).,Grand Theft Auto V

My friends and I have been trying to play this game but due to horrible lag and sync means that driving in the same car is impossible as the driver and the passengers are apparently not even in the same dimension for most of the time which is a problem when you are evading cops. The passengers will on their end be stuck in one place (If they can even get in the car) and then suddenly (not frequently) teleport to the driver five blocks away. If you do a mission together it is near impossible to kill the AI as the sync is It takes clean headshots as no amount of bullets anywhere else will drop them. On top of fighting immortals the enemies can also insta kill you since the game has problems registering damage. Races are okay but you keep getting dropped all the ing time. And it's a pain selecting ""fun"" user created stuff if that's what's float your boat. Now this means that Free roam is where the game is at for my friends and I. And yeah that's actually very fun. If the servers let us play together. Which never ing happens. If by chance you manage to get in a game with whoever you want to play with there is a considerable chance you be dropped by the game whenever and you'll be put in a server by yourself. So unless Rockstar get of their lard asses and fix this piece of then GTA Online will die down by the end of the summer.

2015-05-29,0,0,126,False,Recommended,YES YES YES YES YES FREAKING YES! This game is a masterpiece. Now I know everyone says that but this game really is amazing. Not only is the game well designed extremely detailed and as fun as this kind of game can be it is also a perfect PC crossover. This game is amazing and should definitely be played. I am not going to give much away about the game but yes play it. The three important reasons to own this game on PC are Graphics performance and mods. The graphics aren't as big of a jump between the consoles and this version unlike the jump between the previous gen to next gen however they are still improved especially the textures which are BEAUTIFUL. Performance is obviously a lot better on this version as well I own a GTX 960 and I can have all of the settings on very high (including textures) and I can have some of the advanced settings turned on as well. This keeps the frame rate at a level I am happy with and there is no obvious pop in memory leaks frame drops or stuttering which interferes with gameplay. Mods are also even more fun and will keep you coming back to this game after you have completed it. For example the mods allow you to change into a cat spawn 50 airplanes and then blow them all up with a rocket launcher. There are also texture mods the famous carmageddon and Tsunami mods and even a zombie mod available for this game. So yes you should pay for this. If the story doesn't interest you give it a try anyway you might be surprised. But even if you don't like the story mode you still have tons of mods and a beautiful detailed world to explore which is not locked off in any way at all unlike the previous games. If you are put off by the fact that GTA IV was not that great don't worry this one is much better. Hell I am someone who didn't enjoy any in the series all that much until this one not even San Andreas. If you are put off by the fact that this may be a crappy port like GTA IV was don't. This is actually an example of how PC games should be made. Unless for any reason you cannot run this game on your computer (which may be a few people) BUY THIS GAME!,Grand Theft Auto V

I'll simply uninstall and leave the game to rot in my library as I'll have no reason to keep playing and I'm sure others will follow.

2017-06-15,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,RIP OpenIV and GTA modding in general. Take Two Rockstar's publisher has sent a cease and desist order to the OpenIV crew in order to shut them down. Why? To funnel more people into the microtransaction hell that is the multiplayer. It's about time we did something. Do not buy anything from Rockstar. Do not buy anything published by Take Two. It's time we showed them what's up. And if you've already bought this and you're just reading the reviews post one yourself to let people know. Negative press will show them. Let's see them launch their next installment of GTA with all this hell and negative precedent.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Interactive. Rockstar made a great singleplayer game with cancerous multiplayer put in place by Take Two. They focused entirely on multiplayer not releasing a single thing for singleplayer to the point where to get the new vehicles in singleplayer you had to mod them in. This is ridiculous. They tried to push us towards the micro transaction laden hellhole they call GTA Online. But it is a mess and it's not enjoyable. Singleplayer however has mods. Mods which have exponentially increases the enojomyent of myself and many others. Now however Take Two has decided to target one of thecore tools for GTA modding OpenIV. This is clearly attempting to shut down singleplayer modding and continiue to push the terrible Online. This is not even mentioning them strong arming a couple of alternative multiplayer developers into stopping. Take Two is a vile company that I will never support.You can see that I have played GTA V a significant amount.

2017-06-16,0,0,57,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game solely for the modding and now that OpenIV was given a cease and desist letter this seems to be the next step (and boldest so far) in anti modding. I am outraged by this and urge anyone reading this to take a stand against this now before companies think they can get away with more of this. Companies should encourage modding as it keeps the games alive played and enjoyed far beyond the amount of time that they would be vanilla. Take a look at skyrim and minecraft just to use two examples. Anybody that has put as much time as I have into those games can vouch that they would have gotten bored with them FAR before had they not supported modding. The only reasons I can possibly think of to be against modding is in competitive games where exploits could give one player a massive advantage over others or in a system that relies heavily upon microtransactions. This one fits in the latter category and if anyone tells you otherwise they are a fool. In a game that most people play for singleplayer getting rid of mods is a terrible idea that can only possibly be justified with the shallow excuse that you then won't make as much money off of the microtransactions. Say what you will but I say that in a full price game microtransactions that affect anything other than cosmetics do nothing but negatively impact the community. Microtransactions belong in free to play games or for purely cosmetic changes. They do not belong in full price games and they CERTAINLY do not belong in games that need to sacrifice their long history of supporting great mods and enjoyable experiences just to make the company even more money. Making money should be a goal for a game company but they should not have to sacrifice morals gameplay or fun to do so. This all being said I strongly urge you to not purchase this game. If you are looking for an open world sandbox game you can have extensive fun with I cannot recommend this game without mods. If you need an alternate game I would recommend saints row 3 as the developers aren't trying to get rid of the vast majority of their fanbase.,Grand Theft Auto V

You WILL lose your whether it's hundreds of thousands of dollars mysteriously being eaten by the void or your precious business shipments lost due to crashes. When that happens you have to fight for days to get the support team to even read your messages instead of sending you an automated reply and the chances of them refunding your property EVEN WITH A VIDEO are extremely slim.The following is one of many examples from personal experience.You spend an hour retrieving four top range cars for your vehicle export business. That'll net you about $500 000 enough to buy that armored car you've been eyeing up! You get a group of four players to export them all at once and you pay up the $80 000 to fully upgrade the cars to maximise your profits. You start the sale but wait! GTA has decided that you don't get to sell your cars today. Your screen goes dark then it comes back and the map disappears. You float in blue hell for a while. Oh you think. The game crashed! But this is GTA Online the most unpredictable AAA title you've ever played and to your relief the game recovers a few seconds later. It seems your hundreds of thousands of dollars are saved you and your friends have loaded in outside your garage ready to export the vehicles. Except you can't move. Your friends can't move. Everything looks normal other players drive past you but you can't move. You can't drive or get out of the car or answer your phone or interact with the world in any way. You spend a few minutes struggling with the game trying to get the cars to move with no success but you're a smart guy. You had Shadowplay enabled so you record the bug in its entirety and then you close the game. Confident that this AAA title has competent support you send the recording to Rockstar politely requesting that your cars be returned so that you can retry the sale (hopefully without the game having another meltdown).""We are unable to verify your claim.""""What?

I ve recieved over twenty emails that say I got banned for some reason and then they list 10 reasons and one of them might be the reason I got banned. I never owned GTA V before on pc and my laptop is brand new. I tried opening two support tickets but they got automatically responded within one second with the same text as I recieved in my emails. I also tried to send one mail but again I got the same mail back. That s why I do not recommend this game._ ABOUT THE GAME _Great game good graphics one of the best game engines I ve seen. Lots of fun with friends before I got banned Still not good enough to make up with the customer support sadly._EDIT_ yea back at it again. Graphics inpromved as my beastly pornproducing machine is also improving. Love the graphics and LOVE the multiplayer community. ing with people lower level than and going passive mode when I get attacked by a higher level than me. Multiplayer is exactly what it should be. Bunkers meth labs watching my mexicans producing coke as I lean over the railing of my cokelab. I finally find it worth it to edit my comment. Still not satisfied about the rockstar support.

This is appropriately a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled y'know despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfully chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it "" (PC GAMER)",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,0,0,323,False,Recommended,GTA V is probably one of the best games I've ever played. I have hundreds of hours in GTA online and think it's pretty well put together. However there are cracks in this game's foundations. The way servers are handled online mean you will be spending a lot of time in loading screens which can be very infuriating if you're trying to quickly join a friend. Update The online is completely broken because of Rockstar's insistence on forcing their own official servers on everyone preventing modders from using their own servers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-21,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Overall it's a great game.. But it's not without it's issues. Firstly the Banning issues.. Sure I am to blame for this but whatever I used FOV online and that's that. But the online issues are more than just bans.. For some people (myself included) You join empty lobbies.. You D'C from every game.. etc etc.. some other online issues are insane amounts of error messages with no clear fix.. even when contacting rockstar they can't help. That with the size of the game can be very very annoying.. as several errors when accessing online are only fixable by re installing the WHOLE game.. I've made backups now &amp I'd suggest you do too. But overall it's a good game.. a very good game actually. I mainly play it for the single player now with mods as that's stupidly fun! But online is a hell of a game too.. when it actually works that is. If you're on the fence about buying this I'd 100% suggest you do. It's worth it for the single player alone and that doesn't have any errors getting into that.. at least from what I've seen.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have been a huge fan of Rockstar and GTA but sadly it ends here. Why support a company/game that doesn't give a about their customers.

I used to absolutely adore it.But with all the changes in Rockstar's team even a hostile takeover and the disturbingly greedy ways that Rockstar and Take Two are changing this game rapidly is honestly disgusting and makes me sick to my stomach.DLC is getting more and more expensive where you'll need to buy about 50+ dollars of cash cards just to be able to ACCESS the new vehicles with EACH DLC coming around. ""Oh you'll need a CEO building! Oh now its a motorclub headquarters! Oh wait we can add bunkers too that then need dumb trucks!"" and price it all at millions.They already tore the newer DLC vehicles from singleplayer making it so you can only play them online where you have to buy them. But then to actively ATTACK the Mod Community to cease and desist such an integral part of the modding community one that doesn't even have anything to do with multiplayer hacking?They have basically ended the modding community.

With many awsome heist missions it tells us another badass communist story You have to work but your job is robbery. You and your friends will enjoy this job and become millionaires together ! But later SharkCards came out they pull players back to real world a little bit This is a video game and R* need your money in real life.As ""Shark"" grows bigger thing goes worse . R* stop produce PVE heists because they let players get money fast and stable so they push players to play PVP harder then ever In 2016 CEO DLC and MotoClub DLC came out Want to be a millionaire ? Kill other players in open session ! It sounds like a Nazi story but it is not the worst .Now in 2017 Inflation DLC came out ! Each new stuff cost more than 1 million now ! You have to became a billionair to buy them all. And there are only 3 ways to do so 1.Work hard in reall life and buy a lot of sharkcards.2.Play hard in game like a worker because rob bank in game is more like collecting a penny from candy store now. 3.Become a hacker and R* hard.R* don't like the 3rd way so they ban the OpenIV. I hate hacker and don't care about Mod so I don't protest.But if we hold back and review the whole story the ""dream"" is still dead.

2016-01-10,0,0,21,False,Recommended,Game Of The Decade?Put simply I'm loving this game. The graphics are excellent as is the sound. Much work has gone into creating a convincing environment and there are times when it's hard to think you're not driving/walking around Southern California.That setting has then been used to craft a superb story and some excellent player characters. At first I was sceptical about changing around between the three different protagonists but it actually works very well. In Trevor Phillips R have created one of the best ever entertainment anti heroes ever seen.Gameplay has been streamlined. The classic R* curved ball missions which offer a sudden big challenge or time limit are still there but if you repeatedly fail players are now offered the opportunity to skip forward to the next checkpoint or end of mission and thus don't miss out on the game. Some elements of the character building from GTA SA have returned such as driving and flying skill development or maxing out physique. There's also a simulation within the simulation as players can enjoy a tennis match or play a round of golf. You can jump on a moving freight train and take a tour of the area or even board the Metrolink tram for a tour of Los Santos itself. (Shame the trains/trams can't be driven without a mod).Any downers? Just a couple. As noted install off 7 x DVD's takes around three hours plus patching time but honestly it's worth it. Just do something else in between changing the discs. Fans of Liberty City Stories might be shocked by a plot event when you first encounter Trevor but I won't say more than that. You need good hardware for this to run well. I have a 1Gb GTX650 graphics card and have nudged my settings up beyond the recommended most of the time okay but the odd bit of lag. Finally this is very much a male orientated game. Some of the criticism aimed at R* for how they portray women is not quite justified but in a game where it is easy to pick up a hooker or have a topless lap dance at a strip club you're not going to find many ladies playing this.Nevertheless as a piece of entertainment it's stunning better than many movies IMHO.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-10,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,First day playing online. About one third of the lobbies were ruined by hackers I CTD for no reason once and CoD kiddies can beat me with weapons I can't even get yet because I have to grind to unlock them. Single player no question is a masterpiece but the online continues to be lackluster. Not only that but the amount of hubris it takes to add cash transactions to a full price one billion dollar game is absolutely mind boggling. The greed and cynicism involved in turning the online into a pay to win type of deal simply to make MORE money is just... ugh. Rockstar has become the worst example now with GTA V of a company not giving a about its fans. Worse than EA even. The developers the long time employees I'm sure are not at fault. It's the suits who are not caring who refuse to place any additional resources into fixing the glaring issues because why would they need to when poor unsuspecting souls continue to purchase cash transactions only to then discover the Online wasn't worth the money OR time investment. The passionate skilled worker bees that made GTA V possible can do or say nothing because to even make an attempt would probably see them working at a Wendys within a few days.The horrors of Hollywood have started to seep into the video game industry and this is the first big example we must all pay attention to. Head honchos will do whatever they want and nobody under them can affect that. Especially not us unless we all decide to not allow this by not playing the game or at the very least not giving them MORE money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Only three complaints here. First the free aim mode is atrocious you're basically force to use auto target mode to feel like you are in control. Driving with a steering wheel or joystick very responsive and satisfying. Driving with WASD wtf? The car just jerks back and forth the entire time.

2016-07-22,0,0,234,False,Recommended,Good single player I like the 3 character system it's especially fun in missions that use two or three characters at once. Not much to say there it's just good. Fun driving fun gunfights fun flying. Lots of little activities too if you're in the mood for them.The online on the other hand is the most convoluted thing and unless you have three friends who are always free to play it's really hart to enjoy online some times. People use freemode as an open world deathmatch which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for some of the other issues in the game.It's surprisingly hard to start heists and missions with public players because multiple things happen. 1. You buy a heist nobody joins/everybody leaves as soon as they join.2. You join a heist but not enough people join.3. You finally start a heist or mission but a player leaves as soon as it starts causing all the other players to automatically fail the heist or mission which often forces you to load freemode (and most likely get killed once you finally load in which is .)Another problem is if you get killed while in the pause menu it closes the pause menu so if people kill you fast enough you won't even be able to exit the game. This is luckily rare. I don't hate Online but it definitly has LOTS of design flaws. Another issue that for more information you should probably look at GTA V forums is the fact that Rockstar doesn't deal with cheaters well and hands out bans to a lot of people who don't actually cheat buy sharkcards or are forced to take money from cheaters but I personally have been able to avoid that. To sum up great story mode. Very grindy convoluted online that can only be great with friends and has a sometimes less than fun playerbase.,Grand Theft Auto V

Unless of course you just do not like the genre and if that is the case why would they be here buying and reviewing in the first place? The fact that there is no paid expansions and all new DLC is FREE is amazing. Compare that to the business model of Ubisoft EA Sony or Blizzard.

The microtransaction deal was already a turn off from the multiplayer but now they kill off modding? The showcase of either utter ignorance or (most likely) absolute greed that this whole OpenIV business has shown puts Take Two (and Rockstar too honestly) in the ever growing pile of worthless developers and publishers that have helped to further drag the games industry into the rotten hell of greed created by the likes EA that's ruining videogames.""It's a one off happening"" you can say ""At least they are not doing mention here heartless greed driven action taken by EA Bethesda Ubisoft or any publisher or developer that calls their games 'product' and has not even a semblance of interest in their creations "".

I had some graphics mods installed (fov mod for that low fov default) and now I cannot use them because I'll get banned. Even on single player. Rockstar for what they've done. Great game overall. However the real and main reason for getting this game on PC was for modding and now we cannot. I'm willing to bet you'll be able to mod the game again once VALVE comes back with paid mods. I want to give thanks to the console peasants who alpha tested the game on the PS3 and 360 as well as the rest of the peasants who beta tested the game on the PS4 and XBONE. Seriously thanks to your long testing we on the PC were able to get the best version of the game. Thanks D,Grand Theft Auto V

For me you should buy the game for the story mode. It's the best story mode i've seen in a game ever. You can choose when to do missions you can free roam all you want and you can approach a lot of the missions the way you want to approach them. The graphics are amazing and it runs quite well even on some older PCs (Very High settings on a 750ti smooth 50 60 fps) The online is fun but can get quite repetitive and a bit boring after a while but that really depends on how you play the game. It's not that hard to earn money in GTA online and purchasing Shark Cards isn't really needed if you have enough time on your hands to play and earn the money that way. Modding is also a big thing in this game and since openIV is back I don't find the need to give this a negative review. TLDR It's an amazing game great story mode fun online mode.

2015-10-01,0,0,1859,False,Recommended,"GTA 5 review Optimization This game has great optimization and runs great on mid to high end PC. I have even seen some people claim they run it ok on a low end PC. All in all they did an amazing job with optimization.Story I myself loved the story of GTA 5 and it is very interesting. Sometimes it gets very funny but other times it can quickly get very brutal as well. I just love the connection between the main protagonists and at times there is a proper drama going on because of the tension between such a different people that are brought together by mere coincidence.Gameplay Gameplay is absolutely fantastic I love it. It has some cons but I will mention these later. The cars drive great and the shooting and cover mechanics are amazing so its a lot of fun.Sounds Music and audio in this game are great. Rockstar always suprises with how much music is there in the game.Cons These are things I personally have a problem with but this doesn't mean someone doesn't like these the way they are. You can flip a car around if you are on the roof. I loved it how in GTA 4 you could make a tiny mistake and get your car on the roof and you knew you were in trouble when you had to crawl out of it and find a solution on foot. In GTA 5 that problem doesn't exist you can just flip it and I find it so boring and arcady. It feels like the game is holding my hand and fixing everything I do wrong while driving and I hate that. I as a player should pay for the mistakes I make. You can turn the car while in the air. When you jump with a car in the air you will land on the same spot where the gravity will take you but you can adjust the car rotation while in the air so that you always land on the wheels.. I dislike this as well. It is not realistic and what happens in the end is you just don't give a damn about jumps and take any jump at any time because you can always get away with it. You can fail and land on the roof which will blow you up if the jump was high enough but once you get the hang of it you will land 99.9% of the jumps so when you drive at full speed towards a cliff you can see it as an easy shortcut down and I don't like that at all. I would prefer if players would have to either take the huge risk of jumping to get away from the police or find another way.. There just isn't much risk vs. reward in GTA 5 when driving a car. Kuruma (Armored vehicle). Kuruma is a vehicle that you can buy in GTA 5 Online that is basically the easy mode or god mode. I have played GTA 5 Online for quite a while and no vehicle is as good as the Kuruma because it is incredibly hard to get killed in a Kuruma and at the same time the vehicle is very fast. I did a test once and I tried fighting the police in a tank and then after that in a Kuruma. Let me tell you this the tank lasted less than 10 minutes and in a Kuruma I lasted much longer than half an hour and I just gave up after that because I proved my point and it was just boring. I think Kuruma was one of the worst ideas and hurted GTA 5 Online quite a lot. You only need 1 person in a kuruma to win any mission without any problem. It just sucks the fun out of the game when there is 1 played with a Kuruma which happens often. GTA 5 Online missions are too easy. It barely ever happens that a group of players lose a non heist mission on Hard even without the Kuruma or any helicopters or jets. They need to make challenging missions when the win to lose ratio would be 40% 60% or 50% 50% because most missions are 95% win 5% lose. And the lose part is mostly because people blow up the mission objective and not because of all the players dying. Mentioning this I remember a great mission from GTA 4 called Hangman's Noose and it was much harder than any mission in GTA 5 and most missions should be at least as hard as that to make it at least challenging and because of that quite fun and exciting. The police should be used a lot more (5 stars) to make the missions harder. Money spending. Gta 5 Online has cars weapons and vehicles to spend money on and while that is fun I have a feeling it needs something more. I myself strived for the best appartment and best vehicle and it didn't take me long to have both because I didnt need to use any other vehicle then the one I had at beginning. Don't get me wrong this is a new thing in GTA the way it is done now and it is brilliant but because it is something people will be playing for houndreds of hours for many years it needs something more to keep the players in the game. Because of this it is a minor or a petty thing to mention. GTA heists GTA Heists are great but I have a feeling it creates some tention and bad mood sometimes because you get to play with 1 individual out of 4 that has problems staying alive and he feels bad himself while also others get annoyed with him. It can become annoying instead of fun pretty quickly so right here is one instance where R* could make a new game mechanic to still keep it hard but not as annoying. For example it would be great if the player shot wouldn't die but be unconcious and you would have to get him out of the combat zone (drag or put his body in a car and get him out of it when safe) and a lenghty revive would take place or some other procedure to not punish the whole team so quickly for the mistakes of 1 individual and create some bad mood just because of that. Games are meant to be fun. GTA 5 Online needs a few new modes or mission ideas. Preferably missions like Hangman's noose from GTA 4 with heavy police response I loved that mission. Hackers. A lot of people seem to have problems with hackers but I myself had a problem here and there but nothing a quick change session couldn't fix. Rockstar needs a better protection against hackers because at the time it feels like protecting this game from hackers is the community's job. I have reported a hacker and it didn't take me long to get him banned. With a system like this every player that sees a hacker should report them and we would have a much cleaner game. Of course Rockstar needs to step up and find a system like ""PunkBuster"" to make it much harder to hack.This game didn't have a perfect launch so I believe that the number of positive reviews would be at about or over 90% if the launch would be better.",Grand Theft Auto V

Sure the story is unaffected but without mods you're playing a bland cover shooter and a sub par driving game with a decent story. In my eyes mods were GTA V's only saving grace and they've thrown it away. I whole heartedly do not recommend this game until they decide to reverse the modding decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

Stay far FAR away.If you in any way enjoy using mods enjoy watching modded content view lets plays with modded content or prefer single player to multiplayer do not buy this game.GTA V is an excellent game that is very well built created by innovative brilliant developers who geniunely love what they do. You can see it in their work. Last week the publisher of GTA V Take Two Interactive sent a cease and desist order to the developer of the most commonly used mods in the game. A mod which thousands of other mods and hundreds of thosands of work hours depend upon. A mod which has existed for ten years and has only now become the focus of legal action due to Take Two's efforts to increase monetization. This move came on the 5th of June in what appears to be an attempt to hide this action from public attention as the gaming community is occupied with the E3 conference. This game has recieved a continued level of attention and constant exposure to new audiences through the way in which modders have continued to create new and interesting content that is related to this game. Despite this being of net benefit to their sales Take Two is now betting that they will be able to make more money by cracking down on mod development in order to further monetize the existing player base. In short they are actively destroying collaborative works and content they have previously allowed making the singleplayer experience of their game LESS enjoyable in an effort to wring more money out of players. Considering that a significant percentage of their sales from the PC release of this game (i.e. this version) has come due to interest in using and developing mods this move is unconscionable. Take Two's recent actions represent the very definition of corporate hackery. They are choosing profits over people. There are plenty of other game developers and publishers that do not do this. Go spend your money on their games instead. This decision has utterly ruined the game in my view.,Grand Theft Auto V

I hope a new game comes out soon or Rocstar realizes that players love new content and wouldn't mind paying more for some DLC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,EDIT 17 June 2017 Changing my review to negative sure the singleplayer is great only Rockstar are arses. Firstly as they make us PC users wait 2 years to actually play this game. then they ruin the modding community.I was so excited for this game that the day before I was released I lost sleep.. it was worth it.After the massive faulure of the GTA IV PC Port which my GTX 970 struggles to run GTA V runs the game almost perfectly. The first cutscene I ddn't realise that they were the actual games graphics and was blown away by them.The gameplay itself is perfect that includes car handling movement gunplay. My only problem is that the flying is very difficult Numpad controls On my previous laptop there were no numpad controls so I wouldn't be able to play the game from then on. I am currently 25% through the game and I'm enjoying every second of ita MUST buy14/12 JamEz,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-14,0,0,800,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE if you interested in the old update scroll below. I believe this update was long overdue as there as been several changes to the game from the last time this review went up. I'm going to make this short and sweet should you buy this game? That's up to you. Lately or for a few months now I stopped playing this game as it feels like a constant grind (I had tested this on my console) from dodging and weaving through obstacles like your bussiness get disrupted by other players who just wanna watch the world burn in almost every lobby there is a someone who wants to you kill for sport and for no reason now with the new planes and vehicles. You sometimes can find a peacefull lobby where people actually want to do car meets play together and is not a PvP enviroment. I understand it is to compete but when you'r trying to earn money when your level and people keep killing you due to low level. There is also the problem with Take2 and the microtransactions in this game (I wont go into full detail as to why because you'll see most reviews already talking about that). Overall I dont find this game fun to play anymore even when you have money it isn't fun it just gets dull and boring. NEW SCORE 6.5/10 It's the next instalment in the GTA series. What more can you want? But I know you are here to see if you want to spend your hard earned money on this game. So today I will be telling you the pros and cons of this game. Pros Graphics are amazing and very detailed A.I is good Trevor Motherf***ing a' Phillips Fist Person gameplay mechcanic (optional) Interesting and colorfull characters Single player has lots of events missions. sub goals challenges and Hiests Small addtional content for returing players from the last gen consoles Addtional content ever month or a few months Various popluar songs and cool beats to listen to No problems with fps game is smooth Multiplayer hiests are great and feel natural Great character customization (overall great customization features) You are able to meet great and frinedly people when you find them Many jobs to do in multiplayer Are able to do private sessions with friends (but saldy arnt able to do vip nor ceo missions when in a private or invite only sessions) You can run a company Cons Lots of modders cheaters and hackers but are rare to find Many high leveled ***** destroying low leveled and new players Kids using their mics but are rare to find Random people killing you for nothin (even you tho you are a high level person random people will still kill you for no reason) If and when you a nice car that you want to buy you either have to grind for money on hiests or jobs which can get repetitive and annoying or buy shark cards I had no issue with Rockstar Support but when I go on the forums I see people getting banned for no reason and still are banned without an expilnation I get what Rockstar was trying to do with the ceo missions but when some one destoryed some one's crate that they paid for around 2k to 18k and/or destory a shipment that can cost the person up to 2.2 million (yes that much money) that person will most likely get upset and wanting revenge on you. (Trust me I seen it happen and it ain't pretty). On hiests or missions like in Lamar's lowrider missions when teamwork is needed people would be afk on purpose and cause to the mission/hiest to fail Another thing remember how annoying but lovable Niko's cusion Roman was in GTA 4? In GTA 5 we have Lamar franklins best mate and he is like Roman but he dons't wanna go bowling oh no.... he want's to score some drugs and in the process gets kidnapped/ or starts being shot at. Also during the lowrider missions he can be annoying as your character is not voiced acted and he goes on ranting about something which is annoying not to hear some one tell him to shutupOverall I recommned this game for its ups ofcourse but you really need to think about buying this game before hand and decide if you want it or not I personally enjoy this game to bits and I'm sorry if there is any grammar mistakes in the review and I would also would want to thank you if you saw my review read it and made a choice about buying GTA 5 or not OLD SCORE I give this game a 9.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Only thing I'm disappointed about is no cross platform multiplayer / most of my friends play this on ps4 So I wanted to play with my friends but thats not possible / New patches keep the game fresh and fun.

The game had few issues which was resoved by contacting rockstar i lost my upgraded car and it took them around a week to return it back. other issues i had is the disconnectivity while playing online. this was major issue and very frustrating one. every time i get into online game and before starting the heist i get disconnect or someone else does. it took for ever to play a game without a problem so i have to wait until a new patch is released to fix the isse.other than that this game is must buy and for the one who played it on other consoles if you dont mind spending extra cash then you can trasnfer your character and countinue to enjoy what it means to play such game on PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-24,0,0,73,False,Recommended,I've played every single GTA game and completed the majority of them. I've unfortunately never completed any of the 2D GTA's (but I did put a hefty amount of time into them!) and I didn't complete GTA 4 for a variety of reasons but I did get close. All of that being said for a long time GTA San Andreas was my firm favorite for a very long time but GTA V has thoroughly dethroned it after many years.GTA V does so many things right and very few things wrong. The whole game feels cohesive and comes together in a great way with very few gameplay problems. Most of the issues I had with the game stemmed from the disappointing story or how some of the side missions work. The story starts off strong and has a ton of potential but quickly fizzles out and sort of forces you along rather than giving you a reason to continue. The heist missions you encounter are well designed but too few in number and most of the other missions involve driving long distances so characters can talk with each other. On the topic of side missions some side missions are triggered by just being in a random area and if you're on the way to one spot it can be a little frustrating to get somewhat forcibly side tracked to complete a quick little side mission. Most of these side missions end up just turning into collect a thing quests in the end.Playing as three characters presents some unique challenges. Each character has some kind of special skill one allows you to drive in slow motion one lets you shoot in slow motion and one makes you take less damage and deal significantly more damage. During some missions you can switch back and forth and take advantage of the unique skills of each characters and a lot of the time everyone is in a different position during the mission. It's refreshing and interesting to be able to approach a mission from two or three different angles all at once. I will say that it is very annoying to outfit three characters with powerful weapons and armor though and most things don't carry over from one to the other. Los Santos is full of detail and has multiple environments to explore and screw around in. You can play around in a dense downtown or drive out to the desert or even head to the woods. The entire area feels real and believable even though the characters in the game mention that there are apparently hours of roads between some of the locations. It is easy to get lost just driving around and checking things out and even after 70 hours I still find new things to explore. GTA V retains the right amount of grittiness from GTA IV while also sharing the somewhat whimsical gameplay tone of the first three 3D GTA games. Playing as three unique characters is a lot of fun and overall it is tough to find problems with the game. I really enjoyed my time and I can see myself replaying the game down the road.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-02,0,0,205,False,Not Recommended,GTA 5 was so strong on release. I enjoyed it played through it a few times. Played through it a few times with my gf on console too.Right now? Wouldn't recommend anyone gives Rockstar any money... The single player has been left completely in the cold while content streams into their buggy non existant multiplayer mode it's gotten to the point that they don't even bother adding the vehicles to single player in a token way.If you prefer to enjoy GTA 5 as a single player game you will only get a small fraction of the games content. If you actually enjoy multiplayer good luck finding a people to actually do anything with.It has me deeply worried about GTA 6 and any sequel to Red Dead Redemption. And what form they will take it's easy to assume at this point Rockstar will focus on money and multiplayer completely forgoing the core single player fan base that made them popular.I'm all for multiplayer if they find a way to keep the game consistent. A world where you can enguage the game and all of it's content either through single player characters (with extra abilities that don't make sense in multiplayer such as michael's bullet time). But also play online should you choose.But I can't help that feel Rockstar will simply release more and more micro transaction powered online only content.In fact at this stage i wouldn't be surprised to see GTA 6 be free to play and online only...,Grand Theft Auto V

EVERY PLAYER is an hat... and whats to spawn kill you repeatidly for absolutely no gain than to see another player struggle. how do you beat them? you do what Rockstar wants and buy money to get better gear than said hat. if you take away the microtransactions you might have a better community but that will never happen. so as far as im concerned you can downvote this game to hell where it belongs...all that being said... i will play this game with my friends anyday... i will not make microtransactions... and i will play private servers forever...,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-16,0,0,1085,False,Not Recommended,I wrote a Review a year ago highly endorsing this game. However while I still play it. I can no longer support or endorse this game. Rockstar's Parent company has earned a reputation for being legal bullies and are quick to harass anyone modding their game (Open IV as an example). Take two crossed the final line when they went after a extremely popular singleplayer modding tool with their legal thugs. Therefore I officially pull my endorsement and join the thousands who will not support this game in recruiting new people to. Nor will I support them financially through shark card purchaises. Singleplayer however still offers the legendairy storylines that rockstar has made themselves successes out of. I would recommend the game only for this. however multiplayer it is advised to be avoided just on the sole grounds of the rampant level of cheaters and I will emphasize this That the cheaters are not because of openIV. many hack makers use their own clients and injectors.Support for the game is a living joke. you make a honest request and all you get back is a lawyer approved letter giving you the politest go to hell letter I have ever seen.As it stands now until take two gets their crap togather and stops bullying its population Improves it customer service and actually does something about the rampant modders (other thain attacking honest entity's like open IV) I do not endorse this game. it would be a poor choice to buy it. OR Support it with shark card purchases.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-21,0,0,240,False,Not Recommended,"This game used to be fun and great game to play with friends but now its just a cash cow. Im so tired of how the community for this game is being treated. All that devlopers do is release a bunch of content that is lack luster most of the time and realse the content for ""free"" but in relaity it costs an insane amount of money to get the things you want this way any player that doesn't want to no life the game has buy the beloved SHARK CARDS. I really wish the community would take a stand and buy the damn SHARK CARDS. Im also tired of people getting banned because into a match and someone is dropping money and they happen to get some but once again that cuts into the SHARK CARD profits. Then they also go and screw over the single player people by getting rid of mods once again so that way the people that have been banned will go and buy the game again to play online since Single player is now completley useless. Thanks Rockstar and TakeTwo you're really an inspiration to the gaming industry**EDIT Even though Rockstar/TakeTwo have gone back on single player mods Still be cautious of this game. The multiplayer is still a grind/pay real money to get the best stuff. I will not change my review to positive because to be fair I hate how they use the online community to make a quick buck and how the community actually pays for the micro transactions.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,323,False,Recommended,OpenIV is now back and with Rockstar's blessing. This is fantastic news for the entire GTA community and for gamers as a whole. I had originally purchased this game for modding potential and had no intentions of playing the online component. It was quite frustrating when Take Two Interactive declared that OpenIV was no longer allowed as it was the main thing that keeps me playing the game. Modding in new cars and player/pedestrian skins keeps the game fresh enough to make it worthwhile long after having finished the single player campaign. I am fixing my review at this point because Rockstar openly proved they do care about the overall community and aren't just out for a cash grab by selling Shark Cards. They have earned back my faith in them by speaking to their parent company on behalf of the community and as such I will not only continue to play their titles I will definitely be picking up future titles from them without hesitation. Heck I may even finally break down and try the online component again in the future (after I've had my fill of mods for single player). Who knows I might even buy some Shark Cards when the time comes.Thanks for putting your faith back in the community Rockstar. It will be returned in kind and you proved that not all huge developers are going to just bow mindlessly to the will of their overreaching parent company. I applaud your decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,362,False,Recommended,There is no doubt that I'm in love with what Rockstar brought us throughout the years and of course the guys before them with even the very first GTA. Grand Theft Auto V is huge it's amazing it's unique. A lot a people do prefer GTAIV I can understand that but there is a lot to love with GTAV with new stuff Rockstar is trying such as having three main characters. They expended the world once more in a city we all know Los Santos (and its surroundings). We're not locked up in a city again (GTA IV!). The story is to me very solid and very enjoyable. There is so much to say about GTAV but you must play it to have a real opinion. About the PC version Rockstar did not let us down this time around (unlike with GTAIV). Yes the game is playable with very good framerate it looks good it is moddable.. It is awesome. There are some updates they are messing up a little with them time to time but it's still very very good.If love GTA you will not be disapointed. GTA Online is its own thing I won't review it here.Please buy the game (it's selling very well) support Rockstar and let's hope they will not forget us PC gamers for next Rockstar titles (A new Red Dead? etc...).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-18,0,0,523,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Don't buy this game for OnlineThe Story Mode GTA V AKA What you SHOULD buy this game for)The story mode is a quite long well written tale of three men who decide to set themselves up for life by getting into the high stakes crime game. It's better than any previous GTA game and if you enjoyed previous GTA games why haven't you bought it yet? The only complaints I have are with the way some of the cheats are implemented or missing (that were in previous GTA games) but those are all secondary issues really quite irrelevant to enjoying this game.As an extremely open world game GTA V is second to none. This is both the cause of its success and of its downfall. Because it's so open world GTA V is a technical masterpiece of engine optimization and gameplay opportunity options. However there's so many different things to do that you know you'll never actually 100% the game without resorting to mods. It may be heresy to say this but GTA V is just too big for its own good. Now if you're not a completionist (and I envy you if you're not) you'll be able to enjoy GTA V much more easily than me and I absolutely recommend that you buy it.Story Mode Worth the buyGTA Online The Cancer That Ruins Your LifeGTA Online was good enough when the game launched but it's gotten to be pretty terrible for the average unmodded player nowadays. I absolutely do not recommend Online mode anymore.The first and most visibly annoying issue in GTA Online is the amount of players (many of them with mods) who do not heistate to ruin your day killing you time and time again as you struggle to grind for a measly $10k or so. With all the DLC vehicles Online has become so unbalanced that some players just quit out of sheer inability to play the game without being repeatedly slaughtered. I almost always put myself in a solo public session by suspending GTA5.exe from Windows Resource Monitor for about 10 seconds to avoid this exact plague.Back when GTA V was new within the first year or two of its nextgen/PC release online mode was a massive community and was really quite enjoyable to play with. There was only a single incentive to get money for a high end apartment for heists. The jobs didn't pay out quite as much as the newer modes do but with only one thing to save up for that wasn't really a problem. Every other purchase just made the gameplay more fun.Since then Take Two have discovered that their Shark Cards (microtransactions for GTA Online $) are extremely profitable. With that discovery they altered the course of GTA Online to become pure painful grind. Every DLC expansion that has come since while free to download is in no way free to play. With almost no exception each GTA Online expansion has cost more in game currency than the last to buy into meaning you spend more time grinding than ever before.In the early days of GTA Online a single of the most expensive Shark Card ($100 when not on sale) would fetch you $8 000 000 in game more than enough to buy almost everything in the Online mode. Years later the Shark Card still costs the same and still gives you the same amount of in game currency but that $8m in game is worth so much less. Here's a list of some purchases you can make in GTA Online today (all USD are based on $100 USD/$8m in game). While all of them can be purchased with in game currency without spending a penny the grind to get that much money is tens or even hundreds of hours and Take Two expects you to buy Shark Cards to buy some of this stuff 1. Office A necessary purchase to enter the special cargo business vehicle import/export business or special vehicle missions. The base office cost ranges from $1m $4m ($12.50 $50 USD) with almost purely cosmetic upgrades that can total up to $2.65m ( $33 USD) on top of that.2. Bunker to get into the gunrunning business you need a bunker. Typically placed far north of Los Santos they slowly manufacture weapons cargo you can sell. The base bunker costs between $1.165m and $2.375m depending on location though the cheapest bunker is an absolutely terrible buy as the drive to/from it is almost as bad of a grind as the special cargo missions. Personalization options for bunkers can total $1.695m. Part of weapon manufacturing is buying/stealing supplies which can total $75 000 for a full bunker. If your bunker isn't upgraded (separate from the personalization purchases upgrades cost over $2.1m/ $26 USD total) the net payout from buying supplies then selling them to Los Santos (for an additional 50% payout) is exactly $0. And to add insult to injury you need to pay $4700 in fees every 40 minutes to keep the bunker running. So the only way to make the bunker profitable while paying minimum price is to do horribly painful grindy missions with excessively OP'd AI trying to kill you.3. Cars Boats and Planes In the early days of GTA Online the most expensive cars were all less than $1m. Now some individual cars cost as much as $2.7m (or $34 USD). The current most expensive plane is $5.9m ( $74 USD) and the community all agrees that it's actually complete garbage. And the Lazer fighter jet is coming on sale soon for $6m ($75 USD) and it's beaten in every way by the Hydra a plane that costs 1/2 as much. The tugboat (while not the most expensive at $1.25m ($ 16 USD) was absolutely terrible being unable to take even the slightest explosion and having a top speed of 2.4. Warehouses Cargo warehouses are necessary to do special cargo missions and can range from $250k for the cheapest small warehouse up to $3.5m ( $44 USD) for the most expensive large one. Vehicle warehouses cost $1.5m up to $2.85m ( $36 USD) with cosmetic upgrades of almost $300k additionally.5. Yachts Yes you can buy a yacht. Cost ranges from $6m to $8m ($75 $100 USD) depending on which base yacht you buy with cosmetic upgrades totaling $2m additionally ($25 USD). And these yachts are almost completely useless for gameplay. They're just there to look cool. Yes that's right you can look cool in a video game for the low low cost of up to $125 USD REAL WORLD CURRENCY.I ended up logging about 100 hours in GTA Online in the past month or two but I'm done. I'm completely done never coming back to Online and I've already uninstalled the game for this reason GTA Online has become a PC equivalent of a mobile app. You don't realize it at first but playing GTA Online is exactly like playing Candy Crush Saga (or any of King's other games that should go die in hell). You get in understand the gameplay and think things are in reach. Before long you're playing hours on end for a single achievement that actually isn't worth much at all or your're shelling out a good chunk of real world currency to get the unlocks in any sort of timely manner. And regardless of whether or not you realize it GTA Online is an addiction. It's been designed over the years to become the most effective moneymaking machine Take Two could lay claim to and engineered to ensure players keep playing even when they're not actually having fun anymore. I finally woke up to what this game has been doing to my life and now that I'm aware of it they won't keep me playing anymore.GTA Online is not fun. It's a grind that's been engineered to be addictive and strip your life and/or wallet away from you all for the sake of Take Two making more money. If you buy this game buy it for the single player only. Don't let Take Two get you with the online. You'll regret it when you wake up.,Grand Theft Auto V

Wake the up T2 I have never nor will I ever pay for your stupid microtransactions and shutting down modding doesn't do anything but make people resent you. If you wanted more money like the money hungry your company has become you would actually encourage modding because maybe then people would like your company and want to give you more money.

Something that I don't like though is the fact that there is a ton of exclusive content only for online that means that because I decided to mod the game and not go online with hacks exclusive clothing and masks are withheld from me which kind of sucks.

Played a bit of single player on my 360 and got bored a few hours in but playing online almost never gets old (especially with friends) Love That the game is constantly being updated with tons of bonuses for doing certain activities I might not normally do. Complaints Constantly getting kicked out of sessions while playing with friends is super annoying. We're at the point where we only go to public sessions when we have to sell cars or coke (while constantly being terrified that all our hard work could be destroyed by someone getting kicked from the session).I have seen many complaints about being banned and hackers. Personally I have never been banned and luckily I rarely come across hackers but they obviously they still need to do some more work on their end. I would still recommend this game but be aware that it is far from perfect.,Grand Theft Auto V

They will destroy your and troll you making you go to said empty servers to do it there.Such online gameplay.If you have enough friends the heists are okay. A few times.

I personally love this game and feel they did a great job improving on everything that made GTA4 not so great.So i started with the PS3 version sence release and going from that to this is breathtaking unbelevable and just plain awsome! so the possitive +way better graphics compared to this first counsole ports like the PS3 (unsure how it looks on PS4/XB1 but im sure those arr not on ""high"" settings ether)+First person mode! +your own personal custom radio station (nothing like blasting metal killing gang bangers!)+far better framerate than counsoles (my ps3 looked capped at 30fps?)+keeping your GTA online progress and getting that preorder money added to that account!Negative (VERY hard to find much) Driving in 1st person is a little crazy maybe if they add oculus rift support this will be a possitive ) obveous few glictches and bugs but its all minor stuff that will probably get fixed asapSO as you can tell there is basiclly nothing negative over this massive overhaul of the game.

Smooth Fast Fun. Graphic Options and settings in general are VERY well done. GTA Online is smooth as hell. Fun.

2015-04-26,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,Pretty good game. Huge campaign with three different protagonists plus a massive amount of side content and things to do like golfing and skydiving and riding bikes. Some things specifically aircraft and the submarine and bicycles have terrible mouse and keyboard controls so keep a controller plugged in and switch to that when you get in those vehicles (or any vehicle really). Story it's pretty generic and average. The dialogue and performances are all pretty spectacular though. Additionally the character Trevor is probably the most try hard edgy t character that I have ever seen in a video game and I can't see why people like him. As a supporting role he's great but as a main playable character Rockstar ed up. Michael's pretty whiny too. Franklin seems like they actually put effort into him so no complaints there. The endings are all terrible too.It also has a multiplayer mode and it's certainly great if you enjoy games with terrible character creators bad communities annoying messages and pop ups and a ton of grinding. Despite the flaws in the writing and the mistake of a multiplayer it's still a solid game and I don't really regret my pre order. It's undoubtedly worth the money spent. It also runs great and looks great and has content that other versions of the game do not (such as The Lab FM). Pick it up when you get the chance especially if you're a fan of the franchise.EDIT I should note there is always online DRM for singleplayer and multiplayer. And the unskippable startup video is ridiculously long.EDIT 2 After the fiasco involving OpenIV I've returned my review to normal. However I can no longer recommend the game after seeing the state it's in. Online is terrible and mismanaged singleplayer is totally forgotten so the developers and publisher can cash in on the terrible practices exercised in the multiplayer and the modding community is still crippled.

2015-09-23,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,EDIT With what's happened recently I no longer support ANYTHING Rockstar does. Don't buy anythign from them.This game is both great and terrible. That is the quickest way to summarize. Do not buy it at $60. It's not worth it. The graphics are really nice and there's some good characters but te way the game forces you to switch between three different protagonists means you spend the game not really giving a about anyone in particular. This is not the Los Santos of CJ in GTA SA. I don't know how that smaller and less detailed game managed it but it seemed to have more interesting environments and story. GTA should go back to single character stories and save the extra characters as more fleshed out DLC later. The game was surprisingly short for having three characters.I give it a recommendation but only because it was fun to play. It is NOT worth the full price. Online play was just pretty terrible. There's no reason they couldn't have done a co op mode like Saints Row 2/3/4. This game would have been amazing with drop in/out co op. The online play though feels stale and meaningless. A big world to roam around in that ultimately doesn't mean anything. It's all just a massive lobby.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-20,0,0,1264,False,Recommended,Best game so far.I like how rockstar handle their games.The most importand thing that keeps the game apart is its brilliant AI and the events we come across during the gameplay.Like roberry people being kidnapped etc and all these makes the game's open world the most lively gaming world that has ever been created. I think most of the other games failed to achieve this . we will not be feeling that we are play a game that is what all other games are missing.When we play the game we can see how much time and effort the developers have put into it.One of the things that make us want to play GTA is its crazy explosions and ragdoll physics which they have done very well in this game.Also it would not be right if we do not mention about the sound effects which give life to the visuals. The story line in the game is moving like a mixture of fun.The drama between the three main charecters of the game is actually kind of fun. the Drawbacks that GTA IV has had was its story line it had which was not suitable for a game . But when we play GTA V we are like having a tour in a very pleasant and positive environment.Which is the kind of thing a game should have. GTA ONLINEThe main thing that makes people buy GTA V and not to go after cracked versions is its remarkable online experience . Rockstar has been releasing and planning to release more updates for the online.Heists were one of the updates for GTA ONLINE.And I think it was the best idea that Rockstar ever had .Overall i really enjoyed the game and its worth buying .,Grand Theft Auto V

Maybe if the developers cared enough to change their greedy ways and fix their servers the game would be deserving of a positive review once again.,Grand Theft Auto V

I dont know if the game just has an issue running on Windows 7(what my old laptop runs) or whatnot but Its the same game ive enjoyed for so long on console. Now i need to get my profile caught up...PAST REVIEW SO... I currently own three copies of this game on three different systems PS3 XBOX ONE and PC via STEAM.I have never had any real issues with my other two systems when i comes to playing or starting this game. I've probably logged a few thousand hours playing the game in Story mode and Online mode on the other two systems. However i am stuck at a place where the game is unplayable for me.I've spent at least 40 hours between installling checking to make sure all files are installed troubleshooting with Rockstar Support(for some reason STEAM wont offer support for the game) and reinstalling the game in an attempt to get the game running. I am continually stuck in the ""OFFLINE MODE UNAVAILABLE"" screen at startup. I have also been unable to sign in to my Social Club account. I have asked for refunds thru STEAM multiple times but they cite thier ""2 hour rule"" as a reason for not refunding me my money spent on a game they are not willing to give customer support for. I am also curious as to why i am unable to link my Social Club account with my STEAM account? This is done thru PS XBOX Microsoft LIVE and other services. But not STEAM? I wish i could give it a good STEAM review but im too busy playing the game on XBOX ONE to care about that.",Grand Theft Auto V

Yes it is!GTA 5 runs very smoothly at around 60 frames per second the world looks a lot beautiful and the textures don't look that muddy compared to console versions. Rockstar definitely put a lot of time and effort into optimizing this game for PC despite preloading and unpacking the game on day 1 of release. I'd say this was the right decision to delay the game and further again.However the game still uses the Rockstar Social Club DRM which is still frustrating to sign in(since I forgot the password for the service) but at least it's way better than the abhorred Games for Windows Live (which was used in GTA IV) right?Overall this game is definitely worth checking out in a new perspective. Also having played GTA Online before on consoles ALL the DLC (so far) is FREE! So how can you hate on that?,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,1950,False,Recommended,Well I think most people interested in this game will probably have played the previous GTA titles including Vice City San Andreas and IV and already know if they want to buy the game or not. However there may be those who are unfamiliar with the game so I'm going to split the review in 2 for those who are accustomed to the GTA world and those who are new to the franchise I'll try to keep both as brief as possible ) Just one word before that this is large game both in terms of size and also computation/graphics power required so make sure you have enough storage space and a good CPU and GPU setup before trying to play this game. Players unfamiliar with previous GTA titles This is an open world game meaning you play a character (or 3 in single player) and you may roam around freely among shops drive to the desert sky dive onto a boat walk up a mountain etc...it's quite a large space to explore both above and under ground so you'll pretty much always find something new to explore.Of course the game isn't merely about exploring the world...it's about making as much money from criminal activity as possible. In single player mode there's a focus on heist planning and actual heist missions with side missions such as stock market manipulation that you can turn to your advantage. The multiplayer mode GTA Online could be considered as an entirely separate game since there's so much more things to do more races challenges missions and content such as vehicles and customisation options such as clothing hair cuts tattoos etc. So keep that in mind if you think the price is a bit steep ) It's also a nice place to meet new people and have fun with them. See more comments about GTA Online in my second review hereunder. Players familiar with previous GTA titles Make no mistake this is a good game. It has some elements from IV a game which I didn't like IV very much to be honest (although I do know there were quite a few people who did actually like it) which could have potentially made V disappointing for me. It's sufficiently different that it is not disappointing on the contrary it's quite fun and refreshing. Of course a big change is the use of 3 main characters instead of one which enables more variation in missions encountered. The graphics are breathtaking and the game keeps you motivated since there's always something to do especially if you like unlocking achievements. I will say that there is limited car garage space and that the physics of some vehicles is a let down (e.g. unrealistic crash deformation and suspension characteristics) but overall I'm nit picking. One thing I would like to point out is GTA Online. It is an entirely different game in its own right...so if the price seems steep for you consider that you're getting 2 games here. There's even more stuff to do Online and R* are still adding new content regularly. It's also a nice place to meet people and have some fun with them although in almost every online game you will find 'trolls'. I will also say that Shark Cards are not necessary sure it'll be tough at first but you'll be able to get along soon enough (try to rank up as fast as you can otherwise more experienced players will discard you)...if you put in a few hours a day and don't spend every penny you earn you'll soon start having a few millions in your virtual bank account. It's also not a perfect system sometimes players randomly exit from a game (either intentional or due to connection/R* server errors) and there have been a few complaints about players being banned for no reason. To be honest I have never been banned (so far) so I can't really comment on that but I have no complaints in general about Online gameplay. Conclusion A must have for GTA aficionados and a game that you should seriously consider buying if you've never played GTA games but you're intrigued at what you're reading and seeing. Not without its faults...but what human made object *is* perfect? ),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,I was really hyped up for this game back in 2015. Spent $60 on pre ordering this. Now after clocking in 400+ hours this game grew very stale despite the updates that happen every month or so.Also what the hell was Take Two thinking when they issued a cease and desist notice to the OpenIV team? Don't they realize modding is the main attraction for PC centric fans? Granted you can't play multiplayer with mods since you end up with a big ban but mods are for the singleplayer portion of GTA V. And Take Two's C&amp D is gonna kill a lot of sales.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now if you don't have money all you can do is do a lot of missions because in my opinion nobody plays heists anymore or buy shark cards. Every time is a new DLC update EVERYTHING IS ING EXPENSIVE AS . Conclusion Rockstar and Take Two dosen't care about their players. All they want is our money and time.

These features being character movements and animations making the controls feel lacking in areas where players could once navigate. Other features lacking are the overall AI from the police and peds acting unnatural in certain instances and vehicle damage being almost non existent compared to GTA IV. The game looks great and has tons of customization options but because the game was ported from console to pc and not the other way around I feel the game suffers to some degree due to the limitations of certain platforms.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,I will definitely still play GTA V as I've invested a lot of time into building up my character. I jumped in on 360 right after Online launched. However the continued monotization of the game by Take Two has been incredibly frustrating as a Rockstar fan. I sincerely hope that they heed the calls of the community for less money grabbing more community engagement (just for the love of all that is holy and destructable give us the single player content you've teased for literally years) and provide us the tools to mod the Single Player experience without interfereing with Online. Both aspects of the game are amazing sandboxes because they allow us to live out our own criminal fantasies better than any other game out there but it is only going to turn more people away the longer the community is ignored. Rockstar should look to how Bethesda handles the modding community for guidance. Embrace us and we will keep your game alive for years to come. Until this happens I cannot recommend the game to new players. I sincerely hope I will be able to write a new review in the coming weeks talking about how Rockstar listened to us and engaged and didn't just give the shareholders everything. We are your business. Please listen. Rant end. Review negative overall.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,1675,False,Not Recommended,The online is a grindfest where every new thing over the years gets more and more expensive while the missions pay the same or less than they used to. Obviously this is done intentionally so that people would buy shark cards which is absurd for a game that is Pay to Play in the first place but beyond that the shark cards give ridicolous value. Add to this Rockstar's complete disregard for cheaters and hackers and modders running rampant on their client based multiplayer and the unkept promises for the story mode and GTA V as a whole is simply a great game managed in the worst possible way. It would take so little to make the multiplayer a fun and enjoying experience just take away the greed. Considering how much money R* made off of it already it's about time they readjust the prices and the mission payouts so that the game is no longer a painful grindfest. And then there's the whole issue with the lack of dedicated servers but I guess it's just too late to even bother now.Update two years of DLCs later and the cost of properties and vehicles skyrocketed so high that it would take 60 to 100 hours to grind enough dollars for one vehicle or 75$ of shark card. Microtransactions and pay to win done wrong best example right here. Love the game hate the grind and the shark cards based economy Tood bad.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-29,0,0,2917,False,Recommended,The singleplayer campaign is good enough for one playthrough with the true draw of the game being online multiplayer however the content can run dry after a few hundred hours. Easily the largest downside of online has been the insane pricing of new content but other than that it is really fun with a couple of friends to run through heists or even just in freeroam.TL DR If you haven t played this game before it is absolutely worth it. But if you ve played it on a console not much has changed beyond a few new events and mildly faster vehicles I d have to say it s not worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-02-16,0,0,1431,False,Recommended,This game is amazing... if you have money. The bare minimum is having a friend with money to help you get it but this game is still amazing none the less. As every other living soul on this chat mentions i've clocked in near 1k hours (specifically 934) and ive loved every minute. I HAVE ONLY DONE THE MANDATORY MISSIONS ALMOST ALL MY HOURS ARE SPENT IN ONLINE THEREFOR THIS IS AN ONLINE ONLY REVIEWPros Driving physics are the best out of any arcade like game EVER. Third person is perfect First person (although not as good) is there and functions as it should The amount of stuff to do is beyond my knowledge Looks better than games coming out in 2017 despite its 2013 release dateCons No money means no fun The more money you have the more money you make... the less you have... you get the point This game is its most fun with friends without them its not as good Takes a pretty good computer to run LONG LOADING TIMES The community can only be described as cancer... unless you like to troll in which case buy this game NOW no map expansion yet Conclusion without money friends or time invested this game is just a pretty looking game that is really tedious. But investing a couple hundred hours and with friends as well as heists in mind this game will keep you occupied until gta 6 or star citizen comes out.11/10 good meme,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-04,0,0,509,False,Not Recommended,"I've been playing this game for a while now. Whereas within the past several months (i.e. 10+ months) now the game has become such a crappy experience for online players due to (1) Excessive number of modders online ruining your gameplay experience or heights with other players (2) Excessive disconnects via online gameplay with every player leaving/disconnecting during your gameplay or during a massive heists via Hard Mode and (3) Being told jack squat from Rockstar Support about issue number (2) after other players have submitted numerous tickets created various forums of troubleshooting measures and provided transparent videos on YouTube my honest advice for everyone is to not purchase the game but instead Torrent the game. Mind you I do not have problems disconnecting or connecting in any other games except GTA V Online. With that being said my advice is to go back to playing Halo or some other open world FPS as you're not going to get your return or ""fun time"" if you spend money on GTA V. Because apparently this is a very common issue and there's nothing that can be done about it on the player's end. In other words it's not you but a problem with Rockstars Servers (that will more than likely never be fixed). So I hope this helps everyone.",Grand Theft Auto V

If you dont buy shark cards then you cant afford half the crap Rock* put in the game. Modders on the the other hand are out of control its just a few steps away from turning into another APB Reloaded. God mode game crash explosive ammo aimbots you name it someone is alwasy using it.

2015-04-15,0,0,351,False,Not Recommended,This review has been needing a change since release so what a better time than now.The Grand Theft Auto 5 singleplayer experience is enjoyable and intriguing the amount of interesting and diverse characters draws the player to conversations and the world that the game takes place in is also constructed perfectly all the encounters and attention to details help create an magnificent enviroment. But lets face it you are going to make a purchase of this game based on the online experience rather the singleplayer and thats the problem.GTA Online is terrible the countless amounts of hackers horrible connections to servers and the constant grind blends to create a sour taste in the mouth. All these problems lie on the shoulders of the developers Rockstar Games and Take Two. Rockstar create beautifully immersive and complex universe but that missed the ball with this one without proper servers users are unable to play a constant match with DCing with the hackers users cannot complete free roam missions and with the grind users cant have fun and have to shill hard earned cash from their wallets just to gain a measley chuckle with friends isnt worth it.You should not purchase Grand Theft Auto 5 as the developers do not care about your experience or the community in general.

Quote 2 Take Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third party projects involving Rockstar s PC games that are single player non commercial and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties. 'Generally' is a loose word and not a definitive answer this is still a wide open problem because Take2 could simply make the claim that 'The mod allows others to manipulate its code to make an online hack' therefor still shutting down any single player modding confidence. And this is the entire problem just because something like Opev IV ''COULD'' be used by people to create hacks or maliscious mods for online does not mean that OPEN IV is responsible or liable in any way. Yet still they threaten Open IV when it has absolutely nothing to do with the hacking groups as they could simply create a hack from scratch with or without Open IV.",Grand Theft Auto V

GTA5 ended up being one of the best launches in recent history. Game immediately ran smoothly and the difference in consistency compared to the 360 is amazing. I almost feel like I am finally playing the game for the first time. Visually stunning.People may gripe about a $60 price tag but R* doesn't take your money for granted.

2017-05-14,0,0,176,False,Recommended,I'm going to make this quick and simple with the pros and cons (and neutral) Pros It is a nice port. Certainly a change from GTA 4. Many activities you could join in SP. MP? You'll find more of that in MP (but it does have its cons. I'll list it below) Free MP DLCs A change from your usual GTA game with not just one protagonist but three of them (you can customize their looks as well though the SP customization is surely lacking compared to the MP one). The three are colourful in personality and one should atleast find a character that is to their liking. I liked Michael the most. Semi realistic shooting gameplay that I found to be enjoyable San Andreas is lively. So much livelier than Liberty City.Cons the MP although fun if you have some friends to play around can be cancerous. Griefers are everywhere cheaters roam free and the stuffs are very expensive. You would need to grind to have money and money is everything in a MP game like this. All cars handled the same. There are minor differences sure but because of engine limitation you'll see that the minor differences meant for nothing. Dead MP jobs. I said from before that there are lots of activities in the MP. Sadly these jobs are often devoid of players. You want to do some MP race? You better be patient because not many players like playing the races. Convoluted storyline. You got three protags but the game did not do justice to their stories. The guys at RS once banned me for playing fair so I guess you can include bad admins into the fray (lucky for me I got my account back).Neutral No more than one strip club (Only found one. If there's another let me know). The colourful city. Some may not enjoy it but I prefer the new Los Santos to Liberty City. All in all a good game for you if you enjoy this particular type of game.But what do I know? I'm just a lifting rat.,Grand Theft Auto V

That's the key word though SOMETIMES. Not all the time and not by everyone. why ban every single player from using mods in single player just because of a few bad people? its a tottaly stupid move and its why im going on a boycot against Take 2.the reason why Take 2 did this was because of shark cards. little micro transactions that allow you to buy more in game money in GTA online for real life cash. The problem Take 2 has though is that people cheating in GTA online have no reason to buy shark cards since they can spawn in more money. So to wrap it all up this why I'm quitting gta 5.

2017-06-20,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,Modding the online multiplayer portion of any game should always be met with heavy penalty and all proactive efforts should be taken to remediate such actions. This type of modding is often toxic and usually has a negative impact other players' online experience.Modding the offline/singleplayer portion of games makes gaming what it is today. It allows players to express their creativity by taking a game and putting their own unique spin on it generally enhancing the experience. There should absolutely never be a situation where a game developer should punish those seeking to mod this portion of the game. It restricts creativity and is a slap in the face to anyone who wants to get the most out of their gaming experience.The recent news regarding Take Two Interactive's cease and desist letter to OpenIV is a blatent overstep of their authority. Unless their decision is reversed and they take no other actions in the future that punishes ethical modding players will unite and make a difference.Good luck trying to sell another game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"Well then I am now changing my review since apparently Rockstar and their publisher have changed a bit to work with modders (iirc haven't checked on it don't really care to check on it as of late other things going on in my life) and I have a... newfound moral disagreement with reviewbombing. My qualms with the game as of the last time I played (gun runner update) would be more objective to lay claim to.As much as I don't particularly like playing the game anymore it would be a lie to say that I did not enjoy playing it. The story mode is as fun as ever and the online multiplayer was fun for a while. On the aspect of story mode it's fun and would definitely recommend snagging it if you haven't gotten the chance to experience it.Now however comes to the part where I'm somewhat iffy on recommending this game. Up to the point that I had played there hadn't been any updates to single player as far as content goes that I was aware of so at this point if you play GTA mostly for the single player GTAV is fairly dead in that regard from here on out. If you are interested in the multiplayer and don't have a well developed millionaire character... it is quite flawed and very unfun at points. Firstly the entire thing is pretty antagonistic towards newer players. You don't have as good of guns you don't have access to the good armor initially and more experienced players have a considerable advantage in health. With the gun runner review a whole new level of imbalance was added. The vehicles that are available to players with the in game currency to buy them or get them through the gun runner DLC and previous to that are unbalanced and unfun to play against unless you have those very same vehicles. While yes some of it can be overcame with skill and fancy shooting and tactics it's not a particularly fun environment to play in. Since one of the big ways of advancement is through the open world content via the biker gang and CEO missions/activities it can be quite drull when you get firebombed by a pair of guys on a pair of extremely nimble rocket bikes with rocket launchers on them for the umpteenth time in a row when you're merely trying to make money and succeed.So TL DR Single player is good as ever but has had a halt in development.Multiplayer is about as fun as if APB had turned off the free for all protection that is to say that if you want to merely get on an even playing field with those who make you miserable you are going to have to put in dozens and dozens of hours to merely not have a substantial gear and health advantage going against you.I really wish Steam had a ""meh"" option for recommending the game because on one hand I do think it is a game worth experiencing then on the other I really don't feel particularly keen on playing it or personally recommending it to someone.",Grand Theft Auto V

Whether they apologize or not it still happened and that should never be forgotten. Modding will never die no matter how hard you stomp on it. The haters are right too. ""This isn't a legit review it's abusing the review system."" Fine.GTA Online is garbage and is full of cheaters who's only goal is to make you angry. The only way to get money is to grind for hours and then spend it all on a single car or buy shark cards which is what they want. Single player is horrifically boring once you 100% it which doesn't take long. Where is the single player DLC that has been rumored and teased over the years? It's not going to happen. GTA Online is Take Two's cash cow. They won't release SP DLC because then people will stop playing online which will stop shark card purchases. Mods are the reason I still play this game. Playing LSPDFR is the most fun I've ever had in this. Playing in my world is what I enjoy not playing in a microtransaction filled fest.GooD NTS has not released a statement about OpenIV so far other than the initial one when this happened but OpenIV was updated recently to remove the ""Uninstall Later"" message.

2017-06-17,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,The online portion of the game has become a microtransaction hellhole. Every server has someone in a jet or vigilante harassing some random player killing them over and over again while the player asks them to just go away. the only options at that point are. 1) Play for an unresonable amount of time to grind away the money needed to purchase the same OP godware to compete against those harassing you. 2) Spend real life money to do the same thing. the batmobile alone is almost as much as the game itself so microtransaction might not be the most appropriate term. Or 3) just quit.1&amp 2 are rhetorical. So 3 is the only real option. So don't buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-13,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,Great game in all honesty the singlepalyer is one of the best I've played in the recent years (Mostly On Console as I just moved onto pc) But I have played The Last Of Us Most of the CODs campaigns Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 4) They all had me immersed into the game really heavily I just couldn't live without them. but as soon as you hop into online in GTA 5 it started to frustrate me as there were modders on every god damm server I went into. And some of really did frustrate me hard as one time a hacker had stolen all my money. So If you have friends Heists and Races are really fun and if you dont want to have modders the good thing is that you can make a invite only session were you can only invite people that you know or just play by yourself. Driving is really fun in this game (Personal Opinion)Pros Great Singlepalyer Great With friends Really Imersive Great Vareity Of Amerpartments Cars Heists Etc Great Visuals Amazing DLC Free DLC DrivingCons Microtransactions (Shark Cards) Modders Online Conections (Peer To Peer) Horrible support Toxic Community Horrible Anti CheatIn all honesty this game is great but it has been ruined by modders coming from old gen (Xbox 360 PS3) the same problem is on console I heard so. But if you like singleplayer games or any kind of those type of games this game is your go to.But if you are considering to Buy it for multiplayer please wait till Rockstar patch thesse bugs I mean go ahead if you want to but I would say spend money on another game for the time being because the game right now is full of modders that will ruin your experiance,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-13,0,0,390,False,Recommended,Recent updates has probably made this game unplayable on my system. Neither I nor Rockstar know why. It's a shame since I've been looking forward to playing this game since its launch.Apart from that I think that this game is inferior to Saints Row 2 in most ways but two online multiplayer activity and vehicle customisation. There are other things I like about this game (if I could actually play it on my system) and that is the diverse game modes and the ability to customise them.Even though I think the customisation on this game is crap compared to that of Saints Row 2's and the Sims games' it's still within my taste and I'd still want to keep playing because unlike many other games with customisation it's actually pretty decent.I wish that Rockstar would make interiors accessible throughout the game not only just in the missions in which they take place in. For instance in the Humane Labs and Research building I have seen a Twitch streamer using an exploit in the console version of the game just to access it on GTAO for a non competititve game he made up. Saints Row 2 doesn't require exploits for a similar feature.As always I love how easy it is to mod the game but I'm annoyed that modding for online gameplay is not allowed and will result in bans. Even then modders might not think of the mechanics that I would like for this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-10,0,0,584,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer was abandoned in favor of multiplayer to push Shark Cards. They're essentially harvesting money off people dumb enough to buy GTA Bucks. Its painfully obvious that as a result mission rewards have been tailored to provide insufficient payout to encourage their purchase. Plus all the new content added to Online isn't in singleplayer and they even have made it difficult for people to spawn any of the content in SP through mods indicating they are desperate to funnel people into Online and thus towards their contemptible currency. Given that they supposedly make 250 million a year off this it shouldn't be a massive surprise. The fact of the matter is Shark Cards shouldn't exist to begin with but Rockstar is a den of greedy console peasants pushing a massively anti consumer business model its simply another step down the stairs of corporate hegemony given past actions.With persistent connection issues and terrible performance on the lowest to highest grade PCs this game is a glorified Rockstar money farm. Get millions from a hacker or play something else. Unless they show a massive turn in mentality Red Dead's sequel is bound to be a game riddled with ways to suck money from your wallet.

The online is horrible Rockstar is doing jack all about hackers. They claim they are but for so long every single game lobby I join has been populated by at least one hacker. It's like winning the lottery to get a room with none. Then rockstar with their wonderful carpet ban system have banned two of my friends multiple times because ANOTHER guy was running around dropping money on everyone I imagine other people from that session were put in a similar situation.Wish I were more socially connected I would like to start a boycott on GTA V until the most advertised portion of the game is fixed.UPDATE My review remains negative.

Meanwhile rockstar has done all for the single player and instead pushes multiplayer updates and have ridicilously priced in game items all designed to push shark card crap.

I have never played online gta5 the amount of hacking in game and bans if you get dirty money or a hacked items plus the shark card prices were always enough for me to say all that.

I have no problem with hackers who stay in private lobbies drop money for themselves and have a fun time with friends in a private server cause hacking with friends is adimitally fun. The problem comes when people go into open servers drop money and with other people in the risk of getting others banned. At this point unless you have 3 friends who already have the game that can do missions and Heists with you then don't get this game.

2017-06-18,0,0,104,False,Not Recommended,"There was a time where I'd recommend this game to friends. ""It's fantastic! The singleplayer is great the online is fun! There's more than just killing people!""Not anymore. I've bought this game 4 times now. First on the Xbox 360 with the super fancy best edition whatever that was then on the PS3 normal edition then on the Xbox One normal edition and then on the PC normal edition. That's over $300 to Rockstar and Take 2. I knew PC would have more modders online than the new gen console versions. So I got the PC version purely for mods and to never play online. I've sunk over 1500 hours in the Xbox 360 Version and then another 900 or so in the Xbox One version. A good amount in the PS3 version and a good amount in the Steam Version. I wouldn't recommend this game any longer. Since those first days the last few major DLCs and the end of DLC coming to singleplayer has turned me off of it. There are no ways to get money fast playing this game. When the game came out the most expensive property was $400 000 and the most expensive car was $1million. Now it's $4million in the form of a basic office in a skyscraper downtown. Then of course there's the $2million optional garage for the skyscraper the $6million Yacht (a base model Yacht may I add these can cost up to $12million) a $2.9million underground nuclear bunker and multiple small side businesses for up to $900k each don't forget the warehouse properties for up to $1.6million.Oh and the cars. When the game came out an Obey 9f which is an Audi R8 (a car costing the real life equivalent of about $140 000) was priced in game at about $120 000. Fairly reasonable. Since then there has been a Jaguar F Type added to the game in the form of the Ocelot Lynx. It's a sports class car and in reality shouldn't cost too much more than the Obey 9f. In real life it's about $100 000. In the game it's $1.7million.Same thing happened longer back there was a Subaru BRZ lookalike car added to the game. I have never seen someone own one you know why? Because it costs $700 000. I wouldn't pay that. Not many people would. What you may not know upon reading this review is that Rockstar and Take 2 also have ""Shark Cards"". In game currency that can be bought with real life money. $100 buys you $8million. $20 buys you $1.25million. You get the idea. These weren't initially available at the start of GTA Online only a month or two afterwards. And the $20 card was the most expensive. Now there are even more expensive options. The increase in cost of living in Los Santos has no doubt in my mind been because of these Shark Cards. Rockstar and Take 2 have been trying to squeeze money out of this game as much as possible. And online is their way to doing it. Singleplayer DLC news was promised in 2014 however it is 2017 and there hasn't been any word on it at all. Presumably this DLC has been cancelled for online content. When the game was marketed before release Rockstar also said there would be stock trading in Online however 4 years down the line this has not come to fruition. Presumably because the concept of free money or stock manipulation has them scared of a loss of potential earnings. This is how games work right? This is why PC has mods for those who don't want to play online or can't or don't have the time to. Well it's not going to be this way much longer if Rockstar's parent company Take 2 has their way. Earlier this month the creators of OpenIV a modding tool that blocks the multiplayer aspect of GTA so that the singleplayer aspect can be modified for mods such as vehicle mods (turning the Lynx into an actual Jaguar F Type for example) singleplayer functions such as LSPDFR and more received a Cease and Desist letter from Take 2 during the height of E3. Take 2 believed that the flood of gaming news during this time would stop this story from getting out. It hasn't. In the letter they cite that the creators of OpenIV are violating Rockstar's property and that they need to stop distributing copies of the modding tool or face legal action. The creators of OpenIV have been doing this for 10 years. And their mod does not affect Multiplayer in fact it has measures implemented so this can't affect Multiplayer. But precisely this is the problem that Take 2 sees. If less people play multiplayer less people will buy Shark Cards and less people will spend money on their online game. So they want to stop a gigantic modding community. PC isn't even the largest platform for this game. In fact I would suggest it is the smallest. With the largest platforms being PS4 and Xbox One there is no reason that some people playing singleplayer could pose a threat to Take 2's earnings. Yet it does to them. And that's enough for all of us to stop playing their game and start fighting back. I'm not the first negative review today and I certainly won't be the last. Take 2 you've gotten $300 of my money in games and $140 of my money in Shark Cards. I'm not buying them again. And my preorder of RDR 2? That's been cancelled.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-05,0,0,172,False,Recommended,"It's GTA!The gameplay is the same as every other game in the series the only diffrence is that it is more refined and 10 million times better. Rockstar have been using the same core gameplay since 1997 and have built upon it and made it hugley improved. That doesn't mean the gameplay is bad it's really fun to go on rampages drive through the city or through the desert. This game gives you a lot of choices and that's why it appeals to so many people. You can be whoever you want to be. You can either play as just a normal person obeying traffic and doing crazy activities. Or you can kill everyone and everything which is 90 percent of people. ""SPOILER'S AHEAD""!!!!!The story.....what can I say. The best story Rockstar has made yet. You play as three different characters which you can switch between whenever you like. Franklin Micheal and Trevor. 9 Years prior to the events of GTA V Micheal Trevor and their friend Brad try to pull off a heist in North Yankton.Everything goes well until their car gets hit by a train and they get ambushed by cops. Brad and Micheal are both shot while Trevor escapes with some of the cash. Micheal fakes his dead and flies to Los Santos while Brad dies.In Los Santos Micheal meets Franklin. They pull off a heist which attracts the attention of Trevor who then goes to meet Micheal.At one point the trio starts working for Devin Weston a rich and famous guy. Then Devin Weston offers Franklin 3 choices but I will not spoil them.*SPOILER ALERT OVER* The singleplayer has 69 missions and 58 ""Strangers and Freaks"" side mission. The storymode can be completed for around 30 40 hours if you aren't hurrying.The game offers a lot of side activities such as hunting racing playing darts and much more. This alone will get you tons of hours of fun.Now onto the multiplayer. The only negative aspect of this game. Multiplayer is on the base a fun greatly made place where you can do whatever you want with your friends. BUT...don't get too excited because each lobby is filled with at least one hacker ruining the game spawning in money etc. The game is unplayable becasue if you are new then it's basically unplayable becasue everyone else is 100 percent going to be better than you. In addition to this it has microtransations you can get kicked for no reason and every purchasable item is overpriced to A lot of people have been unlawfully banned including myself for doing nothing wrong. Hopefully in GTA 6 multiplayer can be much better.Should you buy it. YES. Singleplayer is filled with tons of content and mods increase this multiplayer is fun putting negatives aside and worth the hefty price tag. Buy it before I hunt you down......",Grand Theft Auto V

The singleplayer remains a truely solid game but with regards to GTA O the game is no longer fun to play.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,Removing mods was a stupid and greedy move and it limits the game greatly. Too bad that guaranteeing shark cards are more important than the company or the franchise reputation.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,The game is good and has the potential to be great but that potential has been squandered by Take Two in a quest for even more money from microtransactions in a full price game that is still full price even four years after release.The GTA series stands as a landmark series in videogame history it's a series that most people have heard of even if they don't play videogames before GTAV I would say that reputation was well earned. In fact considering the sheer detail of the world and how much there is to do in GTAV I would even agree that the work that Rockstar put into these games is deserving of a lot of praise still.But the problem is that it's too big of a name and the publisher knows it. They know that they can charge full price for the game when they release on consoles and then full price again years later when they release on newer consoles and PC effectively selling the game twice. They know they can even increase the price of the game just before the 2015 summer sale so that even the 'on sale' price is the same as the regular price. Worse still their justification for that particular stunt was that the game package came with a 'shark card' a satirical credit card in the GTA universe that serves as the name for packages of in game money that Take Two will sell for real money. This is worse not only because selling in game money is scummy but also because that shark card is considered by Steam to be a DLC meaning the purchase of the game + shark card is non refundable.I still have trouble believing that the shark cards are real. Everything in GTA is a parody of real American culture they even have jokey adverts on the radio about how the macho credit card shark names make you more of a man for owning them. So when I heard that you could buy in game cash for these things I didn't actually believe it until I got in game and saw it for myself. Even if you're someone who buys into micro transactions in other games like I do buying shark cards is absolutely not worth it. I'm usually happy to spend a bit of money in a game even if it's not F2P because I won't have bought the game full price I'm enjoying it and I like to support the devs. The thing is though everything in GTAV has slowly become more and more focused on getting people to buy shark cards and there is no division between optional micro transaction content and regular content.I wasn't really too thrilled about the GTAV story for a number of reasons but I did like the thought of making my own criminal dude and running about Los Santos driving sweet cars and flying planes. You might think this was good because GTA O is the only aspect of the game that receives updates anymore but you'd be wrong. I've put a couple hundred hours into GTA O and still have virtually nothing to show for it. There have been countless 'free' updates to the game since I started but it doesn't matter because EVERYTHING they add is exorbitantly expensive. Never mind the fact that a lot of it is just very samey super cars they're super cars that my character can only dream of driving because he is and always will be dirt poor. The simple reason that I never have any money in GTA O is that all of the money making methods are incredibly grindy so you get bored and put your credit card details in for some shark cards and the methods often have high up front costs so you justify putting your credit card details in for some shark cards just to get you started on making money. I've never done this however and the reasons why are thus A) The game was already expensive enough even on sale and I cannot justify spending more just for in game money.andB) GTA O is a nightmarish hellscape full of hackers and connectivity problems.Yeah don't let my 200 hours in online fool you into thinking that all of those hours were like logging into any regular MMO. Free play had virtually nothing for you to do for years until they finally adding free play events which even now are often complete wastes of time when veterans can and will completely dominate them. Hackers and griefers are everywhere you might just be minding your own business miles away from everyone else riding a motorbike across the mountains like I have done many times only for you to suddenly blow up or get off your bike and lose all of your momentum while your bike flies away or turn into a god damn carousel while the hackers pin props to your character model. And if you're thinking well I'll just report that hacker and continue playing. Good luck with that. Rockstar have proven to be somewhat indisciminate with who they ban and even accidently receiving spawned money can leave your account banned for weeks and your in game bank account drained of all funds even if they were legitimately earned. Don't get me wrong there's a lot of cool in GTA O and GTAV but unless you like spending hundreds of hours doing the most menial tasks you can imagine in a game or you can just open your wallet you won't ever get the play with them. The tasks are menial by the way. I once worked for an 'organisation' a group that a player had created because they had the right property to launch organisation missions and it was my job to drive a dump truck around a neighbourhood 'delivering' packages of coke on the sly. The money I received for doing that wasn't even enough to buy some of the coats they sell in the clothing stores.I spent maybe half an hour of my life that I will never get back being a virtual bin man for an ill mannered twelve year old.Don't support Take Two and what they've done to this series.Oh yeah they also legally attacked some modders in Russia recently for helping people make SINGLE PLAYER mods for their game so they can play the way they like. Horrible bastards.,Grand Theft Auto V

One of the major reasons I bought this game for the SECOND time for PC after playing on consoles was due to the modding community that has existed for GTA games for many years now. Modding for GTA 5 was just now hitting its height of stability and fun while online has also grown to have many ufn game modes.Just because people are playing single player with mods does not mean that the vast majority of players stil play online. There are still thousands of people who have great fun in GTA online and purchase cash cards. Part of the GTA franchise is the fact that players have the option to play through the game in various ways. Just because some players decide to not play online does not mean that the entire modding community should be negatively affected.

The loading screen has choppy music playing for 2 seconds pausing for 5+ and playing again on a constant loop. When I get in game the stuttering continues. I get one second of playable time until it stutters again for 5+ seconds. When I check my frames it is way more than playable so I don't know if this is a driver issue but I have uninstalled and reinstalled them multiple times. It would be great if rockstar can fix this issue.UPDATE #2I figured it out. For some reason having some of my playback devices disabled causes that issue. I fixed it by enabling all of the audio devices and making my headphones the defaults.,Grand Theft Auto V

Overpriced cars boats planes.ppl constantly bombing you with hydra buzzards hynds Chasing you down with armored trucks that cant be destroyed by explosives Armored cars with HMG on top. Turreted limo (armored) or kuruma that cant be shot thru to kill the driver.I used to love this game but ever since they started adding more and more overpriced stuff in to the game I cant say I would recomend it (cars for 3 mil) Averidge mission gives you 15 25 kHeists and any other activity have so long loading screens that you can go take a break and eat a snack and your still back in time.Comunity is absolute trash filled with 12 year olds. Constantly crying about you killing them you being racist and about doing it to your mom.Overrall its fun as long as you find some hacker to give you money so you dont have to grind but if your stuck in grindvile you might as well bash your head on the table desk as thats how much fun that is after you do the same misssion for 100th time either becose youve done it that many time or becose someone died and you need to restart it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online Way too hard to make money they want you to buy their payfor cards. Crappy business model for a game I already payed a lot of money for.

2017-06-18,0,0,53,False,Not Recommended,"This game is great don't get me wrong. The single player campaign is a fantastic criticism of the extravagant consumerism and late stage capitalism of the United States and is indeed very fun. What makes this so ironic is the fact that while the single player campaign is a beautiful well written satire of capitalism and consumerism GTA Online is too but is very much real. For Take Two to smash the game's vibrant modding community in a pathetic attempt to get people to buy more ""shark cards"" is incredibly disappointing and ironic given the story single player campaigns throughout the franchise. It's almost as if they haven't played their own damn game. Modders have added so much content to the single player game while Rockstar/Take Two haven't released a single DLC for offline mode since the game was released almost 5 years ago.Take Two's argument for their cease and desist order is that OpenIV enables hacking. That's t and here's why. When OpenIV is attached to a GTAV installation it disables GTA Online completely. Attempting to go online on an installation modded with OpenIV will crash the game. Instead of going after the individual hackers who would abuse this tool Take Two has shown that they don't care about the consumer by issuing a blanket demand to stop development of OpenIV.This is not the only time Take Two has been hostile to modders. Around the time of the game's release many members of the modding community were unfairly banned from opening the game in both single player and online mode simply for installing a mod to use in single player mode or experimenting with the game's code nothing wrong with that outside of Online mode.Rockstar as well has lost both my money and my respect. They used to feature mods all the time and were incredibly supportive of the GTA modding community. For them to be completely silent on this whole mess regardless of whether or not they are Take Two's subsidiary is absurd and reeks of rent seeking corporatist behavior.In short you Take Two. You've Taken Two GTA Vs worth of money from me both for the Xbox 360 version and the PC version. That will be the last of my money that you'll ever get.",Grand Theft Auto V

By far the best of the GTA franchise and that's saying something. It's an epic crime saga with a racing game and a flight simulator built in. Three characters provide better variety than just one tons of beautiful vehicles to steal and modify an entire island that is unlocked the moment you start the game (unlike previous GTA games). The gun selection is stellar as usual (sticky bomb heists on armored cars easy money). Not to mention this is easily the greatest video game soundtrack of all time. The radio stations in this game play better music and have more variety than the city I live in. If you played this game at first on console but happen to have a better computer since that time try this game again.

Without mods for single player this game has no replayability. Not worth it at full asking price just wait for a sale later on down the road when it fall below 5.99USD. As for the multiplayer all take two and rockstar want to do is microtransactions and sale shark cards which I get it they are a company and they need to make money. Where it becomes unfair is that OpenIV was for single player only and since the game came out they didn't have a problem with it until just now. It wouldn't suprise me if they release a creation kit and start charging shark card fees for mods that would explain the sudden cease on modding.,Grand Theft Auto V

Stop bending over for publishers to do whatever they want. We as consumers have purchased the game and we own a legitimate copy of it.

They're literally in every session and then there's people asking for money drop from the cheaters and it seems like the community likes to accept cheaters as a part of the community. It's so stupid that rockstars anti cheat system is so bad.

2015-05-10,0,0,290,False,Not Recommended,The below statements about the game are still true in my opinion however the shutting down of OpenIV is unacceptable and the player needs to voice their opinion at the storefront so this will be a thumbs down for now.Grand Theft Auto Five is hands down one of the best sandbox games ever. The best thing in my opinion is the optimization. Even on my low end PC it runs really well about 30 40 frames per second. This was not possible for games like The Witcher 2 that came out years before. the second best thing is the editor currently exclusive for PC. Think the Theater mode for Halo. The rest of the game is just like the current gen consoles. If you are satisfied with your PS4 and XBONE experience and don't mind much for editors then you might stay with those versions. The keyboard controls are pretty good for on foot and driving but as far as aircraft it's pretty bad. The planes fly with the numpad on the right by default and I think the helicopters use the mouse. The other bad thing about this game is the drain on my CPU. Again my computer isn't very good at running this game in the first place but skyping with more than one other person will break either GTA or Skype so watch out.,Grand Theft Auto V

If anyone wants to message me back with solutions to any of these I'd be all for it. As a side note the NVIDIA GeForce thing has a recommendation for all of my settings. I hit the ""Use Optimal Settings"" button and it says it works within that but whenever the game starts it runs at 800X600 with all of the lowest settings.

2017-06-18,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game while it was on sale here on th Steam storefront. I had purchased the original PS3 version way back when this game was brand new. Not exactly day one but it might've been a day or two after it had been oout on the market. I gave my PS3 and the digital copy of the game to a friend a friend who split the bill for buying this game in the first place . I managed to try out the newer generation ports over at another person's house on the Xbox One. I was fairly impressed but $60 for a re release seems a tad bit much. Even for an assumingly huge studio like Rockstar. I told myself if ever I were to get into PC gaming proper I would try this game out with the incentive to replay the campaign story mode at my own pace rather than speeding throught it like I had to around launch. Then once I was finished with the story mode I would install and play mods. Because it's a Grand Theft Auto port for Windows a series reknown for it's modding community on the PC gaming side of the industry. While it's not the sole reason I bought the game for a second time mind you it is a major reason as to why I did in the first place. So I finally own a real gaming PC get the game a few weeks after that and when I beat the game I decided to take a break from it. Having spent a few days on it. Then I found out that the main way of modding the game had been deemed illegal. Which is beyond inept. I don't care for online I don't want to shill out more money to Take Two or even to Rockstar. And I was a huge fan of your games still am. But this is degrading to everybody and I'm honestly upset that I bought this game again. It would've been better off if I had only stuck with the memories of having played it a few years back then try to climb back into a newer package with the possibility to have my experience be even more fun. Giving the game more of a lifespan. I'm actually ashamed to have bought this off of Steam. I now know I should've gotten something else on sale instead. Wasted my cash on something that doesn't want me to play it how I want to. I bought the damned game I should be allowed to play and do whatever with it I want as long as I'm not ruining other people's experiences with it or pirating the game. Which I would not do. I just wanted to play with mods and the companies in charge took away the players' right to do so. I'm glad the community is taking a stand. Hopefully OpenIV will be reinstated and left alone. It doesn't mess with online and from what I'm told your servers are flooded with terrible cheaters anyhow not even related to modding. It's too late for me to get a refund but if I could I would. I'm done writing the points been made so many times by now. I hope this sends a clear message to whoever made the decision up the latter of corporate meatheads. A decent port with a little something extra now stripped of what made it stand out. Unless this is fixed I won't be supporting Rockstar or Take Two any further.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,451,False,Not Recommended,"Single player is good but like most games you will spend most of your time in multiplayer or modding in single player. Take Two pretty much killed the modding part so that leaves multiplayer.Multiplayer is not fun. In general coming across other players just makes you worried about getting griefed. This is heavily amplified when you become a Vip/Ceo/MC President which are the main ways to make money. Doing these typically involves putting your own cash on the line in order to make a potential profit. That's not a problem in itself risk/reward and all but the extent is ludicrous. You can put in many hours of work to make a profit and then lose it all at the end because players are told ""Here's 5k if you destroy that guy's cargo truck that he spent 5 hours and a quarter million ingame cash to sell.""And that's only how Rockstar intends for it to work. Most of the time lobbies are locked down by one or two players using a Hydra Oppressor or whatever other toy of the day to grief the entire lobby on their own. The only way to counter it is to have your own Hydra/Oppressor/whatever and solely dedicate yourself to trying to keep them down as even if you do manage to destroy them these vehicles have very short cooldowns and they will be able to use them again almost immediately in most cases.Quite simply Online is a griefer's arms race. All the best things are expensive and require hours of grinding or paying into the microtransactions. And if you just want to have fun with friends somebody with more powerful weaponry will make sure you don't. You'll get frustated until you buy a hydra or acquire the new explosive sniper rifle so you can be the top griefer yourself. I've bought a Hydra myself before the gunrunning update and just felt hollow inside realizing that it's just a part of a cycle that makes people want to pay actual money to acquire the tools to ruin other people's times.Only consider this game for the single player.

Then nothing happened. Confused was I so I decided to do some research. There seemed to be a glitch among portable graphics cards that would not allow the game to launch (I use my trusty ASUS G750 notebook with an 860m gpu). I tried multiple times but nothing woud work. After countless attempts I left for class furiously. I ressolved to give the game a nasty review but then it happened. Just as I sat down to write my strongly worded review I tried to start my game up one more time. BEHOLD IT LAUNCHED! From that point forward I have been robbing banks winning races and claiming glorious victory! The gameplay was smooth and very nice. After that first hicup I experienced no other problems with GTA 5. For this reason I recomend this game and I hope you enjoy it just as I have. P.S.

2016-07-05,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,This game use to be good. The singleplayer is great but if you are buying it for single player I'd suggest getting it from a discount website because it isn't worth 60 for just that IMO. And online? Forget it it's basically pay to play now. Sure you can play for free and all updates are free but don't expect to get anything good unless you grind your off or buy the shark cards. And the icing on the cake? A majority of player will still defend rockstar when you try to call them out on their bull saying if you actually play the game you can get all the stuff. Well it doesn't take a mathematician to figure out that at about 10 minutes and 30 thousand max per mission a 2 million dollar car will take about 5 straight hours to get and that is completely straight no breaks and don't even get me started on the 8 million dollar yacht. So unless you have absolutely no life and want to devote all your gaming to grinding one game don't even bother with online. And don't expect rockstar to change anything when the fanboys are sucking their d i c k s and buying shark cards. I love GTA it's probably my one of my favorite games but rockstar they have turned into a bunch of greedy heads,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-19,0,0,1986,False,Recommended,Alot of things have changed since i posted this review. At first i did not recommend this game because of the rampant modding and griefing situation when playing GTA Online. But at the moment with the latest patch there are virtually no modders online. Usually by now you would be seeing modders in every session teleporting around and blowing up everyone on the map or spawning UFO's but you simply dont see any of this anymore. The only thing you have to deal with is the people asking for money drops. But besides this the game is fantastic and a great way to have fun with your friends. Theres so much to do and the latest updates have introduced new ways to make money. The cops are still annoying but they can be fun to watch sometimes. The story mode is great and there are many great mods that you can use in single player to enhance the look and feel of the game. GTA Online is a absolute blast when gaming with your friends. Recommended at the moment as of patch 1.34.,Grand Theft Auto V

And the game is perfectly optimized I have a GTX 980m and I can run the game on Ultra High with some settings High. It is a perfect port!

I am so glad I purchased it on PC it is just awesome and 1000x better than the console version. There is so many differences and then so many very subtle differences which make this game an absolute joy. I have played the entire time in first person which words can not describe.

2015-04-16,0,0,212,False,Recommended,"Welcome back home GTA you were worth the wait. This is without a shadow of a doubt my absolute favourite GTA surpassing my love of San Andreas.I completed the single player to 100% on the 360 and it simply blew my mind that Rockstar somehow got that version packed on the now 10 year old console. I never got around to trying the online mode.But enough of the old V my jaw has dropped several times on my now second playthrough. This version is visually stunning and I currently aren't running the game on its maximum settings. I have also been playing for the most part in first person view thanks for that addition Rockstar shooting feels so much more comfortable in that perspective and in my opinion makes a much more immersive experience.1080 mostly high settings with a few very highs and I get a fairly solid 45 60 FPS (it could be higher but I currently have a 60hz screen so)Hardware AMD 9370 4.41 Ghz 8GB Ram R9 270X 2GB Win 7 64 bit. HDD is a standard SATA IIUsage is 100% for the most part on both CPU and GPU and when I did a test FRAPs record the FPS dropped about 10 or so.I hope this information provides some assistance to those having difficulty running the game.I have also seen comments about controllers I have my 360 controller plugged in prior to launching and have even plugged it in and out a few times mid game for a reason I am about to explain further. For some reason the aim tries this weird recenter after ""inactivity"" which isnt a problem for close targets but when sniping and zoomed in it can be a pain.Still haven't touched multiplayer so cannot comment on it yet will update when I have.Good job Rockstar Red Dead Redemption port next please!",Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are stunning.Overall GTA v is great the single player is hands down 10/10. The modding community makes a already fun game 100x funner.

GTA Online can be hit &amp miss with trolls and modders (I usually go into a friends only server to avoid them) but you get them in every game I guess......The single player game is brilliant the ability to use 3 main characters allows for a lot of variation and thats a big plus for me. The main missions are exciting and really do allow to you to see most if not all of the Island of Los Santos. Often forgotten are the smaller missions these too are great fun nothing like driving round shooting ""for sale"" signs or attempting to locate some inner peace (the latter usually good to find after gunning down Merryweather morons!)8/10 for me great game!",Grand Theft Auto V

Story was sharp and not too complex kept me interested to the end and online mode is proving to keep me interested a good bit.

2015-04-16,0,0,128,False,Recommended,If you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) GTA is ready to frustate you.GTA loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time wether it's driving shooting diving or flying.Flying however is the worst with default PC controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at.From my current perspective flying in GTA V is about 10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. It isn't just dedicated flying titles that do it better like World of Warplanes but also so called rivals where one presume Rockstar paid at least cursory attention to like the Saints Row entries 3 and 4. They all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of GTA on this front all the sadder.I'm now off to see if that gamepad I bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is why the hell do I need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several AAA title that don't need it ?

This games has incredibly bad crashing and freezing issues. Like every 10 20 minutes I get the following error message 'GTA V Has stopped working'And yes. I have tried EVERYTHING. I have spent the last 3 days solid trying to make this game work.This is the only issue that I am experiencing however there are countless players experinces issues along the following linesFPS Drops even on good systemsRandom crashing and freezingSocial Club wont start or crashesGame won't even download hwne you click the download buttonThese are some of the most popular bugs that people are postng online and it seems that the PC players that can play without fault are few and far between. Don't get me wrong. With what I have played of this game. It's bloody amazing. I run the game at Very High settings at 60fps and its absoutley stunning. The game is great and the online is full of fun. However due to the nature of the bugs annd how many of them there are I really wouldn't get this game right now. Rockstar has only formally addressed 2 of atleast 10 GAME BREAKING bugs. All current players can do is sit wait and hope it gets fixed. Litteraly.I love GTA. Played every game. But right now If I could get my money back... I wouldDo not buy this game right now. Wait a few months untill all the serious bugs have been fixed,Grand Theft Auto V

Sometimes it reaches 30fps. in certain areas. There is no reason on why it does do this and is there an explaination on how can change anything to make it play smooth? Even if I don't get constant 120 fps at least 90 115fps would do just fine... Anyone want too help?,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Great game and it's optimized really well. I do miss some features especially the lack of working car mirrors can be annoying as I'm currently doing a first person only run. Another thing that annoys me is that there's no option to disable the camera from automatically centering. This is clearly a leftover from the consoles it's really annoying for those who use a mouse. There's a slider in the menu but it doesn't change anything and the centering can't be disabled. Another annoying aspect is the lag in GTA online (and no it's not my internet) and the insane amount of loading required and the insane loading times. There's no reason at all for rockstar to require us to load lobbies games maps and stuff 10 times before you can do a heist. And then there's the stuttering caused by the custom radio etc. Getting an SSD and tweaking some stuff fixed the stuttering though. What I don't like about this is the fact that we had to wait years to get the game on PC but on the plus side they don't seem to be using the DLC policy almost every other game company uses nowadays so I'm willing to forgive them for that. Don't let these minor complaints give you the wrong impression though. The game plays great it looks great the story is fun the humor is great the freedom is unlimited and I'm really impressed by it all. I currently spent around 40 hours in singleplayer and I'm not even close to discovering all there is to discover in the game. It's one of the best games I've played in the past few years.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-16,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,It's a good game at it's core gameplay is fun and GTA Online has alot of content and is consistently updated. I only have a couple gripes. The first is that while GTA Online progress is saved server side single player is not. It doesn't even have cloud or Steam save options and Online progress saved led me to believe it all transferred. I'd actually move on from this issue as my fault for losing my save but I beat it anyway however you HAVE TO progress passed the prologue to play Online! Super annoying.But the BIGGEST issue and the therefore DEALBREAKER is how GOD AWFUL Rockstar Social Club launcher is! I have played the game once in the last 5 months because the launcher breaks over and over it worked once the other day out of sheer luck and has since failed again. No Rockstar official suggestions and online forum methods have proven futile. You could argue that the game would still be recommendable if the base game was unaffected but NOPE it needs to log in and verify through Social Club even for single player!

2017-06-18,0,0,106,False,Not Recommended,The publisher Take Two is issuing cease and desist notices for single player mods. This pisses people off because most modding online is still going on.Another thing is the new update. The player base is honestly really annoying so they mess with what you are trying to do a lot. Originally there was a way to play online solo which was removed.Along with the update is the content. In game to get everything in the free DLC costs 40 million in game. To purchase that money is $100 irl for 8 million in game. This means they think that the content is worth $500 to be accessible to players. You can access it all for free but you would need to grind for over 700 hours.Finally comes the minor things that people have become fed up with. There are glitches and bugs that haven't been fixed for years. Rockstars anti cheat has been wrongly taking in game money from people for no reason they overprice everything to make sure you have to spend to get things and other small things.TLDR Cease and desist to harmless single player modders and genuinely acting like they don't care about the playerbase.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,557,False,Not Recommended,Basically buy this game if you wanna spend 60 70 dollars depending on your region and then get nickled and dimed online. This game WAS really good when it came out and then it got worse and worse. R* does nothing to really moderate online and can't seem to patch hacking worth a damn but then proceeds to demolish the modding community associated with this game. Also for a game that's been released 5 times or so between all the consoles and the PC they've really failed to innovate. They add some new stuff to MP every now and again but mostly its not much the last several expansions have all felt like cut and paste copies of eachother with different skins. Also the replayability for the single player sucks. Once you've beat the game once there's no real reason to go back and play it you just accrue a bunch of money that you can't spend on anything new because all the new weapons cars clothes and houses are multiplayer exclusives. Half of my time spent in this game I spent on single player mods like LSPDFR and now I won't be able to use those because Take Two and R* are so greedy that the HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS that this game has generated for them ISN'T ENOUGH. So yeah spend your hard earned money elsewhere. This game has been out for years and still commands full price and then there's shark cards to top it off. Half the time the server load times are outrageous the game crashes and freezes for no reason whatsoever and 6/10 sessions get hacked. There have been times when playing this game where I spent the entire time bouncing server to server with friends because either the server didn't work right there were greifers or hackers.

It is by far the best graphics i have ever seen in any game in my life! It doesn't end there. The gameplay is equally amazing too It really is a stunning piece of work in every aspect!The bad points... Sometimes after getting killed during a heist or pvp i don't respawn correctly. It stays stuck on a splash screen. If i try moving i can see myself moving on the mini map.. To be fair this has only been out a couple of days on the PC..

2017-06-15,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Updated 23 06 17Great addition to the series even though it disappoints on a few fronts.Singleplayer is fun not all characters are equally interesting. Graphically still a sight to behold. Gameplaywise it has the usual GTA quirks with hard to control characters and some wonky animations. Cars handle pretty well and handling most vehicles is easy.Multiplayer gets updated regularly earning loads of money is hard however so be prepared to grind or fork over cash for shark cards.After finally adding heists Rockstar has sadly been silent on more of these involving missions and instead focussed on different aspects of online.Overall the game leaves a good impression which is slightly overshadowed by the cash grabby nature of the multiplayer. Not the best GTA by a mile however.14 06 17Ridiculous new modding guidelines show that Take Two and Rockstar do not care at all for their customers.Both from a legal as well as a technical standpoint this modding ban is just plan idiotic.I'll gladly recommend this game if they fix this ridiculous modding ban.

2017-06-18,0,0,64,False,Not Recommended,"The game has an okay story with decent controlls and options. There is lots of customizability to cars and there are many cars in the game itself. The loading screens take a very long time and most of the game is just driving around in a car and if you so choose kill innocent pedestrians. The online mode has a lot of content but to purchase anything of said content you need to do dozens of heists and petty thefts as most things are locked by RP and cost hundreds of thousands (and in some cases millions) of dollars. The sodas and candy of course cost $1 at the gas station so you can stock up before you rob them for all of your money back. It is very hard to acquire any money and if you want something fast you may as well buy a shark card as the entire money system in the game is designed to make you buy cards however does not make it impossible to play without. As everyone who looks at the reviews of this game is vehemently aware they also started to ""crack down"" on modders. Some may say ""Oh wow they are finally doing something about the hackers!"" but they are not. They are cracking down on single player mods of which you can now get banned for.TLDR It is an okay game held down by scummy buisness practice.",Grand Theft Auto V

It can also be a little confusing at first as to how to advance the story since there's sooo much to do in the game. Driving is fun in this game too! Each car handles a little differently and the first person mode makes it feel like another game in and of itself.Online mode is also really fun. It goes without saying but of course heists go much better when you have friends to coordinate with instead of random people doing their own thing.

This needs to be something they fix in a week to two weeks time or else you'll have a massive flood (Which you already have so why would you want more?) of people who complain on steam on their forums and to their costumer support that the game is broken and they want a refund.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-17,0,0,83,False,Recommended,"While almost every GTA title since Vice tends to launch with mixed reactions and criticisms I like to think of GTAV as the defiance. I've heard this title derided as a Trucker Simulator as an apologist repetition of GTAIV as a false idol where other franchises have overtaken First Place for themselves... To be honest those are the criticisms of the bitter and inexperienced alike.This is the review of someone who stumbled onto the series in 2002's Vice City and loved San Andreas just as much but felt GTAIV was an ailing entry in the franchise and that Saints Row nailed fun but little else GTAV is wonderful.Like its predecessors V tells an emphatic satire set in San Andreas an iteration of Los Angeles. The three playable characters are wonderfully complimentary to each other. They are the qualities of hubris cynicism and rage each made flesh. Rockstar once again mistakes themselves as being in the movie business and delivers these characters with compelling texture and memorable personalities. If we were to sum up the concept of the game's ""Stage Presence"" as being comprised of its cast its setting and its plot Rockstar has delivered miles ahead of their competitors.Side games are plentiful (if not a bit sporadic at times we're running the gamut between games of soon to be divorced couple's Tennis to street racing to bank and jewelry heists) though I can't say they're as fulfilling (or plentiful) as they'd been in similar titles like Saints Row the Third. Regrettable people like me who love Barbie Dress Up are going to be a tad disappointed in the wardrobes they're not all perfectly interchangeable and where one character might buy a suit that same outfit would be wrinkled and dirty on another character. Cars are customizable to wicked fun but not as consistently as in Saints Row and at times the game has an inconsistent hold on *keeping* those cars. (They use an archaic impound system which may or may not save your car should you lose it.) New features are pretty sparse which is okay by me. One of them is character swapping which is actually a lot less clumsy than I'd predicted and much more compelling to boot. It's nice having three guys but I do wish they'd have implemented some reasonable things like sharing money between them.An unfortunate visitor from GTAIV the driving scheme. It doesn't seem as bad as it was in IV (a game which made me wonder whether Rockstar employees had only driven on the moon drenched in syrup) but it's not the sterling driving scheme from this franchise's glory years either. On the PC in particular I found that mouse driving can be stupendously bad and I even keep my console controller for PC handy if I need to fly. Flying is awful with the keys/mouse. The trade off is that mouse aiming is wonderful.And while I don't usually like playing games online and especially with strangers I have mixed feelings about GTA Online. For one it's still pretty bugged. Joining differently ranked members can result in some goofy flaws but mostly they come in the ""Blank loading screen for 20 minutes"" variety. They have improved it since this game's original launch (in 2013 if I recall you could only design a character by chosing its parents all of whom were tragic uggos) but I think we've got a way to go before we're out of the woods. I really need them to release the iFruit app on the PC since none of my devices are compatable with it (?!) and frankly I want games to stop doing companion apps altogether. So here's to hoping for improved online experiences. Ironically connectivity during play is flawless for me so it's probably something in the design that makes it cringe worthy.Oh and you can set an option to deny spam phone calls from your kaazin as well as set limitations. I'd forgotten how awful that was in GTAIV. You could do a lot worse with $60 and if you're like me you've forgotten just how awesome this game had proven itself back in 2013. Oh and by the way it actually is optimized as hell. I thought that was just an empty little ad campaign but thankfully they meant it. Game looks incredible and runs even better.",Grand Theft Auto V

Take Two remains a crap stain of a company but at least R* itself still has at least one foot planted in reality. The online portion of GTA V is infested with cheaters and always has been. Yet it is Open IV a years old modding tool whose demise will do nothing to address the cheating problem that take Take Two Interactive finally threatens with a cease and desist letter. And this happens after Rockstar itself has previously encouraged and promoted mods made with Open IV on its official blog and social media accounts.Take Two Interactive is an anti consumer company that bullies customers and long time fans.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,103,False,Not Recommended,"Well they've ed it. Straight up. They've been ing it for a while with all their shitey microtransactions and ""not monetizing the end user enough"" (ACTUAL ING THING THEY SAID).They've not asked but taken legal action against almost all mods. No warning just t reasons to make their throbbing money grabbing expand even larger. With reasons given like (paraphrased slightly) ""it ruins the online experience"". Yes I have to say personally that my online experience (which I have never actually got to work because the whole thing is a piece of has been greatly interrupted by the single player only modding scene. Specifically the modding backbone 'OpenIV'. This SINGLE ING PLAYER ONLY mod has really ruined the enjoyment I've had from the multiplayer I don't care about and the single player? Man I can't tell you how many hours have been infected with that horrid mod... I'd probably estimate 100 hours out of my 100.2 hours on record have been purely spoiled by this mod. I mean I've completed the first story mission and left the game to let the modding scene evolve for a few weeks before actually putting any sort of time and energy into playing this game. It's not as if I played 100 hours of modded GTA for no reason no I was obviously just intent with ruining the game for myself. That must be it.Don't get me wrong the game is fantastic but I never bought this on Xbox (I had one at the time of release) or PlayStation. I actually waited TWO ING YEARS for this to come out on PC. Not because I didn't want to play with friends but because I wanted the game to be how it was meant to be. You program a game's code on a ing computer then port it to console because I got the game how it was meant to be played. Beautiful graphics 60fps 4k run on a 1080p screen. Hell I even tried it across 3 monitors (but because it's an unoptimised piece of I couldn't get above 15fps). But I had the game and the game was perfect. It didn't force you to buy shitey digital only products. It didn't have any restrictions on what you could and couldn't do by yourself. It was good.So in summary I hope the developers of OpenIV go on their own way go somewhere really remote and keep updating this or better yet target the core code of the game. If malicious intent was what they wanted to do they would have done it. If they wanted to destroy multiplayer they wouldn't have to because it's already ED. Get a grip Rockstar. You made this game stop hiding behind Take Two and actually grow a pair. Properly ashamed to even consider you guys a Scottish company. Get yer ing skirt in the bin and put on yer kilt. Yer no gonna do anything with yer baws held in a vice. Take Two can have their shitey reign over the lesser consoles. But PC's will last longer than any of that and if you think about it logically they're your most dedicated players. They'll be with you long after you're dead and rotting in a pit somewhere. Give respect to those who respect you. Console players don't have any respect for anything or anyone. PC gamers understand how difficult it is to do something on this platform but we also understand how easy some thing should be such as growing a pair.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar doesn't care about your consumer rights or the longevity of their game as made evident by their supression of single player mods. They also clearly don't care about anything but profit regarding their online service and the rampant use of multiplayer mods and hacks. Instead of targeting the actual problem and making their online service palatable they decided to try and reduce mod use to encourage buying their DLC and paid currency for GTA Online. GTA V *WAS* a great game but several years down the road you have to consider the way a game is supported or in this case isn't.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,First they let hackers ruin aspects of online play and now punish those who genuinely work hard to earn loads of cash by resetting everyone's wallet totals every now and then even though it could've been easily prevented. That in my eyes wasn't such a big deal as you can put money into cars boats weapons etc and resell them later for about 30% less but I think it's worth mentioning. I still despise the decision though as it is a major annoyance and the system doesn't even work as it revolves around just screwing over everyone who works hard aside from the hackers.Now the OpenIV group (basically responsible for nearly all SINGLEPLAYER mods associated with GTA V has been legally neutered and destroyed by Take 2.I gave this company $20 of my hard earned money (bought it on a sale).They responded by royally f***ing every online player solo player AND modder involved in this game.F*** this.Don't support a company who judging by their actions sees their player base as a pile of cash waiting to be drained.EDIT AS OF 7/6/2017 Rockstar has taken to conversing with the OpenIV team and has released a public statement indicating their support for singleplayer mods as well as reiterating their stance towards multiplayer modding (which is generally considered a bannable offense). I support Rockstar in making this respectable move but I still uphold my negative review due to the fact that the only reason Take Two responded the way they did was because they shot themselves in the foot in a way. Their CEO has not changed his position and the company has not changed their direction so this negative review still stands. Fantastic game great developers sh*tty head company.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-25,0,0,369,False,Recommended,While this game is controversial for many reasons it remains to this day as one of my favorite games. This is mostly due to the developers having so much detail in this game. If you look behind you in a car your characterlooks at the mirror. Flip flops flip and and flop. Speaking using the mic online makes your character move his mouth. Its the little things that make this game stand out. They also have a very intresting story. You understand where everyone is coming from. Franklin wants to grow up and make more money. Micheal just wants to have a nice retirement. Trevor is just crazy. You like everyone (except micheal because he lied to trevor and is an to his family) Its really great stuff The music and graphics are on point. The graphics are just fantastic. This game looks incredible even better then the consoles because you can run this game at a higher frame rate. It is very demanding but you can still play it on a low end card. This game also has so much veriaty in music its stupid. You got your rock your pop rap electronic latino you got everything except jazz classical ect. Gta 6 must include jazz or classical or else im downvoting it. Also the Driving in this game is very good almost to the point where you can call it a racer. Its a really good alternative to those racing games where it costs 60$ and all you do is race and nothing else. Terrible value. Online is so dence with activities that it almost feels like another game. Playing it for long enoght and recieving money in the millions you start feeling like a badass that wont take crap from others. You got your tank attack heli personal company minigun and just everything to make you feel like you own everything. Of course theres hackers but those are rare and that is why the exit botton was invented right? Tl DR Gta 5 is everything you can ask for. Its a racing game exploration game shooting game story driven game a yoga game. It has so much to say about our world today its almost a parody. and it is one of my favorite games.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Practices like this should not be tolerated and the backlash that TakeTwo is getting from this is very well deserved.As for my honest thoughts of the game I was able to get 200+ hours out of this game. The single player campaign is worth a playthrough but I've never been able to bring myself to do it again like with GTA San Andreas or GTA IV. GTA Online is an absolute trainwreck and TakeTwo's cash cow. You'll grind for hours sometimes days or weeks on end to get a new car or a bigger house. Shark Cards are a way that you can pay real world more for in my honest opinion disgustingly low amounts of in game currency for what you pay and how expensive everything is in the online mode. Hackers are everywhere and innocent people are consistently banned with no option for appeal while the real hackers run free.Story mode is 7/10 Decently fun and has a pretty good story.Online is a 2/10 You may find it fun for a bit but it quickly fades and it becomes a chore to do anything.EDIT Looks like TakeTwo has listened to the people are reversed their cease and desist of OpenIV.

2017-06-16,0,0,116,False,Recommended,"The following review has been edited to appropriately accomodate for the now resolved issue of mods being banned in GTAV and has been cautiously marked as positive. I hope this will shed light on recent events. // In June 14th of 2017 Take Two Interactive had issued a Cease &amp Desist order towards OpenIV a singleplayer only modding tool that allowed mods on games that used the RAGE Engine (e.g. GTAIV Max Payne 3 GTAV et al.) under the guise that it and I quote ""enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody."" Roughly a week or so later Rockstar Games claimed to have been ""working to figure out how (they) can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting (their) players"" and it was rumored that they were indeed in pseudo negotiations with OpenIV's creator Good NTS in order to achieve a perfect balance that benefitted both parties to a degree.On July 5th of 2017 Good NTS issued an official statement of his own to claim the return of OpenIV albeit with some caveats Map conversions from other games may not be allowed as modifications to Grand Theft Auto V meaning Liberty City V had to have been dropped. Just as well OpenIV will along with its original 'conditions' also abide by the recently created Rockstar Modding Policy (seen here https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/en us/articles/115009494848 ).Although ultimately GTAV will see a resurgence in SP Modding once more and its shelf life will be expanded again due to this there are things I would like to mention that are not directly related to this issue. Mods have been on companies' eyesights once more with this event Bethesda's 'Creation Club' and their... mess back in 2015 it seems as though companies will attempt to find a way to monetize something that had been existing since the dawn of PC gaming. And that is what concerns me the most...As for the game itself? If you've been a part of this debacle it's likely you purchased the PC version for modding as I have. Which means that you may have previously played it on a console and enjoyed it thoroughly! For those who haven't? It is a fine game with a good engaging story multiple playable protagonists on the same game/story (a series first). The horror stories of GTA Online (which still happened even in the OpenIV drought) had always cemented my PC purchase to be offline only. Should you venture yourself be prepared to find hackers with money drops and a skewed Real Money/GTAO Money economy with scales tipped heavily against the end user who needs to invest in Shark Cards massively before being allowed to enjoy one or two items from the Freemium DLC let alone all of them. If you really want to I'm sure there are alternatives for online. FiveM is one of these alternatives using a more 'traditional' online system. // The original review is placed here for posteriority and archival purposes // Take Two issued a Cease &amp Desist towards OpenIV the modding tool for singleplayer and singleplayer alone under the guise that it and I quote ""enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody."" Furthermore they're claiming that they are ""working to figure out how (they) can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting (their) players.""tl dr a BS excuse with no good reason just so Take Two can attempt to push forward paid mods for GTAV or any new release titles. First Bethesda's Creation Club and now this? Bit too big of a coincidence.From this day forward my money will not go towards any Take Two or Rockstar release until this is PROPERLY fixed.",Grand Theft Auto V

The game has so many fun things and events to do Online. I recommend getting this game. The thing that I really hate about this game though is the fact of how the banning system works this new system is a little too much I mean the 3 strike older system was better instead of this first time a 30 day ban and all data reset for online and the second a permanent ban.

2017-06-15,0,0,921,False,Recommended,GTA 5 was a great game the single player is amazing and most of all fun. Online has alot of really fun things to do but the short commings are becoming more and more of an issue. Alot of the content they add has the potentail to be great but potentail isn't what the players play. Alot of the missions designed for CEO BIkers Bunkers are designed so poorly. It's either really simple point to point in any vehicle or indefensible making players split up and deliver 4 of the slowest unarmored vehicles across the city. When your in a lobby where other players don't pay attention to you the missions are at most just boring. On the other extreme when players do pay attention to you it's almost laughable how easy it is for them to destroy you. I'll give them some credit now the new gunrunning missions are more ballanced because the vehicles given now have some sort of way to defend themselves. The games fun with friends when your only playing to play the game (no goals no focus on money). It's so anoying that the game is becoming more tainted with the goal of griding money for the next shiny thing that people are missing out on the fun.My rating is going to be negative because of the newest can of t about making modding singleplayer Illegal.

2017-07-08,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,Where to begin...This review will mainly focus on the online portion of this game. If your intent is to play offline disregard everything I'm about to say. In my opinion there is not a single enjoyable aspect of this game that cannot be experienced in the single player game mode.I hesitate to call GTA V Online a pay to win game. Although you may certainly pay your way into more online cash to spend there is no winning to be had. It is not possible to win at a rigged game. Rigged how? Why by all of the hackers of course! One game you may be killed dozens of times by an explosion under your feet which acts as a ranged spawn camping device. Another you may open your inventory to find millions of dollars not earned but given to you by your modding benefactor. The online portion of this game is simply a cesspool of hackers modders and cheats. The very first online job I queued up for was one of the Dawn Raid missions. These are basically team oriented shootouts with an objective to find a transmitter and get to the extraction point while holding it. The first round was quite enjoyable there were multiple back and forths between the two teams but we were narrowly defeated in a multiway shootout inside the extraction zone. At the start of the next round all of our parachutes were locked up in mid flight and we plummeted to our deaths. Upon respawning inside of the plane we were all greeted with our old firend Spawn Camping Explosion. While the hacker ran the transmitter both teams ended up dying on repeat for the next 4 minutes or so. I ended up being 0 13 by the end of the round while everyone else from my team had left around death 5 or 6(which is penalized btw).From my experience with the game I would say you have about a 50% chance of encountering a hacker each time you enter an online server. I experienced less of this in missions but would still give it a 10 20% chance. If you don't mind waiting at the ridiculously long loading screens to switch servers and don't mind leaving missions when a hacker is present maybe this won't bother you as much.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,180,False,Recommended,So all in all GTA is a great game not amazing in any way but an improvement to the last gta game. I personally prefer saints row when it comes to the story as it tends to be a lot more humorous and entertaining. That being said GTA's story is decent not amazing in any way and you can pretty much tell where it's going at any given time it does however manage to keep your attention for moderately long periods of time and has some moments squeezed in with a bit of sarcasm and humor. Gameplay wise it's pretty good none of the features are as fleshed out as they could be and especially not vehicle handling and physics. (then again saints row is absolutely terrible when it comes to vehicle physics) The game in itself is fun but graphics are already getting a little dated with very obvious repetitive textures and foliage that was designed for consoles. So for the singleplayer bit it really isn't worth the price tag.The multiplayer bit it's pretty much like APB with a different system for unlocking weapons and vehicle mods. It quickly gets repetitive when playing by yourself however having a few friends along makes all the difference in the world and opens up a whole new layer of shenanigans. (This could similarly be said for APB but GTA is a lot more optimized and offers a wider range of activities to take part in) The customization is a little lacking humorous in character creation though. That being said there is a distinct lack of clothing options/hairstyles to make your character look truly unique. This is very apparent when looking at the female player models (Although there is a very large amount of makeup so kudos on that one) where most players with a female character tend to look very similar when it comes to hairstyles and clothing. There are also quite a bit of apparent bugs as you play through it some even game breaking (Looking at you Tennis minigame) Although I have mostly played the multiplayer by myself due to the fact that a lot of the random encounters of players seem to be 14 year old asshats. There are some who aren't but what do you really expect when playing a GTA game? Singleplayer 7/10Multiplayer 6/10Yes I rate games VERY harshly. The score for the multiplayer might go up with a bit more social interaction and shenanigans.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's been pretty cool to see the games progress they almost seem to benchmark large strides in technology. This latest installment has been no let down with the new story mechanics and expanded activities throughout the city the single player game is an instant classic.I can't say that I like every aspect of the multiplayer some parts were definitely fun plus it's multiplayer GTA! What's not to love?Well it seemed a bit overdone at times.. Social Club was never my favorite thing who likes more passwords? Online seems like less of an option and more of an intrusion. Especially when a loading screen takes so long to get through if you mistakenly switched to online mode get ready to wait... It's still enjoyable and programming is never easy so all in all I should just be happy that it works. It does seem a bit overdone though.Did I mention it looks gorgeous... That's running on nearly the lowest graphics settings on my laptop make sure your drivers are up to date by the way...If you've got a good rig for it it's absolutely stunning.

With that freedom comes the openness of the game to create and use mods. Take Two has removed the ability to use mods in single player.

2017-06-16,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,Let me apologize up front. This will be a tldr for most of you but I need to say it.GTA V is a good game made by a very talented developer. Moreover it's an exceptional PC port. It scales well with a wide variety of hardware and both of the major graphics vendors are equally catered to. I've stated in other forums that GTA V is the bar by which all PC ports should be measured.....but! While I understand and appreciate the distinction between developer and publisher they are representative of one another and there is such a thing as guilt by association. That's why parents always warn their kids to be careful of the company that they keep. So I'm sorry Rockstar but you're getting thrown into this too because frankly your silence on the matter is just a damning as Take Two's actions.Through the years my general impression of Rockstar and Take Two's attitude towards gamers and the PC gaming community in particular is apathetic at best and in some cases downright hostile. Be it their abysmal customer service banning of players through no fault of their own or their general inability or more accurately unwillingness to release timely PC ports (I know I know your meager 1.78 billion in net revenue in the previous fiscal year just isn't enough to afford the extra talent it would take to get it done) Suffice to say their reputation as a customer oriented company isn't the best in the business. The recent actions against OpenIV is merely the proverbial straw on the camel's back for this particular consumer.As a long time fan of your games I've personally purchased numerous copies of many of your games across a variety of platforms. GTA IV Xbox 360 PS3 and PC. GTA V PS3 Xbox One PS4 and PC. I've also spent over $200 on in game currency for the PS4 version. So you can call me a lot of things but you can't call me cheap.I've actively advocated against used games sales for many years now. I personally believe that if a developer makes a quality product then they should be rewarded for doing so. In my opinion used games sales work against that notion so I have to the best of my ability avoided them. (I currently own 3 to be exact and I only own those because at the time of purchase new retail copies were no longer commercially available.) So though it pains me to say it I will to the greatest of my ability work tirelessly to see to it that you never...NEVER receive any monetary compensation via new game purchases or in game content from me going forward. When RDR 2 launches I will buy it and I will play it but you can rest assured that even if I have to pay $70 six months after launch just to get a used copy I will do so gladly before I support a company who treats the communities that support them with such blatant disregard.Sincerely Disenchanted Customer,Grand Theft Auto V

Maybe at $20 but that's still pushing it.Pros + fairly well built world+ good number of little details for world building+ large open world+ decent story and charactersNeutral little detail in the world most weapons feel extremely similar most vehicles feel very similar physics aren't very goodNegative progression is slow very little depth to characters or world (similar reactions from everyone AI is pretty bad) the grind is fairly bad loading times are absolutely horrible even loading from an SSD ONLINEThe online portion of the game (which is being pushed heavily right now) is horrible. There are long loading screens everywhere trolls who want to do nothing but kill you repeatedly are the main players in lobbies and hackers are rampant. All of the interesting things they've added in the online mode aren't made available in singleplayer either. The final nail in the coffin for online is that the grind is insane. For example to gain access to CEO jobs you need about 3 million dollars. To get that much you can do heists or jobs which net you very little money and often rely on the good nature of other players for you to succeed. It's a simple case where those who've played more and have better equipment can just stop you from progressing at any sort of meaningful pace. Of course you can just pay huge amounts in the form of microtransactions in order to skip some of the grind.Something that I bought this game for which I had hoped would massively improve the quality of the game was modding. However with Take Two's current stance on any sort of modding this isn't likely at all. If you want a fun open world game I'd recommend any of the Saints Row series or even Watch_Dogs instead.

2016-11-24,0,0,1092,False,Not Recommended,"Being a loyal fan of the series and R* I feel disappointed in what has been happening to this game recently. After getting millions and millions of whatever currency you feel like using in ROI you might think that R* after all these years of selling the game and other relevant items (sharkcards) might actually stop the blatant money grab politics and think about what the players want. That's where you're wrong.They haven't for a minute stopped thinking about that and now completely gave in to this ridiculous system of dripfeeding content and manipulating game files (changing the downforce figures in certain cars) in order for the players to catch the bait and spend some real life currency on this game. DLC after DLC the prices for new stuff seem to rocket up to the Moon and beyond while the payout people get are not proportionally matched at all.In the recent example (Smuggler's Run DLC) you essentially will have content worth of $60 000 000 (!!!!!!!) whilst the payout you get for completing tedious deliveries stays at the level of what was relevant 3 years ago ($10 000 per mission)!!! If you politicize the situation you will have a clear example of ""oppressive"" dripfeeding. And I will not even say anything about the lack any sort of content for the single mode.The content that gets released gets more ridiculous time after time soon enough and we will be riding pink unicorns that drop a barrage of homing explosive sh*tbombs on people!!! It's like I'm playing Saints Row V and that isn't even a game yet!!!!Anyway hopefully Rockstar starts listening to its fanbase because as of now it seems they really don't give a damn about what we think.

2017-07-04,0,0,706,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is a beautifull work of art. Optimized to the assembly level to give even old/potato PCs a chance to run this baby at FPS and graphical levels above console peasants (sorry had to take a jab there XD). The story is incredible the world is absolutely stunning the characters are (mostly) deep and make sense and there are countless refrences to pop culture and 4th wall braking gallore (if you pay attention).The online part isn't that great there really isn't much to do besides f**k around with your buddies and do repetitive missions and races untill you get so bored that you start finding races with loop de loops and that other BS fun. The only redeeming aspect of Online are the heists those are quite fun but again there are only a handfull (5 or 6 I believe?).But it cannot go without mentioning that Take2 (and Rockstar to a smaller extent) is milking the Online cow waaaaaaaaaay too far. The Shark cards and the micro transactions are plain cash grabs and just add inflation to the game which in part makes making money a grind if you don't want to spead REAL money. Ugh _ 'Of course I get that this was the most expensive game ever to develop and they are a business so they have to make ends meet but after almost 4 years on the market still being sold for only 17% less than original price (without sales of course) you'd think that they might not need to resort to greedy (and unnecesary) cash grabs to fill their $$$ quotas. There is just no excuse for such greediness.Oh and let's not forget about the massive neon pink elephant in the room the Cease and Desist given by Take2 o OpenIV. It's another case of a big company waving their mone d**k around intimidating the little guys and ultimately affecting the end user. Even though they apologized it's just more evidence that they don't care about the user and only see them as a $ with legs. Scummy.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,0,0,298,False,Not Recommended,This game is pretty good overall. Graphics map size etc. However I cannot give this a recommendation as I feel that Rockstar has completely neglected the single player aspect of this game in an attempt to force players to go online onto their hacker populated servers. Just seems like a massive cash grab. There has not been a single SP dlc release (Which I would have even paid for so it's not like I expected a free expansion).I can't recommend for the sole fact that I feel if I did Rockstar would take that as confirmation that GTA V Online is a success. It's not at least for me. And honestly with every site that I've seen GTA online has received a lot of flak for nonstop hackers. the fact that if you want to have anything decent you are essentially forced to buy a shark card or spend ridiculous amounts of hours to buy a single car which isn't for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-10,0,0,403,False,Not Recommended,This is kind of a mixed bag for me. So lets cover the reason why I gave this a thumbs down. The Good Amazing Single Player Looks AmazingAlright Multiplayer The Bad Multiplayer Unlike past GTA games. This one has a big focus for multiplayer. It has good core gameplay and is enjoyable with friends but there are a number of issues with it. Everything costs a fortune! You will spend hours upon hours of grinding your off just to get enough money to buy a plane. If you up and buy the wrong thing there is no way to refund that cash. In a DLC they gave us Yachts as an option for a mobile off land home. Only problem with yachts is they cost minimum 6 Million Dollars for just a basic one and up to around 11 Million for the best option. To get the basic yacht without using shark cards it took longer than 3 days of me playing just to get one. If you want to use shark cards to get a yacht the 8 Million Dollar (Highest Amount you can Buy) is 100 ing Dollars. To top it all off. The game is poorly balanced all around if you just want to play by yourself the lobbies take far too long to load if you want to organize a heist or a mission it takes forever and if someone leaves while your in a heist the game will fail. If you don't have any friends to play with this complete part of the game is Modding Most players who bought the PC version of GTA V already owned the game on console. Why? Because modding. Modding is a huge thing it allows players to make the game whatever they want to make of it and improve the experience. Rock Star and Take Two have deemed modding illegal for this game as of recently and now a lot of people feel screwed over. Yes people were using the modding in Online mode. But perhaps instead of doing this. include a method where if the game detects any sort of invalid file in the game when going online. Just make it crash. Some mods even had this feature. Optimization I did say this was fine. But my friend who bought this game had more than the required specs but the game continued to crash for him. I've also had a lot of weird lag and my pc will gain more than +20 Deg C. When playing. It is optimized pretty alright but it could be better. Weird Bugs that come and go from time to time Rockstar somtimes s up the patches causing a lot of problems. For instance for at least 3 months Rockstar made it impossible to fly using the mouse forcing players to use a controller or god forbid the numpad. Demo Lots of games have been dropping demos. While this a mostly minor nitpick. For a game like GTA V that has a lot requirements. It would be great to see if my game could actually run the game before getting it. Single Player DLC While other games in the GTA series had a long and amazing story. This one was kind of short. Rockstar employees even said that there would be a Single Player DLC years ago. But it has gone forgotten. I myself am mostly a singleplayer gamer so this is sad to see. END Overall Rockstar needs to fix a lot about this game before I can rate it positive. Some of these things include Lowering the in game prices or the cost to buy Shark Cards Improve Lobbies Improve Heist Games possibly have it so that if someone leaves a bot is placed there instead. Wouldn't it be great to have Micheal Trevor or Franklin join you on your heists if you can't find any players or if someone leaves? Instead of holding your game hostage while you wait? Give back Modding. If your scared of modding add in more methods to prevent modding online. Optimize the game better or give us different specs. Give us a Demo to see if we can actually run the game. Give us more options for single players. Possibly add in the online contact for singleplayer.Overall It's a really good single player game. But the Online mode (Which is the main focus) Needs a lot of work to even be playable.,Grand Theft Auto V

I personally do not take kindly to a publisher attacking it. OLD It appears Rockstar talked with take two and single player modding is back. Good on Rockster changing my previous negative review to positive. The game itself is incredibly fun in single player. However the multiplayer is all Rockstar cares about now and Shark Cards (real life $ for in game $) are ll that matters. However free updates make me a little happier about it. The racing is incredibly fun and the business ventures are good time wasters.

2017-06-15,0,0,501,False,Not Recommended,Recently Rockstar decided to remove vast amounts of money from people's accounts because they felt that these people had 'too much money to not be hacked in'. Of course a huge amount of these people had gotten their money legit or even from Shark Cards (Rockstar's microtransactions for in game money). I had around $300 million removed from my account and I am far from innocent. I hacked in almost all of my money because if I'm being totally honest the game is more fun that way. It is designed to be a grind so you buy shark cards and that system is inherently limiting in a game that has historically been about having no limits. I still have well over $100 million and that is enough to buy anything I want in game whenever I want for months to years depending on how often I play. So I'm exactly the kind of person that Rockstar was trying to punish with this 'money wipe' yet I've not been punished because of the complete lack of effort required to get that money in the first place. But they have successfully punished potentially thousands of players that are completely innocent. If that injustice isn't worthy of a negative review then I don't know what is.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-12,0,0,604,False,Not Recommended,"At the moment I'm conflicted on the game.Grand Theft Auto V is in my opinion a huge step up from IV at least up until about the time Import/Export came out. The story was fun to say the least and kept me active for a while when it comes to single players it was fairly long compared to a lot of others and also depending on how you played it. One thing I didn't like about it was that the actual story only was about 70% of the whole single player I really wish they would have added more story missions and less ""Strangers and Freaks"" missions because those feel like more of a chore than fun.To put it simply GTA Online WAS half decent at one time but the Shark Cards are what's killing it. The best you can hope for out of the best paying heist on the hardest difficulty is maybe $200k which sounds like a lot but the cheapest apartment you can host a heist from is just over $200k lowriders can easily stack up to over a million (the ""upgrade"" to being able to modify it to be a lowrider is about $325k alone much less the other upgrades) medium high end super cars cost from about $2m and all the vehicles buildings et cetera from Import/Export alone at their higher end rack up to about $33m.That means if you do a good heist and get $200k you have to do that heist 165 times which would take about 247 330 hours if you're lucky. That's ing ridiculous.Alternatively you could take the easy route and chimp out for shark cards but you get no experience doing so and basically you're just going to do it again when the next DLC that comes out needs $33m to own all the good Now you don't need to own anything in fact the only person I know who is a multi millionaire in the game and has done it all without shark cards and without exploits has done so by never owning a vehicle and just stealing them never owning apartments and just joining heists and jobs as crew never owning a business and just working for some (which will be covered below) and basically pooling all his money just to have it and he's been doing this since it first came out on PS3. He has $30m. That is ing ridiculous for a game where you're supposed to be doing this high level crime like robbing banks and breaking people out of prison it takes nearly four years of owning NOTHING and playing the game to earn $30m that is ridiculous. (Now he doesn't play like dedicated he plays other games and I certainly wouldn't say he plays GTA the most but with that money you could only buy and fully upgrade a handful of vehicles much less the higher end things like yachts).You could also be an employee for a ""company"" where you will get pay for the in game economy. It's not worth doing and doesn't always end up with getting money at all. I was helping clear a garage of cars for a friend we lost everything because some in an Mi 24 blew us up for absolutely no reason whatsoever.Players have no true incentive to leaving other players alone. I can't simply drive down the street without getting shot at and you might say ""enable passive mode"" but ing listen to yourself. This is GTA there shouldn't even be a ing pasive mode not to mention passive mode cucks you big time. The money incentive to being decent to other players and not killing on sight isn't worth it you could make more killing players in the same amount of time. The whole ""you have to pay for destroying someone's personal vehicle"" thing is also not much of a drawback as if you run out of money you just don't have to ing pay it. If I have $50 dollars in the game I can go around and destroy other people's vehicles for no reason without any consequence whatsoever because you don't have to pay when you're at $0.You'd think with that being said Rockstar would add in something that kind of makes players think twice about messing with other players wouldn't you? Well they did the exact ing opposite. Being a CEO or a biker gang leader or doing any of the missions that you HAVE TO PLAY IN AN OPEN LOBBY puts a massive ing target on you because you're basically told ""hey uh this guy is trying to grind out cash go ruin that for him"".The online lobbies are cancerous the community is garbage people will join heists as randoms and leave for no reason or rage out or do like run you over in a heist and cause you to lose on purpose. The chat is literal AIDs I don't know about the voice chat because I turned it off as soon as I started playing know that it would most likely be a hemorrage in the form of sound. People will see you in an ammunation or in an LS customs and place mines outside so you instantly die when you come out and it seems like every other person drives a ing kuruma or an insurgent two basically bullet proof (the later being explosion proof) cars which still baffles me why they were sold to people just to use and not just be in heists. But that's not the worst part of all the online ""experience"" (I say experience in the same way Syphillus is an experience) no the worst part are the newest DLC.The ing rocket bike which is stupidly OP as a vehicle the APC with the stupidly fast missiles the unique upgrades for weapons you only get with a multi million dollar bunker which include things like explosive ammunition and thermal optics for snipers the ability to just call a wanted level away for basically no cost the fact you can hire a private army to hunt down one person or have an escort helicopter and not to mention the iest AI in the world.I'd like to end this on a story. I was driving my car actually normally because I didn't want to ram into anything I was just driving around because it was the middle of summer and I had nothing to do but listen to Self Radio in the car and drive around.I was in a solo session in GTA online and I was driving on the outer most lane on the correct side of the street when a car FROM THE OTHER ING LANE SWERVES RIGHT INTO ME NO TURN THERE IT WAS A STRAIGHT ING ROAD DOUBLE YELLOW LINES AND EVERYTHING SWERVED RIGHT ING INTO ME.The AI is ing horrendous.I wanted the last thing to be ""why rockstar why?"" but I know why we all know why the whole online experience of this game is to grab as much money as ing possible and it's going to be like that forever now Rockstar is basically going to be known for shelling out t on a fake silver platter so they can grab money.oh yeah and take two",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-17,0,0,342,False,Recommended,GTA V is atleast from my head...the funniest gta game in the series i have played. I think i have completed the entire game atleast 15 or 16 times in periods with 69 missions of the story. I have gotten the chance to see the Ufos in the game seeing a ghost drived crazy insanely with car played with the cops of speedrun hunting...yeah the game doesnt need more content it could be alot more (gory) when I speak of blood effects...i mean that by when you shoot anyone in the game....that must be the most non realistic effect of blood i Have seen inside a game ever. The driving is the easiest driving of all car games i have touched its easy to get control with cars in gta v....and they are fast and fun to experiment with in garages where you can upgrade cars to be more dangerous with speed. Online part is not interesting at all because i feel i get alot out of the game simply by going through the main story and try to complete those missions in a pro way,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-02,0,0,337,False,Not Recommended,Really fun game to play. I rather enjoyed the story line aswell as having the option to play as 3 character i feel that gives alot to a game rather than being locked to one character. I do have to say though it would be nice if they added this feature into Gta 6 but aswell as having a female protagonist. The online side of things is really fun love the fact they release new content such as new cars clothing and apartments. The main drawback is the fact you get alot of hackers in the game which brings this game to a complete negative. Im at the point of where im quitting playing it for that reason seems that hackers have a way of getting you involved aswell when you havent done anything wrong. Its not a fair policy and its not worth the risk playing online due to this unless your going to solo or play with friends you trust.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,77,False,Recommended,Welp it looks like OpenIV is back from the dead and as a result I take back my earlier statement about never touching this game again. Hopefully Take Two learned from this farce and will stop trying to criminalize the modding community. Even if they do change for the better however I shall still leave my original review below as a reminder of what has happened. Although this situation has been resolved it must not be forgotten. ORIGINAL REVIEW I enjoyed this game not for its story or the online gameplay but because of the hilarious antics and challenges only possible through the use of mods and since Take Two Interactive has essentially banned these mods I no longer have a reason to play this game. I wish I could get a refund but alas I simply played too long. I can say with full confidence that I am never touching this game again.,Grand Theft Auto V

If rockstar doesn't like the concept of mods (even if it's in singleplayer) then you should accept it. Rockstar is trying to stop people that use mods in multiplayer to get stuff like money en rp so what's the first thing they could do shut down openIV (a program that let's you use mods in GTA V).

2017-06-18,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,Creative community for this game has pretty much been shot in the head and dumped into a mass grave courtesy of Rockstar. I get it. I used trainers i deserved to be banned evil scum etc. But there is no option for those of us that do want to cheat to do it outside of official servers. Rockstar has not implemented non anticheat servers and every attempt at 3rd party projects have either been shut down witha cease and desist or are probably going to be eventually. The best way to describe Rockstar and Take Two? Reverse Bethesda. Games like Skyrim Fallout etc. encourage creative development while Rockstar and Take Two froth at the mouth whenever support for 3rd party content is considered. Rockstar have been pandering to everyone who gets money rained down on them by banning all 3rd party content and tools under the sun. Somehow they managed to completely off both non cheating players looking for a good experience and 3rd party content creators looking to make the game different and better and sometimes both. About the hackers Rockstar has been trashing their own community to kill? Still there strong as ever. Good job Rockstar. This is the part where i tell you that i won't buy anything from you ever again unless you fix this and embrace your community but....1 Your never going to change Rockstar and Take Two. Stay classy2.

2017-06-18,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,"Well I suppose since everyone else is reviewing it poorly I should jump on and say some things too. Now before I begin I must say that I actually enjoyed GTA V back in the day. Back when it was first out on consoles my friends and I would hop online and play some online multiplayer. Then when nobody else was online I'd play the story and oh boy did I enjoy the story. The story in my eyes is such an interesting tale that it deserves your upmost attention. For those who don't know it features three main characters who pull off heists and other criminal jobs. In most of the missions you get to control two or even all three characters. This allows a very fun gameplay experience as you can switch between these characters fast and with ease. Now the story alone sounds like a blast but this game has one more component that ultimately ruins this game and that's online. Online sounded so promising! You and your friends could take to the streets of Los Santos and do various missions races and fun gamemodes. They even promised heists just like in the story. For starters heists weren't placed into the game for a very long time but at least we got races and various missions. But those were limited. There was only a handful of missions before you had to grind them just to get guns and planes and cars even an apartment. Online started to get more and more bad with each passing day. Soon enough joining an online game meant either getting killed constantly by randoms or getting killed by hackers all while racial and sexist slurs are thrown at you. Online devolved into this toxic community where you couldn't get anything done or just have some fun. Pretty soon Rockstar started pushing out FREE updates. This is a godsend! Free updates hear we come! Except...they were Sure we got new cars new houses/apartments new boats and new planes but there was one glaring problem. They all costed way too much in game money. The only way to afford these new big boy toys was to either grind missions until sunrise or buy sharkcards. Sharkcards allow you to use real world money to buy in game money which seems fine at first but it gets worse. The updates started to roll out more and more fun vehicles that were locked behind ridiculous amounts of money. Every update the prices for the newly introduced vehicles rose. So it was either grind for about a week and get one new vehicle or buy a sharkcard. This became a problem as you had to keep buying sharkcards over and over just to keep up and get the new content. They also released these online only supply running missions where you and your crew drive some supplies to a warehouse and eventually sell it while people try to attack your shipment. The problem with that is how almost everyone in online is a total and will just destroy your shipment for no reason. You get the supplies you die. You get them again and you die again. They released more and more updates around this concept but it just doesn't work at all considering online is filled with ruiners of fun. They just released another update very similar to this concept which doesn't help Rockstar at all. But TakeTwo Rockstar's parent company decided to really dig their grave. They sent a cease and desist to OpenIV a tool which lets you mod GTA V and thus they had to take it down. This for me is what ticked me off. They just openly shut down modding with almost no warning whatsoever. They completely ruined the game with their ""free updates"" and now they really ruined it. With all that said I do not recommend this game for $60 or really any price at all. Rockstar only cares about the money they earn from online that they don't cater to others. They still have yet to released a singleplayer DLC which was promised a couple of years back. Innocent people are getting banned left and right for no reason while cheaters still lurk in the online mode. This game does not deserve your time especially not the online mode. The story is really good but only enjoyable till you 100% it. Then you can't really do anything else considering you can't mod it anymore. This game is not worth $60 or even $20. Oh how the mighty have fallen.",Grand Theft Auto V

They try to look like they care and they probably do but they messed up. They need to develop better ways to filter the online mods rather than take down an innocent program for people like me who want to do Police RP with LS and LCPDFR. LCPDFR is probably one of the only reasons people buy GTA IV anymore.

The Singleplayer story is amazing and I easily have 200 hours across all platforms for it it will last you a while and is generally exciting and interesting. The Online support is also very well done it will provide lots of stuff to do and in all sorts of different ways. The hacking problem is beginning to disappear the most common thing now is the use of trainers that allow people to give themselves weapons vehicles and other features however this is much less of a problem than it has been in the past.My only problem with GTA Online is the money wh*ring techniques of Rockstar this is mainly done by making things almost too expensive to own without the use of their micro transactions in the form of 'Shark Cards' although it is possible to bypass this by grinding heists one after the other.Overall I would highly recommend this game not only to you but also your friends as I have never really got bored of it and when I have had enough just wait a few weeks and there will be a new update with new missions races vehicles etc. Yes it is a bit expensive but nonetheless it's a great game and has given me hours of fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,52,False,Recommended,"I'm willing to bet that roughly 90% of the negative reviews are negative because ""eye h8 maenstreem"".Being able to say that this is the first ever GTA I've ever completed the story in doesn't sum up my satisfaction. I really loved this game. The story I thought was pretty deep connecting all of the characters in some fashion or another and creating bonds and divides all across the board. Compared to the other titles' stories...Some Russian's cousin who is inherently supposed to just kill people... V is a winner. Characters are unique so very interesting. Franklin is a young man from the hood trying to work his way up in the crime world Michael is a ""retiree"" from running big time heists with family issues from hell Trevor is the meth head that people put in commercials to scare people. Somehow they're all supposed to work together. Somehow it works out perfectly. Heists oh my God heists. Some of the side missions can get a little grindy but when the ""H"" word got thrown out there I kept noticing quittin' time to be later and later. While the heists take a good bit longer to put together once it starts happening every second of it is intense and in no way repetitive. Visuals... I could take up a whole paragraph for this one but just about every other review covers it. Me gusta. Downsides? All I can think of is maybe some of the side missions being a little bit grindy and not enough heists but that's me being critical.All in all just as with all GTA games there is a lot of satirical humor in every detail from the radio to the advertisements on the benches. I didn't feel like any shortcuts were taken in any aspect of creating this game. GTA V is worth every last penny I paid for it and I haven't even gotten on the multiplayer game yet. Still sitting on the fence? Stop. There aren't any unbearable Russian accents to listen to or any odd obligations period.

After this the community exploded and began review bombing the game so R* and T2 would reverse the situation and it did. R* tried to convince T2 to bring back OpenIV and don't intervene with Single Player modding and thus bringing back OpenIV and all of its mods.So yeah thanks for all who participated and a big f*** you for those who defended T2's actions (hope they wake up from those dreams about shark cards).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-22,0,0,287,False,Not Recommended,Originally I had positively rated this game but I didn't take into consideration the cancer that is GTA Online. The servers are rarely fully functional and when they are they're full of russians. Also the community for this game is terrible and Rockstar has done nothing to discourage players from mindlessly killing and destroying other players' property. So pretty much when you get in a GTAO lobby you kill everyone on sight because your head is on the chopping block from the time you exit your home. There are also a lot of modders but I think GTA has bigger fish to fry. The community really ruins the online experience of this game. No cooperation no teamwork no friendly players and no consideration of ever not killing everyone on sight. You constantly have to recover your vehicles from the insurance people who don't even pick up their phone half of the time. And then you have to retrieve it only to have it blown up immediately after. Its a continous cycle of everyone killing everything and its not fun for either party. If you're buying it for the single player experience then that's good for you but don't buy it for the online. You'll be very dissapointed.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm only saying that because almost every GTA I have played has been great. As far as Grand Theft Auto 5 goes everything is possible. Open world? Great! Concept? Amazing and always has been! Characters? Nothing short of cool! I played this on my Xbox One for a long time until I lost the game so I decided to buy it once again for the Steam Summer Sale. It was 40% off and I knew I wasn't going to find a better offer than that untill another sale arrives. It was 100% worth the buy. GTA 5 is one of those games where I can say ""That makes so much sense as to why they are making so much money"". Despite this being a very popular opinon Grand Theft Auto 5 it one of the best games to come out in the past 5 years for sure. Overall very fun to play.9/10",Grand Theft Auto V

Of course there is one more thing. GTA 5 is good but I like many other bought this game for its online version that stole my heart and maybe it doesn't have a lot of updates it has some major bugs and annoys with some random small things but still. It is great. When i talk about small things I point not that many abilities to sell or remove things. Ok cars system is very good but what we can say about our apartments we can't sell them even when we are CEO and don't need all those 6 houses which make it a little annoying to choose cars another thing is about weapons 16 melee weapons you need to scroll to get to your choice of course they made lockers for it but it only works in freemode. And the biggest one is the ""phone calls"" options imagine when you're in the middle of the fight and some NPC calls you to tell you you need to visit him but you never did and will... Those phone calls can appear very often.Other than that this game rules and I wont stop playing it any time soon )",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,0,0,481,False,Recommended,Wow. That pretty much sums it up thus far. I was considering buying a console just for this game (and a few others) when it was released but I am glad that I just waited for the PC edition especially considering all of the hiccups that GTA Online had on console. I am a little over an hour into the story mode and so far this is one of the most impressive and downright awe inspiring games I have played in quite some time. The graphics are absolutely stunning and there is a level of detail that few other games have accomplished and this is the first GTA game that you actually feel like you are in a thriving bustling city. The gameplay and combat feels natural and fluid and while there are a multitude of different ways to approach combat they keep it simple as far as controls go. The driving physics are great especially compared to the 'boat cars' in GTA IV. All in all this is a must have game (especially if you are a fan of the GTA franchise) and anyone that enjoys action games will love this. I have a feeling that all the other games in my Steam library are going to be neglected over the next few weeks as this game is taking the front seat for now. Couldn't be happier!,Grand Theft Auto V

For the 500 hours I spent on this game I grinded my off to save up $15 million. Then a online modder started a lobby wide money drop I had no control of the situation so I stopped whatever I was doing and recorded and screen shoted in case I will be wrongfully accused. Few days later (when gun running launched) my money got reset including all of my grind money. So I sent a ticket to the support took a while to write a very polite and thorough detail of everthing it was 4 paragraphs long. Also included the recording and 4 screen shot pictures. I clearlly stated that I acknowledge that I have taken modded money and why it is wrong but I also added that I never wanted the modded money in the first place and the attached files proves it so I would like my grind money back.Turns out they replied a pre written response that talks about modded money and why it is wrong which I litterally said in the ticket. They don't need to tell me why it is wrong I already know why! I swear R* probably never read beyond my first sentance. Horrible customer service never knew they would treat a very loyal dedicated player like me this horribly.,Grand Theft Auto V

Well Rock* ruined the multiplayer by making everything astronomicly expensive and turning this game into a pay to win. I have never bought a shark card and I never will becuase I have given this company 240 of my dollars. And Now take 2 screwed me out of the only other part of the game i enjoyed after beating the campain 4 times.

You are starved for control lunatic cashed up board members who know about as much about coding as a preschooler playing numbers up on mum's work laptop. What a disapointing display from Take Two. These people work long and hard on these creations often studying the craft of coding to become proficient in their mods and you crush their efforts with a need for control? Sure paid mods are sucky and Bethesda has copped flak for that but atleast they are embracing their fans culture and what they want to see. Take Two you are purposely destroying this content for no other reason that wanting to be the big kid on the playground. Take solace in the fact that while my friends can't play their iron man vs war machine mod in GTA V you're allowing Джон Смит to run around turn people into whales and shoot money from his star spangled bellend.

2017-03-14,0,0,240,False,Recommended,"The GTA series is my all time favourite gaming series expotentially getting stronger after GTA III. This game has the regularlities needed to be a great GTA game however it's not as perfect as I expected espeically with the lack of online enjoyment that required $$$ if you wanted to do anything of new value. Although this game was great I did feel however that getting on the hype train before release did have it's downsides such as cutting short the enjoyment factor of the game after release. It felt somewhat short of my expectations I had during the hype train before release. I know I'm only talking about the negatives but for a GTA it's still of excellent play/replay value. The majority of the game the storyline the mechanics and the soundtrack I found all in a positive light however certain issues I believe needed to be fixed to suit the games overall emphasise on replayablity. The police we're somewhat annoying espeically with there driving mechanics (constantly tailing you while you drive following your every turn 1 shot K/Os shooting a silenced weapon in the middle of the desert somehow got you notoriety). The online missions we're quite difficult to complete for beginners on solo/2 player levels and we're quite repetitive (go to location kill guys take drugs/money/truck go to next location done). Other than that and costly online mode (if you want to get the"" bigs cool toys"" you'll need to spend atleast a couple of $100AUD on Shark Cards) the game was still on par with other GTAs.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-31,0,0,321,False,Recommended,I won't lie GTA V is a superb game! The singleplayer has definitely been one of the best experiences I have ever had in gaming. Its literally jaw dropping to see how much detail there is in Los Santos. It feels like a living and breathing city! I really liked the story and cared about all three characters when times got tough for them. The online component is also very good with loads of heists races and other missions to play with your friends. Be warned though since the game uses matchmaking you will have quite a few connectivity issues. Also you cannot deny that there is a giant amount of hackers in the game. It won't be a problem if you just prefer friend only sessions so you can play with your friends but you will definitely suffer if you want to play with random people. Overall I must say I had tons of fun with this game so I can't not recommend it. You might want to wait until Rockstar actually takes the hacker problem a little more seriously however.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-31,0,0,200,False,Recommended,Single player Amazing 10/10 The atmosphere and story are both top notch. You can tell R* put a lot of work into crafting the city. The characters are great (fleshed out stereotypes) and the graphics look amazing as well.Online So so 4/10 The world is identical to the story mode so it's great and I created a character that looks almost like me so I rollplay as myself being a criminal. With friends you can have a blast playing vs modes or cooping on heists or just messing around in the world. From my experience you will get dropped into a hacked lobby about 1/3 of the time which can be exteremely frustraiting. Quests and missions are not clearly outlined and doesn't really give you the same leveling satisfaction you would get from an MMO or a single player type game. I just felt like I was aimlessly wandering about doing whatever. But I get kind of OCD about that so it's mostly my issue. If you don't have a problem with a lack of clear waypoints or instruction on leveling up then this won't be an issue for you.With so much quality content It's hard not to recommend this game despite it's flaws. If your just picking it up for the single player game it's completely worth it or if you have a few friends to play online with it's also a great time. If you want a game to mess around with random people in an online playground this might not be the game you were looking for.My percieved value of the game.

As an individual who has supported and bought many of Rockstar's and 2k's game I am disappointed to see that there publisher (Take Two interactive) has made an unfair ban on the (previously) active modding scene. Take Twos and Rockstars excuse that ""OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody"" though in part true is not the obvious full story. The publisher has made an very noticable move on making the single player experience something that no one would play after finishing the man story. This is done by never releasing single player content and not even bothering on porting the already made online content to the single player experience and now going as far as too severly limit one of the most popular ways of enjoying the offline game. Why would they do this? This is simple as a company Take Two wants to make as much money as possible and if a player is playing single player they are not spending money on shark cards.

2017-06-16,0,0,331,False,Recommended,EDIT Rockstar have managed to convince Take Two to allow single player mods and Open IV is now available. Good too see that they listen to their fans. I will still leave my old review below ________________________________________________________________________After seeing Take Two's stance on mods I can no longer recommend this game. I wish Rockstar would stand up to Take Two but no. Take Two have ruined Grand Theft Auto first with the shark cards and now with the removal of mods. Go yourself Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,356,False,Recommended,Update OK looks like everythings back in order. Changing the review back to positive.So there is not enough money comming in from GTA Online which is why you needed to find a way to make gamers who only played single player come back to the multiplayer section of the game.How? Just shut down the tool that makes Single player fun state that this is used for hacking in multiplayer (which is not) and just to be sure shut down some real hacking websites (2 sites down from 100...) so people think you are doing a good thing... oh oh and make them donate their winning to charrity this way they will surely not realize the real porpuse of this whole thing.You could have started this a long long time ago but you did not. Why? Because you don't give 2 rats about the players its again all about making more and more and more and more MONEY.I'm not blaiming Rockstars I blame again those greeeeed #&amp !% coorporate money hungry publishers. This is why we can't have nice things (I have uninstalled the game because I don't like to play a game from a publisher that thinks I'm stupid and who doesn't give a &amp %! about their playerbase or their game (again publisher not developer).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,248,False,Recommended,Not much to say about GTA V. Port is great scales very well. Best looking PC game? No Is it pretty? Yes Is the story good? Yeah I love to be able to play for 3 different characters How's the gameplay? Well that's the only thing I hate about GTA V. Driving is fine flying is fine but shooting mechanics are just very poor first person seems a bit unfinished and COPS .. geez... they are ridiculous they just spawn anywhere at anytime can see and shoot through anything Ahh I almost forgot NO BLOODY MONEY money in GTA V is so scarce that it is not even funny the only way to really get money is to finish the game but leave assassination missions after (I did not know that)EDITGTA OnlineAbysmal experience insane loading times lags server issues fps drops. matching system no back to lobby option instead the entire group gets dismantled.

This is an amazing feature. I have some problems with small lag spikes (the reason is that my graphics card and my RAM is not high enough to run GTA higher than ""High"".I have no problems launching the game (it takes me some seconds to get in game) I also see that many people have problems with launching the game or the game crashes on start up.

2015-07-16,0,0,264,False,Recommended,I waited several months post release to buy this game because I wanted to be sure the PC port is solid. And it was. And I paid $60. And I got my solid 60fps. And all was great.And then several weeks later RockStar released patch 1.28. And now performance is and the entire point of buying the PC port has gone moot for me. How they managed to screw that up is beyond me.I miss the time when I could choose which patch I wanted to install. Oh wait I still can by buying on GOG.comEdit Ok after 2 weeks another patch was released and now performance is back to normal and I'm happy again. Great game. But don't trust RockStar...,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,455,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Take Two are reverting their decision. Open IV's development continues and it will hopefully be officially available again soon.GTA V's story is awesome. The multiplayer not so much. The grind in this game is horrific but that doesn't keep one from having fun in GTA V Online.Where they really ed up is with modding. Until now you could mod the game with a programm called 'Open IV'.Well....despite being perfectly legal Take Two (the publisher not R*!) decided to send the developers of Open IV a Cease and Desist Order. They have to stop distributing and developing Open IV.In other words they killed GTAV SP modding.Now you might think that they did this to stop hackers from modding the game.There's just one problem with this you don't need Open IV for trainers the tools used by 'hackers' in GTA Online.So in conclusion GTA V is an awesome game and the multiplayer is fun if you have friends to mess with.But Take Two just messed up bad. There's a petition going on here www.change.org . Please sign it to try to change Take Two's decision.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,682,False,Recommended,EDIT Take Two / Rockstar have reversed their decision and Open IV is back up. As such I felt it only fair I revert my review back to positive.GTA Online is plagued with Take Two simply trying to get money. What should be a $60 game with plenty of content is actually a $60 game with $500 worth of extra unlockable content by buying shark cards. What makes matters worse is that there is also a plethora of hackers on GTA Online doing anything from spawning explosions all around you griefing spawning a cage around you making themselves invincible and even draining your own hard work (or bought) money! These hackers also have a habit of spawning themselves money and occassionally you! But then Take Two gets and takes your money away. So you have hackers taking your money and Take Two taking your money both IG and IRL.So you play single player but you can only do so much. So maybe you mod it a bit. Well now that's not allowed. Take Two has already ed over your online experience and now they're ing over single player.Moral of the story don't buy this game. It's not good anymore.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-19,0,0,113,False,Not Recommended,Single player was OK till Rock Star torpedo'd it. Online is worse Rock Star has created a anti consumer milk machine that froces you to pay real life money to get anythign done. Waht's worse is that Rock Star has compeltly ignored the single player experience that makes GTA fun in the name of this milk machine. Guess it's easier to make up a few BS inserts into online that cost nothing and force people to fork over ANOTHER $60 to fully utilize it than to actual make memorable single player content that adds to the actual game itself. I'm now extremelt apprehensive about any future Rock star titles including the upcoming Red Dead Redemtion. I refuse to buy it until I see Rock Star commit to it with true expansions or at the very least not create an online version to milk it's player base.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-27,0,0,507,False,Not Recommended,If you are going to mod this game then don't bother!Game is actually great but the fact that they took down OpenIV angers me they basically killed modding in this game.

2015-11-01,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,Below was my review before they decided to mess it all up for singleplayer mods by ordering OpenIV to stop. Somehow I'm guessing they will bring back mods which you can install by buying sharkcards. As if they didnt made enough money by milking it completely dry with the online game. The love is gone The game itself is great! Good storylines funny sidequests and offcourse some good humor and a very well designed huge map. There is this great balance between the main characters they are all different and have their ... well issues but the chemistry is great. Lots of things to explore good fun hidden random events. You can finish the whole game quite fast if you are just doing back to back story missions. But you can also lose yourself in wandering about looking for items things to do. All and all good fun. Also there is a huge modding community which allows you to mod the game pretty much as you prefer. More cars houses settings scripts even more cars etc etc. My first review wasnt too positive mainly because of GFX troubles which are obviously known for a while by Rockstar but there isnt a specific fix for it. Online everyone has different solutions but none of them work for me. (err_gfx_d3d_init). Sorta fixed it by fiddling with the graphics settings but not ideal. So aside from the good game the random crashes kinda get to me. From the playing on record time ive spend a lot of time trying to fix stuff booting crashing and trying to find another fix.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-27,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Fantastic game. Although currently my PC can't run the game that well it is wonderfully ported and this is the definitive edition of the game. I own it on PS3 Xbox One and now PC and the PC edition is by the far the best!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-27,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,TL DRThe online game is no damned fun in passive mode. It is no fun playing with Xbox player griefers. I was labeled as a bad sport after killing two guys that started attacking me. It went away after a couple of hours of playing with passive mode turned on. Yay! 5/10 Half the game is fun all by your self the other half is online pretty much all by yourself then you crash and if you are lucky you crash back to single player. For a full $60 this game should crash way less often. I have crashed out of the game in online mode every time I've played it. I have crashed twice in single player mode and I think I've played that 3 times. Only about 10 of my 28 hours played so far are for single player story mode. So about the crashes most happen for no reason I can tell during the most mundane moments like driving or entering a garage. The rest happen at the exact moment that I'm finally about to have some fun with my friends. After long loading screens figuring out who is on what server the debate over whether or not to turn passive mode on (read no fun mode) so we can actually make it to each other in order to play together and ride in the same car we finally get to a cool spot for a race or a job and then the game crashes. When I relog I find I'm in a different server and I have to do the same damn song and dance and waiting to meet up with my friends who have been missing out on their fun waiting for me. I expected bugs but not constant CTDs. Friend just stole a helicopter and landed next to you to pick you up for some helicopter cop sniping? Yay! Two seconds after take off CTD. Fifteen minutes in on your first online heist with a friend and all you have left to do is go home and set up for it?...Aaaand the game crashes on you both as you try to park in your garage. There are times when other people can hear us talking even though we are all set to friends + crew on voice chat. If another player brings a whole four star army of cops past you they will usually begin to chase you and your friends as well. I'm still not sure why. And since you are in passive mode you can only run from the cops but they can still shoot you. Let's take a moment to also point out that with the number of people that have over rank 100 characters they imported from their Xbox accounts it is impossible to hold your own against someone who is determined to kill you as you run around on the map trying meet your friends in game. You can gear up pretty quick online thanks to some free DLC weapons but when the other player shoots your car full of friends with a minigun all the rifles in the world can't help you. Only lucky head shots. And no ones PC character has any skills yet. Those must be grinded like everything else for some reason. Which is fine except for when I'm fighting against someone who rarely misses provided they have the mouse cursor on target. I can click on your head and often miss anyways thanks to poor shooting skill so far. Look I'm sure single player is solid. I plan on having fun with that for many hours just to do the story at least. But I bought the game to play with my friends online. Because Rockstar advertised that I could. Well I can't really.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-27,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Bought the game after debating whether it was worth 60$. Lets see single player is great no problems their nice and long with alot of to keep someone busy.. But lets look at GTA Online... Its matchmaking is difficult to learn for someone new trying to set up their own private match. Connection between people with internet vs good internet is completely unbalanced and unfair. What I mean is people with internet will literally jump fly and do all sorts of fancy tricks across your screen in turn affecting the npcs around you. Not fun... Now let me get onto the Heists im still new so i only got the first heist but doing this with my friend on the first part will 9/10 break when we are bringing the van back to my house. Makign me with three choices exit and restart get into another game and sit through a loading screen or pray that it decided to ing work... Might I also add trying to buy things in this game is annoying because I will accidently buy .. Oh and why cant I sell anything from a mistake at buying the wrong thing. Now seeing as I bought this game to play with friends and have fun the online aspect of this game is a BIG let down as half the time im lagging in my friends car or the mission keeps bugging out... NOT FUN.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-20,0,0,57,False,Recommended,I'm on a mission to silence 4 corrupt jurors who are about to return a verdict that would seriously damage the share price of Redwood Cigarettes Inc. If I'm successful it's expected that Redwood Cigarettes' stock price will skyrocket in value the following day. To prepare for my mission I customize my sniper rifle with an advanced scope and a supressor I grab a nice versitile vehicle (lifted Ford F 150) and I spend the remainder of my cash on Redwood Cigarrette stock on the hopes that my mission will be successful. However after I execute the first corrupt juror the situation on the ground forces me to make some adjustments to my plan. The cops are on me but its only one star so its not too much of a concern. On to the second juror. I take him out quickly but the cops see me do it again and they are starting to get Two stars. Still not that bad. The third juror is standing on a sidewalk so I easily find him and run him down (again right in front of the cops). Three stars. Now I've got to do something to deal with these cops before I make my way to the final juror who is hanging out on his yacht in the harbor.But then I notice I'm running out of time. Just one minute before juror number four goes into hiding and my mission is a complete failure. Frantically I speed toward the harbor. Thank God I decided to use a sniper rifle for this mission. All I need is a good vantage point. Then I see it. Perfectly positioned near the harbor are some high bluffs that I can easily drive up with my lifted Ford F 150 to get a birds eye view of my target. 'It's gonna be close ' I think to myself 'but I got this mission.'At this point I'm feeling really smart. Correct weapon choice correct vehicle choice and a chance for an enormous payout (due to my purchase of Redwood Cigarrette stock before the killing spree began). I park my truck at the top of the remote bluff. Hop out and start to train my sights on the final juror. 20 seconds left. The boat is moving up and down with the waves making this a pretty difficult shot. I put the jurors head right in the crosshairs. 10 seconds left. And just as I'm squeezing down on the trigger...I am mauled by a mountain lion. Michael is dead. Mission failure. 11/10. Moar plz. Best GTA ever.,Grand Theft Auto V

I got online twice and all it was was the first time some with a tank fu cking everybody up that nonstop klled me like15 times lol then moved on to another player. Everyone left that server. Also when I was at the store gettin gear some dude killed the clerk so I couldn't buy anything so I left the game. Next day I joined same on map player dot killing s hit but this time someone spawned a cage on me at the store so I could not move then spawned a car inside the store killing the clerk. again I couldn't buy s hit lol.All that the player dots on the map do is get people killed nonstop by the internet cancer comunity boring people to death that are not being able to do s hit but die like an a$$hole wich gets old quick as it did for me. Getting rid of the fu cking player dot on the map will make it more playable and interesting to play online. This way people have the chance to wonder arround explore and meet other players by chance. This will make this bad game so much enjoyable. The player dot on the map only attracts the cancer of the internet making this game stupidly useless online.Another note to developers This will be the best thing for the game that is to bring in new tons of differnt weapons and new custom skins for them. Also a way to trade guns gear and vehicles with other players on the game page profile or online in the game. Now that will make this one of the best games ever ),Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,150,False,Recommended,"Update 05/01/15 After the latest patch I'm able to play for a considerable amount of time before encountering a crash (4+ hours). So I'm changing my review to ""Recommend"". I hope they continue to improve the game and fix issues but it's at a stable enough level now to be enjoyable.GTA 5 Single Player Very solid enjoyed it a lot. Glad that alot of the annoying missions previous GTAs had are gone or relegated to non critical to the single player story. The story itself was solid enough there are parts where it drags on a bit or stumbles a little but by and large it works. If there's one thing I'd love to see improved Quit changing my characters outfits. I designed looks for the three main characters right off the bat many missions will see them change outfits and after the mission is over they don't change back to what they had on before. In particular this annoyed me with earrings and glasses. I wouldn't mind the wardrobe switch nearly as much if the new wardrobe wouldn't remove glasses and earrings.GTA Online So much potential stuck between a mirade of long loading screens. These really need to be cut down one of the worst offenders is when asked if you want to enter a queue for a mission or not and answer no it has to reload the entire world again... why?!? just drop me back in the world I was already in.There's also *soo* many things to do that it's a bit overwhelming. Better presentations of missions would be very welcome. There's some oddities in this regard as well after completing a mission solo I'm presented a list of 5 additional missions or a random one to immediately do. The 5 additional missions are *always* missions I've already done even though there are plenty of missions I haven't done yet. When I hit refresh I'm then given a lot of game/mission types of a totally different variety instead of the same type.Heists need to be more 'fault tolerant' of people leaving/crashing.Lastly it would be SOO nice if planning a mission or heist could be done w/o leaving the freeroam world. Having to wait in a lobby screen in the hopes that people join and you can launch the job is mind numbing.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,0,0,117,False,Recommended,Good game though cheaters are rampant in online and Rockstar doesn't care. Tanks also are useless in the game as they flip out uncontrollably if you so much as hit a pebble and are damaged by small arms fire which reduces your character's health bar not really any differently than if you were not inside the tank. It also suffers the same control issues/lag/delays as most other console ports.

2015-05-01,0,0,93,False,Recommended,"""Now Go! I Need To Meditate. Or Masturbate. Or Both.""GTA 5 is everything we expected it to be. Graphics gameplay you name it it's all there! Rockstar (probably the last remaining quality oriented company) didn't let us down this time. I'm not a hardcore player nor am I a huge GTA series fan but when I see another Grand Theft Auto game announced my heart starts pounding a little bit faster. This game literally has everything it was expected to have good singleplayer rewarding multiplayer races shootings base jumping golf... hookers for god's sake! Let's start with singleplayer. It is absolutely fascinating you have your own new realistic open world to discover main missions which are gripping (but prepare to drive a lot) lovable and hilarious characters. There should be a separate review to describe just singleplayer alone so let me tell you that it is worth buying just for playing alone.Multiplayer is a whole new ball game. There are lots of new features which are absent in the singleplayer. For example visiting other player luxurious apartment or garage full of neat muscle cars. Together you can go complete a variety of all kinds of missions from racing to classic ""kill 'em'all"" arenas. Talking about multiplayer one can not skip ""The Heists"" which are (pretty self explanatory) series of high rewarding missions aimed at perfect teamplay among 4 players it somewhat resembles Payday. And astoundingly there is much much more...The only significant drawback (and the source of its state of the art graphics) of GTA 5 are system specs. This is the game that truly tells you or perhaps shouts at you to update your graphics card buy new i5 processor and as a possible consequence change your motherboard entirely but if you are a devoted player every greenback spent is tons of pleasure gained.Thanks for reading!Have fun and enjoy the vibe!",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,0,0,348,False,Recommended,In my opinion the story is okay not as good or immersive as GTA IV but still fun. The online is great if you have friends to play with otherwise it can be dreadful waiting to fill a pug group just to complete a heist. I don't think it's worth the $60 if you've played the game on the consoles already if not then it's a definite must buy. Try to aim for at least 3 other friends to have the game to really enjoy the online aspect to its fullest.If you're wondering if your computer can run it compare it with the recommended requirements not the minimum. I have Windows 8.1 64 bitIntel i5 3570k 3.4 GHz quad coreMotherboard with PCI Express 3.0 x16GTX 660 2GB8 GB RAM1 TB HDD at 7200 rpmWith these parts I can run the game on medium settings and maintain the 60 frames per sec with VSYNC on. To go higher I would recommend buying a GTX 970 4GB card to push the graphics to higher settings. This game also has long load times I don't have much of a problem with it but you can get a SDD (Solid State Drive) to reduce load times but these come at quite a higher cost than a regular HDD. You could get a small one say 250 GB SDD to run alongside your HDD for some games. As far as game stability and any crashes or bugs. I put almost 100 hours on this game the first two weeks it came out and I haven't crashed or experienced any bugs with the game. I formatted and upgraded my OS from windows 7 to 8.1 with a clean install and updated it as well prior to installing GTA V to minimize the possibilities of bugs.I hope this review gave some insight and information to go on. Thank you for reading and I hope you all enjoy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-20,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Previous review Just fork over the money to Steam or Rockstar already. It's a benchmark of PC gaming and a technological achievement. GTAV is meant to be on PC. Buy the game NOW.Recent Review Still pretty much the same view regardless if mods have been stripped from it. While a complete attrocious move from Take 2 Grand Theft Auto V still has a pretty substantial single player and multiplayer portion based on one of the most technically detail city open worlds ever created. Even if you don't mod you can get plenty of hours with the game regardless of what price you pay for it. I'm not saying that the take down of mod support is not terrible. While it can hinder one of the main fundamentals of PC gaming I still think people who have enjoyed GTA/Rockstar games in the past should buy it (if they can afford it) anyway. Me and three others played GTA Online and the story just fine without any mods. If you primarily game on PC GTAV is still one of the best ports of it containing graphical options and optimization out there. Regardless if mods are gone GTA V is still worth whatever price you pay for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I was excited and had started to do some esearch on how to play a modded GTAV game.

The game itself is fun in story mode but I do prefer the online multiplayer but prefer to only have sessions with friends and not a lot of strangers from around the world. Frequent patches and ""expansions"" keep this game fresh for me too. Loading times are a bit annoyingly long and to get into online mode and invite friends to your session tend to be kind of ""jump through hoops"" in a way. Just giving you guys my honest opinion lol. I do still really suggest this game and try to get more of my friends to purchase it. I do think it is time to drop the price though but that may be on Rockstar's end and not Steam. some wishful thinking they should add hangers and boat docks for people that buy boats or planes or helicopters so that we can walk up to them and board them just like cars bikes or motorcycles. Also they need to add more heists. The heists are fun but getting 4 people to do them all (for me anyways) is difficult to coordinate schedules. So more less than 4 player heists.

Instead of contacting the developer of OpenIV when they (Rockstar) allegedly discovered some new hacks enabled by OpenIV and ask them to fix whatever allowed it they instead sent an illegal cease and desiest order to which the OpenIV team had to comply to not have to endure expensive lawyer fees and a court settlement.

Review If you are getting the game to mod do so carefully but enjoy the amazing world that was built by rockstar. But also note that unless you mod the game there will be no updates to single player because of the cancer that suffuses GTA Online. This cancer goes under the guise of predators not good camoflage for an equally dangerous idea. The Online is full of cheaters and is virtually inpossible to play with just owning the game. To get anywhere you will eventually feel the need to purchase into the cancer because what can it hurt? Your dignity faith in your humanity various portal cause of deaths and your ability to claim that you fought the cancer The cancer costs consumers $300 Million a year (a very conservative estimate) (spoiler contains an excerpt from Take Two's 2016 Earnings report (emphasis mine) ( Source pdf ir.take2games.com For fiscal year 2016 Non GAAP net revenue was $1.561 billion as compared to $1.669 billion for fiscal year 2015 which had benefited from a more extensive release slate.

Just hoping they would still make good games after this.(Original review)Great game you know it begins with the petty career criminal that eventually traverses to become one of the best ones eventually meeting the other protagonists along the way for obvious reasons the game is regarded as the best of 2013 the game technically it's a masterpiece altho there are certain missions wich do tend to drag themselves along the way some of them wich involver you laching parking veichles i mean...But overall the game it's great runs great too with a few minor exceptions there are some graphics options wich are devastating for this game (The advanced ones at that) I would recommend you to disable them since they do not tend to make such a huge difference visually but in performance they just tear appart the game it's great tho worth every penny.,Grand Theft Auto V

Hackers are freaking everywhere(duh) but the problem is alot of the tactics they use havent been patched out for a LONG time if Rockstar actually cares about their comunity they need to do something about this2. It takes WAY too long to grind for money to buy anything ive played the game sence its launch on the ps3 and sence then ive seen the monitary rewards only dwendle while the cost of some of this stuff only goes up(the best yacht is almost $10 mill)3. The cop AI is utter B.S. 90% of the time there are instances in the game in which im running from the cops and i can LITTERALLY see a cop car/heli/boat spawn infront of me too close to react to it before they see me. And theres a mission where getting spotted by active cops ends your progress and the B.S. cop physics dont let off at all4. They need to improve the online service 8/10 times that i select join friends online i will be put into an invite session ALONE and the game will tell me that i should join my 4 friends who are playing in a session somewhere... I wish i was lying about that too.Final verdictthe game still inherits its ability to just be fun when your goofing around in the world whether online with friends or by yourself. Despite the issues it has nothing beats popping into a private session with some of your friends and just dicking around to kill a few hours. The single player is good theres plenty of easter eggs to discover. The online is still fun once you load in properly and get a good lobby without hackers or general s. If only social club wasnt as granted it has gotten better sence my original review but it still has issues.This is my original review if your interested there is always a problem when trying to sign into the social club then your account gets locked and you cant play the game for hours... even after changing your password 5 times. once you get into the game its fine save for how anal Rockstar is about the mods which is a damn shame cause thats the only reason i bought the game for PC anyway...,Grand Theft Auto V

It became my life for about 5 to 6 days then I realized I had wasted a week on a video game. When it was finally officially announced that GTA was coming to PC I was hyped. After being delayed 3 times I wondered if the game was going to be a mistake or not. I first loaded up the game and even with the expected server issues I was able to go into online and transfer all of my stuff from consoles to my PC. The next 3 weeks were the funnest times Ive had in a while. With mods and all other things with the steam version of the game you will never be bored. I totally believe if you have a PC that can run this game Jump on it. It is the 2015 PC game of the year so far. As always It has a 8/8 on my 8 scale.,Grand Theft Auto V

Where you kind of just hover over games and always come back to a few?Well I have a small hard drive so there was a time when GTA just didn't cut it in my playtime any more to justify it's giant size (at the time.) So I uninstalled it sometimes I would reinstall for a week or two but always uninstall for other games.Then one day I started modding. Suddenly the game started transforming into something that became GTA the way I wanted it to be. The work of the modders is just so incredible.Basically my mods transformed my playstyle into a game that offered infinite replayability and it has been installed for half a year now.I set up an improved cops and stealth mod where if nobody sees you or calls the police you can get away with virtual murder. I set up a fuel and food mod and interiors mod where cars have random amonts of gas and any fast food area has a red blip that heals you.I made pedestrians drop more money gang members some other poor targets that I won't mention would drop STACKS. I set up a mod that did multiplayer random missions in Single Player so I always had a crate van assissination car steal or car blow up mission. I set up gta iv euphoria rag dolls so i could shoot people in the arms and legs and they would try to keep standing and roll around crazily realistically. I set up the game so I could get immerssed into my nasty despicable anti heroes and actually live their lives eating sleeping stock trading getting investments from businesses. I had mods that unlocked all the new cars like the parachuting one with misslesMan my end game is glorious looking forwards to Red Dead 2,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-29,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,The gameplay can be fun and the online multiplayer which is a long overdue feature is nice however the game itself is choppy load screens are horendous and doesn't bother displaying pertinent information like ping. In addition there are typos everywhere in important tutorial info and the tutorials themselves are aweful. I frequently see new players struggle to understand the system and frequently have to ask for info only to get shunned by the community that is designed and meant to be volatile.To add to this list of cons there is no profanity filter no block list no features that every single multiplayer has online yet this does not. In truth if I didn't have a single friend who played this game I would likely have returned the game since playing with party members is also a nightmare scenario. With load screens taking so long (solely due to host migration and network syncing problems) you spend more time loading the game than you do playing if you pug into a random group. This is not a game you play alone. You bring many friends and hope no level 100+ is around with any flying vehicle else you'll spend your time in loading screens on the curv dead every few minutes.,Grand Theft Auto V

From time to time there's a player killing instantly everbody on the map in a second. That among others. Way to less players on a multiplayer map instance (30). At least 50 would be nice. But that would be almost impossible for Rockstar's devs... Take a peek in Blizzard's offices. A lot of prepaid kids.

GTAV is still a great game. Just don't mess with the community please. Begin Old Review The ultimate version of GTAV!I've already played the heck out of this game on PS3...beaten the story and played MP...everyone pretty much knows that this is a great game chock full of goodness in an open world scenario.The PC does the consoles one better with glorious HD graphics with low system requirements. My experience thus far on PC has been smooth as buttah with zero hiccups or flaws.My rig is not even high end and the only current thing I have in it my graphics card. Regardless I'm able to crank out a smooth 50 to 60FPS in all but the most intensive scenes where it drops to 40FPS occasionally using max settings.i7 92024GB Crucial RamEVGA X58 SLiEVGA GTX 780 Ti Black2TB WD Black HD1920x1080RezMax All Settings (3GB VRAM used)The added improvements are what make this the ultimate version. I spent an hour of the 4 hours playing so far just screwing around in Director Mode. It is so much with basically built in cheats to let you be the fanatic you've always dreamed about. Doing massive jumps and crazy crashes just to record the best scenes you can make. There's no doubt there are going to be some impressive videos coming out soon.To keep this short Rockstar did a commendable job on this game and the port is lovingly done. A huge difference from GTAIV's release it's obvious they paid attention. Yes there are teething problems but overall this game is worth the money and your investment.

This is such t OpenIV is only modding single player the creators even said one of the factors of OpenIV is ""Absolutely no messing with Online..."" as in they won't with the online experience. But no because theres mods that let you use Online content in SP to stop people from buying micro transactions Take two basically said ""No you give us money."" It is total t and please spam negative reviews so something to this game happens it's a 7/10 on Google Search from Steam now. Bethesda with cancerous paid mods and now making SP modding illegal? this industry at this point.Game is great in SP but never gets new content and ""Online"" is ing awful. Don't buy this game even on Xbox 360 PS3 Xbox One and PS4 don't buy Kerbal Space Program (It was bought by Take Two) Don't buy NBA2K game or ANY 2K game for that matter there the same games every year anyway.

2016-03-05,0,0,247,False,Not Recommended,If you're thinking in buying this game to enjoy the online mode Don't you won't enjoy Now I'm an Owl of Bird wisdom and you better take my advice on this this is the shameless money grabing scheme I've ever seen!In oder for you to enjoy the online you need in game money and there are only 3 ways of getting money in game 1. Doing Heists.2. Buying in game currency with real money.3. Modding the game/Begging to moders for money.Now you might think it's cool since heist are awesomely planed exiting and fun and you would be right except for the fact that Heists cannot be done solo and this game's matchmaking is more broken than 70's superman's neck. You would waste hours (literally) trying to get people to join and when you finally gather enough people and launch the game someone is going to be randomly disconnected causing the job to be failed sending you to an absurdly long loading screen and ending in a session alone You will try to join a different session but the eternal loading screen will end with an alert message saying that the game is ed up and you need to go back to the offline game.Repeat the process several times untill you waste 70 + hours trying to give the game a chance so you can no longer return it.If you're thinking into buying this game spend that money on a sand paper cover it with glass fragments and then stick it up your it would hurt less.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-30,0,0,84,False,Recommended,Was really looking forward to this on the PC for a constant 60fps. Own it on the Xbox 360 and the Xbox one and it is hands down the best game I've played. Unfortunately even my high end system with a 980 ti still wasn't enough to make it look or run better than the Xbox one version. It can barely maintain a constant 60fps even with most settings turned down at 1080p. Even with grass quality turned down I only get 25 30fps in grassy areas. It also takes these crazy frame dips from 60 to about 15 for no reason while in the same area of the map which makes no sense. Then theres the problem of objects and shadows popping in and out and weird jumps during smooth gameplay that resembles online lag. I guess 1000 dollar video card isn't enough to make a game run smoothly these days. EDIT Apparently after some research a lot of people are experiencing this erratic framerate problem since one of the updates. I seem to have fixed mine. Advanced settings was the culprit. Still have a stutter from time to time but nothing like before. Still have really bad popup for shadows and trees though.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-05,0,0,488,False,Recommended,I highly recommend playing this game it's a masterpiece....With that said I'd like to also add that this game has a level of deceit. I'm not 100% recommending this title that's because of the Online. I've spent the majority of the hours I have in Single Player and then I eventually made my transition to Online mode and that was a MISTAKE! The WORST online experience I've EVER been apart of. EVERYTIME I'm on there's a low life hacker causing havoc becuase they've spent 1000 hours and are bored or for whatever reason. If you can find a session with players and no hackers (good luck) then you're going to run into people level 300 and they'll just kill you. Repeatedly... Yes you can go into passive mode but then you can't access your guns in freeroaming mode. So you're essentially left to driving from event to event. If you don't turn on passive mode they'll just keep killing you over and over and over on spawn. This is midly annoying but what's more annoying is the cost of it you die and you lose money. I've lost over $100 000 of in game hard earned cash to this exact issue. Too many people on here have had their fun and now go around trying to ruin it for others. If you can get into a session without hackers with people who wanna play right and they don't spawn kill you then good luck getting matchmaking to work. If someone who's higher level gets in queue with you see you're level 20 they'll just drop. I spent 30 minutes waiting for a 4 man team. Absolutely pathetic. So again I recommend this game but only for the single player and I'm glad I bought this on sale for that very reason. Screw this online piece of ****,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-26,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,I have given up on the Multiplayer and the publisher basically is trying to eliminate singleplayer mods to force us onto MP I don't want to do that. I want them to drop support for this stupid part of the game and let us mod the crap out of the PC version you know the reason we bought the PC version.To the PC community Rockstar is not a PC publisher. Bully had vary few options GTA IV had a lot of problems San Andreas somehow ran better on my four year old Macbook pro then on my high end Windows Desktop. Unlike say Ubisoft they admit it With that said GTA V is their best game and the pc release actaully went pretty well. The story world and Charactors are entertaining. The detail is insane and little behind the scene features make the game trully come alive. The multyplayer is fun to play with friends but an important thing to remember in freemode is that every player is trevor and as long as they arren't cheating it is fun to play cat and mouse with them especially if you can explode your way to cat. leveling is a bit grindy so defenitly play with friends and some of the online missions can be completed with some creativity. Mostly I would stick to single player sence the world is more filled and you can actually mess around either with the vanila game or some mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have over 100 hours logged in this game and not a SINGLE ONE was in the online mode. This is not cool Take Two you must understand that aside from the (very excellent) single player campaign and the ability to fly around LS in a jet car or a UFO or general hysterical shenanigans I no longer hold interest in this game. Unfortunately Take Two has decided to rob it's PC comunity of modifying the game. Stifiling creativity and invention I am not a mod maker but I have enjoyed them emmensley becasue of mods I have come back to GTA time and time again.

Now you may be thinking to yourself ""why have they done this this is an outrage there must be some copyright issue right?"" NO ALL THEY WANT IS MORE MONEY. With mods you could obtain vehicles and other multiplayer based things in the single player which has no effect on anything other than you personal copy of the game. But Take Two thought to themselves ""hey people are having fun with stuff that you normally have to pay for in the multiplayer we aren't losing money it's just we want more SHUT IT DOWN!!!"" All they care about is money not the player base they don't make anything that is fun to use in the multiplayer easy to obtain. YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOR EVERYING and to be honest I would perfer to not spend 200 hours farming to get level 100 so I can have a VIRTUAL house and VIRTUAL cars.

However due to the fact that Take Two has decided to opt for a multiplayer centric model and cancelled their single player dlc plans they see that creativity and community creation as a threat and use the empty excuse of ""It allows bad people to maybe sometimes manipulate the game in unfair ways"" which is t.

I will keep my original statement as it is still true. Thank you Rockstar for doing the right thing.Original Post Take Two Interactive basically KILLING the modding community under the guise of ""stopping cheaters"" is unacceptable. If OpenIV is the utility used so that cheaters can use their cheats (as they claim) they can at the very least patch the part that allows cheaters to use cheats so that they no longer work all the while leaving the good things OpenIV does alone. Until OpenIV is allowed to continue development and be released to the public again I cannot in good conscience recommend this game anymore. They need to understand that they have profitted off of modders UNPAID hard work which has created a longevity for their game (ala Skyrim). They need to feel how much the modding community means to their userbase.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,1082,False,Not Recommended,"SO i bought the game when it first dropped on PC I preordered it so I could get the extra 1.5ish Mill bonus to start. The game started out great. Then the game slowly devolved into mobile gaming grinds. They build all their new DLC content to make it as grindy as possible but for a few shark cards worth of effort you can have it all at your finger tips now..... While this irked me I just figured it I have fun doing the heist maybe they will release more..... Nope... they just keep releasing DLC Grinds and ""New Cars"" or gimicks to get you to buy shark cards becuase who has time to grind it all when there is Work or School ppl have to worry about. Their customer support btw sucks!... Just a personal gripe for a moment but I spent like 3 days grinding the money to buy their 60 car garage for 1.6M to find out its a 20 car garage and if i paid another 2x i could amass 60s worht of storage in one locatoin... I opend a ticket and explained the misunderstanding based on what I read on their ingame adds. Rockstart Devs told me to suck a fat egg and kick rocks.... So I stopped playing their online BS grind simulator...... Now after all the most of the community and I have swallowed they come out with these ""You cant mod your single player game"" policy?....

2015-05-25,0,0,149,False,Recommended,GTA V is one of the best games I have ever played and I say that with Fallout and Elder Scrolls games in my library. The story is outstanding and if the player chooses the third option at the end the ending is beyond satisfying. It also helps that the game is hands down one of the most beautiful I've ever seen in fact the only complaint I have about the graphics is that the nights bother me because they are unrealistically bright. (Many people prefer bright nights because they find dark ones annoying so I can understand Rockstar's motivation behind doing this.) Underlying the amazing intense story and beautiful meticulously designed city and graphics is the satire and social criticism that still holds GTA close to my heart. A major part of this game even more so than in GTA IV is the focus on the subtlety of these criticisms. GTA V presents the player with these things and doesn't say a word about them primarily because it doesn't have to. It's up to the player to recognize these elements for what they are and putting forth the mental effort to discern them makes the game that much more interesting and enjoyable it just goes to show how much the writers and developers of Rockstar think about social issues and weave the satire masterfully into the game. Sadly not many developers treat their games with the love and care that obviously went into this one. If you haven't bought this game and you're thinking about getting it BUY IT. I would buy it again if I had to.,Grand Theft Auto V

I was really hoping that this game would give me something new to play after the fantastic Saints Row The Third and Saints Row 4. Unfortunately this game is riddled with bugs and crashes. I have a pretty decent machine (8 gb RAM 4 gb graphics card 3.1 AMD FX 8 core processor). The story starts off pretty interesting but you don't get a chance to explore the personalities of the protagonists or the secondary characters. The side quests are insanely boring and most of the game is just driving for 20 minutes to get to the next mission which usually involves diving around trying to catch someone or escape from someone. The game is just incredibly monotonous. After putting in 30 hours (most of which i'm sure was spent driving) I ended up getting tired of dying due to driving recklessly (I was trying to get to the objective faster because... you know... driving is boring as hell) and I uninstalled the game. If you want a fun laugh out loud open world game like this I highly recommend SR3 and 4.,Grand Theft Auto V

With that being said there is some amazing things that have been implemented into GTAV. Althought it gets buried in the multiplayer under a brutal grind. There are thousands of things to do but to get serious money you have to spend days playing the same missions over and over. The grind should feel effortless not exhaust the players into playing other games. I find that when I do play GTAO I can only handle it in bursts. Otherwise I wont play it for weeks on end. All of that aside the singleplayer experience is beautifully performed. The characters are intersting and interact in interestingly with eachother(that was painful to write). The minutia throughout the world is impressive. there are memes on how in depth R* went with including all the little stuff. TL DR Great but be weary of GTAO,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-19,0,0,1975,False,Recommended,"Great story mode and Online only if you play in a closed session with your friends. Public sessions is all hackers.Let me give you a few thoughts about this game. Bought it for my 360 and again for computer so I've been at this a while now. GTA V or GTA Five (for those who are confused by roman numerals) has a fantastic story. I enjoy the ability to swap between the three characters at random. The graphics look absolutely amazing and will make you want to take screen shots of the landscape...a small hint everything looks way cooler with explosions! Weapons handle quite nicely as do the cars. But lets talk about GTA Online. Hey you finally can make your own anti hero to cause havoc with. Got friends who will play with you? Awesome! You guys will have one hilarious time!Now the bad part As is stands now I honestly doubt there is even an anti cheat service active on the Online part of the game. If you play in public game sessions let me give you a taste of what to expect everytime. and I seriously wish I was over exaggerating when I say ""everytime"" Players that take no damage aka God mode Players that can jump into the air and fly off like Superman Prepare to just freeze and not be able to move then catch fire and burn to death Suddenly everyone in game will explode (hope you weren't driving your most expensive car) So basically its plagued with hackersSo if you are here for the story or to play with friends in your own session then I say heck yes you should buy this game. However if you are here only for Online and don't have friends to play with then no...just no.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-19,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,DRM sucks. I've never been able to play this online and every once in a while it will let me play single player. Ive have it for months and barely logged 30 hours. Social Club needs to log in in order for GTA5 to launch and for the last couple months I haven't been able to log in which means I can't play the game. I tried getting a refund through steam since the game is unplayable for me now but since I have over 2 hours logged I can't get a refund. This is the one game I HIGHLY advice pirating. The pirated version works much better than buying a copy. Rockstar DRM is a ing joke and basically forces a lot of people to pirate the game even AFTER theyve bought it. If you think I'm making things up or am some nube that doesn't know how to PC search the Social Club forums and other forums. They are full of people that have this issue.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,"Normally I would give this game a positive review however due to a recent Cease and Desist taking down one of the oldest and largest mods which enabled other mods to function I cannot reccomend this game if you plan to play this in singleplayer.The singleplayer has been under attack from Take two for a while now. The Hydra which arrived in a DLC allowing the Hydra to be purchased from the ingame store is only available to purchase on the multiplayer So if you had wanted to fly around with the Hydra whenever you'd liked you would be forced to go onto multiplayer which in itself is a Microtransaction cespit of terrible prices. The large group of people who play singleplayer for the modding scene even after already owning the game on another console before are being attacked from this Cease and Desist. So if you plan to buy this game for the modding scene don't. If you plan to play this for the singleplayer DLC add ons don't. If you plan for whatever reason to buy this game for it's god awful multiplayer scene you can do better. Take Two has also recently come out saying that they felt they had ""under charged"" it's users meaning they might be planning to introduce more microtransactions in the near future.TL DR One of the biggest mods which a lot of other mods need so they can fuction has been forced to shut down. DLC doesn't always affect the singleplayer forcing you onto the multiplayer.Multiplayer has terrible Microtransactions.Take Two feel players are ""under charged"".I honestly found this game fun to mess around in either using mods or with my friends but now that Take Two are just attacking the singleplayer users to try and make more money.",Grand Theft Auto V

Not currently the superior version.If you want to get the most out of this game the best fun you can have is only available when you obtain the game by... other means. I love this game but ""those"" users have the superior version of the game. In the Steam version you can get banned for using mods single player or not. Most importantly the game doesn't support a high enough FOV for first person to work. This game is in serious need of some patches as it is currently broken in this regard. It's close to being a great game but certain policies make the game broken. Mods will provide you with the most fun including the unofficial online mods/servers. In order to use this superior version simply don't pay for the Steam (or R*WH) edition of the game. For right now the Steam version is inferior. If Rockstar fixes a few simple policies this will by far be superior in every way to every other version. But for now it is not.Alright they don't ban for Single Player mods. Just make sure your completely revert/remove any files so it looks like this i.imgur.com and then verify game cache to make sure they're clean. Then you can play online.

And all i did was modding money for me and people without bothering anyone because buying shark cards is too expensive for some of ous and playing the game without the new stuff is kind off bluh especially when you play in a server with a rich kid who as everything he wants and keeps killing you with his stupid broke vehicles so yeah i used to love the game but now its just a money company who wants more and more even tho they did well enough money and they keep making alot from people buying the game.My regards Ace,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,325,False,Not Recommended,60% of GTA online is spent in loading screens. That is if you want to actually get done to get fun weapons and vehicles.It's not due to bad computer specs servers are just really bad and sometimes you'll get dropped from servers out of nowhere. Tried and tested among all my friends most of them have better specs yet they have just as much problems as I do.Also the grouping system is quite ed or should I say the lack thereof? You can play one mission with your pals then one of four things will happen 1. One of you guys will drop out of online for no apparent reason.2. You'll be put in a group with other players no one in your crew having host privileges so you can't even kick the unwanted out.3. Someone's game will crash.4.1. You all try to go back to free play mode but you all end up in different sessions so some of you will have to sit in a 5 10 minute long loading screen just to get back together. 4.2. You will end up in the same session again thankfully but someone's game crashed and they have to wait an extra 15 minutes to both start up the game and then have to exit a lobby because the game doesn't realize you want to play with your friends so you got put in a different session and have press Home and specifically tell your game that you want to get put in a game with your friends.Also there's the issue which I'm having right now I've tried to start up the game 3 times in a row all three times I ended up in 10 minute loading screens I.E. server doesn't connect me. Then even if I get connected I can only do one mission and I'll get booted again. And in the off chance that you actually get connected to a server you'll have been auto kicked for AFK because you alt tabbed the game because SERIOUSLY the loading screens are so long and you get bored.Seriously Rockstar fix REAL designated servers MMO servers perhaps? You've got the resources to keep pumping out fantastic updates in an amazing game but what's the point if the players can't play your game?,Grand Theft Auto V

This isn't the first time they have said ""screw the customers"". First they lied about the online gameplay when the game was first released. Then they released it for PC at full price years later still lacking the online experience as was originally promised. Then they charged full price for the game during what was supposed to be a Summer sale stating that the game was marked off 25% but that it comes with about $15 worth of DLC (shark cards.. aka useless in game currency) raising the overall price back to $60. This also means those who bought it could NOT get a full refund if they decided to return the game within the sepcified time because technically DLC (which was what they stated the users were paying for) is non refundable. And now while they have always been against the modding community they are banning OpenIV (GTA V Modding tool) which the community completely loves.

Stop blaming innocent modders and actually fix GTA Online. Do NOT buy this game if you are looking to mod it or play online. The single player is okay but not worth anywhere near $60.

2016-01-27,0,0,214,False,Recommended,I have played this game for about 200 something hours online. This was on the initial ps3/360 release. I recently purchased the game for PC. Overall this is a great game. It still has stability issues and some weirdness. It's partially because the game is so huge literally. But I also feel the need to wag my finger at rockstar for some issues that have existed since launch.Bottom line this game is great. Get it play it. It's not a waste.However there are some issues that need to be pointed out. The game has some stability issues even to this day crashes freezing an acceptable level of frame loss. These issues can be common compared to other similarly proforming games. The single player is great. I have no big issues with it.OnlineAh GTA online. What a novel idea. To best summarize it It's like an abusive romantic partener that you stay with even though you expect better. And eventually you learn to love it. Despite it's faults.My bigest complaints are as follows THE LONGEST LOAD TIMES OF ANY GAME EVER.ALL OF THE HACKERS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS.Rockstar's commitment to selling you in game money instead of fixing anything broken or poorly designed.Trolls joining missions and quitting before or during the job.People who suck. The level one dude who joins a higher level mission because they got the invite. The strange design choice to make GTA online a quasi MMORPG.The odd design to PUNSISH the player for acting like this is a GTA game and killing NPCs and other players.The world of underware &amp dunce caps. Known as bad sport world. Where you go when you blow people's cars up. It's a great game. But it's poorly designed and not supported. Also did I mention the hackers? Because they can make you CTD for telling them they ruin the game. Because they honestly do. I don't pay a subscription fee which is nice. But the rampant instability and extreme level of hacking that happens in this game is enraging. I like this game but I don't like the hackers. I don't like how rockstar treats me like a pinata full of money who dosen't care that the product is crap with perfume.,Grand Theft Auto V

Here is their response ""Regarding product destroyed by the hackers while selling the product We would like to inform you that the Rival Organizations (including other players) and authorities can interrupt your Buy and Sell Missions by either destroying the crates or the cargo planes transporting them. Remember that the job isn t over until all of your Cargo is safely transported. The profit loss from destroyed Cargo crates is part of the risk/reward of the Buy and Sell Missions. Players cannot be reimbursed for Cargo that is lost during Buy and Sell Mission gameplay in GTA Online.The best thing that you can do is to continue to report the hackers and modders in the game. Rest assured we do try our best to take action against cheaters accounts.""Reporting hackers in the game is no use as they never get kicked out real time. Banning people for using hacks is way too slow if you try to report a hacker while in mission to save your product from such players it is no use. Vote kick is also either broken or extremely unfair. You need a lot of people voting to kick a player for the player to be kicked. And when you're in a session with 30 players in it people just don't care enough to vote.The response Rockstar gave me made me feel that they are not addressing the issue and they're not going to. The game will remain filled with hackers.Other point is the clear turn the content has taken they are catering to the below 18 players who love competition. There are overpriced vehicles boring and repetitive missions that don't really reward you clearly a carefully crafted system to sell shark cards to stupid people while making the older playerbase feel ed. Seriously this does not feel like GTA anymore. I've had hundreds of hours of fun in the previous ones and even through the storyline of GTA V but the Online content and current state has become very unenjoyable.If you're going to only play through singleplayer then get it on sale.

The graphics are a massive improvement from the console versions they're not Crisis beautiful but they get the job done. Most importantly get this the game actually runs fantastic. I'm able to maintain a solid 70 80 fps on average easy with my GTX 970. Actually the GPU doesn't do a whole lot it's the CPU that gets pushed. When they recommend an i5 3470 and FX 8350 they mean it. There's only so much you can optimize in a game where there are hundreds of entities on your screen at once. I have an FX 6300 with a slight overclock and the lowest I've dropped to is 40.

Id reccomend you get a CPU with at least 4 cores of 3.8 Ghz and a High end Graphics card before you try and play it. you dont have to have a GTX 980 but you want around a GTX 660 and above. make sure you have atleast 2 Gigs of Video RAM so you can amp those graphics a bit. Now how much RAM should you have? 8 Gigs is enough and has been enough for a LONG TIME! You dont need to go over kill here but if you want to stay to the low numbers and stick with 16 Gigs. This game is ported very well and if you get a exspensive card like a Radeon R9 serires or a Nvidia GTX 900 series and the game is all choppy dont s*** your pants and get a refund. UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS! Always keep your GPU/Graphics Card drivers to date if not new games will be very choppy and unplayable. Keep this is mind too. Drivers for your GPU are FREE!!! If you ever pay for them seek a refund. Just search your GPUs Drivers on google and you will find a link. So Can you run the game? If you feel the need to ask... and you feel that your PC is kinda bad... well probably NOT!Save that money to Upgrade before you buy this game and have to play it on 800 x 600 with 25 30 FPS.*Update* Recently Rockstar released an update that seems to have fixed the GTA Online hacker problem. Either way I feel my statement still stands GTA Online is more fun with friends if you dont have any make some. ) I highly recommend this game.*Update* So in the amount of time I've played this game I've had to re install the entire game (yes even after a ""Verfied Game Cache"") 4 times. One of which was becuase I reformated my Harddrive that the game was installed on. So a total of 3 times caused by the game itself. So yeah be ready for that.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-26,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V was a good edition to the PC market. However it came out two years later than it should have. This game was fun for a while. The Campaine is good but lacking in choice. The Multiplayer is lacking in general not much to do but murder people.Simply the fact the Rockstar has shut down multiply modding projects for GTAV makes me feel that they no longer respect the community.,Grand Theft Auto V

This recent legal action is taking place long long after many millions of people purchased the game with the intention/belief that modding would be something they could do freely.

2017-06-15,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,Honestly Grand Theft Auto 5 has always deserved a not recommended for me. Since launch it has been plagued with low FPS and stuttering despite my pc far exceeding the recommended specs. Any attempts at contacting Rockstar in order to get a fix or help were met with no response and the thousands of forum posts documenting the same problem as me are still without a solution that works for all. However with the news that Take Two interactive are essentially putting and end to openIV and with it PC modding for GTA V I find its a good a time as any to point out the only reason I got 200 hours in this game was because mods as I could look past the awful stuttering when launching cars into space. I honestly could not recommend this product at all as Take Two seem more interested in money than player enjoyment and fun in a game should always take precedent.

2017-10-25,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,"Don't get this game. You will meet so much try hards and hackers. You will meet try hards of every race dissing you in another language while they use expolsive ammo for snipers and miniguns and expolsives close range. They will run after you kill them a couple of times. They just go ghost orginization(Off Radar for entire crew) to run get bull shark(boost that allows you to take and give more damage) and snipe or try and rush you. Or they just might go ghost orginization and get a armored truck or a car with guns to catch you by surprise. And if you say that you will just ""leave them alone"" just know you can't. They will try and kill you if you are minding you own business. Take it for me don't get this game i owned it on ps4 previously and wanted to see if was different on pc but it is not. The main thing i did with the time i have on this broken game is main get into gun fights with lvl 200+ people who try hard even when i am not even lvl 90. They will just the minigun on you like with was a normal assault rifle. The have no care they will kill you if you even if you are lvl 2 because they want to boost their kill/death ratio.Just don't buy the game.EDIT Also every thing is over priced so if you want to pay 10 000 for a shirt in gta online(which all of the first part will take place in) then go for it. All the cars are also over priced so if you want a car(The cars that are not slow and the ones that have cool customization cost basicly $1 000 000+) and you do not want to work for it then that will be $20 of your real life money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-24,0,0,179,False,Not Recommended,Singelplayer is the only aspect worth buying in my honest opinion. The storyline is fantastic the world is alive and gorgeous and everythings just as fun and enjoyable as you would expect from a GTA title.But the focus here was clear from the getgo Online multiplayer. ( TLDR microtransactions the game)Originally it was extremely fun. it delivered the experience of the same open alive wolrd that singleplayer has. Ive got hundreds of ours in the original on xbox 360 and opted for the PC version when it became avalible on the relaunch. After that the money grabbing started. Every DLC added more content with ever soaring prices. When that didnt get as many sharkcard sales as rockstar wanted they started locking DLC content behind extremely expensive must buy objects. You need to spend 8 million on X building to even acess X content because thats the only place you can store it. The prices kept going up and the mission payouts stayed the same. You will spend hundreds of hours to amass a small ammount of cash. Rockstar has pulled out every stop to force your hand to buy sharkcards. The only other way is hacking and boy are there a lot of hackers. Rockstar didnt care about the player experience being ruined by the antics of said hackers untill some robin hood types started spawning money. This cuased a knee jerk reaction to ban the use of any mod software including single player mods. Modding the game in any sense would result in a ban Except it didnt stop the online hacking It was just a huge middle finger to the loyal singleplayer fanbase.I have been a loyal GTA fan since the original top down style games. III and Vice city basically turned me into a gamer. I remember every kid in my neighboor hood going over to one friends house to take turns with Vice city and San Andreas. I will not give a cent or a minute of my time to rockstar or take two again. They have shown that fans mean nothing in the wake of easy cash and that we are just wallets to open.,Grand Theft Auto V

The biggest changes are of course the 3 protagonists that you can switch between at any time the introduction of a first person mode and the story structure itself which revolves around pulling off heists. The single player story is rewarding and fun the heists are interesting to plan and execute! The multiplayer mode is a mixed bag due to hackers etc. but overall I had fun with it. Your mileage may vary! I spent most of my multiplayer time in a group with IRL friends doing the heist missions etc. Overall a great experience and totally worth your time.I think I spent 5 or more hours of my playtime just cruising over the hills on a dirt bike listening to the radio ),Grand Theft Auto V

I recently moved for university and both of my roommates play GTA Online on PC so we have a lot of fun playing together. I will admit the online by yourself is not that fun I found it very boring. The only thing I do dislike about GTA V's online is there is no way to play freeroam like in GTA IV. You have to worry about money and other such stuff in GTA V unlike GTA IV. GTA V brings looooads of content compared to GTA IV but there really is no online sandbox mode which is really upsetting.

2017-08-09,0,0,410,False,Recommended,Updated ReviewToday I beat the main story to this game it only took me 2 4 months to beat though.When I got this game I played it consistently up until the end where you must confront Merryweather this is because there is a gamebreaking bug in the game and switching between characters seems to crash the game... That's not very impressive for a triple A title.Moving along... Today I got up the motivation to finally take another shot at the ending of the game all I had to do was not switch between characters during gameplay and that seemed to phase out the crashes still very unacceptable for a triple A title.Other than that bug this game is wonderful and I recommened it (and don't switch between characters after you rob the bank for $200M... the only time I switched characters was when it was necessary to further the plot of the game).To note something... I realize that every game reacts to every computer differently because there is different hardware in everyone's machines... But I don't think that that fact alone justifies selling a really expensive game that's broken.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-15,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,Good game at least the narrative is. It's a bit pricey $75AU but I'm sure you can find it on sale some time in the year. How does it run? I'm using a 4760k gtx 770 and 8gb ram and it works for the most part at 60 90fps.The game has some mindnumbing frame drops especially if you pull up steam overlay and leave a window open.As for the gameplay it's for the most part a solid effort but be warned the controls for a keyboard and mouse are sometimes really stupid. For example driving a car feels a bit clustered around the wasd keys. After taking a long break from the game I don't think I can recommend the game. The controls are garbage and it feels like nothing ever responds the way you are inputting it maybe it's input lag but I highly doubt that.

2016-07-01,0,0,95,False,Recommended,GTA V has to be one of the best games ever made. For fans of GTA you pretty much know what to expect the smart and at times dark humour characters you can't help but love even though you would hate them in real life should they cross your path. The game centres around three different characters each are different in their own way A rich Ray Liotta character the young black guy who is the next big thing on the crime scene and a lunatic hill billy who was by far my favourite character. Each have individual missions some hilarious and random and main story is highly entertaining and I loved watching the characters succeed the usual buying properties and garages new gear customising cars etc and then having all three characters work together towards a huge final mission in the end. The game looks amazing on PC and all the more enjoyable exploring the open world of San Andreas especially when you go rogue and fly yourself off buildings and out of planes. Overall I would highly recommend this game. TO NOTE I haven't played the online content of GTA. As the game is so huge I moved on to play a few other games once I completed all missions. So my review is not based on GTA Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have a pretty decent rig but couldnt quite max out the settings but still....damn good. Story line is deep and completely belivable.Story mode mode is fantastic.Multiplayer mode is fun the first couple times until you realize all you are doing is grinding....for the sake of grinding. Not my thing but others seems to like it.basically this is a solid title and should be worht a $40 purchase for another year yet and then into the fture this game should still demand $20 to $30 until the next one comes out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-22,0,0,130,False,Recommended,TL DR This game is really good.GTA V has exceeded my expectations in every way the characters in single player are believable the world feels big enough to explore and enjoy without being overly massive the Online component is awesome fun with friends I could go on but that would take too long.My one major complaint is the propensity of hackers. I don't care if someone wants to hack themselves in an infinite ammount of money and every vehicle in the game that wrecks their fun not mine but the most common occurence is hackers screwing with your camera auto ejecting you from any vehicle you enter and adding massive invisible blocks all over the map just to screw with you. That being said roughly 50% of the lobbies I enter have some sort of hacker and roughly 10% have the jerkwad variety.if you switch lobbies whenever you get a jerkwad you spend 5 minutes in a loading screen for a much better experience.If I could change one thing it would be the lack of anticheat but since I cannot I'll just give this game the rating I would if it had no cheaters 9/10 Never stop playing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,I really enjoyed this game I even bought some money for it at the beginning. But then the microtransactions kept coming and never stopped. They added so much stuff locked behind either 50 hours of playtime to get one car or 50 dollars for it.

2017-06-20,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,It was a hard decision for me to give this game a thumbs down or a negative review in general. I have always loved the Grand Theft Auto games and the amazing job that Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive has done in creating these living and breathing worlds.The addition of online multiplayer was interesting at first but I came soon to realize that I much prefered to play offline (mostly due to the fact that there is always cheating/griefing/trolling online). I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy some of my experiences online but it was always frustrating. Therfore I avoided it for the most part and focused on offline play.So I am extremely disapointed in Rockstar's decision to essentially end modding for Grand Theft Auto V. I was just beginning to learn how to use OpenIV and a couple of these other mods to enhance my single player experiences in the game. It's a shame to think that they would do this to the PC gaming community and I am therefore giving the game a negative review.Besides that the game is one of the most enjoyable GTA experiences that I have played. Great story and characters lots of action and comedy. Typical GTA entertainment with amazing visuals and easy controls.,Grand Theft Auto V

There have been times where I got to see these white street lights go off but that's as far as I've gotten. I have tried reinstalling the client and that fails to work and after checking the integrity of game cache all files were 100% validated successfully no errors. I tried this before the reinstall as well as after it. In fact I may just upload a video showing exactly what I do when I launch the game. My youtube username is Andyman99999 (haha).I recommend it now. The game runs really well on my setup... I'm still in disbelief that my Xbox 360 controller kept crashing the game in device manager when you're suppose to be able to use it to play (I don't use it to play btw)... Unplugging the controller from the pc and then restarting isn't enough to solve the issue. You have to disable the controller in device manager. I do believe this issue may be fixed now but thanks to myself upgrading to windows 10 and not having the drivers for the 360 controller (thanks Microsoft for not letting me use 3rd party 360 controllers since they have unsigned drivers).

Amazing graphics and attention to enviroment detail. Holy the rain looks amazing. Voice acting 10/10 Lots of customization for guns cars and your body. Sadly none for your cribs. Missions are fresh and fun. Extras ConsThere are no game breaking problems or any major issues it's just some little things that really bothered me for a game that went overboard in so many areas while others were neglected so. Your cars Your purchased and customized cars vanish or get impounded if you dont park it in a garage and if you boost 2 cars before retrieveing it from impound it's gone forever. No Refund. Start a mission odds are your car can't be used so it's impounded. Also you are stuck with ass cars for ""Your"" car to use in main missions. Money Other than buying expensive vehicles and property(Useless except garages) I felt like there really was no point to it I could always buy guns ammo and anything else I wanted without giving it a second thought. I've done two playthroughs and realized I didn't hold up a single person or liquor store for $20.

2016-07-07,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer story was great. Favorite protagonist is Michael.I think multiplayer is good as long as you have at least other 3 friends to play with as planning is way easier and no solo rambos dying by every chance given. If you do go play heists or missions with randoms be sure that you have the time to play for the next 5 hours even to NOT complete Edit Im just going to make this negative just because the game is made boring due to all the grinding you need to do to get anything the pay on some missions are uneven and it aint even that high to get some cool vehicles. The story is still okay but to achieve 100% R has put way too much collectibles for the player to find that makes it boring. GTA IV physics and pedestrian/cop AI were way more fun to mess with and it saddens to not see them in this game. Also you could go into the buildings in GTA IV with guns and without any loading screens as they were easily accessible. And the world size... Where is Las Venturas?? Where s San Fierro?? And also where s the other small countryside villages? But the one thing I mostly hate about this game is when you try to lose the cops. They know where you are even thou they dont. Try to hide into an alley and watch as they all go there to inspect for any criminal activities that didnt happen even at a distance of a few blocks.,Grand Theft Auto V

The fact that Rockstar couldn't get their anti cheat fixed and online cheating under control to the point where Take Two had to step in to this extent is absolutely disgusting.

2017-06-18,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,"GTA Online loading screen simulator and hacker fest due to p2p based networking. Takes forever for job lobbies to fill up because of horrible matchmaking. I'm sure I spent 30% of my logged hours in loading screens and waiting for matchmaking. Over inflated price because of corporate greed to push shark card sales. Godawful customer support response time measured in months.Singleplayer it's good but no SP DLC in sight. Potential for new content (in terms of mods or otherwise) basically nonexistent now after Take Two expressed their hostility toward the entire modding community. But really don't get it unless you really like the singleplayer or can put up with the toxic online communities grind for virtual cash and ridiculous loading and waiting times. Also your hardwork in GTAO could be undone in an instant from temp bans which removes everything you own without a chance for appeal. Shouldn't be an issue if you don't cheat but if you're the unlucky sod who get falsely banned for reasons you don't even know well sucks to be you then since ""all bans are final"".

2015-06-19,0,0,512,False,Recommended,I will be honest with my review. Hopefully it will useful somebody who would like to buy this game.Pros Open World. Long interactive story line in Single Player. A lot of vehicles. (Ground/Air/Sea) In depth character customization. (Online) Passive mode online so players can't kill you. Nice and smooth weather system with day/night cycle. Multiplayer. Heists in the Online. Buyable properties in both SP and MP. A lot of mini games races. Community made missions and maps. Mods in Single Player Crew and grouping system. PvPCons Expensive. Hackers/Scripters. Ability to use real money to buy in game money. You can get banned if you get in touch with a cheater. You can randomly get disconnected from the server Very few heist and story in the Online part of the game. A bit bad community. (I mean players just walk around you and kill you.)Conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a beautiful game. With such a big game there is bound to be issued but nothing that breaks your fun. Create your own Crew/Gang/Group/... on the Rockstar Social Club website get in the game and have fun with your crew members.10/10(If you found this review helpful consider giving it a thumbs up!),Grand Theft Auto V

The controls are simple in theory but difficult in practice. ONLINE Rockstar does disturbingly little to combat hackers. ONLINE Money is incredibly difficult to earn with the only viable ways to make any serious cash being heists or buying ""cash cards"" for real money. This only encourages players to get hacks to give themselves the money they want. ONLINE It can be difficult to use special vehicles you've purchased (such as helicopters or tanks) due to the Pegasus system.

I strongly suggest that nobody purchase this game even if it is eventually fixed for the majority of users. It is honestly ridiculous.

Then you have GTA V Online AWESOME. yes there is the constant players killing you BUT you can always go on a invite only session so you are on your own (Solo session diables some features) the only two things I have noticed is it can be quite hard to get a lot of money if you don't know where to look and to register yourself as a vip or president you ahve to be on a public session but if you have a friend in an invite only session join that and it keeps your title.Oh and don't hack they don't take it lightly.",Grand Theft Auto V

That being said if you don't have friends this game is a REAL pain. There is so much grinding in GTA Online it's insane. Playing with friends helps alleviate this somewhat by making the grinding slight more fun and faster but it's still a pain. GTA V single player is really enjoyable there's no grinding at all and I thought that the main story was really fun. I would definitely wait for this game to go on sale and if you play on playing GTA Online be prepared for a lot of grinding and lots of people trying to ruin your fun if you're trying to grind.,Grand Theft Auto V

If that bothers you and don't like being told what you can and can't do with a product you purchased then vote with your dollar and stop buying Rockstar games I certainly will be which is a shame because I was looking forward to the new Red Dead release.

2016-01-24,0,0,727,False,Not Recommended,Story mode is amazing great characters funny screenplay cinematic as hell. All around great. Online on the other hand has potential and really was great. But it's rampant with cheaters and modders who take money out of your accounts spawn everyone in one spot and kill on repeat teleport you in the air and get you stuck to objects. Rockstar adds new free DLCs which is great but they're all so irrelevant to each other and the content is way too expensive to be afforded with Shark Cards or grinded ingame. Impossible to progress in public server missions due to everyone else trolling. It was fun and simple when it started out but now has become a total cancer project. Instead of fixing bugs DLCs modding cheaters and making aspects of the game more realistic and relevant to each other they just pump out more irrelevant DLCs and money from the public and turn down your tickets. If you want customer service call Rockstar. You'll get better service that way. It's a fun game and it's sad to see it go downhill but get it on sale enjoy the single player and if you can tolerate multiplayer it's a lot of fun to play with friends especially stunt races.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,123,False,Recommended,It's a good game but Take Two Interactive has just effectively shut down the modding scene for this game by cease and desisting OpenIV which has been in development for 10 years and has been endorsed by Rockstar themselves.

2016-11-04,0,0,376,False,Recommended,"Alright.... There's a lot of contreoversy surrounding this game in terms of microtransactions and whatnot. I'm going to try and cover each common issue in this review. Now for some people these issues make the game unplayable. And honestly I really wish R* would address these things. But they don't.Hackers If I'm going to be honest it doesn't seem like R* has any sort of anticheat service other than ""ban the out of everyone."" It seems like every time I play I catch myself in a lobby with hackers. These guys are s. They will blow the out of you with an invincible hydra (attack plane) while you're trying to run missions. If you can get into a solo public lobby (check the guides) then it's not an issue.Banning modding This is total t. In fact it almost made me quit. I never modded the game but the lack of respect R* has for their PC fans by doing this is ridiculous. I imagine that if like I do with Skyrim that if I played mods regularly this would be a dealbreaker for me. We're not console gamers. If people are playing custom races w/o RP and cash rewards or if they're not affecting anyone else then what's the issue? They even banned it from singleplayer from what I hear. Ridiculous. But still it doesn't affect me personally.Microtransactions It's clear that these guys really really want you to buy shark cards. Pay real money get in game money. This is a pay to win model. It puts those who don't buy them at a disadvantage. On top of that a lot of the mission rewards have become pretty stingy. Either you grind or you buy shark cards. Kinda bull.Another issue I have with this game is that the game rewards you for making other players miserable. If I wanted to play competitive I would select a competitive mode. But instead I try doing co op in a lobby perhaps running cargo and a random ""criminal damage challenge"" pops up. It literally tells you to grief other players in game. Encouraging this sort of behavior has made the community toxic.Despite all that I still think the game is worth playing. I like combat racing the huge world and I love feeling like I'm a criminal emperor. But sometimes these issues get pretty frustrating.",Grand Theft Auto V
