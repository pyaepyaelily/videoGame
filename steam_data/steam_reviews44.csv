2017-10-19,0,0,910,False,Recommended,Great game has a constant flow of updates so there is always something new being added. The devs have yet to give up on this one. One issue I have is the lack of performance optimization for low end machines actually any machine will have some massive lag spikes. Still good and i believe that they will get it some day.,Rust

2018-11-24,0,0,968,False,Recommended,If you were to ask me what my favourite game is right now I probably wouldnt say rust. But I also have basically 1000 hours in this game and it was the best purchase I have every made in my life. If your willing to look past the toxicity (or maybe you like that) and you are willing to try over and over again then this is the game for you. p.s this is the hardest game i've ever played (good luck).,Rust
2017-07-31,0,0,1235,False,Recommended,Rust is a harsh game. I only have just over 1000 hours in the game and i can safely say that i've had a fair share of different experiences. Personally i love the game but playing wipe after wipe can be pretty repetitive. Finding a server without a zerg and that doesnt die within a night can be challenging but rewarding when you succeed. I recommend the game but personally i would wait for a sale before purchasing as your experience may vary at first. ),Rust

2016-12-18,0,0,966,False,Not Recommended,Fun game when your playing with a group or even just with one other friend. Bad thing is it can get boring after a while if your playing on solo you'll just slowly descend into insanity as you start talking to the wooden wall you made then you'll probably start eating nakeds like a mad man. So from what you learnd don't play solo unless you would like to become insane play with some friends good game recommended 10/10 please send helpto this day this game still makes me want to die and i cry every night cuz of this game but its still funone of the worst ing games ever made filled with ing queers that have no lifes and just sit on their roof 24/7 and just camp you they sweat until they get ak 2hrs into bp wipe and then camp their ing zerg base in a ing trio server? okay ye sound legit and you game can't even ing run without crashing runs like ing like srsly how ing long does it take to optimize a ing game man holy you keep adding all this ing t like hot air ball n ing electricity but half of the pc's that run you're game can't ing handle it and what the is wrong with this game my ing game crashes when i click exit. no i doesn't shut down it ing freezes like some ing down syndrome retard when he rapes a child for the first time. you,Rust

2018-11-04,0,0,1710,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My friend bought this game for me in 2015. I remind him everytime I meet up with him that this is the best gift anyone has ever given me. It is a really difficult game if you play by yourself but it is fun. You can do so many different things. If fighting pvp is your thing this game has it. If you want to create awesome bases you can do it here. If you want to go around and talk with people you can as well. I'd suggest you watch a couple of guys on twitch to see if this is your game because you will definitely need about 30 hours before you even get somewhat grounded in the basics.,Rust

2019-01-03,0,0,91,False,Recommended,It is possibly the best game i ever bought. First the graphics are stunning. Then the gameplay yeah the community is bad but under it is the concept of raiding and blueprints which add a whole new concept to the game.,Rust
2019-01-03,0,0,36,False,Recommended,This game is fun but you do need at least one other person that you know personally or that you met in game that you trust. The lonewolf mthod of getting to the top is extremely hard for newcomers raiders and jsut overall game experience cause you need to grind. Having two or more people makes the game more fun in general and can make grinding more interesting. For example if you are getting resources and talking to your friend you could be discussing the game base layouts raid plans etc. But by yourself you are thinking to yourself and feel lonely sometimes. I regret not haveing anyone else that I know play on a computer. Most kids in my school are playing Fortnut on the Xbox and PS4 (looking for a friend). The community can be toxic with people cheating and backstabbing but if you are lucky the game experience will be good. Summary9/10 recommend it bring friend(s) leanr mechanics in low pop server and don't switch servers because the blueprints that you have in one doesn't transfer to the other. I learned this the hard way by only going into one server and got raided. Lost my entire base. Raged and promised myself not to ever go into that server. Went into a different server and needed to start from scratch. It really frustrating when you are near endgame with electricity and stuff.,Rust

2018-07-28,0,0,285,False,Recommended,There's a harsh learning curve especially on high population servers which turned me off from the game for a while but once you play YOU PLAY. This game really highlights how vicious and predatory humans are.,Rust
2018-11-27,0,0,598,False,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore survival game that heavily focuses on pvp elements with pve as flavor. Yes people get clans together to dominate servers but that happens on every game with servers that's within or even remotely similar to the genre. The gunplay is good each map is beautiful and unique and the experiences cam be priceless. Is it worth $34.99? Yeah but I'd grab it on sale or on because why wouldn't you? The best part of this game though is the developers. They released a game on early access and they delivered whole heartedly. FacePunch Studios contiues to update this game every single month with updates on what people in the community are up to as well just to keep everybody a little strung together and in the know on what's poppin. Grab some friends play Rust and have fun. will happen.,Rust

2019-01-04,0,0,521,False,Recommended,A great game with literally thousands of hours worth of play time that just becomes the biggest problem with this game for me. Its a time killer. You might struggle to keep up if you havent got much free time to dedicate to this game. Between server wipes and just being raided you need to be online or you lose almost all progression. You also need to keep up with updates and changes which happen every week or 2. The community isnt as toxic as people make out. Modded servers are great. The occasional cheater. Good solo but way better with friends. One of my all time favourite multiplayer games I just dont have the time to sink in to it to get anywhere solo.,Rust

2018-10-28,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,My first review.After years of playing the old version of rust i decided to give it another go.after loading up the game i wanted to play single player just to see how things work there is none your forced to play on a server. So i decided lets take a server with less players the lowest was around 30 aftter loading the game ( took almost 30 minutes) i landed on the beach and decided to lower the graphics down a bit.The game tells you what to do like gather 100 wood and so on i never got to the point of finishing the quest why well the game shows its true color you get killed alot by other players people in full gear and ak 47 or bows that are hunting noobs because they cant fight back and there to scared to lose there gear to other players that are geared to the teeth.Ill call this game the bullies simulator.Iff you like been killed over and over again getting not even to the building base part then this game is for you.Looking around to find stone thinking there are so many mountains and big rocks but you cant mine them no its those weird looking stones with a small sun shining on it those can be mined.Not to mention it takes 100 wood to make a simple wooden spear.You would probebly say why not go to a differend server i did i even encounter a guy who cheated and i got 1 shotted by a ak 47 from far away.I cant recommend a game that has a toxic community that like to kill and humiliate new players iff you die they take your stuff and iff they dont need it they drop it somewhere so it despawns.,Rust

Yet I somehow keep coming back to this game time and time again. The base building is fun and you really have to be creative when designing it to help defend off raiders and also make the raiders really work to get to your hard earned loot. The weapons are based across 3 tiers with each tier getting stronger and more powerful. I wouldn't get to attached to your weapons though you might lose them.,Rust

2018-08-21,0,0,246,False,Recommended,I actually do love this game it looks like I have more hate for it than love but thats not true. I may not have alot of hours in this game but I do have the understanding of rust's mechanics. I am a guy who mostly loves FPS games since I was a child and this is just a unique one ( off ark)You start with a rock and a torch you hit some tress down get a stone node get a hatchet and pickaxe build a base and then the rest of the path is in your hands its truly magical what the paths can lead up to but it can be a rollercoaster of emotions.What I love Just pop into a server and start doing what u are able to go from nothing to a king having the feeling of winning 1 v 3 battle raid someone and it actually being worth it learn everything once and be able to craft it all the time until the server wipes actually finding someone who won't betray you (super rare like a shiny pokemon) having people around with an actual mic so you can negotiate something getting your first gun is a incredible feeling having a great start in a freshly 100+ player wiped server not dying getting to the dome top or the water treatment plant parkour the bandit camp has been a pretty good addition in my opinion.well I listed everything I really love about rust theres no way its perfect tho.What I HATE in rust 1) Most of the people in a rust server cause they don't ever use a mic2) When exploring barrels you can get blueprints like 5 or so no one needs them JUST ADD MORE RANDOM BLUEPRINTS FFS THAT ACTUALLY HELP 3) Getting raided as a solo player against 3 fully geared guys who know they wont get materials to break even spending 4k of sulfur (kys but to be fair solo players should stick to solo servers5) optimization of the game is aids I play on very weird and mixed up graphics why cant it just be more simple and understanding for everyone?6)I love losing all my progress by a guy with a semi auto in a server that was wiped 5 hrs ago 7) I mean you still may be in denial about it BUT DONT TRUST RANDOM PEOPLE IN RUST ITS JUST A SCIENTIFIC FACT8) Getting outplayed but a guy with worse gear and beating you is super infuriating9)Compound bow is dog thanks. Nailgun is even better.10) You killed a guy who had a custom smg? TOO BAD FOR YOU SMG BODYS ARE SO ING RARE (not rly green crates just look for places with green crates like Dome top or something casual like a supermarket its a 17% chance for it out of them) SEMI BODY'S ARE SO MUCH EASIER TO FIND LIKE CMON.11) as a wise man once said ' YOUR SKINS' fREAKAZOID 2k1512) Some people say some of the dumbest on the planet in this game no joke. (if they even can talk)13) Getting spawned and chased by a guy with a bow.14) random pernament characters I get what the creator wanted to do with this BUT LET US CHOOSE THAT TO SOME EXTENTIf you want to buy the game 1) actually have a good pc 2) store this on SSD ONLY3)if u have money sure buy it full price I would recommend for a sale tho.4) understand that this will make you a sick degenerate person.5) your gonna want to ragequit a lot but never give up.YEEET,Rust

This is to this day probably the game I've enjoyed most coming on every day and grinding the game for multiple hours on end with friends. It's given me probably the most saddest of times when you farm a full inventory and loose it to a naked with a bow and the greatest times raiding and gaining the best of loot.Atm the stage where it's at the Component/BP stage. It's a game you basically cannot play solo unless you play on a strictly SOLO ONLY server.. Most of the times you'll be killed by 3+ groups while you're roaming around farming or going on scrap runs and it gets pretty frustrating.I would recommend this as a 8/10 for now and i'm still wishing that they renewed the good old bp's.,Rust

2018-10-29,0,0,263,False,Recommended,I see a lot of complaints but pretty much everything some people hate about this game is fixed on modded servers. Don't like the grind? Go to a 5x gather rate server. Don't like having to supply your tool cabinet? Go on a no decay server. You want to explore and get used to the game without dying every 5 minutes? Go on a low pop server. You want to log on and instantly go kill someone with a big rock? Join a 300 man server. Whatever playing style you like there's a server for you.But no matter what....expect to die and get raided. I probably was killed 10+ times before I got my first kill. And just remember...just because you're naked and just have a rock doesn't mean you can run up on a guy with assault rifle and kill him. I've done it!

2016-07-25,0,0,526,False,Not Recommended,"The last time I reviewed this game I gave it a thumbs up.Now I can't recommend it anymore.The gameplay is fun and challenging base building is awesome and seeing everyones creativity in how they make their base to counter raiders can be very unique and interesting. For most the climatic moment of this game is when you/your group finally has farmed up enough to which you are loaded with gear weapons ammo and C4 and are reading to go out and raid some major base and have a big battle against the Base Home Owners and counter Raiders. For me the climatic moment of this game is after building my base w/ my group the base being put to the test and defending our loot and home against the army of +5 &gt +10 raiders.However overall the community and the games current state ruins it all... AdvancementWant to be geared up with the top notch guns armor and base defenses?1. Find a AK (very rare) (can take hours)2. Farm up a bunch of scrap (can take up to 30mins)3. Research the gun using a blueprint bench w/ your scrap to guarantee blueprint (gun breaks)4. Farm up supplies to make the AK since the last one broke (also rare) (can take hours)5. Craft your AK!Congrats you have a AK!Now do this process again for the AK ammo(s) (regular explosive high velocity) Pistol ammo(s) Thompson Pump shotgun Shotgun ammo(s) Turret Shotgun trap Bolt rifle Sub gun Semi rifle Rocket launcher Rockets C4 Revolver Python Revolver Semi pistol Chest plate Face mask Bucket helmet Garage doors Giant walls LR 300 (Assault Rifle) M249etc.I think you get the point.Unless you're lucky enough to find the blueprint while you're gathering resources it's going to take days to perhaps even weeks before you get even a fraction of good gear equipment and base defenses. All in which time you will likely get attacked and raided and have to rebuild your base and refarm the resources for upkeep.&gt As a solo player that is. If you're lucky maybe you can find a group of players who already have the blueprints that will get you farmed up. But good luck finding a group to join.Solo playing vs Team playingUnless you're a pro the only way to enjoy this game is with friends.&gt The only way to be successful is if you have a group of +2 players.Good luck finding anyone to team with as no one is looking for teammates.If you do manage to find people to team with there's a chance you may be betrayed by them because they joined another team.As a solo noob player good lucking gathering resources to build your base repair the base keep supplying your tool cupboard to keep your base from decaying away and creating tools/weapons to match the other players around you. You'll never make a base that can defend against the groups of dedicated players that farm up C4 all day and are all geared up. while you are still stuck with crossbows / basic weak gun weaponry. You'll never be able to raid your gear back from those dedicated players when their base is huge filled with traps turrets armored walls/doors large walls surrounding it multilayered walls (hunnycombing) etc. as making just 1 C4 can take forever to get the ingrediants for let alone getting the blueprint to be able to make it in the first place and getting the weapons and armor to match fighting the other groups while also being outnumbered etc.ZergsRust used to have an issue with lots of zergs.&gt Aka groups with mass amounts of players that dominate the server.And some servers still have many zergs.Servers have begun countering this by making server rules that are Solo Duo and/or Trio groups only.But this just leads to a new problem in which you have a hard time finding a group to join since everyone is either already maxed or satisfied and untrusting of bringing in new players to their group.Casual vs Pro/DedicatedIf my previous points haven't made it clear already you can't really play and enjoy this game as a casual. This game is a grind fests. Constant farming to keep your base standing while also trying to advance to be able to match the players who have teammates.Closing ReviewI criticized this game when they removed blueprints in exchange for the XP system in which you unlocked blueprints through farming however before the XP system blueprints were not extremely rare and resources to make equipment / weapons were not rare either.&gt It wasn't quick either but getting everything didn't take weeks of farming (solo player).It seems that with every update the developers are trying to find more ways to make players grind. Trying to slow the pace of the game more and more.I used to hop on this game every few months to see the new updates. I would slave for a group until I earned their trust and I would join that group and assist in raids defending farming etc.Now it seems no one is looking for slaves no one is looking for additions to their team.The game does seem to be taking a direction into PvE by adding NPC Scientists and Bandits along with Outposts giving some sort of civilization which adds a Fallout vibe.&gt Hostile Scientists (Blue Scientists)&gt Bandit Outpost (Friendly NPC Bandits but NOT a Safe Zone) and Military Outpost (Green Scientists / Safe Zone)However the NPCs are currently broken with having perfect accuracy.Plus the Attack Helicopter that has been in the game for a while the Tank etc.I know its cliche as everyone else says the same thing but ""the community is toxic"".Its very difficult to find anyone to team with so you'll likely be stuck solo unless you have friends who already own the game or plan to buy the game with you.You won't get far solo unless you become a pro and invest the majority of your life to grinding and playing all day and night.I am hoping for the old Rust to come back.&gt Not Legacy as that is already availableBut I am hoping for team finding to become easier in the future and for this grindfest to be toned back down some.In it's current state find some other game. If you don't have friends to play with this game will be a stressful waste of time bore of a grind...",Rust

2018-10-31,0,0,1170,False,Recommended,I love this game. I hate this game. This is the perfect game. The crazy highs and the crazy lows. Making plays and ing up peoples days ruining lives and adding skulls to my colection. Getting raided geting ganked by a geared AK as a naked with nothing but stone toools and mats to make your base. Rage quiting but getting back on a few minutes later and starting all over. It is literally all the components to fuel the addict lifestlye a rollercoaster. I play solo 99% of the time and I still have a great time. I die frequently and get but keep moving. I go on crazy kill streaks and get tons of loot just to let it sit there. then lose it. But i love it. I have put plenty of time in this game and I never plan on quitting. I love the toxicity and i love the friendships i've made. I've been called horible things but I've made friends that ive met IRL a d love. The devs are amazing and constantly update and work on the game. They really care. The current component/Blueprint system isn't my favorite and it sort of hurts the solo player but it doesnt stop me from coming back. I really love Rust and i hope that It continues to grow,Rust

2018-10-30,0,0,428,False,Recommended,Rust It has its ups and downs. While it is a very nice looking game and is fun to play there are a couple negatives to counter it and even the playing field out.Graphics Exceptionally good sunsets are very nice IMO. Large forests and open areas both look beautiful. If you want to pump up your graphics you'll need a pretty nice PC to get acceptable frame rates. Although there are a lot of hardcore players on here to get the best performance PVP wise you need to tweak your graphics to see other players with the best quality.Gameplay Very fun to play with a group of 3 or more. Gives the battlefield more diversity and it allows you to make some admirable plays on enemies. Even larger groups make it hilarious to play as you mostly mess around with eachother and roam. The larger the group the more you dominate. Friendliness is a give and take. Too much friendliness leads to you losing most of your items and gets you killed. But enough friendliness lets you team up with others and can lead to some pretty cool raids or PVP fights. Be careful who you team up with though. Lots of backstabbers in this game that are selfish for loot.This game requires a mid tier amound of farming but that depends on what kind of server you play. The server browser allows you to make your own server as well as choose from modded vanilla and custom build servers. Custom servers let you train and get a feel for what most of Rust is like. This game has its wins and losses. Don't make any stupid moves that you think is logical but could cost you hours of farming. Treat everything with care and make sure you design your base well so it has a better chance against raiders. Location of your base is key if you want to succeed. On the flip side if you're the one raiding make sure you know what you're doing. Explosives are valuable and rare in this game so wasting them will cost you. Make sure your friends are trained to play this game. Watch your back. Have fun playing solo. Community Whoa.I would divide the community of Rust into 5 sections The nice people the zergs the tryhards the toxic and the suspicious cheaters. Everybody except the nice people have a fair amount of toxicity. 10% tryhards 25% cheaters 35% toxic 20% zergs 10% nice people overall. The cheaters will always dismiss that they're cheating and will rain toxic comments down upon you to make them look better. Before I forget There is an overwhelming amount of younger kids on here. They're annoying cocky as hell and get super toxic when you have the upper hand.Early Access That's about it it's in EA. Only problems with this is bugs can be found optimization could be improved and there is a chance of future updates that could ruin the game. That being said about EA let's move on to the PRICE.PRICE It's not worth $35 IMO. If it were a full game with a little bit more content sure. I'd say right now it's worth $20 $25. Wait for it to be on sale. Sure it's fun and it has its moments but this game has been out for 5+ years. TL DR This game is often toxic full of cheaters and little kids but the graphics are pretty nice and gameplay is always diverse giving you hours of endless play. Super fun to play with groups that know what they're doing. The occasional disoriented player in your group is fun too. Just don't let them go out with a full metal kit and an AK.7.5/10.,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,281,False,Not Recommended,"I used to play this game back in legacy. I loved it then. Now it is a completely different story and nothing but a waste of time in the end. Unfortunately that's how it will always be.This game is a breeding ground for the worst types of behaviors that can come out of people and perpetuates its own toxicity by actively punishing players who try to play without being rude and rewarding players who are. Because of this the community will always be one of the most poisonous and disgusting things that i've ever seen come out of a game.All the things that make this game great... or should I say once did are now what cripples the game. The combat system is fast paced and gets your adrenaline going the downside is that the combat (a VERY large part of the game) is also completely broken. Hitboxes are about as fine tuned as CS 1.6 guns are sloppy and have no actual feel to their weight or usage. The survival aspect of the game is all but gone. Food and water? Nah not important just pick up the hundreds of scattered mushrooms all over the ground and you're set. This once great survival game now no longer has any survival aspect to it the goal of the game is a rush to gather resources and blueprints build a base raid people and then have the server restart two weeks later so you lose your progress. Imagine playing a campaign game GTA V for exmaple getting to the final moments right before the final heist and your game crashes and corrupts your save and makes it unplayable. That is what the game in turn forces on to everyone.Want to know why servers have to restart every two weeks to a month? It's because the game lacks any sort of balance and in the end it corners server owners to have to restart the game so that it ""levels"" the playing field. In reality this doesn't fix anything. Once it's wipe day zergs come to the rescue to loot everything build a massive base and then proceed to raid everyone else without any challenge thus making it impossible for anyone that has a group of four or less to survive and actually progress.TL DR Quick List VERY POOR Optimization Broken Combat Unrealistic Weapons Unbalanced Awful Community NOT NP Friendly ZERGS Galore Overly Complicated For What It Is Lack Of Actual ProgressIf any of that sounds fun to you go ahead and ""enjoy"" the game. As for me i'll go ahead and leave this game uninstalled until the end of time wanting for the days of legacy when the community was good and the game was fun.",Rust

Once you develop alliances and your alliances become clans you start creating micro societies. That's where the game gets fun. Once you reach the clan/society level you can actually explore the world and discover protected loot and play the game without constantly fearing for your survival.To reiterate if you try and play solo YOU WILL DIE AND LOSE ALL YOUR STUFF,Rust

2018-01-18,0,0,377,False,Recommended,I feel as if the game has so much to offer now that I have returned and feel fresh than ever. The game is best played with a team because you can gather resources faster you can farm faster and you can fight others together! Do not get me wrong teams can get defeated if the right player is on the other side of the battlefield. If you are going to be the only one playing you are going to have an issue with the word Zerg (basically a group of people) The game requires strategic playing and awareness very primal survival adds another layer of showing that even if you have just started you can defeat a geared player. You might not like the game at first but a few hours in and you will get the feel that's how everything works. The game is also built off of servers meaning there are servers that are easier than others (loot wise) To wrap this up I have a few more player to player advice The game is a grind you need to play a minimum 5 hours a day to ensure up keep on your base as well as getting weapons PVP and getting loot. Do not rage quit even if you have been farming for 30+ minutes and you get killed it happens to everyone (it's part of the game) you have to be willing to take the risks. To finalize everything I said Great game to kill time kill off people and actually feel amused by taking your hard earned loot and getting better. The game also offers amazing base building where you can store your valuable loot from other players and to craft items. But be careful others can raid it and steal it all!I suggest you watch some youtube videos on the game and see if you like it!,Rust
2018-11-19,0,0,221,False,Recommended,I like this game but i don't like playing for 30 minutes to an hour and having the game lock my entire pc up requiring me to unplug power to it. I like this game due to it being majoraly pvp. I like this game for it's crafting and it's team up or die style of gameplay. I don't like lack of character costomizablity or even things as simple as race or gender. The reason race and gender in this game concern me is that this game has no story that requirs me to be a certain race or gender I am just an anonymouse person in game that does not speak in anything else other than blood curdling screeches upon death. I don't like waiting 5 minutes for a loading screen to be done loading. Even GTA 5 running circles around this games loading screens. I over all rate this game as a 7/10.,Rust

2018-11-06,0,0,206,False,Recommended,This game will be extremely good and enjoyable if you have a couple of buddies that have the game aswell. Rust is a game meant to be played with friends and if you have them you will have a good time but if you dont I cant say the same.Although the community is generally toxic the developers genuinely want and make the game better. They update the game frequently and make it more enjoyable.This is a grindy game so if you dont like grinding it will affect how much you enjoy it but there are modded servers so you dont have to grind as much.BIG WARNING!! If you're using a Mac than it will be laggy as all hell and I recommend you get a real ing computer.(I only know this cause of a friend),Rust
2018-01-20,0,0,270,False,Recommended,"After playing rust for over 250 hours I can safely say that this game is not for everbody. It really appeals to a very hardcore audience.Pros Very Engaging while playing Rust it can feel like time flies by if you are having a great time. I have had a lot of nights were I will get on at 8 00 and I will be shocked to check my phone and have it display the time 11 00. Great Pacing If you can ""get gud"" you can have a base and loot withing a few hours on wipe day and the grind isn't super long and tedious like in other survival games (like Ark). It is all paced so that a small group of maybe 3 5 people can reach end game within 4 days and go raid and have fun for the rest of wipe easy to start Each server in this game has a wipe cycle which means they wipe the server of bases change the map and may clear all learned Blueprints on a regular bases. This makes it really easy to start on wipe day were everybody starts from the ground up and if you don't make very good progress just start again the next week or find a different server that has a different wipe schedule.Cons Toxicity is a huge problem Players in Rust will gladly kill you on sight whenever they see you even if you have nothing. Hell when you spawn on the beach with nothing but a rock and a torch you may be suprised to see another naked trying to kill you just to get your rock. I don't know why people even do this maybe they don't like the way there rock is looking at them so they want yours or they just think ""HAHAHAHA I just killed this other naked with a rock EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME IM A GOD."" Whatever the reason people do it so be prepared. Zergs a Zerg is a huge clan with at least 10 or 13 consistent members that are consistently online. These groups can be really fun to play in and I myself have met some awesome people by joining these clans but going against them is going to make your life a living hell. If you are on an official server solo you are pretty much screwed. You will constantly be mowed down by these groups who accumulate gear like a hoarder accumulates trash. Playing alone is super hard Playing solo is like playing Rust on Ultra Mega Hardcore even for experienced players. If you don't have friends that play rust or can team up with you expect a lot of frustration. The Skill Gap Calling the skill gap between new players and experienced players a ""gap"" is like calling the ocean a puddle. This usually isn't a problem in games because usually experienced players play against experienced players but this is not at all the case in rust. Everybody is thrown onto the same servers which means that you are going to consistently encounter players with 500 1000 2000 or even 5000 hours in the game. They may be nice to you but many out of fear or their twisted ways will try to kill you the moment they see your ugly mug. And often they will succeed in their efforts of turning your skull into another trophy.AdviceBeing a new player can be extremely hard so here are some things that helped me when I first started out Try to get your friends to buy the game If you can get just a few people to buy the game with you then you will have 10x more fun. Even though you may still die and lose progress it will be way less painful if you have some people to support you. Play on a modded server Even though I personally think vanilla Rust is the best way to experience the game playing on a 2x 3x or even 4x server can help you learn the mechanics of the game at an increased rate and with much less punishment for failure. Play on a server that restricts player group size If you are playing solo or with a group up to three playing on a server that only allows for solo duos and trios can eliminate the threat of zergs which is one of the biggest challenges a person can face. ConclusionRust is honestly one of my all time favorite games because of its challenge and mechanics. It can be really fun to try and compete against other players but expect to get your handed to you on a silver platter until you can learn the games mechanics and get semi decent at PvP. All in All I would give rust at least a 8/10 because this game when it comes down to it is a beautifully crafted survival game that is usually spoiled for new players by its community but if you can get past that early frustration you may find yourself loving this game.",Rust

That was my long winded gripe and they fixed it so I have to fix my PoV. Good Job Dev's seriously. I have been with you since 2014 and it has been an interesting ride.The only con I have is it is too heavy on the Pew Pew Pew and not friendly to builders anymore it would be nice if there was a bonus to the choice of building or FPS when entering a server for each wipe so peaceful builders would be able to get better building stats (with weaker gun stats) while raiders/bandits get better gun stats (but weaker building choices making them better raid targets to raiders). I think it would give a little more life to the non toxic player base. IMO.Thanks guys for over a year (in game) of fun play time.,Rust

2018-11-22,0,0,735,False,Recommended,This games difficulty slider is the number of people you play with. Play with a 10 man zerg and it's super easy. Play solo is ultra hard permadeath I hate my life mode. As soon as you understand this lesson you will start to appreciate the game. If you don't you end up like that poor guy from Gamespot and hate it. This game is not beginner friendly but if you master it it becomes the best game you've ever played.Everything you acquire in this game can be taken away. You die people can steal your stuff your base can be raided for all your posessions and after a few weeks the server wipes and everyone looses everything. The joy you get from this game is not permanent achievements a high experience level or constant shooting like other games. It's overcoming difficult situations outwitting and outplaying others. That rush you get when you acquire a powerful piece of equipment and make it home alive is unique and you can't get it in any other game. Just beware the rage when you loose everything is emotionally tilting as well so be prepared ).,Rust

2017-01-24,0,0,1308,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for 660 hours and as much as it pains me to give a negative review on a game I loved for so long I feel that I have to. This game was VERY good at points. But now it is just people who KOS clans or zergs of people (big groups of people). I still play this game on a regular basis but I can't say I enjoy it. Rust is just a big grind to build a decent base and as an almost solo player (I have a partner who sometimes gets on) it is hard. I get raided atleast once every wipe from a big clan or when I'm offline. It is impossible to defend your base while your offline. I know raiding is one of the key elements of Rust but when a group of 12 people come to raid me there isn't much I can do. Which brings me on to my next point clans. Clans/zergs are a HUGE problem in this game. I can't count how many times I've been roaming and getting destroyed by a huge group of people. FPS is a one of my biggest problems in this game. I have a decent PC GPU 750ti CPU i5 4460 RAM 8gb Ripjaw. It runs most games no problems. I am aware this game is in early access but come on its been 3 years now. I average about 45 FPS with discord and steam only open. That's not including the the ever so often drops to 1 2 FPS I get about every 5 minutes which last a good 10 seconds. I have died so many times from this. I would only reccomend this game if 1. You have friends to play with 2. If you have a decent PC 3. If you know someone with backround knowledge on the game (It is hard to get a grasp on the game by yourself) That is the end of my review but in my situation I can not reccomend this game.,Rust

2018-11-12,0,0,952,False,Recommended,This is a great game depending mostly on pure skill + experience and the situation you are in. Ive always loved waking up on the beach to some random kid screaming while smacking another kid over the head with a rock. The difficulty truly varies between these factors Who you play with What server you play on Your skill and experienceI remember one of my first memories in rust where i didnt know how to make a furnace. Playing a wipe on a server has tought me something new about the game every week ive played. Almost everyone who plays over wipes slowly turns into a cold blooded killer.If you are a new player looking to buy this game or who just recently purchased it watch youtube tutorials teaching you how to start off. You can also learn from a friend who is willing to teach you. Ive tought many friends how to play since they first got the game and its more like a job than a game. All you have to do is listen to your more experienced friends and you will learn fast. There are also many servers that are meant for practice which helped me alot.I recommend this game to dedicated people.,Rust
2018-08-21,0,0,525,False,Not Recommended,No recommendation from me until at least 1 minute is reserved for a disconnected players server slot. No one is able to enjoy this game when there is a random lag spike which causes a disconnect and then forces you to wait half an hour or more in a 30+ player queue while your character in game is laying in the open with 3+ hours worth of work in their inventory. seriously ed. Biggest flaw in this game right after the hard snowballing players can get in the first 8 hours after a Blueprint wipe.... please just add slot reservation for disconnects even if its just for 1 minute.,Rust
2017-06-15,0,0,4037,False,Not Recommended,Now that this game is in full release its time to talk.Rust is a good game in that its polished gets updated and has a dev crew that does care.Rust is a bad game in that the players are TOXIC Racist Hate speech vomiting little toads. If you dont have a giant crew of friends you are at a loss in this game you will NOT build a team from ppl you meet in game for the most part ppl will lie and troll and steal and grief and just be all around terrible to you. There are a few good ppl that play but they are few an far between and often become targets because of this. Hacking isnt uncommon on offical servers on private/community servers its even more common aswell as the ppl that own the server using admin to cheat without hacking.I play solo always have learned everything the hard way. i cant tell you you will like this game i cant tell you it will be fun i can tell you you'll be shocked that parents could raise there kids so poorly.,Rust

I mean look at League Fortnite and all that stuff.the thing is you're playing a surival game and if you're playing alone oh dear i'm really sad for you.You will die and die and die and die and die. there is no limits. No matter if you're carrying a damn rock completely naked hitting a three YOU WILL GET SHOT IN SIGHT IF NOT BY ONE BUT BY GROUPS OF 3 4 5 OR EVEN KOREAN ZERGS OF 10.They have no use for you or your wood or your stone they WILL just kill you for fun.But hey isn't that the premise of the game? Its a pvp survival game right?It is! But the game lacks PVE aspects things that should make people get together a kind of equilibrium to make people decided if they want to cooperate or not and if they don't they would just have a hard time. Armed groups will roam the whole map with Ak's and stuff killing everyone in sight big clans will take over big part of the map and if they know where you live YOU'RE GOING DOWN.I will say it here if you're playing alone you need to be a God a literal GOD. Because you will be bombarded HARD and you WILL crumble. The game wasn't like this before today Rust is just a Zerg simulator. Not that friendship is bad or that overwhelming numbers are wrong as they are all friends they are just playing the game. But be prepared to suffer get frustrated die and lose all of your time in a matter of seconds.

I really do love this game though I find the surprising amount of sociopathic trollish behavior to be frustrating.I love the environment the building mechanics the gathering never feels like a grind.I mostly just play PVE now because I do enjoy the communal aspects and there are less sociopaths in those servers.I wonder if I won't find friends in PVE and one day move forward into PVP but then again I don't like to feel stressed out all the time looking over my shoulder.This game really encapsulates life in a huge way.Above all things I hate about this game...

Then for some reason I found myself watching Rust videos and having got a key in a Humble Bundle a while before though I might as well give it a go. Seem to be pretty hooked so far. Base building and crafting is well implemented hunting/running away from animals is both fun and slightly scary human NPCs are definitely best avoided early on but the real danger comes from your fellow players! Mostly avoided any confrontations so far but have woken up dead a few times.,Rust

With developers constantly adding new features every month and a community that isn't only stable but thriving you can be sure this will not be a regretable decision. I have so many fond memories of playing with friends on this game. Some of my best friends to this day I met on Rust.

2018-11-22,0,0,859,False,Recommended,I don't know where to start with this game. There are many things that make it so unique and fun but there are a few that get frustrating. Before I start with pros and cons don't buy this game if you don't have a lot of time. This game is extremely time consuming. There are so many things that you'll need to grind for. Your going to end up getting raided and having to grind back everything you had before. This game is not for people who give up easily either. You are going to get killed over and over again by someone who's better that you or just has better gear than you do. It's inevitable. But you have to keep going if you want to have fun. Just hit that respawn button over and over again until you are able to get a start. There's also something called a zerg. They are basically a group of 10+ people who kill anything that moves and are nearly impossible to beat because of their sheer numbers. A good thing about this game is the graphics. They are absolutly beautiful if you can run them. It not opitmized very well but it has gotten better. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a rewarding and fun open world FPS that doesn't mind doing some farming.,Rust

If you intend on playing with a few friends stick to solo/duo/trio servers as some people no life this game which I can understand because it's incredible. You'll understand once you are able to make a part of a map your home. Then you can make plays against everyone else and take their loot. Then learn their loot in your research table to ue it against them. Soon enough you can control an island.

2017-10-22,0,0,850,False,Not Recommended,First off. I want to make clear this is MY opinion of why i do not recommend to new players.I love rust don t get me wrong with nearly 1k hours over a few accounts.At the current state of rust would not recommend rust because of the simple reason of Zergs and weapon balance. With the AK having learnable recoil you come across people using recoil scripts on the regular. The M249 being uncraftable you would think its balanced right?? Wrong with it dealing 65 damage so you can mow down anything under a Coffee can and having learnable recoil... A hackers wet dream. The bolt is beyond rare and is only used by Zergs having a base the size of a small castle. The MP5 is also terrible and are underpowered and tends to be out DPS'd by AK's or a SAR. Now to Performance My specs are Cpu i7 4790K OC 4.6GHz (H80i)Gpu EVGA 980ti Hybrid SC x2 Ram Corsair Vengeance 16GB With my specs this game runs like A S S with potato mode and gibs turned to the lowest i get around 30 70 depending on the server. Now this problem isnt strictly Rust s fault its more of the servers you decide to play on. Modded servers are the worse with multiplied gathering there are more bases and structures hence the lower fps.In conclusion if you don t have a group of friends to play with and don t mind the current meta and balancing get Rust it s one of the most enjoyable and well developed Survival game out there with regular monthly updates there is always new content to comeback too. But Rust will always be riddled with Zergs specially in Offical.LAPD For lyfe,Rust

2018-12-26,0,0,748,False,Recommended,Worth the buy if you like to respawn a lot lose everything you spent hours worth to farm for or if you're sadistic and like doing the taking. There are a multitood of classes to pick from in this game The Bot Terrible at building Terrible at farming can't aim the gun for his life and never gets 20 feet away from the baseThe Farming Bot Not too bad at the game but relies on clan mates for protection but can farm materials quicker than you canThe Builder Can build a hecka beefy base design that's either good at defending while online or is terrible for defending online but good at confusing offliners.The PvPr Mostly older people who only play rust in their spare time and doesn't need clan mates but could use them to distract other people. The Zerg This is a mutiple people class and (usually) are really bad at the game or extremely good. Raids occur day one.The Chad An all around Rust player can lazer beam you at 200m with an AK roams with Incendinary Rounds and mutiple clan mates that either have m249s ir l 96s + aks.The Sweaters These people try hard at everything they do usually raid the second or third day with tons of rockets. Will yell at you if you mess up.The Joker Typically a solo player doesn't take wipes super seriously will play for real on some occasions these are usually really good players that can make plays or really bad players that act this way to hide their lack of skill.The Roof Camper Perhaps an annoying asset to the game espically in a fight but shoot at you from the comfort of their base to prevent their items from being lost. They claim they can shoot from anywhere in the game.Pick it or not this game will eat all of your time if you let it.,Rust

You finally get a grasp of what you can craft and build and you'll get killed building your first base. You're smart so you're gonna farm rescources and then immideiatly build a fortified base. You get killed farming. This game is all about having your short life exterminated as unexpected and inconvenient as possible. You get killed just for the fun of it. You might be swimming in water and your foe has no possible way of getting to your loot they'll still shoot you on sight just for sh*ts and giggles. Watch a lot of youtube in advance so you enter the game with some knowledge of how to play. Don't trust anyone. Build a lot of bases because they will get raided when you're offline. The bigger the base the sooner the raid so stay small. I recommend this game but beware In order to not be the bottom feeder you'll have to grind 12 hours a day!,Rust

It's like a monthly christmas where I get to hop on my favourite game with a few of my friends and feel like i've just bought the game.This game also teaches you to be untrusting and relentless since most of the time you have days worth of grinding to be lost within an instant and anyone can take that away from you.All in all a really intense survival game with some fun pve elements. Would recommend 9/10,Rust
2014-12-27,0,0,639,False,Recommended,"I've been playing Rust since the legacy days and I have a love hate relationship with it. On the one hand You don't get the hardcore survival experience anywhere else. Everything is always on the line confrontation is always just around the corner the game doesn't like to help you and everyone is out to kill you. It has an awesome atmosphere and combat really makes you feel alive You don't respawn close to your killer you don't respawn with any loot. In every gunfight your entire inventory is on the line. Which really helps with ramping up your stress levels. Don't play this game if you hate losing. Because you will lose. Often.But that also makes winning more satisfying. Winning big gunfights and demolishing an entire enemy base is very satisfying and can feel amazingly rewarding. On to the cons Mining and gathering resources can be a chore and sometimes you just want to get some loot up without getting shot by some dude with an AK. Getting raided can be incredibly Also the game has a bad code. The content's awesome but at even the highest framerates the game feels choppy. It's because of bad code they haven't replaced for years. The lighting system is so good and so bad at the same time.... At night campfires look absolutely amazing. Natural lighting or electrical lighting at night looks so god damn good. But without light it's borderline impossible to see anything and the lighting during sunrise/sunset looks very ugly. They changed the lighting system to stop people abusing the ""increase gamma"" exploit which would allow players to up their gamma to be able to see more at night Which is understandable! It's literally impossible to see anything at night especially if you're above someone. Every shape or landscape just turns black. It's quite annoying considering midnight gunfights and raids seem like the most awesome thing ever but in realism they're extremely difficult cause you can't even see what you're shooting.Anyhow this is why I love and hate the game. I'll continue to play it on and off probably until it dies it holds a special place in my heart. Would certainly recommend trying if it appeals to you.",Rust
2017-01-22,0,0,1729,False,Recommended,Rust is not for everyone you have to put in a lot of time for it to be rewarding. While the game can have shaky development and updates that split the playerbase the developers are very good at what they do and try to push the game in the right direction. The game was toxic since 2014 so if you have a problem with it maybe don't buy. If you are on the fence buy on sale.,Rust

2017-01-30,0,0,1615,True,Not Recommended,I used to play this game a lot. That was until they ruined it. The current progression system is ridiculously unbalanced compared to previous ones and the devs don't even acknowledge it and keep adding irrelevant stuff to the game. I'd even prefer the XP system over the current one. At least back then no one had AKs on the 1st day of wipe.Another thing that the devs managed to ruin was the gunplay. It used to be nice and balanced quite skill based where someone skilled enough could take on someone with better gear due to their superior skill. These days this rarely happens because the easier to get move primitive weapons have been nerfed to the grave. Crossbow headshots that used to be able to oneshot a player with a metal facemask if hit in the correct spot now struggle to do 40 damage. The team UI update was another nail on the coffin and has sealed the deal for me.Without significant changes to the progression system I most likely will never play this game again and can't recommend that anyone else should either. It's simply too unbalanced and unfun in its current state. It's a shame really considering how great the game once used to be and how much potential it used to have.3/10,Rust

2014-07-21,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,2014 10/10Rust is the best survival game I've ever played. I've already played Infestation Day Z SA for some hours. But I can assure that the experience of this game is the best of all. I can say also that Infestation is garbage and Day Z SA needs lots of improvements. Also the graphics of this game are awesome and they're even running very well on my Nvidia Geforce 9800 GT(AND IT IS ON ALPHA TESTING). I've watched Nether and I didn't like the gameplays of that game but nether has other logic(and as I said I didn't like it).So in my opinion RUST is the best optionGood Simple and complex system of crafting. Beautiful graphics. No lags. There are not many bugs Very good gaming experience. Hardcore SurvivalBad Some minor fixes should be made. Some things should be added to this game(like the option to destroy our buildings).2018 The game is awesome and keeps getting updates however it takes a lot of time to load even if you have an SSD. Also I get framedrops even with good pc specs and with settings lowered.,Rust
2018-12-10,0,0,114,False,Recommended,"The game itself is fun and the server admins I've interacted with have been really nice. I personally loved grinding for materials and building up bases with my friends. Building and gathering is what got me hooked on Rust but other random players is ultimately what made me stop playing. Even on ""noob friendly"" servers I was getting raided almost daily and if I didn't log on for a day or two my base would have a wall or doors blown out and all my hard work would go to waste. On normal servers people immediately kill on sight even if you're naked with no supplies. People will also camp bases and make it their mission to murder you as many times as possible and take all your stuff even if it's just a rock. One time my friend was wrongly accused of raiding someone's small starter house and they mercilessly killed her and then me as well. Other players' toxicity and general want to kill everyone in sight really put me off. Overall Rust is fun but just be ready to have your heart and soul absolutely crushed when some bloodthirsty vindictive monster comes along and takes and destroys everything you worked days for.

The toxic community is highly amusing and I have made many good friends through playing. It is well balanced in that there is not too much grind if you want to get to mid tier but the difference between the mid tier grind and the high tier grind is large. The best thing about the game is the developers and their now monthy updates which constantly bring new features to the game there is nothing I enjoy more than reading the Devblog. Only complaints I have are about the forum management and performance.22/11/2018,Rust
2017-11-26,0,0,429,False,Recommended,Rust is very unforgiving and especially difficult when you first start. But if you find a good server and play with a group you will get endless hours of enjoyment out of this game. Each wipe has it's own exciting possibilities and keeps the game interesting along with the constant updates and love from FacePunch.In the current state of Rust there is bit more of a grind for gear and resources then previously (unless you are good at PVP and snowball). So be aware you will have to put some time into this game to keep up with others on the server. However you will likely find that Rust holds your attention with the building raiding social (or toxic) and sandbox elements that keep this game exciting.,Rust

2018-12-10,0,0,3,False,Recommended,This game is great compared to other games of it's kind. One suggestion is that the game should adjust the advantages all you have to do is not die as you gather enough materials to build your base and chance of surviving but the problems that I have in the mod free comunity servers were only with health and the amount of overpowered players that you spawn beside it is just very hard to stay away from players and all you is die. The last thing is that everybody has so much health that is also one of the problems with the overpowered people.,Rust
2018-10-23,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,The curve of this game is so steep that in order for you to have an understanding of what you're getting into when you start playing you need to either experience constant failures or have an experienced player who is willing to teach you thousands of things.This game could be good but it is definitely not good. After a 10 minut eloading screen with no sense of when you're about to actually load in lag often occurs every time anything serious happens making even the hardware curve way too steep for an enjoyable experience.Just yesterday my game forcibly closed 10 15 times in about a 4 hour window of time. Sometimes the game would freeze while I am simply replying to another player in the in game chat other times it freezes when I have 1000 scrap on me and im crossing a very exposed river causing me to get raided due to disconnect.My video settings are on potato and I have everything turned off (EVERYTHING) and have everything turned to to 50% that can be. The only thing I didn't change was the draw distance because I assume (the game doesn't tell you of course) that that would affect how far I see other players which I left alone.With potato quality and everything on the lowest settings possible I can't understand why my game closes so often that I now expect it to close 2 3 times per hour of actual game play.Seriously beyond the toxicity and near impossible defense against zergs and random trolls that are literally destroying your game this game simply doesn't hold up like any other game like it.I have never seen graphics become such an issue.What a shame I wasted my money and time playing this game. This game should go back in development until you stop seeing 20 recent complaints per day about how this game doesn't play on peoples' computers short of a beefed up Alienware.UPDATE DEC. 7 2018 Decided to get back into Rust because after a reinstall it was working better.Played for 6 hours until I got disconnected due ot the Dec. 7 update. After restarting my PC the game no longer works. I can't load into a server. I have tried 3 modded servers 2 official servers and even the Intoxicated battleground one. NONE will let me load in. The game freezes before I can wake up.How did the game go from being to not being able to load at all? Seriously they got my money. And this is what I get? You ruin the game I paid for months after the fact? How is that even legal? I was literally just playing it before you forceably updated it to a non working condition. t and no refund is to be expected. They can just ruin the game and make it unopenable.I contacted support for help about this and they sent only one email one day later saying to verify the game files. That's all they told me. So of course I had already done that and re installed Rust and reinstalled Steam nothing. Sent them 3 update emails to my ticket and it has been 5 days now no reply.I guess Facepunch just chooses when they feel like helping certain owners of Rust and when they decide some you should just sit at home wishing you could play your game but cant. Is this part of the games' challenging meta?Unacceptable.,Rust

But then that would pretty much mean half the people who play this game don't have an opinion which is kind of sh!t. Some of the best pvp i've ever experienced in a game due to its fast pace and now all I do is play combat tags. But I think everyone can agree that some kind of nerf needs to happen on zergs and clans I even have a few ideas one what to do about the problem like 1. Upkeep depened on how many sleeping bags are in that base and the size of the base This will force zergs to have more than one base and reward people who do not play in outrageous numbers I think if there are more than 3 5 bags in a base the upkeep should increase.2. Make the green dots above teamates invisible until you hover your mouse over them for 2 seconds This will reward good zergs for comunication and will punnish the unorganized zergs with the two seconds Thoose are the only two I can think of right now but comment some more suggestions below Anouther thing that needs to happen is that scrap costs should be lowered. The reason why they're so high is to stop big clans from getting everything day one and to have a sense of progression but since their so high all it's doing is encourging claning and punish small groups of 2 or 3 for not having 8 people grinding for scrap and lets be honest clans are still going to get everything on day 1 or 2 so you might as well just help the smaller groups and lowering it just by a little (like the revolver to 50 scrap semi rifle to 200 or 175 and the Assault rifle down to 650 or 550 scrap) Then optimization should be a bit better (and no my pc isn't .

2018-12-10,0,0,5,False,Recommended,This game isn t for everyone. It s very hard core if you die and you can t find your body because someone looted you lost everything. You can never get it back unless you make a new one or take it back. And each server can reset which means that what ever you have built is lost and you have to start from scratch but it lets everyone have a chance and this can happen either once a week or every two weeks once a month etc. overall I enjoy this game but for my personal opinion it s best played with friends only because everyone else has their friends and will try to kill you and loot you.,Rust

2018-12-13,0,0,10,False,Recommended,First of all Rusts community is possibly the worst community you have ever seen in any game. Even regarding that it is a PvP survival game. There is like not a single friendly player which i don't expect to be honest but would be a nice thing to see. I think people are confused and think that Rust is a Battle Royale you'll often see fresh spawns killing each other for literally the sake of the kill and nothing else.Nevertheless Rust is a well made game. The community surely isn't the fault of the developer and i like the quiet times in the game when you're just farming with you friend as well as the casual reasonable fights between me and another player. Rust would be a seriously nice game to play if it wasn't for this community.I think Rust doesn't deserve a thumbs down for the community because it really is a good game. Thumbs up to the developers but thumbs down to everyone who has this game. And yes even thumbs down to myself and my friends. The toxicity is infectious and since everyone is doing it we also started to kill every single living being on a server. In the end buy it or do not. Just keep in the community in mind. It's not that there is this one player on the server who always trolls you the whole server trolls itself.Final rating 7 out of 10,Rust

You will die you will die a lot like a lot ( I died 2 155 times in 1 45 k hours but I m really not good and Iam always rushing) To wrap it up It is awesome game but you have to have the time to learn it nerves to play it (and handle the sometimes toxic comunity) and someone to play it with.

2018-12-20,0,0,354,False,Recommended,Honestly the best PvP survival game on the market currently. It's PURE PvP and survival and nothing else. You start with nothing and try to get the best gear you can by whatever means possible.This game will make you feel every single emotion except love. There is no love or trust in Rust. There is anger surpise happiness boredom anticipation fear etc. And you can experience all of this within mere minutes. You're going to build up a sweet base in a great location and get your chests full of good items then you're going to lose it all and you have to be okay with that or else you're going to hate this game. You're going to have to start over and over again and everytime you get more anxious. But when you finally get in a position to pull of a sweet play and kill someone with loot it's a wonderful feeling and you'll want more and more of it. You can't be scared in this game or else you'll have a bad time. You have to walk around with your in your hand and a spear in the other ready to ruin someone elses day. The memorys you'll make on this game will be some of the best when it comes to video games this game feels raw as hell in the best way possible.,Rust

2018-12-20,0,0,1202,False,Recommended,Rust..It's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun blasts while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults. The auditory experience is both fantastic and haunting. They have made changes to make it somewhat not so stale from the birth of the game. It is both frustrating and rewarding. Rick reward is very much alive in this game. Either you love it or hate it.,Rust

2018-12-12,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR Don't buy it it's a toxic pile of trash that's a marathon of death upon mild success.Rust is a huge crock of trash. Unless you have a dedicated server a dead server or sheer luck Rust will not be a fun experience for you. You will be killed on sight by anyone no one is willing to help you 99% of the players are toxic as hell and the gameplay bone dry. Besides the giant performance issues the Unity engine brings forth and also the downright unusable mess of the chat system there's little joy in running for your life for 15 minutes trying to gather the minimum supplies to create a pickaxe or hatches. By the time your naked body is covered in maybe some gloves or something for your feet you'll be dead. Or at the very least starving. Or being shot at... Or being set ablaze... Lets not forget that if you're a beginner with no idea what to do you'll be given no help by fellow players and they'll just taunt you with such things as ""I love killing nakeds"" and ""If I see you I'll kill you for 1 scrap"". This game is a huge pile of trash a game somehow even worse than the DayZ standalone or even terrible Steam Greenlight survival games.",Rust

2014-06-09,0,0,565,False,Not Recommended,REVIEW AS OF 2014 This game is awfully addictive for an indev game! The graphics are actually really good and even though they could use some work im really impressed by them. However graphics arent what matters when it comes to a good game the real thing is the gameplay. In Rust there is a lot of PvP and PvE as you will have to fight to survive against many different challenges such as other players Mutants and Wolves/Bears. This game is highly addictive as i have said before even though the console/commands could use some work because they arent that easy to use I recommend this game. I could see a great future for this game. UPDATED REVIEW AS OF 2018 NO NO NO NOTHIS GAME IS TRASHDO NOT PLAYSTAY FAR FAR AWAYEVERYTHING GOOD HAS GONEEVERYTHING BAD HAS REMAINED,Rust

The other elements revolve around fighting in some way so don t expect much besides PVP and raiding/getting raided.Community.There are some hackers but they ussualy get banned pretty quick.Community as a whole is mostly toxic but that's to be expected from a PVP game don't you think?THE DEVSDevs are active. A roadmap montly updates if needed quick patches. Lot's of devs from survival games lack that these days. But in rust FACEPUNCH is very active and they don't look like they are planning to abandon rust in any time soon. They fixed most of the issues from legacy alpha beta and every month add something new to keep the game alive.So if Fallout 76 left you dissapointed give this game a try.,Rust

I have many hours on the game and very few like only 15 out of the hundred of battles I have fought in were won because of skill when Me or my team have worse gear and are outnumbered.

2019-01-02,0,0,329,False,Recommended,This game is everything I expected it to be. Challenging exciting frustrating fun and strategic all rolled into one. I joined and started playing this game a few days on the Rustopia US Main after it did its weekly wipe. Don't expect to progress very far since most of the player base is established already with prime locations and etc. Also be prepared to die...A LOT. There is a lot of grieving and toxicity so if you get your feelings hurt easy then this isn't the game for you and you should move on to something less...evil. The one thing I did see is immediate bans for homophobic and racist comments...that alone is a huge improvement. I applaud that. They receive bad marks for allowing anyone under 18 in the game though. There are many underage members. The graphics and sound is very nice. For being a DayZ clone these guys did a bang up outstanding job. The only thing that I would probably be critical of is not letting new players understand what exactly they are getting into. It would also be nice for them to open up a newbie server that focuses more on game mechanics and understanding them versus just going around and cannibalizing everything and everyone for the LULZ.I hope this is helpful. I'm a friendly in game if you see me feel free to join my little community. ),Rust

2018-09-12,0,0,751,False,Recommended,I wrote a review back in 2017 on my main account. But now I've got a broader understanding of this game and I've played offical for enough now. So here is my 2018 review on rust.The game is super fun even after having nothing and starting over again with a rock in hand. But it's as toxic as it's ever been. And not gonna lie i'm really toxic as well. But I think one of the biggest problems in this game with offical servers. Is asians and hackers. Asians don't have any servers so you have them come to the Australian servers so it's really hard to communicate. And hackers are everywhere there flying around instant doming people raiding people exactly where there loot is. It's really annoying. Edit 23/12/2018I was playing on Facepunch 2 Official back in the day which was filled with Asians. I've moved on and there isn't that much once you move other offiicial servers There are still asians but not alot. Don't have a problem but it's a lot of Asians are hacking/hard to communicate with or in big zergs which makes the game a bit unfun at certian times. but if you can get past that your good. The optimization is terrible in this game and I have to play on Potato graphics with a 1050ti and a i7 to keep my frames during PvP Also has anyone noticed the decrease in frames and good animations over the years? Just a quick thing to point up But at this current state of the game I give rust a 8/10.I'm going to rewrite this review at a later date. please leave any constructive ideas in the comments that I could address in my next review.,Rust

2018-12-04,0,0,168,False,Recommended,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING. HORRIFICALLY toxic playerbase at times. Good players are gems that glow in the dark and become friends. TONS of stuff to do. You will die a lot at first but if you avoid the starting areas and congested areas you'll have a much calmer funnier time. Build up your bases tech tree Unlock new techs through research and discovered blueprints. Survive attacks on both you and your base. Explore ruins and find chests. Go scuba diving and explore sunken ships. Avoid military base tanks Fly in a balloon with fuel you crafted. Drive a boatsCons See more racial slurs than you've ever seen outside four chan. (four chan is a censored word in Steam? LMAO)Basically if you can be an adult and ignore all the toxicness and avoid congested areas you can put TONS of hours into this game and have a lot of fun. Having friends to play would be a great advantage but I've been doing solo and I've hit 32 hours in like... 4 days. I can't stop binging on this game.TIP There ARE toxic people here. This game is a ""Sociopath Simulator."" Everyone is cruel. BUT if you CHOOSE to take the highroad other humans WILL find you and you'll make friends.

2018-11-03,0,0,1929,False,Recommended,rust is a unique survival game were instead of it having balenced pve and pvp it has little pve that impacts you game and makes it a heavy pvp based game that pushes the knowledge and skill of both you and the people around you. Think of it as as minecraft and csgo combined. the reason for saying minecraft as the building aspects are pretty much borrowed but instead of breaking down your base you spent 2hrs on you can simply just upgrade without breaking a simple item with in your fortress. another borrowed aspect of minecraft is the crafting but you have to find the items within a radtown/momument to make more of it and you have differenet tiers of crafting tables which are called workbenches you have a workbench level 1 (which is used to create more basic equipment) the workbench level 2 (which allows more advanced items like sub machine guns or rifes and more advanced base defences like auto turrets) the workbench level 3 (which allows the most advanced armor assult rifes sniper rifes and advanced raiding materials like c4 and rockets). the csgo aspect of rust is of course the guns every gun has a recoil pattern and spread (which can make or break you) an example of recoil (which happens to be the highest recoil in the game) is the ak https //www.youtube.com/watch?v xqXFfFjLlkw this video will so you how the ak recoil looks like other guns are much much simpler than this so if the ak is to much try its counter part the lr 300 but weapons like the lr 300 are uncraftable but can be bought (for scrap this game is not p2w),Rust

2016-04-09,0,0,3298,False,Not Recommended,I have mixed feelings for this game. I love the game but on the same time Im worried about how long time it will take and have taken to get it out of early access. It's been almost 5 years now since they started this game and it's believed to be out of early access in february 2018 even though I think it's far away from done.. Excepts from that I find it to be the best pvp survival game on pc currently there arent many survival aspects in the game but the interesting gun play and hard to master game mechanics make this a game that you will have tons of hours in. Just make sure to play with a fellow gamer or else you will have a tough time!EDIT 5 years after the game got published and 10 months since it left release on feb 2018 There are alot of things In this game that I find to be gamebreaking such as the helicopter shooting nakeds with bows (even when not being agressive). It really shows how much the devs care about the game..,Rust

Otherwise it might not be the best game to buy unless you like to grind build repair upgrade and defend by yourself. I always play with my small group of friends. It's fun to kill and raid others groups in the game. The servers reset every first thursday of each month for the new updates. We usually only get on to play once we see an update add something interesting. It best to not trust anyone in this game because everyone is usually out for themselves.,Rust

2018-12-27,0,0,967,False,Recommended,At the time of this review I have more hours on Rust than any other game in my Steam library. Suffice it to say that I would not have put in this much time in without giving it a favorable review. That being said a lot has changed in Rust over the years most noticeably the toxic atmosphere created by kids that don't get enough attention from mommy and daddy. This is slowly eating away at the enjoyment of the game. This game is heavily focused on PvP but with the recent introduction of electricity more PvE servers have popped up and it is being compared to Minecraft. minus the blocks and editable terrain.If you like creative games but hate PvP then you will be torn with this game because the creative aspect that you can apply to building a base is great. On the other hand if you like PvP *AND* creative games then you will love Rust because not only can you be creative with your builds but you can make your builds functional too and even moreso with the electrical update.If you're new to Rust or about to purchase choose a small community server to learn on before attempting any of the official servers because the official servers are the most toxic and the constant KOS you will face will make it difficult to learn the basics.,Rust

Prepare to waste time for real here.This game is the antithesis of fun. This game is an allegory for life and the futulity of action. Much like in life in this game you will make great effort to both not die and prosper only to inevitably die of something most likely out of your hands. Sometimes you get the opportunity to ruin someone's day. Most of the time they'll be ruining yours. No one wins and everything is dust in the wind. We're all doomed to claw at one another like animals.If you can get over yourself and make friends you might have a chance.This game constantly makes progress gets updates and continues to grow.

One of the newer guns the L96 is really Over Powered And is easy to get (bandit camp) so I think it should get either a nerf or should no longer be sold at bandit camp2. The group system is great for telling who is friendly and who is not easier but it also has friendly fire meaning that a small group can add a new member who then gains their trust and kills them for all their stuffMaybe this is just me being salty over the amount of times these two things have gotten me back to square one maybe others feel the same but I feel that (especially the first one) these issues should be dealt withThanks ArrowBoi,Rust

2016-01-08,0,0,2072,False,Not Recommended,Ive played this game alot... all the way back to legacy. Its awesome... adrenaline filled and great with friends. Facepunch studios have put their heart in soul in to the game. This game keeps you thinking about it even when you aren't playing. Everything is about Rust. The only problem is the community. A summarization of the general pop of Rust above 300 hours just want to be MLG PvP gods and will one day be a Youtube/Twitch sensation... Even on small community servers where most are just looking to have good fun/competition in the world of Rust. Naked/low geared players automatically assume when they come into contact with another player that they will kill them. No talking just shoot on sight or a young boy screaming at the top of his lungs possibly doing both.The worst poeple are the ones who commit all of their free time to the this game. They are usually angry sexually frustrated or trying to live the dream of once becoming MLG Rust famous. If you kill these types of players by some chance they will usually make a threat to raid you when you go to bed. You can stay up till 4am but it doesnt matter. They having nothing outside of this game and will most likely have to start again until you or your friends quit till next mid month wipe.I dont think a talk with the community will work... its more of a cancer.Long live the old BP system and Rust 2015 to 2016.P.S.

Since the arrows have travel time the dont always hit but when on melee or when thet get guns or even a crossbow its a headshot festival.DONT BUY IT RIGHT KNOW !!!BUT This is a very good game. The survival aspect. The crafting/building... The struggle for suvival what's makes you build a base farm resources fortify and raid others for resources and guns. The drill of look around and never fell safe. The drill of defend what is yours and to claim what is not yet yours. It's a great game. Still on Beta but the developers are very active and keep the community informed about their work.The downside is like others FPSs games (the PVP on rust is kinda any other FPS out there) there is hacks but they are isolated cases and the hackers usually dont last long.,Rust

2016-06-09,0,0,718,False,Recommended,Too many hackers. Official servers have no admins to help the players. The devs ignore these issues. Very fun game with friends but the official servers are awful as far as administration goes. People will be kicked like 5 times in the hour over movement violations and are still allowed to play and possible fly hack into peoples bases.Would not recommend until Facepunch either ups their anti cheat program or provides active and useful administration to their offical servers.Gameplay is clustered and scatter brained as well balance and PvP is a mess. Devs have been trying to find something that sticks after three years. Game optimization ranges between catastrophic and acceptable. Recommended SIXTEEN GB of RAM and the game installed on an SSD.There is so much potential for a great game under all the issues. The devs constantly dream of interesting and fresh ideas but are either left on the white board or are implemented and require months of bug fixing.I do want this game to be good. I only criticize because it could be a stellar game.*** EDIT JANUARY 11 2018 ***Most of my complaints that reduced my recommendation have been resolved. Most servers official and otherwise have effective anti cheat. Game optimization has improved to the point where mid range PCs can play it comfortably. Gameplay loops haven't changed much over the years guns are still overpowered as is offline raiding. However there is a great amount of fun to be had. It is a simple pleasure to harvest resources make and protect a base and screw with random folks on the server. Would recommend. Very good with friends.,Rust

2019-01-06,0,0,5,False,Recommended,"It may be considered a game in the genres of survival and building (I think its close to 7 Days to Die and such).You start naked only with a stone (which is your first tool to get stone wood etc.) and a torch. Nothing else. With this is you gradually try to get ressources feed yourself defend yourself and make a base. Within this base you can make research and get to better materials (eg. iron using a furnace etc.) and therefore better equipment.There are also NPCs that may make your life harder (depending on where you are on the map).This is not too bad. I have seen better games in that regards but certainly worse. It is rather intuitive and the tutorial rather easy to grasp. The graphics are pretty and on the ""comic"" side but in my opinion fit pretty well.You can play it solo (haven't tried that though) and with friends (hosting your own server). In my opinion this is the only way to play it. Playing it with friends might be considered fun even though it may take away (some at least) the challanges of PvP.There are community servers (non official server for public access) which may also worth taking a look.Playing on an official server (you need to play there to get the steam achievements) can only be considered toxic. It's pure PvP with no rules and absolutely no noob friendlieness at all (noob meaning here new on the server with no functioning base).It took me over 32 deaths I stopped couting after that all within 3 to 4 minutes to get TWO single achievements (getting scrap from barrels and destroying barrels. Afer each death you start over naked with no materials and somewhere else on the map (not even close).Naked me got attacked by other nakeds and by others fully equipped with automated weapons. All out of nowhere no interaction what's'o'ever. Within these few hours only ONE single player gave me an iron hatchet and left me alone.So ....if you like this kind of challenges....go for it and play on official servers. I can't recommend it.

2019-01-05,0,0,227,False,Recommended,So Rust over the years in beta suffered alot of setbacks. From deers deciding to scale mountains to run away to people building a massive tower and jumping into your base. However since full release in Feb it has greatly improved and i give the Devs credit. They fixed optimization issues dead spots in the landscape glitching characters gun lagging and everything else. The game runs so much smoother and they added tons of side events which makes you feel like you arent doing the same thing over and over again like in wave games or MM. They also routinely speak to the players about both present and future updates. Even with the price increase i would recommend this game especially to group gamers. This is such a relaxing yet vigorating game and im looking foward to future updates.,Rust

Playing solo is the most boring thing and takes so long to be able to do anything that gets to the fun. Having 2 3 friends hop on make memes plays and raiding is what makes this game the most enjoyable for me. Yes running around role playing can be fun for a night or two but when getting down to the mechanics of the game it doesn't like the solo player.,Rust

If you've ever played minecraft think of it like that except add on alot more murderous players explosives such as rockets and c4 and the occasional helicopter to come shoot you down if your not indoors. dont forget the animals as even a chicken can kill you. Rust is a open world type of game where you gather materials and build a base and then fight off other players to protect this base or you go destroy somebody elses base and take whats rightfully yours. Yes as some reviews say there are negatives. being(1) Hackers are lurking around corners left and right. but most of the time the modded and community servers do a good job of banning these snot nosed kids quickly.(2) As a solo player you will struggle in this game. yes your going to get raided alot. yes your going to get shot down by multiple people ranging from a 2v1 to a 6v1. but it is quite fun to be doing your own thing with nobody else to disturb you.(3) i see some people complaining about faulty admins. yes your correct these admins will most likely be abusive but also if you join a server with ""ranks"" on it like urusty servers in modded you'll notice the admins actually arent allowed to play the game at all they just watch players for cheating. there are several servers like this and a way to find them quickly is just looking through and seeing if they have ranks or a store or something like that.Overall if i had to rate this game 1 to 10 i would give it a solid 8.5 graphics are nice i like that you can vary the graphics in the launcher depending on your pc the voicechat is very nice to communicate with other players ( toxic or not ) And this game is special. as all servers wipe bringing you a new fresh map with new people daily which is what i personally believe is why so many people play rust and keep coming back to it week after week.",Rust

2017-06-24,0,0,410,False,Recommended,I made a review on this game back in april when i went on my run of making reviews for certain games I played. I am rewriting it since a lot has changed in 8 months. First this game is still one of the hardest games for new players on steam but is rewarding when your skill level gets higher and higher. I used to be hot at this game and after 300 hours i know consider myself half decent at aiming. This game is a perfect blend between realistic survival and arcadey survival. The hardest task in this game is 'soloing' or playing by yourself but i have made plenty of steam friends via this game. Overall some of the new additions like the ship and military transport helicopter that were not relavent when i did my first review are great additions. However some like the electronics and traps added very recently seem to be a needless chore like a minecraft mod. This game is fantastic and easily lands a place in the top five of my most favorite steam games of all time and if you can get it for a good price like $25 or so buy it however you will need a beefy computer to run the game fair warning.

Running Rust on a Lenovo can be tough but I so far have not had problems I simply set my graphics to the lowest mode and it shockingly allows me to play. Having presently played the game for about 4 hours I've seen my share of the Rust stereotypes. Rust has a toxic but loving community. Small servers have their own communities which thrive and build off of friendship and adventure. At first I was introduced to the game by a friend then it evolved into constant bindging of Rust youtube videos. And let me tell you playing the game is so much more fun than watching the game!

2018-01-25,0,0,399,False,Recommended,Rust is a game about stealing from others you steal people's stuff and defend your stuff from being stolen. easier with more people to play with harder if you are doing it alone. If you're buying this game I greatly recommend you play in a group of 5 8 people as it will make the game's steep learning curve less overwhelming especially if you are starting out.,Rust

2017-07-04,0,0,1091,False,Not Recommended,Update 01/01/2019 This game is trash and you should avoid it as a solo player or someone who has a small group of friends as you won't stand a chance against the zergs or the hackers. Not recommended.Rust is one of those games which you either love or hate. It depends on whether or not you can blend in with one of the most toxic communities in all of gaming. People seem to misunderstand this for a cooperative survival game. This is NOT for people who are looking to be friendly and live peacefully. This is an intense PVP game thats meant to make you mad.1. A very small portion of the Rust community is friendly. This game seems to turn most of us into complete s2. You will die a lot. 90% of the people will be to you and kill you on sight even if you got nothing.3. You will get salty over losing some good loot that took you a while to collect. This will occur multiple times.4. Someone (Sometimes huge clans) will always raid your base while you're online or while you're sleeping.5. The optimization of this game is simply awful in it's current state. Make sure you play on lowest settings.My suggestions to enjoy Rust 1. FInd a friend to go duo with if you're new. Solo is usually insanely hard for new players (especially on official servers)2. Try out Low pop community servers or High rate modded servers to get a hang of the game.3. Modify and change your mindset to become a complete to everyone else to feed on their salt.4. Git gud. It takes a lot of practice and experience to build a proper base and use weapons effectively.And finally try to learn to let things go. If you die with your best rifle or a crap ton of resources don't get mad. That's what everyone else is looking for to make people rage quit. Just make an effort to farm it back and get some sweet revenge!Coming to my final verdict,Rust
2014-03-19,0,0,1485,False,Recommended,Great PvP game that is very rewarding to those who have skill or put in effort to improve their skill. It is definitely an unfair game if you do not understand what's going on such as different styles of servers like solo/duo/trio and keeping up to date which days the servers wipe. You will most likely have no fun if you join mid/late week so it's important to learn wipe schedules. Playing solo is very stressful you will die a lot but it is possible to do this alone once you learn how to pvp or avoid confrontation. This game can take a lot of your time up but you can play modded servers that will speed up gameplay so you can have fun over a weekend instead of grinding for a week straight. Highly recommend this game if you love PvP. This game has a lot of negative reviews because I don't think people understand that the main goal is to kill each other and they try playing it as a survival game. Which it is but to survive against your neighbors.,Rust

2018-12-04,0,0,673,False,Recommended,I ve played about 200 hours on rust and I can easily say it is the best survival/crafting game I have ever played. I really enjoy the concept of spawning into a desolate wasteland having to deal with animals other players scientists and numerous other things in order to survive. I absolutely love the crafting system and base building system. I have played games that have had similar building mechanics in them but there is just something about the way rust employs these mechanics that really take the cake for me. I enjoy how you can choose numerous different servers to match your play style whether it be intense pvp or limited pvp week wipes or monthly wipes. The choice is yours and it is nice to see a game give you this decision to make. I would full recommend this game to anyone looking for a very enjoyable experience. 10/10,Rust

2018-12-20,0,0,1472,False,Recommended,I've been playing rust since it came out (legacy). I have to say this is the best game I've ever played. The devs truly love the game and you can see that with their almost weekly updates for half a decade now. The game has come such a long way and is continuously getting better. I play solo which is a huge challenge but part of why I enjoy it so much. This game is not for the weak and will require that you learn A LOT before making huge progress but ultimately it is so rewarding to see your hard work come to fruition. The game also compliments people with various play styles. If you are a creative person that likes to build bases set up traps and strategically get ahead then you can do that. On the other side if you like to PVP and progress through getting other peoples loot that you kill you can do that as well. Rust truly is the closets thing to real life in a game.,Rust

I give it a 9/10 based on it's current version. I recommend this game for everyone to play. I personally play the Rust Alpha 5X Icefuse Server and it's a very cool community.

Clans on vanilla have 4 12 people so yeah don t try to solo.Why do i recommend it?

2019-01-01,0,0,83,False,Recommended,I was banned from this game all the way back when only Legacy existed. Now im not hear to make a case or statement outright i blatantly cheated. I did however purchase the game on a different account and have been enjoying it ever since. More now than ever does Rust give a unique feeling when playing. The loot you carry actually has value to you mostly in the form of time and losing or gaining loot is either a huge crash or a pumping surge of adrenaline. Nothing feels better than raiding a base for a case full of weapons and explosives. Rust isnt without its flaws obviously the community is extremely toxic and it can feel disheartening for new players or small groups when a 10 man zerg marches over their base. With this in mind though there are still many positives to the game. Rust has an active dev team that is fully committed to the game and ships monthly updates that can change the landscape of how the game is played and while a good majority of Rust's player base is toxic there are a few individuals who you may make a connection with and then who knows!Side note Thank you to all the devs who have put in the effort to make the game what it is today and thank you for all of your hard work it does not go unappreciated. Much love to daddy Helk keep being a meme!,Rust
2018-10-18,0,0,1837,False,Recommended,Yes I waited over 1600 hours over the course of four years to write a review.Rust is the best game if you're not faint of heart and enjoy high risk high reward gameplay. Rust does not hold your hand but gives you the tools to pretty much do anything you want. With enough charisma you can create whole communities of strangers set up shops and sell items for the materials you need to maintain your base. If you and your friends are good at PvP you can roam the map and hardly farm anything at all. If you're sneaky (and you'll have to be) you can run solo around the map and into monuments which is some of the riskiest and most thrilling gameplay.You will die a lot. You will get extremely frustrated. Morale will get very low. The eventual big victory is totally worth it whether you successfully defend your base from a raid defeat another group of players in the wild drive another hostile group out of the area or even put up a damn good fight as an underdog in a losing battle.The devs are some of the most active I've seen for a survival game. New content is pushed out regularly and it works as intended most of the time. Whatever small bugs exist are quickly fixed. They also do not compromise on their vision of the game. There are plenty of people (carebears) who have pushed them to make it more forgiving but they haven't budged very much in this regard. They know the game they're making and the niche it fills.Get the game. Git gud. Bring your friends. Make some friends. Take over the map.,Rust

The server's and player base are awful i cant even wlak forward a few steps before get some guy gun me down and start t bagging me and talk like he's cool. About the server's i cant even keep a base up in a high pop without even getting raided it's more like a job insted of a game.

Whisk together one egg one egg yolk and a little milk taken from the 300ml then pour into the well. Whisk with a little of the flour.Gradually whisk in half of the remaining milk drawing in the rest of the flour a little at a time to make a smooth batter. Stir in the remaining milk. Cover and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.Heat the frying pan and brush with a little oil.Ladle two or three tablespoons of batter into the pan and tilt the pan so that the batter spreads out evenly over the bottom.Cook the pancake over a medium high heat for 45 60 seconds until small holes appear on the surface the underside is lightly browned and the edge has started to curl. Loosen the pancake and turn it over by tossing or flipping it with a palette knife. Cook the other side for about 30 seconds until golden. Slide the pancake out of the pan.Heat and lightly grease the pan again before making the next pancake. Serve the pancakes as they are made or stack them on a plate and reheat before serving. (If the pancakes are hot when you stack them they will not stick together there is no need to interleave them with greaseproof paper.)Total time40 minutes,Rust

You start on a server build a small base get a bunch of stuff log off for the night come back on in the morning and see you were killed damn near 2 hours after you logged off so then you go to youtube look at some base desgins you copy them and it last for about a weeks then that god damn zerg clan comes and abliterates the entire server with you being on of them so now you're and find a new server. Yeah it's pretty much rinse and repeat but I mean I guess it's fun if you like getting excessively angry and wanna murder everyone buuuuuut you have no loot and you just get spwn camped.all in all I would recommend this game if you're looking for something that will make you experience rage like nothing ever has before.,Rust

As well as giving the rust community more ways to make trap bases by incorporating electricity which is a great addition. Gameplay Pros Solo is hard but is able to be done. Recomended 3 man group. Any group with people 6+ will be set in their wipe in rust.Cons Clans in this game that are 8+ will dominate the server but is able to be tackled by offilining or allying with another group to take down a common enemy.Conclusion This game requires a lot of time to be played since you need to materials to build up your base and aquire new guns aswell as researching them which takes quite a bit of time to do. Being very good in pvp in this game is crucial and you will not get away with not being able to left click on poeple. Consider this game to be a 2nd job working 6 12 pm in a sense that if you dont spend enough time into the game you wont get anywhere. THE GAME IS GREAT !!!!!,Rust

2018-12-30,0,0,2895,False,Recommended,"okay after 2800h played and more to come can i safely say that i ADDORE this game. It is a post apocalyptic survival PvP game that really tests your limits. Spawn on the beach get beaten down by naked people who swing their around to mock you. Esacape the evil circle and make it to the woods start gathering wood and basic supplies like mushrooms and hemp cloth. Craft yourself an hatchet and a pickaxe and start your resource gathering build a shack stash your make a bow and go PvP you're most probably going to die but if you make it congrats your hunt was succesful. Keep stashing your and make a decent base go loot in the closest rad townand find something of value run back to base in hopes of getting there unnoticed and stash your new (better) After many hours doing this you are going to be shocked how time consuming this game is and for what? Wake up next day do whatever you do when you wake up log in on steam eneter rust find your server. to spawn in with the text ""you got killed by _ZERG_KOREA_10_MAN_CLAN. now repeat.okay for real this game is amazing however if you have no friends that play this game it is going to be very difficult for you. So keep in mind that soloing in rust is for experienced players if even them. I with 3k hours can have a hard time soloing.

Hunting down the specific rock model that you can harvest in a map full of rocks just to collect a resource you need a whole lot of was already pretty absurd but now on top of that you also have to luck out and find the right one.So now it isn't fun.That's the whole review.,Rust

2018-11-26,0,0,29,False,Recommended,I asked for a refund after 3 hours of play time because when i joined a large map my fps was horrible. I shouldn't have to own a half working game. Steam sent bot automated message of refusal twice. I'm pretty sure it was bots anyway. I refuse to believe steams customer service is so bad that they'd refuse someone with one extra hour of play time.Anyway I'm somewhat glad they didn't because once i decided I was stuck with it. I tried to make it better and looked up some video's on how to improve fps in rust and I picked up a few tricks that I didn't know. The biggest of which being the ''Global.free'' command which I believe boosted my fps by about 40 50 and removed most of the stuttering. So now rust is fully playable for me. I guess I'm just making kind of a warning before you purchase make sure you have the specs to run it. Because the que times and the loading screen and the fact you have to change the res outside of the game will most likely put you over the 2 hour limit.REVIEW The first time I spawned into rust ever I was chased by a wolf and there were no platforms to jump on.

2018-12-23,0,0,417,False,Recommended,I do reccommend this game since you will get plenty of play time out of it for the price but there are some things i'd like to add some reasons why i've started playing this game less and less lately. First the good. So the game is definitely worth the price which basically comes from the game's awesome building features and high anxiety combat. At all times in this game you have to be constantly alert and ready to fight because you have to fight for your hard earned loot and resources with other players. It's both good and bad super rewarding to win a fight/raid or completely devastating to lose it all (especially back to back). The other good parts of this game are the updates which are constantly being added with the most recent being electricity and water based updates involving boats and ships. These updates will keep things new and interesting and let you experiment and explore more new locations all the time. However I think there a few fundamental issues with the way the game runs as a whole basically involving balancing. Playing solo is very much possible in this game which is what i've done for nearly all the hours I have in game but it is the most frustrating way to play (on vanilla) since you are always outnumbered always outgunned almost always on the receiving end of a sneak attack/gank or always the target of raids since you can't afford the upkeep for a good base or don't have allies to defend while you're offline. This is essentially what burnt me out on this game restarting every few days or weeks because I was raided by a 2 man 3 man or entire clan. I have tried team play but it feels like a cheap and easy way out and i've always liked a challenging game instead of having everything handed to me. With a group it just feels like you can steamroll anyone in your region and it gets boring once you max out your upkeep and have every blueprint/gun and there isn't much else to do but kill people. It is a fun game overall but it just gets to the point where restarting over and over burns you out. If I come back it might be to try out the new updates but until then i've moved on to more singleplayer oriented survival games like 7 Days to Die or The Forest. I think part of this is my personal preference since I don't really like PVP in general but if you're someone who does and likes a tough skill based game this is for you 100%.,Rust
2018-12-20,0,0,390,False,Recommended,NOT A GAME FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! Besides that is a great game yet VERY difficult and time consuming. The only real advise I can give is prepare to lose everything you worked for while you are offline. Friends are almost required for this one. Just hop on the steam forums and try your hardest to join someone so you can stand some sort of a chance.,Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,1411,False,Not Recommended,I love Rust. I have been playing this game before it was even good. I have so many amazing memories on this game and nothing made me want to stop playing. But the devs. added a new function. The Decay system was added and its actually a really amazing idea it makes idle players bases decay away if they don't get on reducing lag. and it also made players/clans not able to create huge bases because the tax on your base is relative to the size of your base. This is a great idea and system but it doesn't clash well with the other systems in the game. finding blueprints making a base and getting components are WAYYYYY too much to do. This game doesn't feel like a game and it more feels like a JOB. It's actually frustrating because I have to get blueprints for stuff find the stuff to make the stuff I know. and then gather resources for the daily tax on my base. The devs either need to get rid of the decay system (which I don't personally want) or the blueprint system (which I do want). I don't enjoy this game as a solo I would LOVE it if the devs. changed this stuff. But I truly don't think they will and the grind feels like a JOB. Overall I love Rust but can't recommend it because it's just too much and the devs really need to make it feel more like a game and less like a JOB.Please read the big box of text before skipping by my review I have 1400+ hours.

2019-01-02,0,0,1817,False,Recommended,Rust is a game for people that have a lot of time on their hands to complete tasks or to even grind to get guns to try to kill people with go on raids or upgrade your base. Unless you are good enough to kill geared people with low tier weapons then you have to work a lot. Playing solo isn't ideal because the amount of zergs or clans that may play on your server depending on the population gets very toxic if you keep dying to more populated groups. I would say playing solo is for after understanding the game. And if you're reading this and you just purchased the game keep in mind you're going to rage a lot because people that play this game are very skilled just know that once you get better it'll get easier. Anyway one last thing if you're planning on getting rust but are still unsure I can promise you hours of fun and if you get good you'll get even more fun out of it.,Rust

And this was a 2x server with no kits btw. And it wasn't the python it was the wank one. So you need a ton of grind they add all these juicy guns in but you'll never get em unless u are 1 sweaty who doesn't care about pvp and just wants to hit barrels and open boxes all day long. ME. Listen I love the game I REALLY DO 700 plus hours but ME IN THE BALLS. On order of the peaky ing blinders I want the game too 1.BE LESS GRINDY +1And easier to get guns yes not too easy but damn man I remember back when I could actually make myself a p2 and not having to use a bow for 5hours until I get a wank relover. I went on a server today (never do this) to actually use a Ak and P2 etc just to feel the weight in my hands and even discovered new guns I had no clue were in the game. Btw I'm not a who cries when I lose gear so I'm not making the review for this u I just want it so I can get my hands on a P2 again or bolty maybe even ak YES DEFO BE HARDER TO GET THEM 2 but not 100 hours hard. Btw the gears look ugly,Rust

If that's not your cup of tea you can go around the map squashing everything you see and take everything for yourself. The players tend to be a bit toxic but if you are not as quick on the draw and willing to give diplomancy a try you can make friendships you never knew could exist before.

Was getting slaughtered left right and centre some people would pretend ""friendly player"" then kill you at a short distance (must like the look of my stone tools). Didnt really get any building done just kept getting hammered but Ak's or groups would butcher me. Found a modded server that is local and made a start. Into my second wipe have teammed up with a master builder it seems got the mainbase set on the second day and have just been making mild alterations as we proceed. Really enjoy the duo play have had a few engagements and wow check out the bow if you can hit the headshot Oh what a great feeling.

If you're up for a bit of a challenge and don't mind cocky and immature people this is the game for you! This game offers planning building shooting sneaking raiding and all that fun stuff. It is very unpredictable and offers a variety of servers with different rules and possiblities. Just look around and you'll find something that will suit your taste. Playing alone can be considered to be quite rough to say the least. If you're not a highly skilled player I'd advice you to bring some friends or at least search for some in the server chat or on Reddit.This game is very stressful not to mention frustrating and if you're not careful you may find yourself enraged by one tiny mistake made by either you or your teammates. Many of the players are as mentioned above on the toxic and immature side as this game can bring out the worst in people but if you're thick skinned enough you can take it. Putting this aside I absolutely love this game. It is very fun to play with my friends and I advice you to try it out.I'd rate this game 7/10 (it would be higher if the community wouldn't be so negative).,Rust

You get very good loot like guns extra mats and end game items for building.Building bases are very fun to do but I always get raided so the fun does come to an endbut you can always start again.It is very enjoyable with good friends as well you will learn off of eachother.I recommend this game as it is a challenge but rewards you with fun!9/10 Conkerp.s I only have 21 hours so far so I may not of excperienced the full content of the game just yet so my review may only surface the full excperience of the game but i still have many hours to play it.p.p.s This is only my opinon I may be wrong or somthing but this is what I think if you have any discrepencies please feel free to comment.,Rust

2018-08-20,0,0,245,False,Recommended,Rust. What is there to say about rust that already hasn't been said? Rust is a Survival game set in what seems to be a post nuclear island that is filled with animals scientists and even other players. Players compete (or help eachother) to build up a base farm materials and eventually get great end game weapons before wipe day. Rust is a great game in my book and I love the style look feel and almost everything about the game. It always feels so great to take down The helicopter or get the chinoook crate. The PVP combat system is great giving many different weapons with many different advantages (or disadvantages depending on how you look at it) and giving each encounter to feel unique. To sum up rust is a great game and should be bought and played even for it's somewhat steep price. Love the game and almost everything about it.,Rust

2015-09-04,0,0,483,False,Not Recommended,Look I edited my review before. Most of hours are from Legacy I won't lie I have ever so hated the new direction of this game. Sure albeit that in the begginning it was nice for a change since yeah Legacy looked like a piece of junk but at least it was functional if that. I no longer see a functioning game anymore when I look at this.Yeah the graphics improved but do they run even on my high end system? No.Yeah the map seeds were improved and generate more interesting maps sure but do people refrain from squading up in a clan and camping objectives for components? No. Yeah you could say that the gunplay has improved but is it smooth? Is the bullet drop realistic? Do people no longer roof camp and headpeek like I am playing Counter Strike when my bullets emerge from my characters mouth? No. Yeah they added boats hot air balloons helicopters hell even tanks but can we pilot them? Can we make Soviet Russia the clan we always desired? Can we fuel our engines with Vodka and praise our gracious leader Stalin? No. Can we have tracer battles at night like we are immitating lazer fire in Star Wars? Or is it pitch black and holding any source of light is basically a target for roof campers like I think it is. This game is no longer something I want to be a part of. I have always loved it yes and I come back just about every interesting update to see if they actually fixed FPS optimization and added actual content but despite their convincing fan base that this game has a somehow positive reputation status on reviews despite the price INCREASING for this piece of crap I see no end no improvement the ground mistakes that plagued it at the begginning have not been cured people still run this game on potato whether it be for FPS or for the fact it enables people to be better at PVP I don't know which is worse I feel like I enter Verdun whenever I come back nothing innovative about this game at all. I most definitely recommend to stay away. Despite my hundreds of hours of farming I do not enjoy this game. Period.,Rust

Do you want to join a high pop where people are being slaughtered every 2 seconds and be in consant gun fights? you can do that too. The base building is unmatched by any other survival game the constant updates from the devs who actually care about their game is refreshing the amount of user made mods that can be put into a server is amazing.

The games skin feature is probably the smartest allowing players to further customize their own character. Not being restricted to the original textures makes a huge difference. Another feature I loved was the fact that I can run my own server and have a community of my very own directly from Rust. If you have the money you should definitely buy Rust.

Graphics Gameplay Community 8/10 7.5/10 5.5/10 Review In my opinion this game is mostly great and should be the example that other developers follow. While I have noticed that the game has slight bugs the developers are very active and always patching them. Along with bug fixes new stuff is constantly being added into the game. In my time playing the game I have come to realise that a part of the Rust community is very toxic and most people just want to ruin your day. Of course I have also met multiple people who have helped me progress through the game and get started. Rust is sometimes about exploring and the developers have done an amazing job making the natural environment look amazing. I recommend this game to people who like PvP and PvE. While you can play this game by yourself I also recommend getting a few friends and playing together it is much more fun that way!,Rust

2016-12-19,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,My original review was during Early Access. I must say i'm disappointed. So i'm going to be changing this to a negative. Most achievements still don't work even on official unmodded servers(I'm not using an achievement unlocker. I shouldn't have to). Still a terrible online community. Playing solo is next to no fun. You have a higher odds of winning the Powerball than you do NOT getting griefed once you are killed.No option to play by yourself unless you find a completely empty server which due to my area is overseas so no thanks. If i wanted to lag i'd go back in time and use Dial Up with AOL.,Rust

(unless you are geared then they will kill you) &gt But this game is about killing other people and taking their loot. SO DONT COMPLAIN IF YOU DIE AND LOSE EVERTHING THAT IS HOW THE GAME WORKS! Anyways it takes time to find the non toxic people in this game and once you find them it makes this game a 10000000000x better I promise. People in this game will be glad to teach you how to play this game this game is easy and fun once you get the hang of it. *If you are clueless on what you are doing in this game and there is no one around to teach you how to play do yourself a favor and watch YOUTUBE it will make this game a 100000000000x better.* Anyways sorry if I wrote a lot I get carried away when I write but anyways I hope you understand what I said and I hope you have a great rest of your day! ),Rust

2018-12-31,0,0,171,False,Recommended,The game is great. I enjoy survival games so my review might be a little biased. If you don't like PVP or survival games this is definitely not the game for you. However if you do I fully recommend this game. It has a survival system that isn't too ball breakingly hard but hard enough to where you notice it and tend to your needs. The PVP is sometimes stupid with people who camp on roofs people who just rush nakeds with AK 47s or just times when you shouldn't have died. But there are great points to PVP and that feeling you get when you get your revenge on some salty kids you just sh*t talked you. As far as PVE when going to Launch Site mind the tank. If you hear helicopter blades get inside. Don't try and kill scientists if you don't have the weapons to fight them. And boars bears and wolves are so easy to kill. The game isn't hard but you will have to put time into it. Before refunding it I recommend that you just get to know it. I assume if you put in enough time you'll learn to enjoy it.,Rust

Along my sailing i come to what appears to be some idiots crafting gone awol as it appears to be a of tall brick walls blocking my watery path i get closer and end up having to dock my boat as i cant get round them.

I spent 15 on this game back when it came out and after playing it now for over 2400 hours I still play it quite often!It may have issues but for a game to be that cheap and have no ingame transactions other than minor cosmetics its a ing steal!One of my most played games of all time and even after all this time they keep updating it. Every thing from new events to minor loot changes even tho it is not as often as it used to be its still really consistent (first Thursday of every month).At times the devs of the game (FacePunch) can seem disconeccted from it's playerbase in terms of what direction the game is heading in.I have my frustrations wth the game but they do mainly come from me knowing how great the game could be and how great it has been and still is! After having played it for so long I really cant give it anything else then a 10/10 its one of my favorite games of all time but I still hope it gets better as it has it's flaws!

2019-01-14,0,0,25,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. If you need a fullthrough review you may need to look for someone who spent thousands of hours in this game. If you'd expect me to go through those hours chances are it won't happen to a guy like me who enjoys a different view towards Sandbox games.Yes by definition this is a sandbox game. With the obvious generic elements of survival open world multiplayer stuff that does not hesitate to bring your first few minutes into terror comparable to your first circumcision. If by any means you are afraid of that happening towards you don't waste your money in this game.If you are willing to commit then welcome to the game that will repeatedly crush your hopes and dreams. I would compare this to Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress in terms of it's lack of mercy towards the players but that depends on which servers you'd land on the most part probably the community and official servers. If you obviously wanted to do things solo in this game then you may have to make your own server to do so.As many generic survival games follow you gather resources build your own base and commit to scavenging and developing to become one of if not the best man or woman in the server by having ""cutting edge"" late game hardware that will dispose anyone whether prepared or unprepared. And by no means creating a crossroads for all players whether they should commit against the unpredictability made by fellow players or toss the game to the bin and call it a day. If you are willing to commit then congratulations you are still far away from being an official masochist.Random events and NPCs generally happen and appear every tick of the clock adding to that already chaotic but vibrant mess that makes things more dangerous but as always taking the risks guarantees a reward alot worth than your grandmother's fake pairs of pearls she normally wears everyday and that's calling the chances of yourself getting something better like a rocket launcher or something worse like nothing. Including the players for that reward? The same variation who knows they might have something you need to satisfy your stats or something even better.But how did this game garnered such a mixed reputation despite a community's ""very positive"" review? It's a bit weird to say that the game lacks content but to put it more truthfully Rust have definitely rusted itself out pardon the pun.The players are the sole reason the game builted up it's well known standing reputation. Like things in life each individual would begin to prey over the other regardless of their intent. An unwanted achilles heel many games not wanted but nevertheless given by it's players. The unpredictability scale explodes by every player that joins in and that remarkable wanting journey to get everyone the experience they need is only defined by what other people hurl into them. Whether by a charming cuddle of friendship or by no means many's favorite approach a violent swing. The game does not lie about it's basic description and by tossing them phrases similar to that of survival isolation do whatever it takes to survive. Such oversight by players from the game's very truthful description left them doused with frustration and disappointment. But even if one were aware of the nature of this game there is no doubt about many people's answers that everything is the same with or without hardware.How the game runs is okay to say the least. It's one of the few Unity Engine games that doesn't seem to collapse the player's enjoyment in the game for most time but its notorious presence of breaking the game still persists for a few but growing numbers of players. Most would blame the community servers' contents others for reasons of the engine barely optimized or just inconsistent. The music is unneccessary and the sounds are okay as the annoying birds on the balcony. Unless Steam gets the option for players to vote between good and bad this is as far as I can go with this. If you think my review sucks you'd probably be right. But as how Rust goes it's not making it up there well to be relevant but as my experience goes it only works like charm with friends and I have to admit there's still a few more good things to do.",Rust

2017-02-12,0,0,176,False,Recommended,Sorry but I have to change my review. This game is huge waste of time becouse of most toxic community I ever saw in open world multiplayer games. The game is so boring at begining becouse all you need is a luck to not meet anyone until you make a base and furnance. This seems easy but community on all servers I ever was seems to be 15 yo low IQ kids who just play to with others. You will get killed 99% you meet someone and it's pretty hard to not meet anyone on these maps. Developers are doing great job but they have to find a solution for this toxic community which is destroying not only gameplay but whole Rust game. Normal players are leaving servers and those kids who are reason of it will leave too becouse they have nobody to annoy after they leave. I wasted so much time just spawning running hiding getting killed and again and again It's like 80% of time in Rust you just trying to start. I'm speaking as a solo player. If you play in group of 2 or more people it's far more easy whole game is super easy when you play in group of 3.I thought getting killed by 3 fully geared guys on beach while me having anything is just a bad luck but more I play the more I realize this is not just bad luck this is normal and so much people doing it.I would play on server with intelligent hacker rather than with 40 toxic kids in big groups annoying weaker players.,Rust

2017-12-07,0,0,923,False,Recommended,2017 This game has had so much content added to it since it first came out in Early Access back in 2013. The Legacy version of Rust which is the one that came out in 2013 was lots of fun. I really miss it and am sad to see it have to go. The new version of Rust which I guess isn't really new since it was released in 2015 has had so much content added to it. The Developers of the game do NOT dissapoint whatsoever. They are full of supprises!2019 This game is still one of my favorites. Since my last review it's had many updates and a ridiculous amount added to it. I highly recommend.,Rust
2019-01-26,0,0,361,False,Recommended,Very fun as long as you intend on spending most of your time playing this game. Almost all servers with above 5 people reset every 1 2 weeks which I feel is unnecessary when there is a decay that destroys your base if you are inactive for a few days. So overall its a fun game just shouldnt spend a long time painting or building a really cool base unless you want to play on a low pop no reset server,Rust

Getting far in the game is fun and wanting to get that end loot will have you addicted to this game. After over 1000 hours I constantly feel like not playing this game anymore because of the toxic community and the need to start over every time I die.

2019-01-21,0,0,140,False,Recommended,This is a great game I truly love it but it does have some issues especially for new players.Gameplay wise the game is excellent. It's easy to start but hard to master. However the only way to play this game is online and most of the community is super toxic. The chances you'll come across a friendly player or even one that won't kos (kill on sight). A giant clan can just come and grief you even if you are a naked with a thatch base. Even if you have nothing but a rock you'll get murdered and laughed at by groups of geared players. They don't care about the loot on your body half the time they won't even check it they just want you dead.The graphics are great and really easy on the eyes. However the game runs like garbage if you don't have a NASA computer. Good luck getting this thing to run on even the best of laptops so you should snag this game only if you've got a good graphics card and ram. However it does run on crappy computers but at about 5 frames a second. There are graphical settings however the graphics really don't change the frame rate unless the setting are ultra high. So this game is great but you're gonna need a good computer to run it.This game's purchasable cosmetics are pretty interesting and cool. In games like counter strike and even the free to play zombie survival game Unturned the in game cosmetics are for weapons and clothing pieces. However in Rust the cosmetics still include Weapons/Tools and Clothing but it also has some cool additions that are unique to the game furniture and building supplies such as bedrolls furnaces and even doors. In my opinion it's a really neat concept for purchasable cosmetics and I look forward to new skins and even new items that can use skins.This game is updated consistently and they're pretty interesting. The major updates can change the way players strategize the game. New tactics can be added with the newest update as of this review electricity as you can now use electricity in traps and in a clan. I believe the game's updates really shape the way the game works and goes to show how commited FacePunch is to this game.In conclusion I believe everyone should at least try this game. It's a great game in my opinion and the people you can meet in this game while rare can be friendly and you can cooperatively work to make a giant base and even recruit more people to your up and coming clan. This game is holds a spot in my heart and I would give it a 9/10.,Rust

2019-01-21,0,0,1981,False,Recommended,stupid shit love this game but ing hate it in same time.the most prob is its all about number. like theres literally no way you can beat the clan.secondary fix ur ucking AI's at least you facepunch kids seriously needa call some SOS about this AI system to VALVE or some other company this is totally chaos itself. when you get agroed by personal autoturret piecekeeper mode by some random guy picked it out of mili crate you cant get in to banditcamp and outpost for 30 minutes. and as you keep getting closer to it it resets the timer so you can never get into the bandit camp or somewhat and autoturret is just system. its much more better to be deleted.for third this is the most important part roofcamping is clearly ruining the game.they dont risk and killing everyone taking their efforts.the solution is so simple delete embrasures and window bars at least it makes they risk their stuff.and make the ladders craftable without bp.if they dont have embrasures and bars ladder bp doesnt matter.fourth the optimization is terrible.the freezing thing especially lol.this game is so awesome but its just 80percent becuz of the concept of the game. there are not really popular games like this. not a fair fight.but for fact there are serious ts goin on in this game currently when the day some big actual game company releases the game with this openworld survival concept its just the matter of time this game gets burried 6 feet under.stop working on with t hovercrafts focus on initial stuff what is really needed.,Rust

These people will call you s for killing you and then turn right around and do the same when they have a gun laughing the whole time. There might be a few people that are pretty nice but I can assure you that you won't encounter them very often atleast not on the most popular servers.,Rust

The server i played on was PVE and went to PVP without notice. They also crapped up the rate of decay. In a matter of days my town decayed and i have to start all over again. The community is overall very bad. No one helps each other they just try to raid your house over and over again. It is not allowed on my server but guess what they take no action. Maybe with some dedicated servers and some sensible decay rates this game would be fun to play. Currently though i would stay away unless you like to waste time starting over every few days. Refund!As of late summer 2018 i got banned by the game developer. I was hacked and my account stolen. While they can clearly see my account was hacked and i was not the culprit the ban still holds. This is a scandalous way of doing business innocent until proven guilty clearly is something they have not heard of. Furthermore they have stained my name with this ban and this is against the law.

2018-08-12,0,0,34,False,Recommended,"Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.successful Rust campaign.ADVERTISINGBut then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying) and put him down with a single well placed strike. I wish I could tell you that as I was standing over his fatally wounded body that I didn't laugh my off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting ""Hey man wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.If it feels like we've been living with Rust for a long time that's because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios and it's been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send ups ever since. If you're somehow unfamiliar with the premise think of Rust as a dumber more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads you can harvest a few basic resources (stone wood and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces) you'll be able to craft pistols flamethrowers and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms which means that occasionally your journey will end with you matching another player's revolver with a rock that you've tied to a stick.This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked run for your life do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative or mythos or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes you will need to manage your hunger thirst and health and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive but that's it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far flung post collapse society but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else.I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo but I don't want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust's brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent even if you're logged off which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines punji sticks and keypad locks while they're away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones to make sure there's always someone on guard.) That's a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians showing off the multi man raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That's Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I'm turned the other direction he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust.Given the tone it shouldn't be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There's a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely. And unsurprisingly the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn't spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead when you join one of the many servers you're presented with a few faint hints in the top left corner of the screen ""harvest wood!"" ""build a hatchet!"" The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive with well written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog and you can fast track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won't win any awards but it's tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone crunching sound effects connecting your hatchet with an idiot's head feels great and really that's all I needed. There is also a strange post release monetization model in which you can buy ugly paint jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons but Counter Strike style weed leaf AWPs isn't one of them. Still though I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It's hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview and I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed warm and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves and turn this Eden into a battlefield we will do it on our own terms. In Rust there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence more potent than in any other survival game on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase or K/D to nurture or exclusive vendors to unlock despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped we are at war and we always will be.",Rust

2019-01-29,0,0,1228,False,Recommended,Rust rust rust this game has taken so many of my hours enjoyed most of it. I got this game on humble bundle back in 2016 and have played it on and off with my friend group. The first time I played it me and my friend enjoyed our saturday hunting people down with spears and running around killing people while they scream in voice chat enjoy your first few hours it will never be like that again. Now after another 1.1k hours me and my 4 man group run around on r/RedditMain US and typically get aks and do lots of raids. This is very time consuming though so we only actually try to have a fantastic wipe on 4 day weekends because we are all very busy with life. This game will require you to sacrifice lots of time to enjoy it fully. My experience playing solo it is very difficult and lots of clans will on you no matter where you live. You will enjoy playing solo if you build somewhere away from the main monuments and in the snow you will truly experience the survival aspect of freezing to death because you jumped in a river or being killed by a wolf/scientist with an inventory of sulfur. The game is much more difficult playing solo but if you build away from people you will likely meet other solo players who are friendly with you. Also if you are new people can tell and there will be people who help noobs there will also be people who run around without mics on and killing everyone they see. If you run up to someone and ask how to play they likely will take you under there wing that's what I do when I meet another player. You will experience the full enjoyment of rust the first time you get online raided yes it seems like it sucks but it will be the biggest adrenaline rush you have. The counter raiders the rockets the loot everywhere. I have been doing online raids as well and they are very enjoyable but you likely will not get any loot. Final two things you will be offline raided no matter what and probably will lose your stuff if you off a big group/clan most people do hate clans though but stay on the move and you will move bases more than once. Wiping the server seems dumb unless you play the game I could not imagine a wipeless rust the wipes allow you to all be placed on the same playing field. Overall I love this game and will remember it for a long time I recommend this game the ups and downs are insane you will hate it but love it. It is hard to explain unless you get it. But you should get it. 10/10 worth the price.,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,the devs brought back the BP system .. hurray ?. the game is nice but with all the recent updates and those yet to come i feel like theres no hope if youre a solo player and you wanna try and survive a whole wipe. zergs and clans everywhere and the community is ing toxic af (trust me you cant even find any sort of interactions unless if its naked to naked talk). oh and also if youre asian and you wanna buy the game goodluck finding a 'decend' server to play on. im giving up on this game for now until they can balance it better for solo players like me /. kinda sucks tho coz i really enjoyed the game until the recent updates.,Rust

Though if you play Csgo league or dota you would already be used to this. This game imo is only enjoyable if you play with friends. Playing solo is quite tense unless you play on solo only servers. For those who complain about Lag/Crashes either upgrade your pc or your internet. I have 700 hours on record and not once have i had issues apart from minor frame drops during early access. The best part is the fact that they are always updating the game. Since early access they have been non stop releasing updates. More content for free bug improvements etc. Best survival game.",Rust

Its ego strokers that suppress new players instead of going after the richer rewards off higher tier players.With all that being said if you can get into a group of people who know what there doing this game will be a hell of alot more fun. Ive never enjoyed being hunted for sport so much. unfortunately players like Nebsss that door camp players with 25 hours time played without any provocation (id cop it if i was being an hat like him) are the reason i wont dedicate anymore real time to this game.Might look for that aforementioned group though hell of alot more fun when you dont spend all your time maintaining your base.,Rust

2019-01-13,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,On my main account i have over 600 hours on this game.. At the start it was really fun to play with my friend and when there was a server contest for 20 50 eur we would always win.. Those times were really fun for me and i was addicted to the game. When our favourite server got shut down i took a 3 month break and came back to the game being full of useless updates that don't make the game fun for me at all.. All you do in this game is start with a rock get some wood make a base and then just quit because the game has all these updates that make you grind and be good at the game..Never liked the grinding part of games because i always thought games were meant to be fun. To be honest early access felt like a completed game and in a lot of parts wasn't even broken. All i have to say those 600 hours were the best and the most fun in rust i have had and now that i know i wont ever get 1k hours on this game makes me sad and it's all because of the updates with scientists boats tree minigames that don't work most of the time puzzles. I hope i would be able to go back to 2017 when i started to play the game and had some good fun. Go watch facless's most recent videos on how rust really is meant to be played and you will understand why the community and everything else has ruined the game and how new people usually just refund the game after 30 minutes just because they get killed by an who runs around with a semi rifle near where the nakeds spawn and just kills them over and over just because someone did it to them.. I have only had 1 time i've saw a cheater so i think it's not really infested with them... (subscribe to facless if you already haven't) bye. never playing this game again until they remove the show of updates or make it easier to play.,Rust

2019-01-30,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Rust is a very time consuming game to finally get started in. If you want (in my opinion) go into crowded servers when you learn the basics of this game. The game is a overall good and fun game. BUT has a serious problem with little kids running servers and helping there friends and also a moder problem. But if you can get away from that then you can have a fun time. Just remember going solo in the game is very difficult. There are alot of teams in this game that can ruin your day. Even though I have 2.9 hours on record This is a solid game. I would reccommend this to a person who love a challenge and survival games.,Rust
2017-09-15,0,0,1416,False,Recommended,This game can be a lot of fun if you can find a server that fits your playstyle and the amount of time you can commit. There are plenty of modded servers that offer a completely different feel compared to vanilla. I play solo a few hours a week and still enjoy the game on a monthly non bp wipe solo server.Fixes Any BP (blueprint) you can find inside a barrel/crate they need to make default. Why do I have to find a BP for a bear rug or guitar? A solo player has to learn a BP for each item he wants to craft but a group of 5+ players only needs one player to learn it to be able to craft them so groups have a huge advantage over solos. Groups should be forced to research an item or be penalized by the item breaking faster during use. Since they added BP's to the game there is basically NEVER BP wipes on official servers which seems to defeat the purpose of adding them.,Rust

2016-09-19,0,0,2926,False,Not Recommended,Who cares about Hot air balloons? Who cares about electricity? who cares about ANOTHER monument. There are so many things broken about this game like the team system Zergs grind the workbench/bp system roof camping and optimization.i Don't think the devs listen to a single thing the community says. who the hell asked for a drivable helicopter? i think the devs should nerf zergs and make guns less valuable so more people run around with them instead of hoarding them in their base.also the amount of scrap you need to get end game gear is a joke. you need almost 1850 scrap to get all the workbenches and 750 scrap for an ak 250 for meds and probably 3000 scrap for everything else. not to mention getting the items to research in the first place is impossible anyone with aks just hides it away or only plays in a zerg and finding one is so rare that you could play 12 hours straight and only have revolvers.even after 2800 hours and being accused of hacking many times this game is simply unplayable without 3 or more players.also i would play solo/duo/trio severs but they are dead and usually modded.,Rust

2019-01-23,0,0,66,False,Recommended,This game is very fun although quite toxic. It is a good experience that is quite unique. Although it s also one of those games where you almost need to commit to at least a couple days of your life. That is if you want to have a chance of survival. When you start you will be a nice normal human being. Just after a couple hours you will become a toxic person. As you will be building your base and be so proud. Then inevitably will be blown shy high once you decide that you committed enough time for the day. You will go to sleep and once you wake up you will be upset. You will wake up to your body on the starting shore. You will run back to your base to find they destroyed your sleeping bag and cabinet. And it happened like the middle of the night so everything you put time into is gone. You will sit there and back out of the game for a day. You will restart and this process will continue over and over until you are the top of the food chain causing trauma to other players. But yeah It s a good game.,Rust

2014-08-16,0,0,1732,False,Recommended,Rust. Its always Rust. Still love this game after all the years. Blood sweat and tears Over 1850 hours over two accounts and I'm still trash. Doesnt run so well on my pc. I honnestly reccommend this game to all those out there. So many different ways to play this game it suits just about everyone. Dont like grinding? you can play modded. like fighting? play battlefield servers. dont like fighting? weirdo. So many options to choose from.I remember when i first bought this game i was still in high school and it was just before the summer holiday i spent everyday playing Rust through the summer ( it was legacy back then) and it quickly rose to my most played game and has held the position since. Many childhood memories have been replaced by memories from rust. Its amazing how i can remember so many different wipes from over the years. Ive run shops traps zergs roleplaying bases and i even was an admin and a chat moderator. I have met so many people and made friends from all countries this game has given me so much and unlike other games this game has been so cheap. ( Rainbow Six and Overwatch in particular) I probably have spent under 35 on this game over all the years and hours ive spent. Whereas ive likely spent around 100 on each overwatch and rainbow six.Anyway try this game. Its provided me with something to do for 6(ish) years.Thankyou Facepunch for unlimited hours of fun for me and my friends. You have put so much effort into this game and we all appreciate it.,Rust
2019-02-02,0,0,14,False,Recommended,"This game is actually amazing. I know I'm not a ""Veteran"" of Rust like a lot of other people with thousands of hours but I don't need that much time to be able to tell how good this game is. I know I don't have much playtime yet but I have played 14.5 hrs in 3 days. I know what you're thinking I don't have a life. That is only PARTLY true I still have school and homework and friends and family and I am going into high school so that just goes to show that I took time out of my busy day to play this. It can be a little toxic sometimes but there are still lots of nice people if you just look. Overall this game is worth it. To be honest it is worth sixty dollars or more and I wish there was a deluxe edition or something because I would have bought it. Also if you want good Rust gameplay because you're still unsure about whether to buy it or not check out the youtuber Welyn founder of the Pumpkin Gang! Also check out Enardo he's great too!

I hoped that Rust would be different from other survival games but at this stage everything is about obtaining loot from other players corpses. If you haven't bought this game yet I would reccomend to wait until the gameis out of alpha/beta. Wait for it to develop and enjoy it on the long run.I give this game a 6/10,Rust

2017-11-05,0,0,889,False,Recommended,I have played Rust for 6 months total now and have about 900 hours and this is my review based on my experience.WARNING This game is HARD! Note before buying you will die lots. The graphics at maximum are stunning though the game is poorly optimised despite what the developers say as of now. To run it this way at a solid framerate you will need a top end PC. Otherwise you will most likely have to turn down the settings.The audio quality is pristine and the stereo and surround sound is accurate and has a wide variety of settings for different audio configurations. Footsteps are easy to hear which improves gameplay also.The game mechanics are some of the grindiest I've seen although if you have 10 hours a day spare for the game it is worth it. The building is easy to pick up on the gunplay is skill based with recoil patterns and no RNG and the crafting system is simple however the blueprints and workbenches can be a pain to farm for especially for solo players.The community is full of extremely toxic teenagers although there are a few good apples out there. If you can get past that then it is an enjoyable experience.,Rust

2019-01-11,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,So far can't even get to play the game D Can't get past the queues...wtf DTried royale radiation where the does it comes from which direction...No tutorial nothing. No idea...........maybe I will get to play it eventually but it seems like waiting time 30min 1h to play................................Not much to recommend so far.Connected to community servers hit trees with rock(??) and got one hit from something. AGAIN.Why do people like this.... knows )))**UPDATE**I will leave my old review so it would be visible what was the thoughts from the beginning.So managed to get into game seems more servers are reachable and wait time doesn't exist anymore (no idea why it was previously so...).Game idea is interesting and fun but the mechanics are a bit broken.Basically if you're starting now from fresh (servers get wiped after a while and everyone starts anew) you are running butt naked and trying to survive against people who already progressed and with guns but have no fear you have a rock )) You WILL die multiple times to god knows who or what until you will start to get some grasp of game and if by then you are not frustrated then just wait.... )) Because when you realize that you need some sort of base to continue learning the game and building be prepared to be raided every day even multiple times. Videos online will guide you to how build those bases both small and large but reality is that it won't matter. You will wake up and the place will be raided or someone from a clan sees you and they will raid you within seconds (presumably you can fix walls but you won't make it in 2s to do anything wood or stone doesn't matter). On videos it says it takes more time to go through rock or steel but in reality groups of people can blow whatever you have there within seconds it isn't expensive for them at all even if raiding is not worth they will do it just for the gig. So it definetely caters to grouped players and it will be hard to learn anything as a solo. Disregard those solo videos on youtube to get to that level you will grow gray hair and will have to play like the game is your y spouse not a game to have fun in ) There's more to add but basically....I can't recommend it just because the idea is nice graphics are good and feel of the game itself is attractive the gameplay is pure cancer for a player that plays solo and even if it is more than 5h a day not to mention some casual person....just don't waste time and money.If you would want to start fresh well all of what I said plus other irritations and the fact that you will be up against groups of people and solo people who are much more experienced and will just die endlessly and spawn all over the place for other player amusement. To get to those levels of experience or finding someone you can trust to play with headache that will drain you until you won't even want to play the game itself.If I would need to give marks to the game Graphics 8/10Music 9/10Environment 8/10 (although small maps even those that say are big).Price 3/10 (should be someting like 9.99GBP not much content (comparing to A titles) and it is still ongoing project (as i understand...).Fun 4/10 (it is fun for 2 3 days have 15h of play time since I bought it) But eventually it is more a niusanse than something you want to play on regular basis.So resume is that although I did mentioned to my friends about the game but definetely would not recommend to spend this much money (at least to some) on a product that's just basically mocks you instead of delivering proper value for it's worth.,Rust

If I want to wait inside my house for hours on end until it s safe.... oh wait I do that already as I m in Canada and it s currently about 33C everyday.....Not really sure how they can fix this for a solo experience... even after a server wipe it seems like groups can get high end gear in the first day... tough to compete with that.****EDIT****I bought this game a long long time ago and it was great.Now....the optimization is terrible. You'd think as the devs progressed it would run better and more smoothly. Not the case.Which is too bad as its a great game (Wait for a sale and pick it up. Or what for it to run better,Rust

2019-02-04,0,0,232,False,Recommended,Though my hours are relatively low I've had this game for a good while now. The vanilla servers are pretty sweet the game is much slower and next to impossible without friends to help you as there are loads of teams working together that will shred your very existence at the drop of a hat.There are loads of modded servers as well that imo are where its at.. A good 5x server with a couple buddies can result in some seriously fun PVP raiding base building etc. The survival side of things is very cool. 100% surviving from other players.. Alliances can be made sure but trust no one in any survival game. Not even your best of friends should be 100% trusted. Lock up everything you want to keep.Graphics are great music is sparse but always nice to hear audio is pretty solid. Voice comms are a little wonky but they are obviously trying to make it proximity to feel more realistic. Buy lots of RAM and an 8gb GPU minimum or you'll regret it ),Rust

2019-02-07,0,0,512,False,Recommended,Rust is a really competitive and adrenaline rushing game. However I would only recommend this to someone who's willing to take on the stress and time that this game gives and takes away from u. Rust is a game that takes hours out of your day and it keeps you think on whether or not you're getting raided all day. You will go to sleep thinking about all the hours you put in and how u hope nobody offlines you. But you will probably wake up to being raided. And then you will have to restart all over again and keep going. This is the trust on rust and this is what goes through the average player's mind. And this is why i love it. It keeps me on edge and it's really competitive. The community is what creates the game without all the toxicity and KOS rust wouldn't be rust. And that's why i love/hate it in it's moments.,Rust

People in their late 30s with no life 10 year old whos parents left them because of their lack of chromosomes and the god nice guy but they are more rare than Trump making a good action for making a more functional government. So would I buy yes either go in disable chat and voice and play this like a solo survival or turn on chat and all that and just play it without being serious.

You can troll people with your unique trap base get all their loots for free which I bet was the most fun part of this game. If you like survival mode games crafting PVP ing with others and play in multiplayer in the open world then this is your game. Is it hurt when other people killed and raided you?

Wonder and terror at every turn.I'm sorry I won't be able to experience it for the first time again.,Subnautica
2018-01-01,59,2239,90,True,Recommended,"It's hard to overstate what a magnificent exploration and adventure game Subnautica is.What really stands out to me is that experience not an XP bar but the accumulation of knowledge about the game world its locations and its inhabitants is the most powerful weapon in a player's arsenal.Take Stalkers for example They're the first large predators a player will meet and initially they're annoying and seem quite threatening. An experienced player will ignore them though or at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go away while at the same time stealing all of their scrap. It helps to have upgraded swim fins upgraded O2 and other advantages but if you took upgraded fins and O2 tanks away from experienced players they still wouldn't have any issues with Stalkers.There's a lot to find and a lot to do in this game. The need to unravel the game's central mysteries and to obtain blueprint fragments salvage and rare materials from wrecks grottoes and strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again. First you'll crawl out of the Safe Shallows then you'll creep further and deeper then you'll swim further still until one day you'll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod 5 you've gone at the readout on your depth meter and you'll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scary.Sustenance is a challenge at first and you'll scramble to get enough food and water but later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead. If you're going on a long expedition you'll want enough supplies to last for the duration but not so many that you can't haul a goodly amount of salvage back to base.As for fiddly stuff you can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitat customize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build (once you've got the complete blueprints and necessary materials) and have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and Portal/Half Life style ""techno guns"" the game has to offer. There's a lot of meat there but the true meal lies in exploration.Even at the very end of the game though armed with all the technology you've spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning (typically while watching your O2 meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outside) you'll never feel completely safe or at ease. There are great dangers lying in wait and you'd better hope you spot them on your sonar before their sonar catches wind of you....",Subnautica
2015-04-16,71,1253,726,True,Recommended,I used to be a SCUBA diver. Can't do it anymore. There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts. The freedom. The solitude. The Unknown... It's all out there hidden beneath the waves. Subnautica is the game I have been waiting for. In a strange way it feeds the sea hunger inside me somehow. Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived but that's how it works for me.I stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips. Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks? I did. Definitely got my attention as I recall. It was an Early Access release so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself. My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too but it didn't matter. I wanted that game. Badly.I bought it. I played it. I built things and survived. I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again. It's an alien ocean on an alien world. Curiously the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place. There is indescribable beauty to be found here side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious. It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask. Remember. YOU are the intruder down there. Take a deep breath and immerse yourself completely. Welcome to Subnautica.,Subnautica

No. Start your journey.This is hands down the best survival game I've ever played.It's also the only survival game that is not just about collecting ressources and building bases. It has more story &amp lore than all other survival games combined.It's story doesn't begin at the end of the game. It's story starts when you load up the game. It's your story. Not the base building keeps you playing but the exploration and the story drives you further.Drives you deeper.Literally.You push deeper and deeper. And everytime you reach a new area you don't feel welcome. Until you explore the area overcome the obstacles &amp problems there. You have to find out what wants to kill you. From your comfort zone into the wild. You make the unknown your new home. You were afraid first. Now you know what to do.You gather new ressources. They allow you to push even deeper.Rince repeat.You're not welcome.Again.I haven't had this feeling in any other game so far. Pushing into the open not knowing what will happen. Not knowing what to expect.My story playthrough took me 50 hours. I had goosebumps way over 50 times. The atmosphere the whole world the animals you meet. It's a stunning world and you're just a small part of it.No lethal weapons. You're on your own. You're weak. A lone survivor on a strange planet. Then you overcome the challenges build vehicles. Survive adapt overcome.This game is absolutely unique and worth every penny.No this game definitely should not be multiplayer. I am glad it has only singleplayer. You are alone. You feel alone.And when you finally find out the planet's secrets... you will know.,Subnautica
2018-10-04,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Subnautica is by far the best survival game I have ever played! This game is unlike any survival game. You gather resources and discover technologies to build better and stronger equipment. As you play the game you start to get infected by an alien bacteria. Soon you will find yourself looking for a cure and by doing so you are discovering the misteries of this ocean planet.The visuals are amazing! I couldn't run the game at high settings cuz I only have a gtx1050 but still... WOW! The biomes look spooky and misterious. It just creates this spooky atmosphere.The music is also outstanding! Every biome has its own music. Play with headphones and you will forget about the real world.Then there are the creatures... O man the creatures!The sound design of the creatures is amazing! Just the sound of a reaper in the distance is enough to make me turn around. Not even talking about the gohst leviathan.I strongly recommend EVERYBODY to play this game!Hopefully I haven't spoiled to much about this game!Sorry for bad English. It is not my first language...,Subnautica

2018-06-11,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Subnautica is quite an experience. I've always been a fan of survival building games and this game can be considered a masterclass in the genre. Everything is very well polished and beautifully designed I have very few gripes about the game. The underwater landscapes are breathtaking and the design of creatures is very inspired. Building the sub known as the cyclops is going to be a gaming moment I never forget. The sheer size the cool factor of the inner workings watching the engine rev up. Such a satisfying progression I'm having a hard time comparing it to any other games.The only negative thing I can think of is that collision detection for entities and walls is not the best at times. I lost a fully upgraded mini sub because it feel into the ground and I could not retrieve it. I would recommend saving often because of a lack of auto save you can just quit and reload if any game breaking bugs happen.Overall subnautica is firmly in my top 5 favourite games. And I will be voting for subnautica GOTY 2018.9.5/10,Subnautica

2018-08-25,0,0,229,False,Recommended,Subnautica...one of the best games I've played in awhile. Great story game play mechanics and graphics. The devs will not be adding any additional content to this because they are now underway with working on a new stand alone game of Subnautica but will continue to work on bug fixes for the game.You receive a lot of information early on to help point you in the right direction to progress as you explore but what's great for me was you still had to take that information and figure out a lot of what had to be done to futher insure your survival in the game.You start out with just some basic items and have to figure out how gain the things needed to create better equipment to survive and explore farther and deeper.....and deeper you can go.The great varity of Biomes and aquatic life is fantastic and the many different things that can and need to be explored creates a great atmosphere of beauty fun stress and fear.Subnautic does not support MP which for me isn't an issue but for those that this might hold back from trying the game I would say they would be missing out on a great experience.If you've thought about trying it but are still on the fence I highly recommend it and say get it.Just an update....Vote Subnautic for STEAM GOTY...I did and it should be.,Subnautica

2018-11-23,0,0,621,False,Recommended,"(No Spoilers)Subnautica is hands down my best Game of the Year and in my top 3 games I have played in over 25 years of gaming. I absolutely recommend it but be prepared to go on an amazing adventure.This game is immersive and atmospheric absolute beauty matched with moments of terror and humor and a well paced storyline with clues and subplots that lead you into the depths of the game yet let you explore at your own pace. The sounds and music greatly enhance the experience and are a major factor of the game pay attention to the sounds around you! The crafting system is very well done unlocking more levels and enhancements with different areas and just exactly when you need them. Base and vehicle building is also quite well thought out and customization is easy including turning your submarine into a mobile base if you like. Difficulty is also customizable anywhere from permadeath to creative (building without the story). However I would suggest not doing either as your first playthrough. Also as others have said DO NOT watch videos or read guides in your first time through this game. You want to experience it as it was meant to be and you will not get those ""firsts"" back even though it is still very enjoyable to replay (as shown by my hours played). In the end you will find you have been on a wonderful journey engaging your emotions and mind. Do not be surprised to find yourself emotional at the end. It is a compliment to how well the devs have crafted and paced the story and experience. DO watch through the credits at the end though for Alterra's (and the devs) final joke to the player!",Subnautica
2018-03-15,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Subnautica was a game I initially thought seemed pretty basic at first but it still looked fun. So I had just gotten a decent gaming PC and I see it's on sale. I thought that I might as well give it a try and i'd refund it if I didn't. As soon as I started playing I was hooked I never thought something like this would be so appealing as I would explore new biomes and discover new sealife. The feeling of building your first Seamoth and exploring th deeper parts of the game had me so struck with a sense of acheivement. One thing that I never could have expected from the game is how genuinely terrified I was at times like when I heard a Crabsquid for the first time or when I first discovered what lurks in the dead zone. The graphics are beautiful with a unique style to every creature biome and flora.I have never recommended a game more10/10 would die by Crashfish againEdit Now we just wait for Below Zero,Subnautica

2018-01-27,0,0,63,False,Recommended,I've played this game for a long time in early access. At first it was rough. Not much to do little to create and it lagged something aweful. However from the first iteration of this game to the official launch it has continued to improve and adapt. The lag is still there but very rarely does it affect play there is much more to create and explore and the story has blossomed into a very interesting tale of survival on a beautiful alien world. I am glad this game popped up in my recommendations way back when. As someone who doesn't enjoy survival titles all that much I love this one. 10/10,Subnautica
2018-01-24,0,0,127,False,Recommended,Quite simply one of the best survival games I've ever played the sheer amount of things down in the ocean for you to explore is mindblowing and the atmosphere of being lost in the ocean never gets lifted,Subnautica

2018-10-28,12,305,54,False,Recommended,"One of the best games I ever played.First words that comes to my mind are ""deep immersion"". Developers created a huge beautiful and very realistic world. Subnautica is mainly focused on exploration and it is extremely good. In fact I think that there are no enemies in this game at least I could not perceive any creature as enemy. They are not monsters but just local fauna that live their life in fact they are not even aliens they are at home and you were not invited. There is only one alien on whole planet and this alien is you. Once you learn behaviour of animals you will very rarely encounter any aggression. If for some reason you want to fight... well you may find a prey but bloodshed is absolutely senseless and unnecessary.Game is quite peaceful but it does not mean that there are no dangers in ocean. Pressure lack of oxygen cramped caves limited light... deeper and deeper you went more and more awe you feel. When your submarine hangs over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth... it is scary... well I hardly can remember another game that gave me such intense emotions.World in Subnautica is opened for exploration from the very start you can travel... well everywhere. Still amount of accessable locations is cleverly limited by available technologies. You can try to explore deep caves immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown. So game softly push player to explore safe shallows first.There is storyline and in my opinion it is very good. I do not want to spoil anything just want to say that storyline is simple but intense yet not intrusive in same time. Bit by bit you will visit all locations and learn all mysteries. Final scene gave me very complex and positive emotions it is beautiful and full of hope with light sadness. It was worth all long way down.Gameplay can be divided into two stages. During first stage you salvage technologies gather resources and craft equipment. There is some grind but I can not say it is boring or tedious... you just explore surroundings and study local life gathering useful items by the way. And second stage is travelling when you gathered enough resources and crafted basic vehicle Seamoth you can explore almost everywhere. There are only three vehicles in game not too much but they are widely customisable. You can install different modules extra armor torpedo launchers defensive electric field and so on also it is available to change appearance of vehicle such as colour and finally you can even give your vehicle a name.You can construct your base that will serve as center of operations. Constructing is simple and effective it is very easy to learn and comfortable to use. There are lot of different modules you can combine and create your awesome station. Even more importantly game offers a lot of different furniture and decorations to customise your base and turn it to... well not just ""a base"" but your home. I really got attached to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartments and my tamed cuddlefish. I really hope that my pets will survive without me... wait it is just a game... *sigh*.Of course I must mention the stunning beauty of Subnautica. Blazing sunsets dense kelp forests impenetrable darkness with sparkles of luminescente flora and fauna... almost every scene literally craves for screenshot. As for sounds and music they are excellent such quality is really impressive. For example I humbly advise you to search for ""Tropical Eden"" melody it creates amazing magical atmosphere I was truly enchanted with.Game is not perfect there are some bugs. Several times I seen fish swimming in my base. Once during exploration of Aurora wreck I got stuck in textures and then suddenly fell out of the world. Well... all this tiny confusing troubles seems insignificant for me.Probably the best advice I can give do not watch videos and do not read guides. Explore by yourself! Believe me pleasure from discovering new things is worth the time. If you love adventure games with main focus on exploration Subnautica is a sure bet. Honestly I do not know any games that can compete with Subnautica in this niche. You do not want to miss this game.",Subnautica

2017-11-27,0,0,124,True,Recommended,I was hesitant at first about buying this game but after seeing a Let's Play about this I just had to play it (thank you Mark).If you love survival games with a decent crafting system and an interesting story I highly recommend this one.The Story might not be complete yet (at the time of this review) however the game is about to leave Early Access soon.The crafting system is accessed through different machines ingame the first one of which is inside the escape pod that helped you survive the crash. If you want to build a new one elsewhere you have to gather materials first to build a tool that let's you build underwater bases and build a fabricator inside of it. These bases can be build almost anywhere in the huge play area which consists of several different underwater biomes. There are also several underwater vehicles you can craft to explore the ocean (somewhat) safely ) .Also it should be noticed that while this game is not classified as a horror game it can be quite terrifying to be alone in the dark ocean hearing all those strange different noises from all the different alien ocean lifeforms around you and then suddenly a bigger one of them roars right into your ears .A Coop mode was planned for this game from the beginning but the developers decided to focus on the game itself in single player completely and add multiplayer later (probably some time after the full release) so if you want to play this with a friend(s) you'll have to wait a little longer. Otherwise you can enjoy the game as it is right now.The developers stated that this game will not have a multiplayer mode. However they might develop a game in the same style in the future with a coop option Have fun D,Subnautica

2018-11-22,0,0,62,False,Recommended,I picked up Subnautica from the Humble Freedom Bundle in February 2017. As the game was still in early access I put the game into my backlog list to play when it would be complete.The Good the Bad and the Middle GroundGoodStory the story of Planet 4546B is intriguing. There is just enough lore laying around to make the story of the world enjoyable. Exploring the exploration is top notch and is well paced. Areas/depths are soft locked behind the mod tech level of your submersibles you can push deeper if you want.Atmosphere the atmosphere of the ocean is excellent with each biome having a unique feel.Building building bases around the world is easy and enjoyable except for the high resource cost of some stuff.The Subs both the Seamoth and Cyclops are fun to pilot around. I would have liked the Cyclops or a third larger sub to be a bit more equipped for exploration.Flora and Fauna the plants and creatures of the world are interesting. I would have liked to see a bit more variety in their behaviours. Middle GroundSurvival depending on the game mode you choose you ll get a different experience with having to deal with the survival mechanics. I found the standard survival mode to be a little bit too much of a grind and tied to resource management for my tastes.Docking you can only dock either the Seamoth or the Prawn Suit in the Cyclops not both. In addition I would have liked to have been able to dock the Cyclops to the bases I built. This option would have been especially useful if you could connect the base and the Cyclops s power grid and life support together. BadResource Grind in the standard survival mode I found the grind for resources and the management of your life support to be a bit much. This could have been helped if you had auto collectors that could have been built.Limited Fast Travel in the late game you gain access to a gate network that can take you to some of the biomes. I would have liked a fast travel option that is tied to the bases you built and is accessible much earlier. Leviathan s Tails the tail section of the two late game leviathans you encounter are very similar.Bio mechanicals the Warper is the only bio mechanical creature you ll come across. I d have liked to have seen others and possibly some creatures that were transformed as a result of the Precursor labs. PlaytimeMy leisurely playtime to escape Planet 4546B is about 62 hours.RecommendationThis is a must own if you re into survival exploration atmospheric or base building games. If you don t like survival mechanics or much of a grind I d encourage you to go with either freedom or creative mode. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entertainment for creating a great exploration game with a great atmosphere.,Subnautica

Fun game the building part is fun resource hunting can be tedious enemies can be infuriating (more so since the latest updates added the ""teleporting claw your eyeballs out nope"" and the ""gigantic omg it shoots fireballs at your face nope"".) Placement of some of the tech items is absurd but with practice and a monstrous amount of planning and patience they can be obtained. True the game has gotten substantially harder over updates but for the atmosphere gameplay and especially the graphics I can still honestly recommend this title. I would however suggest tying to grab it on a sale though.Edit 1 Ok so since the addition of new content I cannot praise the game enough. The way the story has been implemented into the survival mechanics has really polished the game. The biomes have been smoothed out and look fantastic the sense of dread passed 500 meters compounded with the atmospheric sounds had me at pucker factor 9000 all the time.

2015-12-26,114,766,217,True,Recommended,Everyone talks about how it's early access bugs blah blah blah. If you're reading this review you know about all that. I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games and I have played quite a few in the last months. Here is my personal impression of this one.Graphics are incredible. I know everyone has said this but it needs repeating. On the lowest settings it still looks awesome! Some clipping and such but it never really bothered me much.It's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own but not enough to make it boring.Edit I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far. Here is what any new player needs to know Expect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't. Explore. Even the dark and scary areas. They usually have the best loot.Storage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review.)Predators are everywhere and you are not one of them. If it can eat you it will.If it can eat you it's usually in a scary area.You WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared. Give it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online and once you do do it very sparingly. Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out the more valuable this game will be.,Subnautica
2018-11-19,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Played this game quite a few times and to be honest I play with cheats sometimes because the animals scare me. On a different note The game does it's job at immersing you into the story you aren't playing the main character because you ARE the main character. Their silence is your voice and that is something not alot of games can do. Something that impressed me was the fact that this game brings out your instincts as if you are in REAL mortal danger for me there was alot of looking over my shoulder both ingame and real life. In a way this game shapes you at the same time it gives you opportunities to shape it.,Subnautica

2016-02-18,42,708,399,False,Recommended,After 41 hours I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game. It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water. The game will be very different depending on which mode you play because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment. In hardcore you have to be extra careful because once you die you have to start over. At this point I'm glad I did not pick hardcore because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable. There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.First Impressions This game is amazing. That can be and is said about many games. But there is nothing like Subnautica. I had been waiting for 19 years ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive fun but ultimately flawed Sub Culture. Finally we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline. With that said Subnautica has flaws.The Bad In all it's glory there are a few nags some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game. First I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load. This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly. In any event I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.Also The learning curve is very steep. There are no instructions for anything and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does. There are some basic descriptions but they're very poor. For example the current generator says it generates current. When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.The third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles. There is much debate about the actual depth of the game. Some say it goes on forever. Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60 000 meters. Some have said 20 000 meters. Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths which sounds pretty epic. In any event. The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about. The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters. (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency. I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)Fourth the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly. This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on. As a result you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water. Which leads me to the next problem in the game.Fifth scarcity of food and supplies for making water. At first everything is plentiful and readily available. Salt while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for seems to respawn readily and limitlessly. Coral while seemingly limitless at first begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay. Moreover I have seen no indication that it respawns. Food which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks can disappear amazingly fast from an area. After 41 hours of gaming I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean plus the surrounding depths of fish. It's amazing how fast they diminish. The only solution seems to be to put respawning or faster reproduction of the fish in the game. I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save. There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups. Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited and all you have to do is look further. My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter energy and other resources to find food. Because of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game. The devs claim it causes people to explore more. I'm not satisfied with that response because the reality is this if people have no motivation to explore. If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently a fix is being tested in the experimental mode but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.Sixth and my final gripe and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth scarcity of resources. Copper Quartz Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on. Quartz is practically used in everything because you need it for glass and rubber which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles. Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly. Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources. Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem that there's plenty in the depths. The problem is that it takes more and more energy food and water to farm this stuff. You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources. This really needs to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity. Both of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity with the argument that resources are scarce in real life. I would like to point out however that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life. Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person. Also if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates. The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams. The Good Based on my criticisms some might get the idea that I don't like the game. That couldn't be more wrong. Subnautica is hands down simply the best underwater game ever made. There's no competition. The environment is rich full of wonder and among the most immersive games I've ever played. The world is packed full of fascinating creatures beautiful vegetation and unparalleled undersea effects. The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine. All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.It's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever at least among those who have played it. In my opinion the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves. The amount of stuff you can do in this game and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing. Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica. Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations. Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past. I just hope they maintain the trend.Subnautica is an oustanding game worth its price about three times over. It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state I would give Subnautica a 9/10.Added 11/23/17 The game has been hugely updated since this review.,Subnautica
2016-08-02,0,0,165,True,Recommended,Definately a game to blow some time on if you just feel like derping around. Yes it does get boring after a while but you can find ways to make it interesting like make a garden collect eggs and raise 100 stalkers go to the dunes or aurora and crap your pants by being attacked by reapers shock the reapers and make them cry build a huge base for no reason build an island with the terraformer or explore. In my opinnion Id say this game is horror and adventure its horrifying when you get eaten alive by a reaper or watch a crabsquid or crabsnake wander around (crabsnakes being a bit more majestic than a 14 legged freak). The game might not have alot of potential just yet but things like (im not saying the name of the race) alien bases and alien abominations are definately going to spice this game up.Yes the monthly updates might not be the most exciting but quite a few add interesting concepts like the chargers those definately allow you to save a few resources by charging your depleted cells and batteries where before these were added you would have to craft new ones. Summary an interesting game with a lot of possible potential not reccommended if you easily stress out because some creatures will latch on to you/grab you to kill you (i think i set the record for the number of yous in a single sentence) because like me i feel like im going to have a heart attack recommended if you do like changing your pants alot and feel like building some crazy base.,Subnautica

2018-11-21,0,0,63,False,Recommended,I am going to say this at the beginning of the review. Play this game! It is one of the best survival games I have ever played and will go down in history as one. I may spoil some stuff in this review so please play this game it is so much better to experience all of this first hand. Anyway without further ado let us get into the review.The PositivesThere is so much that this game gets right that it is hard to sum up in a quick review. The visuals are stunning beautiful water effects the world feels so alive. The sound design is immaculate from the reefbacks to the squids they all sound spot on. The content is amazing with all locations in the map distinct and offering something completely new. The creativity and customization regarding your base locations are unique to any other survival game I have ever played. The equipment is weak but effective not making all the monsters seem powerless and still posing a threat to the player.The NegativesThere is honestly not much to say. One point I could bring up is how difficult it is to find parts and blueprints for equipment. Through my game I had to result in searching up where to find particular parts because it was taking me so long to find just one part. Another point to possibly bring up is the lack in developer updates. To my knowledge Unknown Worlds is currently working on a new expansion but besides that they haven't really added anything to the game.In conclusion I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone. This gets a 10/10 for me. A truly perfect survival experience.,Subnautica

2018-11-21,0,0,21,False,Recommended,DISCLAIMER This review has been created for the autumn sale badge primarily. Its content is valid nontheless.I've only got some 20 something hours under my belt but I've been following and (back then only occasionally) playing Subnautica since its early stages of early access.First things first the developer did in fact deliver on the promises they made. The game has been in development for quite a while and the full release is a breathtaking piece o' art in my opinion. The environment(s) are captured beautifully as f* k. The world that you're exploring screams for you to keep going further since it seems there's always something new right around the coral (I'll never forget my first time discovering the glowing mushroom caves!).One thing for the single players among you Subnautica is single player only and it's unexpectedly great at it. It may be a survival game with all the classic survival elements (that to many screams for multi player) but it is well thought out and does in fact have a story that you're playing through.The game mechanics are pretty straightforward. A decluttered UI and easy controls add to the great accessibility of the game. The only actual issue I find myself having is that sometimes objects are being rendered quite late and thus popping up out of nowhere. Might be that's due to a rather short detail drawing distance/LOD stuff? Dunno... I can only speak for myself of course but I can live with that pretty well.The best part though that made me grin all over my face (warning contains spoilers for new players) Getting ripped apart by a reaper leviathan for the first time gave me massive chills. The same uneasy gut feeling you have when you wake from a nightmare. That alone is an example of fantastic staging and scripting. It's rather rare that a game can make you feel like that nowadays without the use of jump scares or the likes.TL DR Subnautica is an aesthetically more than pleasing game within a world full of surprises and a load to see. The story is in fact rather interesting the more you get into it.,Subnautica
2016-11-24,0,0,97,False,Recommended,Not since Morrowind has a game captivated me so with its setting and ecosystem. It does justice to the oversaturated survival crafting subgenre and shines as an example on how to do Early Access well. Equally beautiful and terrifying Subnautica will have your full attention as you explore the mysteries surrounding this alien waterworld.Edit Unlike other games the increase in price has matched the content added. It is still completely worth it.,Subnautica
2016-11-23,0,0,94,True,Recommended,Probably the best run early access I've played pretty frequent updates with loads of new content. The game is engaging and a background story unfolds naturally as you explore new biomes unlock new technologies and stumble on hidden locations. Can be taxing on lower end systems because the graphics are beautiful and the sea is full of life.,Subnautica
2018-07-07,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This game instilled me with a sense of awe that no other game has matched. Chock full of gorgeous underwater scenery exploration is a balanced by the sheer unadulterated terror of the alien unknown. With a masterfully crafted soundscape Subnautica will leave you on the edge of your seat for the entire experience. My only regret is that I can never play it for the first time again (but this hasn't stopped me from replaying it anyway).,Subnautica
2018-07-07,0,0,213,False,Recommended,I have played plenty of games in my time but this is by far the best. It has such a sense of eploration and a magical and mysterious aura around it. You can survive you can explore you can learn and you can build. I highly recommend it. But the thing I love the most is going deep. Down there is so much different to the surface. Monstorous creatures beautiful sights and scary places. Im going to be honest some siduations can be terrifing. And at times I have sworn its more of a horrer game. I love this game 9999999/10.,Subnautica

2015-02-07,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Being that this is an early access game i cant say its 100% at this point in time (Im not meaning completed Im meaning as a score)For its current state though it is quite amazing and graphically eye catching with its bright mix of colour.Pretty much a ocean survival game not much else to it.You swim around collecting resources so you can gradually build (and name) your own submarine known as the CyclopsOnce you have that the vast oceans of this alien world are yours to explore.. on saying that though there really isnt much to do at this point.. I guess you could go explore the depths in your mini sub (the Seamoth which can also dock inside your Cyclops) and avoid the many sea creatures that are able to attack you (there is also many that are neutral) but there really isnt much to do and after a few hours of gameplay it may get a bit boring for some.Personally i love it.. Its good to play an ocean exploring submarine game rather then the usual FPS or any other mainstream game out there.Yes theres bugs and glitches and some can be quite annoying but the console commands assist alot though.In all if your willing to assist the dev's in progressing this game and love exploring alien ocean depths then yeh i recomend this game.If you wanting more content and greater activities then i guess its best you wait this one out for a while.*Update* Just buy it!

To me there was enough of a game here to be worth more than the 20 dollarsI can say right now the best aspect about this game is the exploration aspect. This has to be the best representation of an explorable ocean in any game I've seen. Its an alien ocean too. Its huge scary deep and full of things that want to murder you. Oh yeah that's the neat thing. The ocean can get REALLY deep. Try looking down while wading water and not being able to see the bottom until you go very far down. It can be terrifying.There is a huge variety of ocean biomes to explore with colorful (or dull depending on what biome you're in) flora and fauna in them ranging from underground caverns with pink jellyfish mushrooms wastelandic dunes coral reefs kelp forests and crashed remnants of the ship you fell down from and more.As someone who's terrified of open water this game was a really cool experience.

After the full game came out a while ago it took me weeks to beat it. I remember everytime their was a big update to the game I would have to restart the whole game. I did taht untill just a while ago when (again) the full game came out. This has been one of 3 things that kept me playing Steam. This was my very first story mode game. To the Creators of Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you for being the reason for staying on Steam. I have had so much fun times on here. I would also like to congratulate you on this game. This game is just like a baby and I am a person growing up with it. I have watched this game go from being just a small little game with low graphics develop over time get bigger more well known to being a full game with awesome graphics good detail awesome voice actors unique story plot and of course badass music. I love this game so much I was willing to spend $160 on a better graphics card (I think it was) just to play this game. The weird part is I hate the ocean in real life but I was willing to play this game to help me overcome that fear. It didn't really help. So I would recomend this game to anyone who is afriad of the ocean and wants to scare themselfs. Again Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you and congratulate you on this awesome game. P.S.

2016-11-24,0,0,105,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. It is a mix of science fiction survival exploration fear wander and a feeling of inmersion like no other. It is beatifull beyond words and rather simple. The best is the exploration that we are discovering for the first time so many creatures the feeling of being quite defenseless the feeling of being lost. Speechless.Also the devs are great very open and actually you can acces the developmente status on trello.Cons Sometimes fauna and flora variation is not that big. However this is normal as its on Earlly Acces.10/10. Totally recomended.,Subnautica

2018-10-17,0,0,73,False,Recommended,I don't normally write reviews. Quite frankly I feel a game should be pretty good at the least as you bloody well paid for it. But this is a lot more than good it's awesome. The story starts off simple which is good. I like Commando. Arnie killing lots of people. Simple is good. It's really great fun scavenging and learning the tech tree at first to break you in. I was expecting the game to then peter out after a couple of hours but it just didn't. It got more and more engaging and had me absolutely hooked. The story structure and attention to detail is fantastic. I was lucky enough to play this in VR on the Vive and although the detailed graphics are boarderline fuzzy/horrible (trying to see your inventory panel) the immersion reminded me of when I did my PADI licence and it really made me feel like I was tootling about underwater. I started holding my breath when I was running out of air for heaven's sake! Anyway...buy this please especially if you have a Vive. Next to Arizona Sunshine this is one of those VR defining titles for me and made me glad I paid for it the whole VR thing. If it makes you feel sick then sorry you just didn't have my Dad driving you around like a lunatic and making you impervious to motion sickness when you were younger ) Hey Sully you remember when I said I would kill you last?

2016-07-01,0,0,153,True,Recommended,"Currently (as of 7/1/16) a clear example of an ""early access"" title that is both enjoyable AND replayable.The Devs are both responsive to their player base and creative indicating that they want to see this game to a ver.1 when it's actually done. My hope is that they don't lose interest too soon and patch it up in order to move on like so many other titles.Around once a month a new patch hits the stable build that changes things so much that players are persuaded to start a new game. And I don't mind a bit! Each new build repairs critical bugs adds new content and improves upon elements that were already interesting enough to inspire players to imagine even more ideas for the direction of the game.The true energy for growth in this title comes from a masterfully orchestrated suggestion function/bug reporter combined with a development blog that reports to players exactly the progress that participant Devs are making towards implementation of said improvements. This system for development does wonders to stem the inevitable tide of criticism that comes from players that typically feel disconnected from the process.Game is worth it in its current state $11.99 summer sale. Even at $19.99 it's better than most other early access titles.",Subnautica
2018-01-20,0,0,53,True,Recommended,Bought this game almost 2 years ago. Since then the game has been significantly changed in a good way. Constant updates to both content and to any gameplay issue. Wish the game had a multiplayer aspect where you could play with a friend however the game is defintely worth the purchase. The immersion of going to those uncharted depths for the first time and hearing loud noises from the npc's can send shivers down your spine.

2018-11-27,0,0,124,False,Recommended,"TL DRWith a personal rating of ""S "" Subnautica brilliantly blends the abysmal possibilities of deep space ocean life into a survival game about the exciting yet menacing exploration of the unknown.Basic info.Genre Action Adventure (Survival) AdventureTheme Sci fi Aliens UnderwaterPlayer type Single playerPerspective First personSummarySubnautica follows the story of a spacecraft s crash on the hostile underwater world of the uncharted Planet 4546B in the late 22nd century. Specifically it follows the struggles of one of the survivors who descends into the ocean exploring and learning about the alien environment and its habitants in order to gather resources craft items and maybe find a way home.Main analysis Overall score 91 100 Rating S Story15 15Universe Outstanding Subnautica takes place in the fictional Planet 4546B which is almost completely covered in water. Aurora crash landed on the planet luckily on a guyot (namely the Crater) that houses a variety of miniature ecosystems. Each of these biomes contains its distinctive set of flora and fauna to discover and resources to harvest. More specifically ranging from the busy coral reefs of the Safe Shallows to the deadly red and white forests of the Blood Kelp Zones and from the hypnotizing Jellyshroom Cave to the blazing Lava Lakes the Crater s biomes are diverse unforgettably original and awe inspiring. In addition being an outstanding base building game Subnautica allows the creation of compartmentalized habitats progressively flourishing into true palaces. Eventually the protagonist may also explore Aurora s crash site and other abandoned bases and facilities.Characters Impressive Despite the plethora of data downloads that can be found among the wrecks the protagonist doesn t encounter any other survivors which results in an even more horrifying atmosphere. The player is forced to explore the ocean as well as encouraged to seek companion among the native fauna (or flora). From a biological perspective Subnautica s biodiversity is impressive and its lifeforms are carefully designed to reflect their evolutionary adaptions. Planet 4546B is a breathing and breathtaking world where one can witness the organisms complex relationships as they develop.Plot Intriguing The game s multidimensional narrative unravels in accordance with the player s pace of exploring as it takes place in a non linear open world environment filled with wonders and threats to discover. The main story line has a classic 3 act structure (setup confrontation resolution) and it includes several side stories. Spoilers aside discovering the history of Planet 4546B is truly fascinating and intriguing. Notably the player is equipped with a PDA a multipurpose device which among others contains a data bank aimed at documenting their journey s logs.Artistic work18 20Graphics / Visuals Captivating Planet 4546B s beauty is colorful vibrant and vivid the wild biomes are refreshing and visually stunning even the intruding technological advancements grace upon this aquatic paradise.Cinematics Bad Subnautica s cut scenes are disappointingly few short and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay.Soundtrack Enchanting Being an established sci fi themed title Subnautica s futuristic soundtrack contains songs that eerily etch the mystery and the horror of the unknown and of what lurks within it the curiosity of exploration and the thrill of discovery deep into one s soul. During their staying on Planet 4546B the player is accompanied by electronic music that stimulates the feelings of loneliness and homesickness yet strengthens and replenishes their hope and will for survival.Audio Great The game s audio successfully vitalizes its creatures rendering them acoustically identifiable as well as either cuter or more horrifying. All in all it contributes to the ambience by creating the ultimate subaquatic experience.Voice acting Great Despite the lack of NPCs the player may collect voice logs and come across radio messages which include immersive performances. On the other hand the player is always accompanied by the voice of his trustful PDA s AI (and occasionally the ones of his vehicles AIs). Finally the telepathic contact with the Sea Emperor Leviathan is mesmerizing.Gameplay12 15Modes Good There are 4 modes (Survival Freedom Hardcore Creative) with different restrictions on gameplay. They define the requirements for survival (as far as the player s needs are concerned) and the number of available lives.Extras Great Duration Extremely long Replayability Incredible Difficulty Not adjustable Grindy The game has a standard level of difficulty (depending on the chosen mode) and requires hours of farming for resources. The player is advised to read the PDA s guides and tutorials.Technical work17 20Mechanics Hooking In order to survive the player must keep their health above 0 while covering their basic needs for oxygen food &amp water by any means necessary. In the meantime they re called to avoid radiation and extreme temperatures as well as defend themselves against any dangerous life forms. The quest for survival is fortunately facilitated by a complex crafting system that provides the player with cutting edge equipment tools vehicles Seabases etc. Furthermore base building feels addictive as it involves the full customization of interiors.Controls OK The limiting 5 slotted toolbar in combination with the lack of hotkeys for essential items (such as the Scanner and the Seaglide) forces the player to periodically spam the PDA in order to access unbound items in the storage and perform basic functions (heal eat drink etc) which is inconvenient and frustrating especially when it s a matter of life and death. Sooner or later the player gets used to driving the game s vehicles and can navigate their way around with ease but till then there s plenty of bumping to put up with.Functionality Good Having spent 3+ years in Steam s Early Access Subnautica is almost bug free. There are occurrences of glitching AI now and then (e.g. models harmlessly passing through the player s base) but since the game s release I haven t encountered any game breaking bugs.Menu Options File size Reasonably big Misc.10 10Development Great Community Great Personal experience19 20Version 3.0.0.",Subnautica

2018-01-30,0,0,83,False,Recommended,"&gt Built a yellow Seamoth Sub and named it ""Newt""&gt Built a yellow Prawn Suit and named it ""Ripley""Just waiting for an opportunity to shout ""GET AWAY FROM HER YOU BIIIIITCH!!!!""This is actually a really good game that I have been binge playing for the past few days. Incredible atmosphere great game design and progression system. Intensely engrossing. Overall fairly solid with no crashes although there is the occasional bit of frame dropping when I enter a vehicle or breach the surface of the water.The only thing that makes me stop playing is the sudden realization that I've gone wayyyyy past my bedtime and I'm starving for some real life food. There's very few games that ever do that to me and very few things in life that do that to me as well. Subnautica is like a gripping novel you just can't put down or a suspenseful movie you just can't turn away from but it's also an epic journey and the more you play it the more you WANT to play it.So yes it has a good story. It also has good gameplay. In some ways it borrows from games like Metroid in that you MUST upgrade your gear in order to reach certain places like reinforcing your submersible so that it can descend further. But it also blends that with games like Amnesia where the needed blueprints are in a *really scary hulking wreckage thru a hole that your sub won't fit thru so you better get to swimming...* It's got ATMOSPHERE! LOADS OF IT!And all of the little tidbits of audio from the Alterra Corp. AI that talk to you through your helmet audio paint a little bit of wry humour just to break the scariness a bit and the game loop of going back and forth between the bright safety of your undersea base and some truly terrifying and inky depths just keeps you from getting used to how scary AND beautiful Subnautica is. There are some truly gorgeous things to be seen in this game and the handcrafted locations feel like just that HANDCRAFTED AND UNIQUE and NOT copypasted and bland!In terms of lethal weapons you have your survival knife and you can manufacture nerve gas torpedoes. The former is more of a tool though you can use it to fend off smaller parasites and nibblers and secure food and the latter is reasonably effective against anything that isn't Leviathan class. You're neither at the bottom of the food chain nor the apex predator but when you have to craft your own torpedoes you probably won't feel inclined to fire them for any other reason besides self preservation. All the aggressive species are inedible and provide no usable materials so your best bet is to avoid them as much as possible. Besides even if you kill one the sea has a limitless supply of them.But in terms of other gadgets and tools the Stasis Gun is going to be the one that gets you out of a pinch the most because it works on almost everything and it's the best tool for securing food AND for holding the most unsettling creatures in place while you either swim the hell away or get a scan and then swim the hell away.And all the crafting and customization of your undersea habitat feels really well thought out. You don't *have* to go and make a big aquarium and populate it with creature eggs gathered from the depths but after you come back from a terrifying dive after being chased by giant spooky beasts you are going to think about sprucing up the place while your terror subsides and you can work up the courage to go back there because you left early because you ran out of food or storage space because the spooky place had all this great loot back there.C'MON WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN?!?! THIS IS THE BEST SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD SINCE FOREVER! STOP READING THIS GO BUY IT ALREADY SHEESH!P.S. When I build my big Cyclops megasub I will call it the ""Sulaco""",Subnautica

2016-11-27,0,0,127,True,Recommended,9/10This is without a doubt one of the best early access or indeed indie titles i've ever played.The gameplay and controls are incredibly smooth the graphics are surprisingly beautiful and the atmosphere is captured brilliantly despite it being almost exclusively underwater.As it is still in early access there is obviously a limit to how much content there is although what is already in the game is very polished and engaging.It is one of the few early access games to regularly get updated with a big update coming at least once a month and developers are very open to the community with an excellent section on their website for bug reports feature voting and production tracking.Subnautica is a fun atmospheric and well polished survival/exploration game which honestly makes you believe you are on an alien world trying to survive in a beautiful yet dangerous ocean.For only 15 this game is an absolute steal.,Subnautica

I never played the beta I never saw anyone else play it. I just saw it on sale bought it because it looked good and started to play it blind. I stopped playing for a couple of months because I did not know what else to do. I started playing it again because I saw some gameplay and wanted to play it again. In the past week and a half I built my first base seamoth prawn suit seaglide and cyclops because I did a lot of googling. I spent most of the game swimming around without any of that stuff and dying a lot. So what I ask the developers is to put in more objective descriptions for the people who have never heard of this game before or is new to these types of games.

If you've ever wanted to play a survival game but always dreaded the greving this is the game for you.

2018-03-23,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A masterpiece. This game is incredible a real experience. It has stirred emotion in me unlike any game has done in a long time.What Subnautica does is truly unique. Subnautica stands you on an alien ocean planet. It dares you to survive and tricks you with its illusions of safey. Truly the best advice I can give to any new player (which I recieved myself) is to play this game guideless. Dive in with both feet and survive. Figure it out on your own. Leave the guides and tips till later and let the game teach you.But aside from all of this the thing that Subnautica does the best is this Subnautica gives players the means to build the perfect ocean base and research facility. It seduces you with its habitat customizations posters cuddly toys (and fish) potted plants and furniture. It does this so well that you'll forget you were even planning to leave.And that's what makes the final step in this game so much harder. This game excels at creating an emotional bond between player and experience and then forces you to say a heartfelt 'Goodbye!' and leave it all behind for home.So goodbye for now Planet 4546B.I'll be coming back to do it all again in future.

2018-02-02,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Let me just start off by saying this game is easily one of my favourite games ever made and easily the best survival game on steam The visuals and the sounds are top notch they set up the atmosphere spectacularly and really immerse you in this beautiful world. Every biome every cave cavern and whatever else you come across feels and looks incredible and unique.My one gripe with the visuals is that there are some poppup issues the game engine seems to have a hard time with that but the quality of said visuals easily makes up for it. Exploration is easily one of the best parts of this game. Terror mixed with bliss as you go deeper and deeper into the depths of planet 4546B fills your every nervous breath as you watch your oxygen tank slowly deplete while simultaneously listening in a boot shaking fashion to the sea monsters roaring and swimming around you. I swear sometimes this game is a horror game in disguise.Subnautica being a survival exploration game you wouldn't expect much if any story. Subnautica once agains exceeds your expectations by delivering an incredibly well linked together and presented story. The deeper you get into the game the more the story and the lore of this planet reveals itself to you through readable PDAs exploration and astonishingly good voice acting. You slowly start making sense of the rubble steadily uncovering every secret this planet has. ""Why did the Aurora crash?"" or ""Why is that bizzare creature even for this alien planet so hell bent on killing me?"" or ""What happened to all the Aurora survivors?"" you get answers to all of them.There is a whole spectrum of different fauna and flora for you to discover and learn about some harmless others scaring the sh*t out of you to the point where you wish their whole species went extinct. At no point in this game do you ever get lethal weaponry which really helps with the whole setting of you never being the apex predator the ocean is your apex predator.Something I stole from someone elses review but is cool nonetheless ""There is a sense of wonder and danger present in this game that I haven't found in other similar titles. The light fades the deeper you go and sometimes all you can see is a limited field in front of you. That doesn't mean you don't hear everything. ""The devs of Subnauta are unbelievably devoted to this game. Subnautica was released on early access 3 years ago. Back then it was more of an idea than a functional game. The graphics looked like crap and the game was very underdevelopped. On multiple occasions the devs almost went bankprunt but luckily for them the game was brought to light by youtubers and twitch streamers who helped foster a community for the game and helped the game prosper. After funding for the game started getting some traction the dev team went beast mode and started pumping out update after update and made the development progress easily accessible to anyone through the trello where they released logs and images of the whole thing. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entraintenment ( hehe studio name matches the game ) for making this game a reality. Conclusion This game is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word and should be experienced by every single person who has the ability to do so.Visuals 4/5 because of the poppup issues the graphical design itself is astonishingSounds 5/5 simply top notchImmersion 5/5 got hooked for 6 days until I finished the gameExploration/gameplay 5/5 Story and lore 4.5/5 very good for any game but especially for a survival gameHUD and player menus 5/5 practical and stylishLenght and price 5/5 I followed the game fanatically during early access meaning I knew exactly how to progress and where everything was located and it still took me 27 hours. 27 hours of pure enjoyment for 23 euro.Overall 9.5/10 Just buy it already have I not praised it enough ?",Subnautica

2018-06-21,0,0,34,False,Recommended,TL DR Amazing game worth the high price! But beware of replayablility 8/10Played the game start to finish in about 32.5 Hours but sandbox mode seems like the way to go. I finished the game in about 2 weeks of off and on gameplay using a few wiki pages to find some of the fragments for the tools and find quicker ways into the lost river/lava zones. If you went through the game completly blind not having watched anyone play the game or use wiki pages (I did both) it would easily take you another 20ish hours to finish the story AND you would have a ton of fun in sandbox exploring all the different areas of the game. But for someone like me who has seen other people play the game and beat it there is hardly any replayablity value for me.,Subnautica

The environment is gorgeous and all the various creatures are well realized and designed. Amazing sound design great music and even an actual story!The base building is pretty simple yet still very engaging and there's lots of entertainment to be had just trying to build a well laid out base. Vehicles handle well (except when they're not supposed to) and they each have their advantages and disadvantages that balance each other out.It actually took until my third playthrough before I realized that some of the logfiles you can find in the world have audio that can be played and that made it even that much better!All in all I heartily recommend this game to anyone.

2018-08-08,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Subnautica is potentially the best survival horror game I've ever played that's not even labeled as a horror game. You start off the game as a survivor from a ship called the Aurora and your primary goal is obviously survival. You constantly have to keep an eye on your food and water meter (unless you're not playing survival mode) alongside your oxygen and health. And if that's not enough to keep you on your fins soon you find out there's fish so big you never want to see them more than once. Subnautica also has a very interesting story that I will not spoil here for those who haven't played the game yet.So now that the basics are out of the way let's review the positives and negatives about the game PROS A huge oceanic environment with many different biomes to explore all containing different fauna and flora. A touching story that will make you sympathetic towards a massive aquatic species. Three interesting vehicles that are mostly fun to operate and integral to your survival. Dozens of different blueprints scattered around the biomes leading to useful equipment. Potential fish friends! Contains the most terrifying area in any game ever (also known as Crater's Edge).CONS Is a bit buggy at times. It can also be a bit laggy.Overall? 9.8/10! Subnautica is probably one of the best games I have played in a while and I'll be looking forward to the Arctic biome DLC.,Subnautica
2017-09-02,0,0,320,True,Recommended,This game is early access but it is AMAZING!I love The Immersion! It really sucks you in. The Graphics and detail are great! Salvaging Crafting Building Exploring Surviving BluePrints with risk for reward mechanic That moment where your computer A.I. talks and puts you at ease with its calm voice just to get jump scared a moment later by some random aquatic creature because you think your actually are struggling to survive!I truly expect this game to be my favorite game for a long time. Even though its not finished it is only an update or two away from being a complete story.I do however want the bugs fixed. Especially immersion killing ones. I notice everything especially the difference between a normal battery and an upgraded one in the charger having the same mesh. My cyclops not healing all the way once when I patched the hull (Related to being hit by a Ghost L********). Jumping on my cyclops with my prawn sends it 138 000m down into nowhare through all the terrain and still hearing the ai screaming about it being below crush depth. Causes me to reload my last save. Lastly the performance on some areas causing the game to stall for a bit while it thinks not rendering items occasionally fast enough and all performance hit items related to this should be addressed. This will only add to the games value and for me that oh so great immersion.I fully expect the team to fix these things and have a well polished game in the end. They are completely open about development to the public and have a trello page that you can follow to see exactly what is going on right this moment in its progression.I give it a 8 / 10 now and feel it will be a 10 / 10 game by the end of its developement.IMO this game is a must have! I say get it. I believe the price will be going up at release (They will then likely also put it on sale to make you feel your getting a deal) and you will only have done your wallet a diservice to not have grabbed it sooner.ENJOY!!!!,Subnautica

I have a 1.8 ghz processor 6 gigs ram and ATI Radeon 5400 graphics card and it runs ok on minimum graphics.It's unique.

2018-11-25,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"Subnautica is one of the best games I've ever played I can't recommend it enough.Normally the tags ""Survival"" ""Open World"" ""Exploration"" and ""Crafting"" turn me away immediately because I've spent so much time in Minecraft and these kinds of games are a dime a dozen. Subnautica is absolutely anything but. Immersion is a term used a lot in games but Subnautica pulled me underwater and into the game so well. The environment is beautiful the sound design is extremely well done and the story is... something I hope you get to experience without any spoilers. I was entirely blind sided by the moments this game brought about. Story is difficult in an open world because you might just miss some content but the developers made a system that led you to everything you need to.The survival aspect of the game is fun as well. As I said I've played a lot of Minecraft and other survival games so the genre feels very grindy to me now. This game's world drew me in to ignore any gripes with that and... made me actually want to have a base for the sake of living in the world. Living and furthering my exploration of the world below of course.I've played games since I was a kid so a lot of the magic of video games is a bit lost on me now but Subnautica caught me off guard and brought that magic back.

2018-03-19,0,0,177,False,Recommended,"""This ecological biome matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans."" This game is terrific and at times terrifying it can also be heartwrenching. It is more than survival but it is survival at it's most basic. I won't give spoilers aside from saying it's a horrific shame to be here in this amazingly beautiful world alone. I have played a couple of other ""survival"" games but this one actually gives you the total sense of isolation while communicating with you. You have no one to talk to but your PDA talks to you and it's not just mind numbing information. You can't talk to your PDA however were I really to be in this situation I would be talking back to my PDA the same way I talk to my screen when I play. Sometimes I laugh at the comments sometimes I'm just like ""No sharding Sherlock...."" but it really does communicate with you not just talk at you and by that I mean that the information is meaningful and not just data. I have found a place where the biome matches 9 out of the 9 conditions by the way and one of those conditions is a sense of hopelessness. I did however manage to limp my way back.The beauty of the game world is captivating and alive. You don't long for life and the place feels far far from dead. You do long for others however and being with others is always just out of grasp. Subnautica motivates you to do everything. It drives you to explore it drives you to build it drives you to work toward a sense of normalcy when there is no normal anymore. Subnautica pushes you to face your fears and to actually dive deeper in every aspect of the meaning. In the begining you are totally helpless and while that situation improves some you are NEVER the big fish. For all the tech at your disposal you have the means to survive but never the means to dominate. You are actually in over your head. Being in over your head however doesn't take away all hope ever and pushes you to explore and challenge yourself and go further and deeper.The sense of what could be never goes away the sense that you need to leave remains the sense that you will miss this place when you do grows and grows but you know one thing you can't stay and even knowing that you will miss this place and all the effort you put into it you know you can't really come back for a vacation either and if you did it wouldn't be the same. Part of the beauty is the isolation and the isolation while leading to despair at times is part of what makes it feel so amazing. Were you to live in this world with a group of people it would be ruined. Measures would be taken to ensure that humanity becomes the big fish and the big fish are part of what makes this world what it is. I wouldn't mind surviving with a partner but the one thing that is most out of place in this world is you and were anything to change it it would be ruined. That is part of why you can't stay I feel not just due to the isolation but because you are actually lucky to be alive and see what this world has to offer.",Subnautica

2018-06-14,0,0,32,False,Recommended,I haven't written any reviews before and my english isn't really that good so bare with me. But for this game I just had to write a review.When I saw this game I thought it would be just a regular survival game but underwater. I thought that that was an interesting concept so I tried it for a bit. At first it really was just a survival game it looked amazing. The more I played and the more I explored I started to notice that there was more in this game then you would think. This game wasn't just an ordinary survival game you had a goal you had to escape this planet. Not only that this whole game had an amazing story line which would unfold by reading little PDA's which you would find by exploring . This game is so beautiful and I must say it was terrifying. There were moments were I really jumped there were moments were I felt like a hero because I would've done something that was really amazing. Another fun part of this game is that you can't really kill fish with weapons I think this makes sure that players don't just gather weapons and start killing everything this makes sure you have to play smart to make sure you don't die. I just finished the game this game is easily one of the best games i've ever played and I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games and likes a little mystery that slowly unfolds.Now for the pros and cons Pros Beautiful graphics Music is amazing The sounds that you hear underwater are really well made and might be terrifying The story is amazing The way that you learn new items and new means of travel are really well thought of You really get the feeling that you are unraveling a mysteryCons There are little bugs that I found at the end but werent anything massive You get thrown in the game without explanation (Could be a positive thing depends on the player),Subnautica

2018-01-24,1,1,44,False,Recommended,This game was an amzing survival and stragety genre i loved how the ocean gave you moments of pure beauty and even suspense out of the fear of the creatures in the depths the story was amazing even if the player was a silent protangonist the story was still being driven the music as well was perfected and it was something i liked listening to on my playthrough of it as it never got boring the ending which im not going to spoil was also very well produced and had that amazing epic feel to it where you get goosebumps not out of fear but out of awe instead but they topped it off nicely with a little funny one liner from the robotic PDA voice which i admit was quite funny The gameplay was also really good where i barely spotted any bugs and the graphics even on low were still something that would be covered by the baeuty of the ocean planet but when on high quality as i mostly spent my time with that setting set onto the settings it was just amazing i do definetly recomend this game as for its price it seems almost generous to have it sold at that price but it is still an amazing deal i recommend this game to anyone into survival genres and even thrilling genres too as sometimes it can get quite scary too.,Subnautica
2018-06-30,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Heroes are a strange thing. In recent years the super heroes themselves are well known for killing and fighting. But the best kind of hero is the one who saves lives not those that end them. In Subnautica you are not simply a survivor you are a super hero of the rarest breed.*THIS WILL BE A SPOILER FREE REVIEW ANY DETAILS MENTIONED WILL NOT REVEAL ANY KEY STORYLINE FEATURES*To begin with this game is anything but a grind and that is unusual for survival games. If you have ever played games like Ark Survival Evolved then you will instantly see the contrast here. Subnautica is more about exploration and survival rather than driving you to do endless resource runs and build vast warehouses for your next base or whatever. In many ways the game is vastly more enjoyable due to this fact. Yes you have to look for materials but they are readily available and you only need small quantities for most craftable and buildable items. What's more exploration is not hampered like in games such as Ark as most creatures in Subnautica do not have the ability to ambush you and leave you wondering what hit you when you respawn. But what it does do is broadcast the presense of the creatures who are capable of doing some serious injury to you with audio clue that you hear long before you get within aggro range of them. And this moves me on to the next point.Subnautica is almost a survival horror game in how it presents itself. Not in the gory way but due to the tension it generates with the aforementioned predators. In some of the best horror movies you never saw the monster but you hear them somewhere in the dark this is how Subnautica can be truely nerve wracking at times too. The largest predators the ones that really need to be avoided at all costs tend to hang around specific areas of the oceans you never really feel safe in those areas even when you know roughly where they are. I took to marking their territory with bouys so that I would know that when I heard them they were in a specific direction usually. Since you can hear them from up to 300m away you generally need some indication that what you are hearing is not actually close enouh to be a threat else you end up constantly watching your back for no reason. You do eventually get provided with various vehicles and tools that give you a greater measure of protection. The Seaglide is a standard hand held engine which gives you some significant speed when swimming this in itself allows you to out run most predators with ease. The Seamoth is your first true vehicle a simple one man sub which gives you that added protection since anything that wants to eat you has to chew through the hull first. Moving up again you have the PRAWN mech suit which is far tougher than the Moth but not as fast. It's best used for mining the larger mineral deposits but is also the only way you can actually do damage to the local wildlife. It's not much but most predators tend to turn tail and run if you hit them twice. Finally you have the Cyclops sub this is a vehicle intended for a 3 man crew and due to it's size it is ignored by most predators. It becomes more like a mobile base of operations but its sluggish speed means you can't really explore with it unless you kind of know there is nothing dangerous where you are going. You can also dock the Seamoth or PRAWN into the sub so I would often dock the sub somewhere near to an unexplored region and then undock the PRAWN to scout the area first. But as i said it does get extremely tense when entering an unknown area especially the depths of the ocean where visibility to very poor at times and the only light is from bioluminesant flora and fauna. Or lava. Or rivers of green sulferous goo.Now this is not to say that the game is without bugs. The most common seem to be relating to the local wildlife being able to pass through solid geometry at times and this can really be frustrating if you suddenly have a very large predator appear from within a solid rockface and invite you to dinner. Or when you find the local goldfish 'swimming' through the corridors of your underwater base as if the air was as valid a substance to swim through as the water outside the bulkheads. Fortunaely these instances are not common but they do get annoying from time to time.All in all Subnautica will take you a good 50+ hours to really finish if you take the scenic route. The developers were kind enough to signpost your way through the objectives but as I eventually discovered it helped me a great to not just follow the breadcrumbs or else a lot of backtracking would have been needed. There is a measure of replay value here but the world is not randomly generated so once you've played through it once you'll lose the awe wonder and terror that the game produces in abundance during your first play through.Wholeheartedly recommended here's hoping more survival games take notice of what this title did so well.,Subnautica

2015-09-01,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Very enjoyable game lovely visuals and mood great feeling of being a diver in an alien reef.I have two big beefs with it at the moment but I expect both to be solved with time because I have been VERY impressed with the frequent and substantial updates the developer is making to the game they are clearly commited and this is early in development still.The first issue is that there isn't much in the way of end game/late content. After playing it for 11 hours (that includes starting over a couple of times) there's just not much left to see or do. As I said though from their current track record I have every confidence that the developer will add more stuff until it has substantial gameplay. I'm only mentioning it so you know what you're going in to if you're buying it now and hoping to play a lot right away.Issue number 2 is... well myself and several others on the forum have serious issues with motion sickness in this game particularly when piloting the small SeaMoth vehicle. I can only play for small periods (10 mins or so) if using that vehicle before having to stop. I sincerely hope the controls will be tweaked to reduce the nausea.Final verdict Want to support a game that's almost assuredly going places and looks awesome? Put some bucks inthere now It's worth it. Want a substantial game to play and not just a bit of colourful exploring and crafting for a few hours? Wait with your purchase.,Subnautica

2019-02-05,42,349,40,False,Recommended,"Oh man it's been at least a decade since Ace Combat 6 and we finally have 7 released. I've played the numbered Ace Combat games from 2 6 and to any series veteran wondering if its worthwhile I'll tell you this.If the previous Ace Combat games were that kid back in the 7th grade who was down to play Goldeneye or Mario Kart with you all day everyday.Ace Combat 7 is that same kid a decade and a half later after they age up and manage to become a gazebo owner and still is down to play those games with you.Even though 7 is all triple A and hella purdy grafixs planes now (and arguably flawed compared to the older games in it's story/amount of content) the gameplay feels just like it should with new things to keep it fresh like the new weather mechanics and there are still some throwbacks to previous games and traditional moments that make you go...YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS MY STIFF THOTTLE STICK IS COVERED IN VANILLA COLOURED MOTOR OIL RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T EJECT OUT OF MY MESSY CANOPY or you know a similar sensation but less extreme of course.To those new to Ace Combat games I would definitely recommend picking this one up on a sale.If you have that feeling of ""wow I need a break from all these FPSs open worlds and sidescrollers and need a cool game out of the ordinary""This is that game right here. Give it a good shot and you will most likely find yourself an excellent breath of fresh sky air from this oddball game.",ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN
2019-02-01,6,358,27,False,Recommended,I'll start by making it abundantly clear that I am a huge fan of the ace combat series. I have played to 100% completion just about every one of them baring Assault Horizons which I don't view as an Ace Combat game. As such I feel it's important that I do my due diligence and write a review for those who come after me to determine if they wish to purchase this game.I'll start by clarifying that at the time of writing this there is a large amount of review bombing occuring so I will directly be refuting the points being made by the negative reviewers at the moment.1st There are claims this is a low grade console port.It has some alarmingly bad PC setup problems You can't change settings outside of basic flight control settings. IE inverting your controls and slightly altering flight style.2nd This game is meant to be played with a controller just like Darksouls from From Software.This is an arcade plane game. It has always been designed this way. If you expect 100% realism with complete HOTAS support from an Ace Combat game you've missed the point of Ace Combat. 3rd Bandai Namco is remaining silentThis is false they posted on the forums how to fix the problem with HOTAS until they can bug fix.https //steamcommunity.com/games/502500/announcements/detail/1729848148045983457This is the link. Stop screaming that they didn't do anything within 24 hours of release. Gods above.That out of the way my state in the game.Played through the campaign the first time beat it. Working on getting the rest of the planes and their upgradesI have not yet played Multiplayer.Yay Incredibly beautiful graphics. Amazingly optimized I experienced zero frame loss at the most intense moments of gameplay. I had 40 planes on screen at a point lasers flying to and from missiles everywhere. Flares being dumped left and right. No frame loss.Incredibly fun campaign encourages replayability with custom skins and unlocks which become available upon completion of certain requirements. Like previous games it adds aces which you can kill to unlock their special skins. To get them to appear you must perform to your highest in every mission ((Do certain things that enable them to spawn))Really fun high octane fast paced A classic Ace Combat gameReally good controller supportDecent difficulty rampX 02 Wyvern's backNay Feels hand holdy when it comes to landing/refueling... Makes me feel like I'm a baby and takes some of the fun out of it by essentially completing these tasks for me...It's an Arcade game so planes routinely do unrealistic things like high G maneuvers without their pilots passing out.((I was beyond confused the first time I seen an Su 30SM perform an Immelmann turn only to fly straight back down yo yo style before it ramped up to max speed within 2 seconds and juke off screen)) &lt This.Lack of PC settings that we all adore and love.Shortish campaign. 20 missionsIn closing I love this series I like this game. It's a great entry. I intend to keep playing as soon as my work schedule allows me to and my partner stops giving me dirty looks when I drool over the models of some of the planes. If you like Ace Combat Fires of Liberation and more specifically The Belkan War you'll love this game. Just keep in mind this is a console game being brought to PC it was always a console series and expecting their first game outside of Assault Horizons to be perfect is silly. I hope you will find this review helpful and enlightening!,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN
2019-02-03,5,149,3,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Disclaimer My copy of the game was provided by Bandai Namco Entertainment as thanks for my work at Acepedia the Ace Combat wiki. I also purchased the special collector's Strangereal Edition for PC but that code is going to someone else.My playtime here does not include the hours and hours I've spent playing this game on PS4. Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the return to form that Ace Combat has so desperately needed for over a decade. We haven't had a proper Ace Combat game in so long and while I loved Ace Combat Infinity to death it was a free to play game and not a complete experience.Ace Combat 7 is a complete experience. It features an enthralling detailed story that goes in directions you don't expect. It can be a little convoluted at times but this is part of the charm of Ace Combat storytelling figuring out the truth in the mess of conflict and strife. I daresay that this game is the most accurate of Ace Combat portrayals of the chaos of war. It all goes to hell as it should.The performance of the game on PC is astounding. The Steam version is truly the ultimate version of Ace Combat 7 with support up to 4K resolutions 8K supersampling uncapped framerates and any XInput gamepad you can plug into your computer... Yes the flight stick support is a little disappointing but that's not how Ace Combat was meant to be played anyway. The real disappointment here is the lack of in game TAA support draw distance options and removal of chromatic aberration and vignetting. Thankfully most of these can be fixed very quickly cleanly and easily. See the PC Gaming Wiki for details you'll definitely notice improvements.The presentation... my god this is the most gorgeous Ace Combat game ever created. The graphics. The music. The sound effects. The aircraft models. The cockpit models. Seeing my sweet baby the X 02 and Stonehenge in full HD. And it's not 110% realistic there's some expert shading and design work at play that makes it look uniquely Ace Combat while remaining close enough to reality that you can enjoy it fully.The real big disappointment for me is the multiplayer component. This isn't something that affects my personal opinion of the game itself as I care far more for the single player experience. But many fans myself included were hoping for an online cooperative experience like Ace Combat Infinity since that game showed just how well Ace Combat works with PvE multiplayer. Instead the multiplayer here is very barebones with just TDM and FFA. A shame. Not enough to make me dislike this game but still a shame.For all of those who have been looking for a chance to dip into the Ace Combat franchise this is your gateway. Ace Combat 7 retains the incredible unparalleled gameplay everyone has come to expect from Ace Combat and everything else (besides the lackluster multiplayer) has raised the bars to match. It's here. It's beautiful. It's time.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN
2019-01-31,14,640,21,False,Recommended,Edit I've now completed the campaign and I wholeheartedly stand behind my appreciation of the game after the first three missions (which is described in the following review). Other users have also pointed out that the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is not supported (although I've seen reports of people using unsupported sticks with a controller emulator).As you can see from my playtime I've only completed three missions so far so don't take this review as something written by someone who completed the game because that's not currently true. With that out of the way I'd like to leave a positive rating to help people who do not have a HOTAS at their disposal and would like to know if the game runs well (and is as good as previous Ace Combat titles).Playing with an Xbox 360 joystick on a 4770k 16gb RAM GTX 1070 machine running at 1080p I'm getting a near locked 120fps maxed. So the PC version is far from badly optimized. The planes control very well with the 360 pad and if I can find my Extreme 3D Pro I'll report back on that as well.I read that 4K support is in actually though other people report that's not the case so if that's important to you there's a chance it might not work.Otherwise the game is excellent so far with clear mission objectives beautiful graphics and outstanding gameplay that more than makes up for the travesty that was Assault Horizon.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN

2019-02-01,9,141,17,False,Recommended,I have absolutely no idea what s going on and I m loving every second of itAce Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the most recent and long awaited instalment in the Ace Combat franchise. This is my first Ace Combat game so my understanding of the story is limited to you re some guy being ordered by some other guy to help defend one country that sounds an awful lot like the country you re attacking. The story really is as confusing as it is ridiculous but maybe that s just because this is my first game in the franchise.Positives It s just great fun. I love arcade flight games and one of the main reasons is because it s just non stop ridiculous action and AC7 is no different. Tearing through the skies at insane speeds and then doing what s effectively a handbrake turn to get the drop on your enemy is just so satisfying especially when you blow them up and get to fly through the explosion.The controls are tight and the planes feel nice and responsive. This is obviously super important for any flight game but particularly important here in this fast paced action a thon. So far I ve unlocked and flown about seven different planes and each one does feel unique. For example the A 10 feels a lot heavier than the Gripen I d highly recommend not using the A 10 in a dogfight!There s a great variety of different planes and weapons to choose from. Initially you start with one (three if you have the launch edition though one of those doesn t have combat capabilities) and more are unlocked by spending MRP in the Aircraft tree. MRP is earned by completing campaign missions and multiplayer matches if you re really trying to unlock something you do earn more MRP in multiplayer so it might be worth grinding a little bit.The multiplayer is surprisingly fun. Typically I don t play multiplayer at all but I decided to try it out last night and it was really good fun. You have a battle royal mode which is an eight person free for all and a team deathmatch where players are put into teams and face off against each other. I think the battle royal mode is a bit more enjoyable and more suited to this kind of game but they were both good fun. I was a little concerned about how few people were playing the multiplayer but I m assuming that most people were just too busy playing through the campaign.There s enemy AI seems very competent. I ve been playing on normal and while I haven t been having too much trouble dodging missiles (yet) some of the enemies are pretty agile and it takes some chasing to shoot them down. There s been a good balance in the missions so far between ground enemies fighters drones and bombers. I haven t felt bored by what I m fighting. Despite the story being well weird and confusing the voice acting is actually really good. I was expecting the voices to be super cheesy but actually it s quite nice hearing the chatter during the missions brings some more life to the game. Also the rest of the sound effects and music are good too. As far as I can tell so far no map is re used. If this is the case then that means twenty different maps which is great. All of the maps I ve seen so far in the campaign and multiplayer have been well designed and nice to look at. There s one map I played in multiplayer that had these towering rock formations that were great fun to dodge in and out of. There s also a free flight mode so you can always go back and just be a tourist in your multi million dollar jet.There are two replays at the end of each mission which are really cool. The first is a regular replay you can watch how you played the mission while changing camera angles speeding it up or slowing it down and you can toggle the display if you want to grab some nice screenshots. I would have liked more fast forward/rewind options and scrubbing would have been good but it s a fun little feature nonetheless. The second replay comes while you re watching your points get tallied up after the mission it s basically neon arrows flying around a black box which may not sound super interesting but the arrows actually do a great job showing off the different manoeuvres you pulled off. These replays aren t something I m going to watch at the end of each mission but I m really glad they re in the game.Speaking of replays replaying the missions with different planes/to get higher scores is a lot of fun and I ve actually already gone back to do that despite only being a few missions in. I haven t achieved any S ranks yet but I m trying to get all A s (hope my parents are proud!)It runs really well. I have a pretty modest laptop and I m having absolutely no trouble running it on medium at 1080p.Negatives The game has launched with broken HOTAS support which has led to the game being review bombed. Personally I prefer playing these kinds of arcade flying games with a controller rather than my HOTAS but I felt it was important to include this anyway. I m hoping we ll see a fix soon so the reviews can start to reflect how much fun the game is.This probably isn t a big deal to many other people but I m really disappointed that there s no take off and landings in the free flight mode. One of my favourite parts of HAWX 2 was doing the full take off and landing in free flight mode some of the missions even let you taxi. Free flight mode is much less interesting without this in my opinion. Here s hoping Project Wingman will include it.I would have liked to see another singleplayer mode in here something like a wave based mode where you fight increasingly more numerous and difficult enemies. It s not a huge deal that there s nothing like that but it would add some more replay value to the game. Verdict Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is an absolute blast the story is utterly ridiculous but the action more than makes up for it. There are a couple of things that let it down a little bit but if you re a fan of arcade flight games then this is an absolute must have.If you found this review helpful please check out my other reviews over at Kemo's Corner.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN

You have two choices join your friends escape the horrors or be left for dead.Left 4 Dead 2 is the classic Zombie Survival Shooter made by the greatest minds of Valve. This is one of my favorite coop games out in the market today. GAMEPLAY The game is fun and challenging. The different chapters give out a new style of gameplay. The game offers a wide array of weapons. The zombie types is where the game shines. Jockey Spitter Smoker Charger Boomer Hunter Witch and Tank zombies will hinder your success. These zombies will join the normal zombie horde to lower your survival rate. Trust me a jockey charger and smoker simultaneous attack can leave the group in disarray and will be easy pickings for the normal zombies.

You can kill the Tank whilst your team mates are all injured. You can sacrifice yourself for the good of the team. There are so many standout moments that I have had playing this. I'm not the best gamer in the world but with L4D2 it really doesn't matter it's about teamwork and pulling together making sure you have someone's back flinging the pipe bomb at just the right moment sniping that smoker right before he strangles a team mate.Best zombie game in my opinion and when I want to play something fun I'll always load this game up just stay away from that witch!,Left 4 Dead 2

2016-02-10,17,203,529,False,Recommended,Yes this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well let me explain.Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half Life 2 and episodes. Yes it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.But don't think graphics are bad. No they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations infected puke beat eachother walk around die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism I'm just getting started.)So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry medical supplies some other stuff. You have a very simple goal get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies 3 basic types of main weapons a few different secondary weapons grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well every time different items get generated in different places you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over again and again. And people actually do.Speaking of people it's a multiplayer. Yes there is single player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players maybe you should play with friends maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back sharing resources with them. Oh and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates %gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11 and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours its gameplay was dull. Yes you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. Easy to learn difficult to master yes we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic and is it bad? Nope it's fine it's a videogame not a reflection of reality.There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic they create games with some new elements. They create a game it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2 Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half Life 3 may never happen what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b a s t a r d ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).,Left 4 Dead 2

2015-08-16,724,2396,1094,True,Recommended,"This is a review of the offline game. This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over 25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests. I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. After I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought ""oh well"". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. I have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.",ARK: Survival Evolved

2016-09-08,0,0,714,True,Not Recommended,Ark Evolved has provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment. It was an example of Early Access done right. But with diverting more and more resources to other projects without actually finishing the core game and now the unprecedented release of paid DLC before the game is even finished I can no longer support or recommend this game.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-12-21,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Really good game! Needs a lot more updates not just adding dinos! I hate the bugs though. They are updating the game a lot and making it more playable. Remember the first day it came out? It was unplayable with bugs lags etc. I mean the dinos were teleporting everywhere and stuff haha. Yeah this game is really good I have it on all of my steam accounts. The game is being updated a lot but realistically they are just adding items and dinos to the game but not REALLY focussing on bugs to be fair. I run a dedicated server on the game I would like more things added to the servers like admin commands you cant even fly because you go super slow its pointless. The game does have a high potential.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-10-27,0,0,1426,True,Recommended,Greetings one and all. I want to express my feelings on this game. My experience. But first I will roll with the pro's and the cons.Pros 1.Breathtaking game with beautiful (as well as immersive) scenery 2.It's not just PvP it is PvPE . In other words you have to watch your back for both players and the environment. 3.It does have a PvE setting for those who desire less stressful gameplay 4.Easy to learn game for anyone starting! Hours of fun! 5. And for those that got ripped from Stomping Land this game is CONSTANTLY updating with new features! Even getting it now while it's still in early access isn't a bad thing! This game isn't so broken it isn't playable AND enjoyable! 6. Tamable Species of all sorts! ((Not just dinos anymore folks!)) Anywhere from prehistoric mammals and dinos to unique sealife! 7. This game prides itself to work together with others. Sure you can go play solo in a server if you wanted. But official servers you are limited with how much knowledge you can gain. So this also limits your crafting? Is this a bad thing? No. It strives people to work together or for those solo players out there. A challenge in the fact that you can overlook this hinderance by finding the blueprints within unique crates that appear randomly over the island!8. Mod friendly! That's right folks! The Dev team has offered the option for player's themselves to make mods to even further the content of this game! You will find thousands of community made mods to enhance your gameplay!Now the Cons1. The game is still in early access. Which means you will run into random glitches that can cause some hinderance in gameplay. ((Fun part is the Dev team knows about these glitches and if you find one they may have skipped? You can actually message the dev team via forums and they WILL answer!))2. Hackers. yes this is a problem in most games. The official servers cane be crawling with them. ((Fun part! Their are several servers and even unofficial servers ran by other players! Also contacting the dev team via forums you will find a thread dedicated in finding such hackers or hacks in the game so they can prevent them with their anti cheat system!))3. Playing alone can be difficult to most and even if you are a social butterfly some people may find it hard to welcome you with open arms. Players are indeed ruthless and the environment even more so. ((if you were me however you will consider this a challange! &gt D))4. Official Servers. They are good and bad depending on how you look at it. Sometimes it's just the server itself always constantly full or maybe the tame rate for some of these creatures are too much for those who want to devote their time to this game. Fear not! That is why they also offer Unnoffical servers! 5. Mod Friendly. This is both a good and bad thing. Mods are fun! They enhance gameplay whether you are looking for more immersion or straight up silliness. However playermade mods can be gamebreaking. Causing errors to the server and/or issues with the actual gameplay once installed. So be careful and read carefully which mods you are adding in!Overall I utterly enjoy this game! I've always been a big dinosaur nut ((or prehistoric nut in this case!)) ever since I was little and for the Dev team of this game to finally come out with something enjoyable and immersive like this? Makes my inner child scream with joy! Take it from me ((a victim of the stomping land fiasco)) This game is worth ir's weight in gold! ((or in this case cash! XD)) Until then friends this is Vaughne signing off! I'll see you in the game!,ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-08-30,0,0,1062,False,Not Recommended,Though the basic idea is a good one the game itself suffers from unprofessionel developers. Actually I cannot recall a single release date or promise that wildcard did actually could hold. They NEVER release on the promised date and the ALWAYS miss at least half the promised stuff. Best example is the last 'Release Update'.The promised Fully working game with virtually no bugs left two new creatures Otter and Phoenix new gear ability to download ice wyvernsThey delivered most of the old bugs still remain collision has never worked with this game that has not changed clipping and falling through the landscape still are common also a lot of sync issues. I seriously doubt the devs ability to fix this ever... of the 2 creatures a single one is available for only PC (not Xbox/Palystation) no new gear no ability to download the ice wyvernsAnd this is not a special thing it's like that for the last 2 years on every single release date. That makes up my impression of dealing with a group of hobby developers that are really far away from any competence. Interestingly they have a great mod community that does a lot of those things that the devs are not capable of.All in all Good idea done badly. The release price is totally out of this world but wildcards are really quite greedy They even released a DLC for the game in it'S unfinished state. If you see this here on a sale for under 20 bucks go for it... and bring a lot of patience as the inofficial ark slogan is it's not a bug it'S a feature ),ARK: Survival Evolved

2017-09-01,0,0,1250,False,Not Recommended,Was a great game for a while in the early months. The devs started adding too much content in my opinion they should have just kept it a primitive dinosaur game but they had to add all this tek and high tier t which I felt ruined the game. All my friends and I had so much fun when it was just simple and primitive with dinosaur pvp and not trexes shooting lazers out of their ing saddles and flying birds holding tens of thousands of pounds of stuff on their back. What has really motivated me to write this negative review for Ark is this outragous price this game should be no more than 25 dollars. The state of the official servers are a joke. Unless you're playing with a tribe of 35 people and can get past the spawn huts built by the tribes who have been on the server since the game came out(yes the official servers have never been wiped) it's almost impossible to get started. with the addition on Tek to the game it has made it even harder for the new player to start.

I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7. First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.Pro tip don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.2.) Unless you're alpha you don't get a base they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) 3.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to tame dinos they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)4.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either refer to 1.)6.) Offline raiding. Just imagine working for 2 3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear you don't get to save any of your dinos you don't even get to fight back it's all just gone. This happens all the time and honestly offline raid protection should be baseline on all servers.7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason sleep or work or whatever then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on or if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basically this site and sites like it are cancer. Also it doesn't tell them your in game name but you steam name that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also if you them off and try to go to another server they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2 3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge if the fact that they have 2 3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos you are DEAD!10.) Ark is a full time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try you won't. Look I'm tired of typing this review just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point their gear will have much higher armor and damage their dinos will have much higher hp and damage just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it not like you'd have a chance if you were.EDIT I never expected my review to actually be popular but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.Firstly this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based offline raid based exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now you would probably expect this. After all they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50 60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50 60 metal from a vein an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1 2k metal an alpha tribe can farm 20 30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now noobs wont know how to do this and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players but if you get more than 20 players in a server the lag becomes unbearable. Once again Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.",ARK: Survival Evolved

2017-08-30,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,Bought this game a while back when it was only $29.99. Pretty good buy back then because the game was rough but the content was streaming in before the console drops. Now I can only log in half of the time and when I do I spend the first 5 6 minutes every few feet rendering after having already waited a solid 8 minutes to login (Not even mentioning the massive amount of memory this game takes just to install). Don't get me wrong the game is okay aside from cheaters hats and random glitches. But Optimization should have been a priority over the bloated content within the game. Hell the Devs dropped an expansion during early access before it was even released and they didn't even give it to the people who bought the early access for free. Now they are selling it full price as well as the expansion which is an absurdity that cannot be made up. These early access games are the P2P Candy Crushes and Farmvilles of the real gaming world deliberately squeezing the funds out of fan boys just to make it seem more appealing to casuals while not supporting the real player base. You can make all the cool items/gear/loot to your hearts content but if the game doesn't function then that stuff has absolutely no value.

2016-09-08,1,7,26,True,Not Recommended,I have owned ark for a year now and from my perspective it is not worth buying I am the type of gamer who likes to run games at max settings and I play at a high resolution of 3440x1440 but I also have a good computer to back it up 2x gtx 980ti's now I know sli isn't supported in every game but honestly it is supported in most and in a game this demanding the developers really need to support sli because with my 2 980ti's at 3440x1440 i get 20 fps on a mixture of high and low settings which after being out this long is pretty abismal to be honest. I mean cmon I run witcher 3 ultra hairworks on at that resolution getting 60+ fps. So if your the kind of gamer who games at 1080p and doesnt care if everything is on low settings then the game is fun! lots of fun but for me it just isn't i load the game up every now and then to see if performance has improved and nope same old 20 fps.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2016-05-30,0,0,7448,True,Recommended,My 2000+ hours show my obvious love for the game. This has to be the best early access that I have played. Yes it has its' bugs .. but they are minimal bearable and the devs are always quick to rectify the problem. With the addition of mods this game is now my favourite game. You can play it solo but for a better experience ... playing in a tribe is awesome. The emmersion in this game is 10/10. Highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.Like other games though .. it should be known that every user will have different experiences which are mostly determined by their computer specs. So the better you have the less you will experience many of the bugs that are only seen by users on lower end PC specs.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-06-29,130,1795,189,True,Recommended,Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true they'll kill your dinos steal your stuff abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself taking everything in eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights maybe even a week but alone you're doomed to be found robbed and killed. And like many others said have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you thing can get really intense really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok T Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them auto turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess block caverns so only they can harvest the resources literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.I get why so much people hate that after all they're just being preayed upon they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now they gotta allow people to be complete a holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.But if everything I said right now put you off don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos just hit level 45 and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.As a closing statement I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better still not there yet but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh and it's also pretty cheap.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2017-09-21,0,0,1983,False,Recommended,"After so long I've decided to finally review this game. I bought this game shortly after it was up for sale in 2015 and the game has come a long time since then. Looking through these reviews talking about performance issues I can honestly say that I haven't had any performance issues since maybe early 2016 when the game was in its infancy still. My pc is 5 years old and it runs this on a mix of high/ultra at 60fps+. That's not to say the game doesn't have its issues bugs dupers and other botters but what game doesn't? It seems people are too lazy to google ""improve performance ark"" or something like that since there is a few easy things anyone can do to improve performance by a bit. I've played on both official and unofficial servers ill talk briefly about my experience.I've put in the bulk of my hours(1600 in fact) into one official server and while I love this game the official servers are brutal. Playing on these is a MASSIVE time investment and I mean MASSIVE. It takes a long time to do anything and starting on an official is brutal much more so if it's a pvp server.As far as unofficial servers go if you can find one with higher rates and a decent friendly community then you're all set get in there and enjoy the game.The bottom line is that yes the game has its issues as any other game does. There is a steady stream of content being added continuously and the game is ultimately fun. If you're on the fence about it don't take all the negative reviews for fact if you want to try it then jump in and try it. And unless you have alot of time or are a masochist then try find yourself a nice unofficial server to begin with.",ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-04-01,0,0,867,True,Not Recommended,The only reason I can gather that this game is immediately 67% off following the update is because nobody wants to play it anymore. Well done.Maybe if they undid some of the damage this past update just caused it would sell for more than $10.

2015-11-27,7,13,116,True,Not Recommended,"Game goes like this Create character choose location spawn in and spend time looking around and scratching your arm where you are unable to move or act and a random carnivore starts to chase you if you lucky enough for it to be far enough away before you stop scratching your arm and looking around then you actually live to try outrun it and inevitably run into something else just as deadly... usually this is not the case before you are able to move you are one hit by said carnivore.Sometimes you are lucky enough to spawn in a less dangerous area like maybe in the snow where you quickly catch a cold and die.If you are lucky enough not to die by one of the 2 ways above then you probably will get stuck in the ground and have to wait till you die of starvation in order to randomly spawn again and probably die by one of the above.If you still manage to survive all of these things then lets talk about combat you manage to make a spear and try hunt something in order not to die of starvation you find something low enough lvl you can probably kill but unfortunately even though you are playing on a server where your ping is between 30 and 60 the animal teleports about and your miss stabs turn into exhaustion and you fall asleep the animal then kills you while you ""tor por"".I tried returning this game after playing it for 8 hours because I found it buggy and unplayable when I got stuck in the ground (and there is no unstuck command or suicide I even tried eating spoiled meat and my own feces) but they refused.So I thought what the hell ill give it another go guess what.. nope still a pile of feces. would definitely not recommend.",ARK: Survival Evolved

2016-04-20,332,1264,1084,True,Recommended,Note At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things. Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs. Then you will meet people these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over or they will be really chill and you'll form a tribe with them. You will spend countless hours with these people farming materials taming dinosaurs and build bases. You will grow more and more in power. You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down. You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes). You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes French and German all while growing more and more powerful. You will on occassion have a set back but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics have a good group of friends and objectives that you have given yourself. You will feel happy with what you have accomplished. But there is a downside. There must always be conflict while it can be delayed for long periods of time it will eventually come. And so another tribe will pick a fight with you. Your tribe will fight their tribe and you may lose or you may win. Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends so you'll never give up. Some other tribes will jointhe fight picking sides. The winning side will probably kill all the dinos take all the mats and kill everyone on the losing side. Thus you have won your first war. You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with. Soon enough you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well. Now the entire server is split 50 50 and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases. Eventually you'll win though and the other side will leave the server. They'll be fed up. As the enemies are now gone you are happy once more. You hated them just as they hated you. Now a long period of peace has passed a couple weeks. There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting. Peace will try to be maintained through talks. But it will fail in the end and more war will arise. This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain. These two tribes will be dominant in every regard leadership tactics dinosaurs and materials. Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server. You will fight your heart out against your former allies. You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend now as an enemy. You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with. You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours. The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end. It will be exhilerating.Then you win. Then you are the supreme ruler of the server. You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest. But then it will hit you. The sadness. As now all the people you had once known months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out will all be gone. Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone. While there is some joy in victory it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with. Your tribemates will still play but it's not the same. Even if not in your tribe you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers. Now all that is gone. You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart. New people will always arrive to challenge you but you'll always beat them down. Destroying any hope they had. You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag. You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power. Finally you'll get bored and leave.Months will pass and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on. You'll log back into your old server. Everything is different. New names faces bases everything. Not a single structure you had built is left standing not a single ruin. All of it is gone. The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs' but you could never tell them. You could never tell them an entire servers history. The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world. The structures they couldn't ever even imagine. The wars you'd fought and people you'd met. You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you for it is all now gone. In it's place is a new world completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity. You will be both extremely happy at this new world and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight. To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours. To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours. To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours. To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.If you'll pour time and effort no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark Survival Evolved. Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game. But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise see things you never thought possible commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ. In the end you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.10/10 Masterpiece.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-09-18,946,1383,426,True,Recommended,First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!This game is like Crack! I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.A few weeks later. we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources carrying heavy loads transportation combat you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.One week later. Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t rexes varying from lvl 150 200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. The next day. I log on.Everything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....The chinese tribe who helped us out from day one Destroyed us.RIP.AtlasAbraxisNienTalonAeonMckittenMcCatMcMuffinMike the trikeBob the trikeArmageddonMorgothApocalypse AnkrahmunAnkaderpMuffinDeemDemonspawnSharkenatorLuluRammusRockeyStoneyScorpenatorMittenRappyOmegaMammutanWoollyMamenamenamenanCarnyBrontenatorAnd many more....That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.3 days later. we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. But we we're determined and longing for revenge.... we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.We started mass producing grenades.I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. Today we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2015-06-05,55,1211,134,True,Recommended,I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...I'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin GoG etc.Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.Make no mistake this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues and the server numbers didn't cover the 100 000+ players... BUT the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. For me that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie or AAA team.That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).In all you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.,ARK: Survival Evolved

But after playing this game for 8 9k hrs and willingly surviving all manner of bugs cheats and trolling I have found the 1 thing that I think is unnacceptable in any game which is the ability of other players to completely shut you out of the game. I am currently in someone's base cuffed to a bed being fed and watered and under ACs so I can't even play move kill myself or otherwise. Like I said I have a lot of hrs so pls don't explain to me how to kill myself in these situations assume I have tried it all. I am literally losing 0 food or water sitting here online for over a day now. I left my computer on to see what would happen and sure enough I'm still losing no stats because of this environment. Somehow my character has decided to also stop defecating so there is no way to die at all. I can't even be rescued/killed by my team because I am in a glitched location where the tribe has a giga parked inside biting through walls. While I feel someday the devs might actually listen and ban cheaters/make this form of prolongued capture bannable atm I am the tribe leader of a tribe that has no ability to play. I am not starting a fresh character and supporting a game that thinks this is gameplay. If you aren't actually playing it is not gameplay. I am sitting here not losing a single stat in a survival game FOR HOURS. Pls fix your game.

And STILL my pc freezes for 5 to 10 seconds whenever I run or whenever there is a moving object (like a dinosaur) in front of me. Honestly I want my money back..,ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-06-08,0,0,1751,True,Not Recommended,Really bad game.It is unfortunate as ARK had SO much potential when it began. The freedom to explore and build was fulfilling. Interaction with neighboring tribes was a social experiment. It was really fun to have long term goals to achieve difficult tasks through planning and to work as a team.Unfortunately Wildcard SUCKS with customer support. Any software requires a corrective actions process to fix bugs administer servers interact with the user group etc... Wildcard has poured all of their effort and resources into new models new skins new features and NOTHING into fixing glitches or exploits. They release game changing new models (tek) that WRECK the game... and provide almost no apologies or fixes. Every release seems to be in favor of the griefers and the exploiters who destroy the economic balance by duping glitching under the map using server lag to their advantage denial of service attacks etc... The ability to move resources across servers without first providing human referees and administrators MONITORING GAME PLAY was a STUPID idea. Providing tek transmitters that can be placed UNDER THE MAP with no server admins on duty 24/7 is completely irresponsible.Unlike other massively multiplayer online games (UO WOW EVE LOTR TF CS...) Wildcard slapped a beta label on a two year old game in order to bybass any responsibility of maintaining their servers. When you play the game you WILL be greifed by a cheater. There is NO recourse. Months of effort will vanish at 4 AM by a handful of cockroach players who spent a few hours grinding weapons that when combined with any of a hundred exploits will bypass your defenses. Your five generations of dino breeding will be wiped in minutes. 200 auto turrets on redundant power generators will be completely impotant as griefers slide into a map glitch and attack your base from underneath the map. They will bring a T rex from an unofficial server to an official server (dup exploit) during a major patch deployment with health 50x what is allowed... and wipe the dinos you took MONTHS to raise. You will watch your favorite dino fall through the map never to be seen again. Your best bird will die as your client lags out and fall to earth. There as SO MANY THING WRONG WITH THIS GAME.IF there was a full time admin present on each server that would respond to these problems and restore your hard work it would be an awesome game. BUT when you fill out a ticket with WildCard they will tell you that it is a beta and you are screwed. They have only rolled back servers when evidence of MASSIVE exploits are so painfully obvious they have to step in. Think about that their only recourse is to restore to a snapshot. That's it. They apparently have no parallel database tracking individual objects IN A TESTING ENVIRONMENT.Seriously don't waste your time. If ARK gets bought out by a larger more professional company (Blizzard EA)... then they will spend money on the support layer. But WildCard has proven to be completely incompetent in this area. Don't give them any more funding EVER.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2017-05-19,0,0,2612,True,Not Recommended,"The premise of this game is amazing but the execution is absolutely embarrassing. Even for an early access game ARK is far too broken to be recommended to anyone. The balance issues are extremely prohibitive. Taming a dinosaur takes literal hours even for experienced players and most species are useless while some are far too overpowered. Once you have a base and some dinosaurs you can expect to have to log in at least every few days to keep your structures and animals from ""timing out"" and being deleted.There are bugs and glitches within every single mechanic of this game. I've had 30 dinos disappear at once. I've had many dinosaurs starve to death next to troughs full of food. I've had dinosaurs get stuck hundreds of feet in the air or get pushed below the terrain never to be seen again. I've had my character get stuck underground or in my own walls. The devs have claimed to fix all these bugs multiple times but they keep happening.And not suprisingly customer support is non existant. Lost dinos or your whole base to a known bug? Too bad. When not IF ARK destroys hours of your work don't expect anything more than a half arsed copy/paste ""sorry.""The developers of this game are far more interested in pushing unfinished and over priced expansion packs than they are in actually fixing anything in the core game. This is not worth your time or money now or possibly ever.",ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-05-29,0,0,573,True,Not Recommended,This game started out pretty fun and has the potential to be. However what it has boiled down to are griefers running around destroying your bases and killing your dinos for lols. This wouldn't be an issue if it was more difficult to destroy something than it is to build it however it is so laughably easy to offline raid a base that there is no point in even attempting to build anything unless you are in a mega tribe with 20 players. Not to even mention that troll builds have players sprinting around at insane speeds with the ability to knock you out in one hit with a wooden club regardless of your armor. The community has just gotten more and more toxic since release.TLDR Game is full of griefers and promotes griefing by design. Stay away.,ARK: Survival Evolved

Solid gameplay in a fun environment.Cannot recommend however a lot of people have mentioned the high price and releasing DLC while still in alpha which is all bad practice the thing that has me not recommending this game is the many bugs and constant crashes combined with the 15min load times. I don't want to have to play another game or watch netflix while i wait for a game to load to only have it crash 5mins later.I may play this one again once these issues have been resolved but i'm not going to get my hopes up.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2016-09-15,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,alright so I've played the game and had fun with it BUT its buggy as hell honestly I would give the main game a sideways thumb if I could. Its fun interesting massive tons of things you can do but the bugs are terrible when you run into them and unless you have a group of people you play with and only play this game it takes forever to get any progress. I probably would have ended up giving this a thumbs up but like so many others have pointed out paid DLC in early access. usually I could let this go but from what I've seen the DLC is more polished than the main game at this point that is a massive middle finger to the people who supported the game. Just a quick tip for the Devs perfect what you started before you perfect the side project.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-08-29,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,You won't see a lot of what the game proposes in their trailers and screenshots. I certainly didn't. It's a massive time sink because on standard servers it takes what feels like about 20 years to do anything. That's how I managed 222 hours. The Dev team has also made it clear that they do not give a damn about their player base. They only care about the money. Which brings me to another point the $60 price tag. I got it on sale and I felt like it was overpriced even at $30 during the Early Access days. Buggy as all hell with the original problems never actually getting resolved just content update after content update adding more and more to the problems already there. It's a shame that it's held down by these issues because the concept of the game is great. The biggest mechanic the taming of dinosaurs and other creatures is awesome. It's a shame that the rest of the game doesn't work half the time. Eventually it got to the point where I needed mods in a single player format for me to squeeze out any enjoyment out of this game. Oh and don't even think about trying to play this game without at LEAST a pretty good PC setup. Mine's OK and can barely pump out this game with decent settings but a fair few people will have trouble getting this game to run with even decent looking graphics let alone what the screenshots promise.

2017-08-20,0,0,1103,True,Not Recommended,"yes im voting it down. why? the game is fun when you start off and get to about mid levels everything can pretty much kill you even the weather but when you get higher up it starts to be work .when i say work i mean every day you log in you have about 2 hours of clean up farming crops feeding repairing forging etc. then if you have time to go out hunt dinos to tame which at high levels is 2 4 hour taming time you hunt for a dino you want have kibble ( dino spec food) to tame it after you shoot it with tranqs ( knock it out) lots of tranqs keep away from you and other dino that would eat it if it knock out sit there for the taming time guarding it and keeping it knock out. then after all this you got to bring it back home with some pretty mess up /pet following command. if you do like i did and try to save said pet dino from an attack and you end up killing your own pet after tring to save it.......did i say enough ? this is probly fun the first 2 maybe 3 time you do this after that i think most would have enough well for me it is. in high lvl there no longer a point to this game its all grinding mats and repeat what i stated . if your into pvp maybe you get more out of it. but with you lock in a sever with only about 25 people avg a sever pvp can get pretty salty with some pretty bad exploits .ok how about a privite server you can maintain you own rules but a sever not cheap by any means and your an amit now not a player.now you got to log on and take care of others problem . i was just on one type of server which i could not log on to it becuase of a mod bug ""ozocraft"" kelp dl a mess up file of this mod once it did crash my game been working on it for a week . but now i give up becuase i do believe the base stucture timer time out and my base gone poof so with that i end my adventure into dino hunting and now remove this game from my library in all and all it not a bad game but have to many anoying problem and lack of NOT worth the $60",ARK: Survival Evolved

Well you'd find that with this.However what you won't find with this game is good frame rate regardless with how low your resolution is. The optimization is horrid and rather than delivering a fix for it the developers have found that releasing DLC is more important.It's understandable that games will react that way if you have a poor PC and specs that are too fancy HOWEVER if you can run intensive games on Ultra such as Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 GTA V Middle Earth Arma 3 etc and NOT be able to run this game there is an ISSUE.Even tinkering with the settings setting them to medium or low and then flying away from any graphical clutters from dinosaurs spawned is not enough to keep the game's frames from being staggering then there's something in the game that needs fixing.But hey let's have some new DLC instead of optimization shall we?This is a wonderful game but I can not enjoy it because of the lack of work on it.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2017-03-10,0,0,446,True,Not Recommended,"There are a great many options in the survival crafting genre. It's worth noting that most started at ARK and then fixed the glaring weaknesses. It's unforgiving in both good and lazy ways. Hostiles are... hostile. That's a great unapologetic quality. However it actively supports griefing in ways that are literally impossible to defend against. In virtually every official server all starting spawn locations are walled off and every inch prevented from building. This makes the server unplayable. Only recommended if you find an active server with a devoted admin as much game playability depends on them.Additionally there is no ""offline"" when you log in you'll usually find yourself long since dead and often with your base destroyed even on PVE servers. If you're into ""unforgiving"" and the concept that there really is no sense of safety that's a feature. If you prefer to be able to log off and breath a little easily it's a frustration. Years of work can be destroyed in a few minutes with no recourse.Pros Dinosaurs are cool. Seriously they're huge intimidating and amazing.Reasonably varied terrain.The ""polish"" is pretty... well... pretty. Dinosaurs really are epic from sight to sound. Water elements are very well done. Even on low settings the scenery and terrain are well rendered.There are seriously challenging ""end game"" targets.Cons No punishment or protection from grifeing. Most servers are unplayable for newbies within a day or two as all spawns are walled in and locked.No intelligent respawn. You can easily respawn in a base and be unable to even kill yourself to move out or die before you finish spawning in.Virtually all gameplay resolves to ""find dinosaur. tame dinosaur"" as you advance.Minimal weapon and armor choices. There really isn't specialization in skill advancement. All characters are the same.Servers are massively overburdened by controlling the hostile fauna. You'll get 15 second lag consistently and virtually all fights will involve animals warping around as you wonder where to swing at. Action resolution will take a very long time and you'll often find yourself warped back in time 30 seconds.A poor engine that doesn't gracefully resolve client/server position/action disputes an issue that's been solved since 1995.Comparisons Conan is a reskinned version of this with much better skill and item diversity but virtually no middle/end game hostile diversity.7 Days to Die is a much more varied survival horror crafting game with bases having more depth and modern weapons.

I payed a whopping 66$ for this game only to find it riddled with bugs and just general things that NEED to be fixed. &amp then I realize this is the full release and not even the alpha.. and I don't know how the dev's aren't completely embarassed of what has turned out. They took a great idea and butchered the execution in every way possible and now it seems as though they don't even give a about the game or the people who have overpayed for it. Almost EVER SINGLE SERVER has been capped for dinosaur tames since the servers can only handle so many. The problem with this is super groups just hop on servers and take up ALL the tame slots so any new player coming on the server CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME FOR ONE OF IT'S MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES. HOW ON EARTH ARE THE DEVS ALLOWING THIS. This is rubbish as far as I'm concerned and these devs are the exact type of devs that people do not want in the future. I would give this 100 thumbs down if I could. Give me my money back you greedy s.just wanted to update what an absaolute piece of this game is.

2017-09-16,1,4,90,False,Not Recommended,What is Ark Survival Evolved?Ark is a survival game set on an island inhabited by dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. And dodos.To survive on this Island you have to eat drink and build a shelter to withstand the cold of the night. Of course you also need weapons to defend yourself from the creatures of the Island and maybe even from other players.With nearly everything you do you get experience and levelups. With each level up you get a certain amount of skill points and engram points. With skill point you are able to increase your stats. With the engram points you are able to unlock newengrams (blueprints) to craft new items or objects. Another rather important thing is the possibility to tame the creatures. Therefore you need to get them unconscious and then feed them until the taming bar is filled. Depending on the type of food the bar feels faster but nevertheless it takes very long until it is completely filled. To ride the animal you also need a suitable saddle.The problemsEven though the may be fun to play there are way to many things that lower or even destroy the fun you could have with the game.The first thing are many bugs that occure and since the game is now released from Early Access im most certain those things wont be fixed.The next thing and probably the most important one is the performance. Since the beginning of the game in its Early Access phase the game suffered from a very poor performance. The developers promised ever since to improve it. Not only that they also promised to release a patch to support DirecX 12 which also should improve the performance. But till the present day the performance is still terrible and it seems like the plans for the DirecX 12 patch are comletely gone.The last thing I want to point out are the developers. Even though they knew of those problems they just made promises. They released a few patches which increased the performance. But not enough. They made patches which fixed some bugs. But not enough. They decided that it was more important to release content like new creatures or new objects to craft. And then they decided that it was more impoertant to use the money they got for finishing their game to make an expansion. An expansion which is not more than a new map with little changes to the gameplay.The conclusionArk Survival Evolved was a promising game at the beginning of its Early Access Phase. But as it went on the developers carried on to destroy it. And with the release of the expansion it was clear that the developers gave up on the game and just wanted to make money with it. And then they even decided to release it in its current state. I can't recommend this game and I honestly can't understand people who recommend it.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2017-06-27,0,0,45,True,Not Recommended,I'll start by saying that when Ark is fun it's fantastic.But there is so many problems with the game. 1. The official servers are impossible to play on.2. Private servers with friends are fun but there's so much grinding.3. Private servers on your own are boring because it's just grinding. 4. This might just be my PC but even at minimum graphics on a private solo server I get so much lag that last time I played it killed me. Right as I was getting on an icthy to run from a plesiosaur it dropped to 2 fps and I died after grinding for 5 hours to get scuba gear an icthy and a plesiosaur saddle and more that I had with me because it was all part of taming the plesiosaur. 5.

2017-05-29,0,0,465,True,Not Recommended,"Graphics are great although very resource hungry. Building and exploring is fun but that's where it ends.This game demands the majority of your free time. You're not going to get anywhere with casual play. Being vulnerable when you're logged off is immersive but not realistic. Having to worry about losing your life and possessions while not playing it is unreasonable although an interesting tactic to force people to log on as much as possible. While I appreciate the challenging nature of Ark the comittment required is unrealistic for people who actually have a life outside gaming. Plan on spending many hours harvesting crafting and taming only to have everything you worked for taken away from you in an instant by a random dino or malicious player. Speaking of malicious players Ark is a classic social experiment to see what happens when people are without laws and morals. It runs parallel to the book ""Lord of the Flies"" or the TV Show ""Walking Dead"" where the worst side of people emerges when survival is at stake. You will likely be a victim of simulated harassment bullying terrorism and even slavery from other players. Sound fun?The concept of this game is an intriguing one.

2018-02-02,0,0,1091,False,Not Recommended,ARK my summed up thoughts that hopefully will influence your decision to buy.. or not buy ARK and it's DLCARK is a progressive game with gathering and surviving as well as taming creatures to help your ventures.The upsides and downsides to ARK with minor comparisons to other games if you can understand where I come from in some personal views and how it ties into this reivew.I'm not going to sugar coat it at all the worst part about ARK is how poorly optimized it is to crashes on a regular basis and poor framerates despite having having a beastly computer set upand for people who don't have a fairly good computer my heart goes out to you my tribemates typically ran with less than 30 frames and their crashes were more common than mine along with these problems finding the motivation to play ARK after you enter/leave a cave and your game crashes and your game crashes every time this is such a simple optimization fix the game tries to unload and load everything around you they could have changed it to load slower I have a beastly computer and loading in and out of caves is awful I got at least 4 5 second game freezes when loading in and out of caves ontop of the caves having your tamed creatures glitch out of the map or in your base foundation is by far the worst you either have to destroy most of your base to get your tamed creature out or let it die and if your tamed creature glitches under the map it's as good as gone.The above issue of your creature glitching out of the map can be fixed by contacting an admin and having them teleport it out but... this is only a viable option if you play on a non official server otherwise you're SOLThe second biggest issue which is as big as the first one in my opinion if you play on a official server you can transfer your character and tamed creatures and items from server to server which is required to obtain DLC specific items and tamed creatures however this opens up a ton of community problems anyone with a high level character/creature can join a server (usually a group of people) and destroy everything in a server within a few hours and believe me this may destroy your motivation to play i've had my large base with a lot of creatures destroyed within a few hours.The last problem if you haven't gotten frusturated with poor frames or optimization issues or your creatures glitching out of the map what makes losing your creatures and bases worse is how long it takes to get them/build up a high level creature can take sometimes up to 5 hours to tame this is a game for Youtubers who can record and make cut content of the game that may seem appealing when it may not be or you're a no life in a basement somewhere this isn't a game where you can pickup and put down as you want it the only acception would have to be is if a large number of people were extremely cooperative with eachother and took turns on a schedule and even then this may detract from the enjoyment of the game as raids may make you worry or give you anxiety even when not on.1 Poor optimization2 Transfer greifing3 This game will suck a lot of your timeif this game had it's serious optimization issues/bugs fixed instead of them adding more content I would recommend getting this if you are more of a social person not everyone is cancer (small amount but noteworthy) quite a bit of social people play on ARK and may give a somewhat more enjoyable gameplay experience,ARK: Survival Evolved

The game is fun taming dinos and riding them is fun and enjoyable but be aware of the following The game has been in development for years and is still not optimized. It will probably never will. Grinding. Expect hours of cutting bushes and smashing rocks for materials you need for building. Seriously its ridiculous. I rly hope they change this.

THIS NO EXAGGERATION! Long Promised improvements still not available On Windows (see Specs below) nearly everything is two times on your HDD/SSD. One folder can be removed until the next patch arrives. This folder takes about 20 GB of Space but only makes your game load faster on HDDs by about 5% and on SSDs nothing changes at all (excluding that I could have 2 more games on my SSD). On Linux (see Specs below) game runs smoother than on windows and even looks better Net Code is HORRIBLE. Dedicated Server on Windows has only a 50 50 chance to start correctly. 10% of RCon commands to Windows Dedicated Server lock up the RCon Connection and you have to reconnect with your RCon client. Many Hitboxes are incorrect. Many desyncs on servers. Despite the MANY settings on Custom Servers some essential settings are missing! The server uses randomly the specified Port +1 or +2 never both and unpredicatable. The server takes AGES to start for no reason. Optimizing bringing about 10% better performance? Hah your FPS have been halved. Sometimes you die for no reason. Sometimes you replace a part of the building and half of the building collapses Some things are too easy to craft while other are far to expensive WTF! A level system?! WTF²! Engram System?!?!?!?! Either I find a blueprint or I learn some things using the engram points. Some things have requirements that make no sense. Taming System ... hit a dino until it's unconcious than feed it and keep it unconcious. When you're done the Dino will wake up instantly and is fully tamed. Dino level system ... WHY THE is mostly food and oxygen skilled instead of essential things that make the dinos survive like stamina speed health or attack damage. I mean most dinos can survive ingame centuries without eating... WTF?! Resource farming ... you pickup a small stone about as big as your mouse +1 Stone. You hit a rock bigger than a car about 5 times and get about 20 stones and the rocks literally EXPLODES! Ugly textures if I haven't mentioned these. Serveradmins abusing their power and make overpowered characters that are portable to other servers ... not even the slightest ""were cheats used with this char"" check Again Serveradmins abusing their powers Spawn level 500 dinos ""DoTame"" these &gt lvl 750 dino.

Water Jar Blueprints and Compass Blueprints... about 95% of the things you get in a Supply Drop are Water Jar and Compass Blueprints ... WHO NEEDS THESE ... Those Blueprints can't even have better stats! Aiming with weapons is horrible. Weapons shoot excatly straight have linear recoil and only arrows have slight decrease in height when shot. BattleEye!

2015-06-24,0,0,1442,True,Recommended,"I don't do reviews ever until this one sooooo we'll see how it goes. I love the concept of what Ark is supposed to be I've dropped a lot of hours in the game for the short time it's been out and would do it again. This is where the but part comes in. I'm not going to completely pick this game apart because it's E.A. and I get that but it's going to be kinda close. There are a few things I want to see in this game before I go back to playing it.The Short verison welcome to Grinding Similator 2015 and Dino Prom date! ""she'll leave you when you go to the bathroom and never come back"" 2010/10 would play Destiny again because the grinding doesn't feel like you're getting dumped by the love of your life every time you play. Still love this game and will play again but right now we've agreed to take a break.The ranting truth long version.1) I want a Tribe alliance system like June 1st 2015. This way Tribe Chieftains meet accecept the pact and you have a better way of knowning who your are allies rather then ""Yeah sure we're friendly where is are you basesasuars?""2) The Griefing is a bit much. I've played 7 Days To Die and the PVP is real in that game. I've spawned in this and 7DTD and had to start over again. Now to be honest I'd rather start over on 7 Day's because I don't have to spend at least 6 hours just chopping wood to make a hut to live in. I wouldn't mind the grief so much if I didn't need to spend so much time rebuilding and getting back up and running. The other thing is this the defending of the base when you're offline is completely terrible. I have to hope my Dinos aren't aggro'd away from base a left in the wilds someone didn't stand on the back of a trike and shoot over the walls and killed them and finally the dinos decided to go on a camping trip and left base. Honestly building a base in this game right now is pointless either your dinos can't defend themselves and die or someone gets smart leads your 4 Rex's and everything else away from base and it's happy raiding. Right now I still haven't thought of a way to fix the issue without buffing the walls HP and resistances.3) Building is fun I like making forts and and learning from mistakes when my base is obliterated more then likely my fault I didn't think of something and that's why I'm spending 6 hours rebuilding a hut. The amount of materials needed to build a decent base in the world is insanely high compared to what you get out of it in return and takes about 10 minutes to go through if it's a wood base and you have a half decent trike. Now let me clear that up that's 10 minutes to completely level someones base. The snap system of building is Meh at best for example building on the side of a hill I put down the foundations just fine knew that have to switch to support beams and did. Now I have the base done and started putting up metal. Watch one side of wall completely fall off just cause and then could rebuild because the hole of open space was obstructed. So either tweak the building system or scrap it and start fresh because I spend more time building and when I'm not doing that I'm sitting down tamming a dino for 2 hours just to have it die in 2 minutes because I turned my back and a dilo spawned next to it and attacked taking the trike out in the wild to die by Shenainigains. The amount of resources needed to make walls and such should be reduced and I find grinding of Kertine/Chitin in game to be disturbing.4) Dinos are awesome when they are alive and so much fun the downside is they suffer from a mental handicap which makes tamming them practically useless to have around because once your base is rebuilt you're back to tamming your dinos which takes any where from 5 minutes for a Dodo to 5 hours of my real life to tame a T rex. Which honestly sitting there watching something raise it's head to eat for that long is stupid boring. I mean I could be rebuilding my base. The worst part of this is the fact you can aggro a horde of dinos away from base and they won't return to the last place they were told to not follow at. I've lost a lot of dinos that way for no reason. Simply add in to the commands to stay or return location with a 50ft radius of pursuit when attacked so they don't chase to the ends of the world.So now the good part. I like how the game looks the survival aspect is pretty much on point I like the current dino's so far though a huge beaver and bigfoot seem kind of lame additions. The crafting system is easy to get a hang of and the leveling is nice. Game is a lot of fun with friends and makes getting started only take 3 full days of your real life rather then almost a full week.",ARK: Survival Evolved

In short I like what I have played a fun survival game that has a lot going for it. After I had put more time into the game I fully planned to write a recommending review. However after the recent DLC announcement I can certainly not recommend the game. Removing Survival of the Fittest from free to play to a purchasable title is one thing but releasing DLC for a game that has not yet exited Early Access is laughable. The developers response was even worse citing that they had always planned to do this. If you want to test DLC and your game is in Early Access fine but it should be free.

Insanely immersion breaking.*Spawns are nonsensical. There are essentially spawn dots sprinkled throughout the game and a number or random dinos are drawn from a weighted list. That's it. There are no wandering herds. Predators don't travel the world hunting. Dinos don't travel looking or congregate at water or food sources. Zero immersion. Just spawn bubbles with random dino assignment.*Level requirements for everything. 90% of your time playing this game will be trying to think of a way to level up just so you can do what you actually felt like doing. Want to build a wooden base? Too bad you're not allowed to build a wooden floor despite having an entire forests worth of wood collected. Want to build a stone base. Too bad you have to know how to build a wood one first.... apparently being a stone mason requires extensive knowledge of woodworking. Totally makes sense. Why?

That is until the latest update... in the latest update tamed dinos were pretty much made useless taking away all those hours that I spent to get dinosaurs that I could have fun just relaxing and riding around.

2017-11-18,3,14,1042,False,Not Recommended,ARK Is a great game. I like everyhting from the PVP aspect to the grinding and taming. But wiht the upcoming turret update i am NOT happy with. Because of this update my tribes huge base has to suffer where instead of having a couple thousand turrets and plant X we can only have 100 150. THIS WILL RUIN ARK AND MAKE IT UN BALANCED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYED FOR 2 WEEKS COULD RAID MEGA TRIBES THAT PLAYED FOR YEARS. THIS IS OUTRAGES!!!!!!!!!,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-06-03,1,11,127,True,Recommended,I have played for almost 10 hours upon release date. The game has problems yes the optomization is sorta bad it favors the higher end cards with higher settings giving more fps but lower settings less? Confused on that. The game closes and restarts as there is an update and the few hours I spent on a server is gone and I have to find another another downside. Servers go and new ones show up. Overall besides all the t the game is fun. Not what I expected exactly but it's more playable and enjoyable than rust or any other survival games. I would hold on to purchasing this and wait a week or two to see the changes. Game is fun guys and the people who don't like it are the ones who have no patience.,ARK: Survival Evolved

2016-09-15,0,0,682,True,Not Recommended,LETS PUT ASIDE EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARDI understand needing to wait until all the content is in the game before optimizing because new content can clash with the optimizations. (this fact seems to be lost on most of the community)I understand the devs need for funding after suffering the massive lawsuit. (another thing people dont seem to realize)I understand why the game is in early access it still has a lot of work and the devs want a live community to give feedback as it grows.However even with this all considered.. The truth is ARK has a lot of work and so far the way the development team has responded to the issues arising with the game and the wishes of the community has left a lot of the community unsatisfied. I reccomend waiting this game out see if the devs can better evaluate the situation and realize the right direction to take the game from here.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-07-16,0,0,123,True,Not Recommended,UPDATE The game is still very buggy the lag is still present but at times worse as the server cant even keep 10 people on one server from having severe lag constantly then you have these idiots that go around and put pillars everywhere so that no one can find a spot to build the devs need to address this issue quickly the dinos arent running through my house anymore yet you start as a lvl 1 and will have lvl 116 birds come from the sky and attack up non stop at the early stages this being said the devs still have yet to address real issues they feel its more important to keep pushing out new content while they are turning a blind eye to the acts people are using to grief others to the point they cant even play the game also when they do updates that dont require client restarts if your on your flying mount you are automatically dismounted in air to fall to your death then you cant find your mounts anymore also in my case my first week back to try the game yet again i had to relocate my base 3 times because the devs kept changing the boundary lines for the updates they put out so in a short if you like the devs ing you up or like being griefed by other players in PVE not just PVP then this game is the bucket of youve been waiting for.Still would not recommend this to anyone at the current point In the games current state I would suggest that you hold off on your purchase of said product. The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.Other game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with. Im tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.If you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.this game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2015-06-17,6,78,17,True,Not Recommended,In its current state my first hour was met with poor FPS on the lowest of settings Dinosaurs that glitched around when trying to fight them and then if I could manage to kill them the corpses had a habit of just soaring off into the sky.You start out naked without any clue of what to do I punched a dodo and lost health with every hit I punched it for meat losing health on every hit I punched a tree for wood to make an axe lost health doing so. Using your bare hands causes you to lose life while harvesting or fighting which is insanely stupid. I could understand after a few hits if you lost a little life for your hands being all bloody but still.At one point while chasing a floating corpse I fell into the rock texture and got stuck for a minute. After some jumping and trying to escape being stuck inside the rock texture I freed myself only to find my vigorous excercise left me starving and rapidly losing health because of it.The food bar depleats way way too quickly. I get its supposed to be survival and that running and such makes you hungrier than normal but not even one day/night cycle left me out of food multiple times.TL DR Looks great on epic settings optimization lacking.Buggy very buggy.,ARK: Survival Evolved
2019-01-24,3,210,58,False,Recommended,Dear Devs thanks for taking your time and making the right call to fine tune the game. I think a lot of developers can learn from your example. A really excellent sequel and you have proven that some companies can consistently produce excellent 40k games.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2
2019-01-24,1,159,9,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Engaging and accessibleBattlefleet Gothic Armada 2 is an RTS set in the Warhammer universe developed Tindalos Interactive a follow up to their 2016 game. While I have played several Warhammer games I m not very familiar with the lore or the stories so if you re curious about how it holds up in universe this isn t the right review to read. That being said I was impressed by how easy it was to get into the game but also how easy it was to get into the story. Positives The graphics are great but what s really impressive is the level of detail here. I ve been playing on medium settings and I was quite surprised to see the level of detail there is for the different ships. It s better than a lot of other RTS games I ve played. The battles look cool too they're fun to watch which is obviously quite important.One of my favorite parts of the game is you can pretty much choose for yourself how much you want to micromanage. If you want to you can just tell your ships where to move or what to attack and sit back and watch them occasionally clicking to activate an ability or something. But if you re a big RTS player and you like having a lot of control you can micromanage quite a few different things for each ship in your fleet. You can set the engagement range of your ship you can set which part of a ship you want your ship to target (targeting weapons lowers their firepower targeting engines lowers their manoeuvrability etc.) you can change the priority of a target which side you want to attack from and a couple of other things too. I ve pretty much stuck to just choosing which part of a ship to target and leave it at that but I like that there s so many options.The single player campaigns are quite engaging. At the time of writing this I haven t been able to play the Tyranid campaign (it wasn t available in the beta build) but the Necron and Imperium of Man campaigns are equally well made and engaging. The voice acting and writing is good and I like how the campaign maps work. I personally prefer the Necron campaign but that s just because their story interests me a little more and I prefer how their ships work.The campaign map is basically where you see what your goals are where your fleets and enemy fleets are and it s how you move your fleets to attack targets to take over systems. Your fleets have a set number of movement points that allow you to jump to systems connected to the one your fleet is currently in. My only complaint with the campaign map is that there are a few things that would really benefit from having tooltips that show up when you hover over them. For example systems have points of interest that can be upgraded. The problem is I can t tell you what the upgrades do because I don t know the game hasn t told me.Having three separate campaigns with three very different campaigns adds some great variety to the game. I was feeling frustrated with how I was doing in the Imperium campaign so I started the Necron campaign and was right back to enjoying it.In the campaign you earn renown for every battle you finish. This renown can be spent on adding new fleets unlocking new ship tonnages or on technologies that upgrade your stuff. I will say renown does seem to be earned quite slowly especially early on but I like this way of getting upgrades.I haven t played multiplayer but the balance in singleplayer seems pretty good. From what I ve played so far I haven t found anything that feels particularly over or underpowered even the small support ships are quite helpful. I also think the pace of the game is quite good especially as you can pause half speed double speed or triple speed. Also it s worth mentioning that you can issue orders while the game is paused (in singleplayer) I wasn t expecting to be able to it s nice to see.While the three campaigns are restricted to a specific faction there are nine more playable factions in the skirmish mode.There is an auto battle option if there s a fight you really don t want to do. Seeing as this is an RTS game I m not sure how many people are going to want to skip the whole fighting thing but it s nice to have it available anyway.Negatives The maps are a bit sparse. I mean I get that it s space but you re basically just in a chunk of skybox with a planet way off in the background. There are some things on the maps such as gas clouds and debris fields (you can hide your ships in these which is nice) but I just felt like the maps were missing something. I guess my issue is there s not much that differentiates the maps but maybe I m expecting too much from a game set in space.As I mentioned earlier there really need to be tooltips/more explanation for things. I m a few hours in at this point and there are still UI elements or parts of the campaign that I just don t understand. There s no ship customization here as far as I can tell. You do have quite a few options when building new ships (as long as you have a good enough shipyard) but you can t change what weapons a certain ship has. I wasn t too bothered by this personally but I feel others might take issue with it.There's really not much in the way of mission variety in the campaigns. So far every mission I've seen is either 'destroy the enemy fleet' or 'destroy the enemy fleet or reach the strategic point goal'. It needs some more mission types. Verdict While I have had a couple of issues with this game I m quite impressed by it overall and I ve been enjoying it more than I expected to. This is a great space/Warhammer RTS that has surprisingly good single player content. I think the price is pretty fair based on the content and polish here if you re a fan of RTS games or more generally space or Warhammer games I recon this is worth picking up.

2019-02-03,5,72,40,False,Not Recommended,"I wish Steam has a ""meh"" opinion instead of just yes or no.Pros 1. Beautiful looking game. This has to be one if not the most beautiful 40K game out there. The devs put a lot of effort into making this game look like a movie. It is absolutely gorgeous.2. Wonderful storytelling. In fact this is the first and only 40K game set in the 8th Edition setting. Comes with 3 campaigns each with their own gameplay style and features. You get to meet important characters from the setting like Bobby G and and his aeldari whatever she is and some returning characters from Battlefleet Gothic Armada. 3. Good inheritance of the naval gameplay from Battlefleet Gothic Armada now with even more ships and factions! 12 different factions to play with (even though there are only 3 campaigns the devs said they are working on the fourth one). Now for the Cons 1. Campaign fleet management is based off of multiplayer balancing. It just doesn't make sense. In Battlefleet Gothic Armada you can customize each and every one of your ships giving it different skills and upgrades. Currently upgrades are based off of an upgrade tree and skills comes with the captain thus making the skills only available to the flagship and no longer customizable. I can understand putting upgrades in an upgrade tree I'd even say it is an improvement but I think the skills should be available2. QoL features needed Upgradable planets tracking invasion tracking and such features should be implemented. When you have 6 7 sectors in your hand and each of them has 2 3 invasions incoming it is very hard to keep track of everything.3. Bugs There are quite a few bugs in the game. Not quite gamebreaking but can be extremely annoying to find out for example the Archeo Gellar Field in Obsidian Depths doesn't stop invasions on Nemesis Tessera even if evolved to level 3 or playing a mission and suddenly finding missingstring texts or French out of the blue. These should be fixed ASAP.I would probably give it a 6/10 at its current stage add your own bonus points depending on how much you like 40K. Once some of the more glaring issues are fixed this will definitely go up.",Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2
2019-01-26,6,202,88,False,Not Recommended,I'd like to be clear that this is a mixed review and I wish Steam had a mixed response button. The tactical ship to ship action is great and in a lot of ways better than the last game ships are tougher loadouts like torpedoes are effective but limited in uses and lighter ships like escorts are actually useful. I do wish they'd inlcuded more mission types but overall it's a big thumbs up.The strategic map is disappointing and it's disappointing mainly because it appears to have so much potential. The first game was a series of missions with filler coming from attacks on your territory this second game gives you a whole map to move around in ship yards to occupy defences to build and somehow feels exactly the same. To give some examples Occupation is always a simple matter of moving your fleets into the system and killing whatever is there. The AI can't do this and announces its rare intentions to attack your territory a turn beforehand so all your fleets can intercept them. Defences can be instantly built delaying the AI attack and making building any defences before an attack is coming pointless. The AI can't delay your attacks with defences but can limit your fleet size to two instead of three fleets seeing as there's a limit on how much you can deploy at once that makes virtually no difference. There's no way to delete an unwanted fleet and it will still cost upkeep. Because of fleet limits it's impossible for Necron fleets to recruit cruisers when they initially get access to cruisers.All this makes it feel like you're playing Windows Chess on beginner mode. What could be a meaty important part of the game is reduced to a series of admittedly fun tactical battles but they aren't enough to make the game feel solid on its own.The game is beautiful and sounds great the tearing metal of hull against hull and the flash of void shields being hit with macro weapons are enjoyable on their own.I hope this review is helpful. I'm certainly still going to play the game now and then and I'd hope some of these issues are solved in patches and expansions.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2

This is the new version which has microtransactions and less mod support at this time but also has an upgraded engine that can give more stable gameplay with some setups. I personally prefer the original game and see no real advantage to upgrading even though I was given a copy of special edition free when it launched. If you own neither of them you should do your own research to see if you really need or want to put up with the creation club and it's associated inconveniences to the actual modding community that has sustained this game for the last 4 years prior to making any purchase decision.

PROS The game is now in 64 bit which MAY improve performance and stability (NOTE no this doesn't mean that your crappy HP Compaq with 2 GB of RAM will run the game in Ultra settings) As advertised the graphics have been remastered featuring updated textures and new cinematic lighting effects such as ""God Rays"".CONS Significantly less mods available on the Nexus though popular mods are slowly moving into the Special Edition Nexus a lot of mods have been left behind in the old repository. Creation Club. As of December 2017 the price tag slapped on the game is ridiculous. Not worth it if you didn't receive this game for free. CREATION. CLUB. Besides the remastered graphics and 64 bit engine Bethesda DID NOT fix any bugs from the old Skyrim.CONCLUSION If you haven't received this game for free don't buy it you'd just be tossing your money away. This is just Bethesda trying to tempt you and when you fall for it you get a nice kick in the nutsack. Performance wise it really varies depending on your system but here's my conclusion if you own an older rig stick with the old Skyrim the 64 bit system will not help you. Otherwise get Skyrim SE you should notice an increase in performance and stability compared to the old Skyrim if you own a newer rig.Personally I'd stick with the old Skyrim ESPECIALLY if you don't really own a good gaming rig or want to extensively mod your game.

I barely noticed at all any difference between vanilla skyrim original and vanilla Skyrim ""special edition"" For starters they could've made much better civilian / player models so they didn't look like poorly crafted dolls with cheap painted faces and hair like in the original many years before this new updated one. That would instantly bring this ""special edition"" to date and have it be special. If you're gonna update a game to the up to date times make it look it. Honestly all I saw was they've made a few textures bigger. Big wow. My modded skyrim with ultra high textures and new better looking body shapes and lighting actually do what this company SHOULD have done. Make Skyrim LOOK special and FEEL special.

Fallout 4 save system Basicly we can make different characters and it automaticly switches saves makes it easy to make different characters without needing to worry about saves.

Cons Mods disable achievements Yeah Bethesda did it again. You can get a mod on the nexus to re enable them with mods but its worth mentioning. Not as many mods as skyrim This is the main downside to SE. For PC skyrim has far more mods than SE (but mod authors are working on making SE versions of their mods. Frostfall ordinator unofficial patches and others are already here and more are coming. People are having problems with the game. There are people that experience slow fps long loading screens frequent crashes and other issues. I have not had those issues but it is worth mentioning. So should you buy SE or regular? Do you have original skyrim for PC? Maybe not.Do you not have original skyrim or you're on console and you want the mods that SE will give you? YES go buy it. It is a great game especially with mods and mod authors are converting more and more mods from the old to the new.

So he bought me an XBox and game of my own. LOL When he moved over to PC for games so did I. I played Oblivion also. Loved it. Then when Skyrim came out on Steam he was sweet enough to purchase that for me too. The game is awesome in my opinion and I love the way the Special Edition looks. The graphics I believe. Looking forward to the next edition of Elder Scrolls.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
2016-12-20,12,439,475,False,Recommended,"Game was and still is so cool but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.I usually play the standard mode sometimes due to my laziness but this game has quite a few excellent mods especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable even when you role play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.Mods i use Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition this fixes most of the bugs of the game Campfire Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents Vivid weathers Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness shadows etc. Frostfall Depending on how difficult you want it you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster Wet and Cold Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing. Point the way Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling this is why i got this mod which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad. Lampposts of Skrim Lamp posts on the main roads but just what is necessary not plenty of them. Waves Now beaches with waves D Better horses Now horses go faster than you by foot something that makes kind of sense. Less agressive animals Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers. Hunter's Reward Better prices Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter. iNeed To eat to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable. Holidays Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff Expanded Carriage Service Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before like Morthal or Dawnstar. Rich merchants of Skyrim Merchants have more money to buy meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH) Run for your lives When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon. When vampires attack Same with vampires The Paarthurnax Dilemma Lets you spare his life. Hold border banners Banners from different holds are placed on their borders pretty simple but cool enough for me. Immersive patrols SE Since there's a civil war going on it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available like the dawnguard. Practice Dummies You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"". Mammoth Pelts You can skin mammoths something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game. Dog followers are Huskies Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north. Whistle Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle. NPC's Run and Walk at your pace exactly what the mod says. Animal poverty Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something... Immersive armors adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors) MamTuskPowderGrind You can grind mammoth tusk to make its powder an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks. Fantasy Soundtrack Project Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one. Enhaced blood textures MORE BLOOD! Skyland Landscape texture overhaul Static Mesh Improvement Mod Better textures for interiors. Skyrim better roads More and better textures for main roads. Verdant Better textures for grass. Blacksmith forge water fix se Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it. Realistic water two Improves A LOT water textures and effects. Open cities Skyrim No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod) Immersive Citizens their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)BTW i got them in this order and all of them work properlySome of the mods are only available on nexusmods which leads me to my final advise Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? There are two options wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list but it will be there so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).EDIT I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE and i found it on nexusmods. Short description you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city setting primary spells weapons THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff.

2018-07-27,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Product received for free. okay. first of all allow me to get this out of the way. i hate what bethesda did with the creation club. they essentially made modding (somthing that was universally FREE through all of normal skyrim for the most part) into a way to make money after already having to pay 40 bucks for the base game (granted you recieved it for free if you had the original and all the DLC) just to have to go and buy credits that you and only buy in set amounts with the higest being the same price as the game itself. i feel like this was bethesda just being greedy with a fan favorite that everyone knew and loved. and while yes you can still go to nexus and mod bypassing bethesdas greed it still feels like a kick to the gut for those of us that played the game since it first came out on pc and console. now for the upsides. the game is beautiful. its a surefire upgrade from the original skyrim and is an amazing game to play. and while some will enjoy the original more (i do for the simple fact my pc is and can run the original skyrim better) just going through the beginning was enough for me to be awestruck as if i was playing skyrim all over again for the very first time. the gameplay is simply amazing and sucks you in. and while this brings me to my one personal downside SSE is still a recommended game for anyone.downside is that with the updated graphics and the amazing features this game is hard on any computer that isent up to date in its hardware and software. my computer even the lowest graphics settings could run it but not without the lighting glitching all to hell and textures ing up. maybe its because my install dident finish correctly(?) but i still love this game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2018-02-23,2,17,0,False,Not Recommended,"Its a Bethesda game what did you expect. Looks and plays horribly Terrible engine where you can slide down walls avoiding all fall damage. Or where props and bodies constantly flip out which leads them to get shot straight into the stratosphere you climb the highest mountain by repeatedly pressing space etc. Boring repetitive quests that force you to join guilds or serve daedric lords even if you wish to play as a good guy Big and empty (recycled NPCs empty buildings everybody looks exactly the same extremely unappealing environments) Full of bugs and glitches that haven't been addressed YEARS after launch (with devs calling them ""charming features"") Released the same game 5 times for a quick buck with zero improvementsMods are the only thing keeping this garbage alive. And Bethesda should thank their lucky stars that people didn't give up on this parody of a parody of a game.Skyrim would have been dead on arrival if not for the modders' hard work and dedication. Over the years the modders have fixed the graphics sound engine added real physics HD textures made the world rich and beautiful interesting to live in and pleasant to look at. Improved and polished pretty much every aspect of the game. I have 90GBs of mods that I have to install every time I want to film stuff in game. Hey have you ever heard of Skyrim ? Oh the cockroach meme yeah!People call Skyrim a cockroach because it just won't die. Just when it seems that people are starting to forget about it Beth simply re realease Skyrim a couple more times Original Anthology Edition Legendary Edition Special Edition Switch Edition VR Edition all of them being the same exact game. No bug fixes same glitches same texture flickering and no improvements or any real effort put into it.Bethesda became a meme a laughing stock for any real developers out there who put love and effort into their games. Who actually test their games and play them themselves before releasing. Hell look at some of the games in Early Access on Steam. Those developers fix and patch bugs hours after they've been reported. But a massive tripple a behemoth like Bethesda ? Why bother ? Just re release the same game 5 years later. And of course everyone will buy it because they were foolish enough to think that Beth would have fixed all the bugs and glitches by then. They surely must have fixed Skyrim by now and probably gave it that awesome fantasy look right ?Nope! Skyrim Special Edition is a joke.They spent 5 years on ""improving"" and re releasing the same hot garbage. With their only real improvement being that the game is now ""more stable"". When it should have been stable right from the start like all the normal games are.The modders for the original Skyrim came up with much much better mods and fixes A WEEK after the game was released. A week! And that's people who do this leisurely for fun or out of the kindness of their souls. Original Skyrim with just one mod is ten times better than the unmodded Special Edition edition of the game. Which took them 5 years to ""remaster"".This sentence alone should help you realize what kind of company you're about to give your money to.Absolutely terrible. And Skyrim serves no other purpose than to be modded into a real game.That is the only reason it is still alive.Oh and Bethesda wants people to pay for mods made by other people to improve their game.

If you're on the fence I would wait a while. It amazes me that a team of modders created an ""Unofficial Patch"" that fixed most of Skyrim's problems but Bethesda didn't bother to fix the problems before releasing this ""Special Edition."" To be fair the lighting improvements are nice. Depth of Field and ""god rays""are now options. 64 bit allows for better framerates. Unfortunately we still have to dig around in the config files to adjust the field of view (FOV). One of Bethesda's unexpected new ""features"" is you can no longer get achievements if you use mods. Why would they do that? This can be bypassed with a mod but every time Skyrim releases a patch you have to wait for the mod to update. Speaking of mods some have been updated to this new version but mods that rely on SKSE's scripting functions will need to wait until it is updated.I do not recommend purchasing the Special Edition of Skyrim right now. If you got it for free great! A 64 bit executable and improved lighting is nice but it doesn't justify a $60 price tag.

2017-09-07,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. UPDATE The Fall 2017 Creator's Update of Windows 10 finally fixed the DX9 vram limiter error! However it should be noted that you may still experience poor performance in Oldrim depending on your Processor. Oldrim was designed and optimized for dual core processors and while there are some ini tweaks to make it somewhat better they don't actually do much. Basically the less powerful the first two cores of your processor are (such as with the i7 4790k which is what I have which sacrificed performance in the first two cores to have four equally functional cores) the more oldrim will chug at times particularly in areas densely packed with NPCs like Whiterun (top of the stairs there kills my framerate.)Skyrim SE does not have this problem as the updated version of the Creation Engine that it runs on is optimized for quad cores and beyond. This is the primary reason SE runs so much better on more recent systems.Still the MAIN reason to switch to SE is now obsolete. If you don't mind framerate drops in certain areas Oldrim just offers substantially more mod content...and you don't even have to get prodded with the creation club to experience it! Only go for SE if you really really prefer the smoother experience over the excess content...I mean to be fair it isn't like Skyrim vanilla isn't already loaded to the bloody brim with content and the amount of mods ported over grows by the day. In the time since I originally wrote this review SKSE64 has gone into a beta state and a lot of the ""essential"" mods for a good skyrim playthrough are slowly but surely becoming available to those who want the SE stability. ORIGINAL REVIEW I'm going to put this review up as a means to inform on a certain value belonging to this version of the game and not the t Creation Club nonsense. I do not support that idiotic service in any way shape or form but if you are one of the two people left in the first world who has not played Skyrim or you are using a newer built PC there's an element to the special edition you may want to consider.I recieved Skyrim Special Edition for free as did any previous owners of the original game + all of the DLC.For those who don't know Windows 8 and Windows 10 have a critical flaw in regards to Direct X9 which prevent them from utilizing more than a total 4gb of VRAM regardless of how much you actually have available for use. Guess what the original Skyrim was built atop?In otherwords unless you're still using Windows 7 odds are attempting to mod your classical Skyrim is going to be significantly more limiting than you may expect. 4GB of VRAM is just not a lot to go with when many of the most prominant visual mods expecially things like texture mods use very high resolution assets and that 4GB will be stretched extreme thin very very fast. Unfortunately the problem with DX9 is hardcoded into the newer varients of Windows itself and despite many the pleas from the community Microsoft seems more than happy to completely ignore it and leave it in place. In otherwords there is no way to remove the limiter and as such no way to get around the fact that some older games like Skyrim or DoW1 which run on DX9 will run objectively worse on NEWER computers than they would on older ones.The only real benefits to SE over the original Skyrim are because of this. SE has been completely converted over into DX11 and as a result the limiters do not apply. On top of that the game just runs flat out better and for what it is worth SE's graphical improvements over Vanilla are very noticable and quite well done. If you're the kind of person who likes visual mods but don't go deep into the side of things like ENBs the vanilla world visuals of SE may be more than enough for your tastes. On top of this SE is also notably more stable than the original which is to be expected.Unfortunately this comes with the caveat that many mods have not been properly ported into SE yet and also many mods flat out will not function with SE until SKSE64 the SKSE version being created for SE is complete.So pick your poison. You can get the original and be forced to severely limit your modding capabilities due to an obnoxious forced Vram limit coutesy of Microsoft or you can get the SE and not have to deal with such problems but have severely limited mod choices until an undisclosed period in the future where SKSE64 becomes available to the public.The point of this post is to inform people that yes there is indeed a logical reason for SE to exist. Unless Microsoft pulls their heads out of thier asses and removes the hard cap on DX9 the more time passes and the further away from 2011 we get the more and more unrealistic it is going to be to play a properly modded vanilla Skyrim.But if you DO choose to go with the CE I would advise two things Vote with your wallet go NOWHERE NEAR the Creation Club and it's disgusting practices. Do not even spend the free 100 points they give you to try it out. Tell Bethesda to sod off with their ""mini DLC totally not paid mods"" nonsense.And The Creation Club currently forces you to download 2GB worth of data essentially all of the mods that are currently available on it. If you do not buy literally every single mod on the platform that 2GB is dead weight on your hard drive and unless Bethesda swallows their pride and axes the service for the failure that it is that number is only going to go up. Fortunately there is a certain mod on a certain prominant modding site which will replace all of the files forcefully downloaded by the Creation Club with negligable alternatives saving you precious space. I'd advise wholeheartedly that you consider picking it up.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-29,0,0,161,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The new Skyrim Special Edition is a pretty clear difference between the original vanilla version of Skyrim. Mostly with how smoothly the game runs.Compared to the older version of Skyrim this now loads ultra fast. Running in 64 bit also gives the game much more stability.My break down for this is Pros Some improved graphics and tweaks to the environment. 64 bit (the BEST reason) Faster loading times and better stability. A future potential for better mods to be released. Free for PC users who had owned the entire set.Cons I personally think the improved graphics isn't really all that great but it's mostly because I have played the game with some nice HD mods and ENB enabled which makes this pale in comparison. To a vanilla player though this is a lot nicer. I just kind of feel like they could have done better... Especially with the character textures. No improved UI. This is perhaps the biggest con. The Mod Load order system within the game is quite clunky and has caused problems for me once.To anyone marking down this game because certain mods aren't released yet Um. You do realize that mods are made independently and not by Bethesda? Have some patience. P The SKSE team has released a statement saying that it will take a long time to release the new SE version. I've already seen some uploaders on the Nexus releasing a dull version of SkyUI so even if the author is MIA I'm sure someone will remake it when SKSE is released.For now there are a lot of mods up on the Nexus that you can use. Try them out if you'd like or wait until SKSE/SkyUI is released and enjoy replaying the vanilla. Cheers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Big Skyrim fan since it came out but nonetheless nothing changed with the Special edition.To counter some of the so called positives in the game Graphics Graphics are better than vanilla but not in the slightest worth the 60 bucks they charge for it. Modders have already created a much more beautiful skyrim than this so called special edition. (Granted I got it for free but I'm talking about the whole picture here.) Optimization/Performance Let me start by giving you my specs gtx 1080 Oc'ed i5 4690k OC'ed 16gb ddr3 ram 144hz monitor (2560x1440). My main problem with the vanilla version is that (understandably) any refresh rate above 60hz wasn't supported (again understandable given at that time there wasn't much above 60hz). Now once I started up the SE it was still buggy like crazy not talking about water flickering buggy but talking about horse going batshit crazy buggy. Patches came out saying they made optimization fixes for the 144hz display which in my opinion didn't change anything. For some kind of reason I can't even play past 60fps anymore (Yes I disabled Vsync yes I changed the right Ini files yes I altered the nvidia cp yes I did everything I could think of and no I'm not new to this) conclusion still runs like crap (not so much like unplayable but more like the same crap the vanilla skyrim played at.) Sounds You all know the whole audio fiasco surrounding Skyrim SE I'm not even going any further into it. Patches/fixes Takes them months to come out with patches when they do come out they'll be vague like we are used to from Bethesda games. and won't really change the more important bugs or problems.Verdict Is it a fun game? Yes it's skyrim for me it was one of the best games there was until recently. Is it worth it's money today ? Not at all It is the same game as the one released in 2011. This is a blatant money grab not spending any time on the game but still raking in the cash. Keep in mind that this is coming from a huge Skyrim fan. I always wished that Bethesda wouldn't turn into what is becoming a trend among developpers but only time could prove that I was wrong If you can buy the vanilla version mod you game to the max and enjoy a truly special experience but don't encourage this kind of behavior from developpers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I have played hundreds of hours from Morrowind to Oblivion to the first Skyrim release. There have been bugs there have been crashes but NOTHING that renders the game completely unplayable. Skyrim SE has finally broken that. This game is nothing short of useless. I can launch the game I can get anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes into it before it crashes and my computer reboots. Nothing I have attempted thus far has had any effect on fixing the game. If I paid money for this I would be furious. Lucky for me I got it free on release because I owned Skyrim Ledgendary Edition. From what I see in the first 15 minutes SE looks and plays no different then th first release. Any improvements could easily be attained or even surpassed by modding the original release.

2016-11-01,1,3,18,False,Recommended,"I hardly ran into any game breaking bugs back in the orignal skyrim with only one main quest bug occurring and another causing me unable to craft Stalhrim equipment. Other than that I faced very few issues and now that Special Edition has een released I am glad to say that I have yet to run into any problems with the new release. Colors look far more crisp with the extra additions being nice welcomes without the need of mods now. Some of these include rain not clipping through building structures to the addition of God Rays and improved textures. Weather effects have also been enchanced for a more visual appealing look as well. There are a couple of additional graphical tweaks that users can change as well such as depth of field. The new engine is now 64 bit and as a result is not subject to memory limitations faced by 32 bit. As a result my loads times are far more quicker with some being almost instantaneous. Since I received my copy for free due to the the upgrade promotion I find this to be a rather generous move by the company and one that broadens my hopes by what future mods can accomplish with the new engine. I never ecpected an updated version of skyrim as it was releeased not too long ago but this new updated released has me reliving the fun I had years ago. I never expected this to be a ""remaster"" in the sense of completely new assets because for the most part it was not needed. It is true that bugs have not been fixed from the previous 32 bit release but I have yet to encounter these throughout my playtime. If you own the older version and have nothing to gain from this updated version then it is not for you but if you do want some slightly updated visuals along with better performance then this is the definitive version to buy. Another possible flaw is that the audio has been compressed now however Bethesda has stated they are working to improve the audio once again on the pc version and mods also exist to put back the orignal uncompressed audio. If you are looking for a reason to go back to Skyrim or never got the chance to experience why Skyrim had one of the biggest modding communities or memes for a period of time then I highly sugest getting this game.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

It prompts you to go into Bethesda.net to log in there Would be fine if you have an account otherwise prepare for the most fustrating experience of your life.My tale began innocently enough recently I just downloaded this since I have the old skyrim. So free game is free and I like free. But after downloading it and setting up my graphic settings. I was curious on to mods. I was sadden when I saw that the steam community didn't have mods for the Special Edition. And Then things went downhill after that. I saw they had Bethesda.net and wanted you to log into there. So naturally I go to the site and try to create an account since I don't have one. Well it asked for a fairly simple request with usernames. But every username that is fairly unique to me was some how ""unavailable"" aka taken. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to come up with any username before i just gave up on that notion. I seriously would say that if you are going to get this game for the modding community don't bother. Go with the old skyrim that one is much easier to deal with and you can find mods on nexus or workshop there that is much easier to get to.

I can't really complain since I got the Special Edition for free due to owning all the DLC for the original game but if I payed money for this hoping to get a modern looking game I would be very disappointed. They updated the ugly vanilla game from something muddy and low res to something slightly less muddy with a bit higher pixel count in their textures. Definitely still looks like a game that came out years ago. Beyond that I only just got to the character creation screen before I ran into a glitching guard that kept disappearing and reappearing every time he tried to walk through his horse while he was talking to me. So those bugs still exist too. Shadows are still overly dark and ruddy colors are still muted and nearly mono chrome.

The game is bugged while running on a laptop with both an integrated low performance card and actual high performance video card are present. The game simply doesnt recognize the latter and keeps running on the lowest possible settings. Settings the performance card as default and forcing the game to run on it as opposed to the low performance does not change anything. Only possibilitty for me is to run it from a different PC that does not have 2x GPU's for the game to choose from.I will update the review once a fix is released as for now the game is not playable with my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-11-09,0,0,392,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. As someone who is an achievement hunter and to some extent wasting time on an open world Bethesda game despite my personal problems with it I still don't recommend to just about anyone from buying this game in the future.Because you'd be better off buying the legendary edition than the special edition (referred to as ""SE"" for my following review).Sure the SE's graphics are noted to be slightly better than vanilla Skyrim but only slightly.What's more is that the lightning effects are pretty much the only thing notable to be improved while say the graphics of NPCs indoor items they are all still the same with the only difference being done because of the lightning.This is not how you do remastered art.This is how you just plainly release the same product again with the same janky NPC animations that pretty much most if not all of them share the same voice actors only in a slightly more pretty looking sky.Gameplay wise it's the same open world rpg game though I admit that after playing the Witcher 3 it really feels awkward to return to a game like Skyrim and feeling less like I roleplay anything specific and more of the usual time when I just do whatever I want no reprecussions and just get all the loot and fortune.But the real problem with the SE the reason why I am not recommending this is because the game is awefully buggy. Honestly I'm tired of Bethesda getting away with bug ridden games because people think it's funny.Sure it is sometimes but then again some of these bugs do end up crashing the game or just make a quest plain unplayable because you were too curious to explore an area before the proper quest forcing you to figure out how to use whirlwind sprint shout while holding a wooden plate in the air just to clip through the castle's gates. Or in another case when you plain can't stop an NPC's aggro DESPITE HIM BEING ESSENTIAL AND IMMORTAL IN THE QUEST and end up just noclipping in an order to finish said quest!This is pretty much why I hate to see people still praising skyrim for what it does not deserve as this special edition is nothing more than a cash grab at a game that I mostly play now just so I can clear the achievements again and nothing else. And it's sad because I really want to like this game but it's hard.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

We speak not its name. thats what its like.)Colors are overbright or washed out.( HueHueHue)Any glow effects highlight the low res/ outdated textures.( If you draw a on a piece of paper and then go over it with a highlighter same effect)Your mods? not supported. maybe the mod makers will feel like wasting thier time to update thier mods to support this iteration maybe not.Same old bugs some new no fixes.If i were to re release a game for the third time i would have fixed some bugs finished the ing civil war content/story added some small DLC/updated the old DLC and released 2k textures that everyone has been asking for for 3 years.I would have paid 15$ for that.

I couldn't use my mouse buttons for attacking/blocking when I entered Helgen Keep Dragonsreach looks like the flickery mountains in the orginal game I've seen npcs floating in the air when you sneak slowly foward you tail is being tazered Alvor doesn't have the shop dialouge during vendor hours and more.The graphical improvements only somewhat noticable but the sound is noticably worse... at the cost of losing half of my fps my load order and my mostly bug free gameplay.I hope modders will come in and save this game but I cannot recommend it to anyone who has played a modded skyrim playthough before special edition.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Instead you now pay for mods or manage everything manually outside of steam using nexus mods etc. Mod compatibility was broken of course so you rather go for the paid ones.Keeping a game alive and interesting with mod support and an active community is no longer wanted. That may be good to make a name for your company but once you have it you have to milk money. You're not supposed to play a game released 6 years ago unless you start paying again!

The game was unlike anything I had ever played before and even after my Xbox was sold off for some cash I bought it on PC and started from scratch. I spent far far too much time on this game and frankly... this 'update' wasn't needed. The original to be fair has dated a little but not enough to warrant a remake. I honestly would've expected Morrowind or Oblivion to recieve the make over treatment (which they both definitely need because my god they look like trash compared to Skyrim). This Special Edition also doesn't really add anything that mods in the original couldn't of done except the graphics hike isn't optional and if you're playing on a sub par computer like me isn't good. At least with the original I can pick and choose my graphical mods to customise my experience sure it might look a bit worse than the Special Edition... but I can run it.All in all I feel like this was just to milk the popularity of a modern classic from the 12 hours I've played nothing but graphical stuff and a few little immersive things have been added. Again this is all stuff you can get in the original with mods. They should've only released this for console I feel and added more graphical options for PC rather than a new game that can't have it's graphics lowered.However I appreciate Bethesda for quite literally just giving me the Special Edition I feel like that was a great move on their part. But Oblivion/Morrowind should've got this Special Edition not Skyrim. But if your PC can run this then enjoy it's still Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The already beautiful world of Skyrim are getting for me much significant upgrade and improvement. That makes me wonder in awe while riding my horse just fooling around enjoying the scenery. On the down side some of the old bug from original game are still there and Bethesda like always are not quite fast to patching that bug or other problem that annoying in the game.

I have played Skyrim on 4 different computers over the years including with both an AMD 8350 and i5 4790 with the technically superior GPU being a 660 GTX. I always had lag. I currently use a 745 4GB OEM which normally is terrible at rendering textures. I can run Skyrim with mostly Ultra High settings and a stable non laggy FPS at 1080. I'm really looking forward to seeing how the game plays with a better GPU and some modding but it is nice not to be required to mod the game just to reach the quality level it is at currently. For those with a modded Skyrim that they are pleased with it is a better option until (and if) more mods come along but as far as the baseline this 64 bit version is superior all around.

2016-11-12,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Product received for free. First off I'll acknowledge the hate around this game and even state why people aren't too happy with this game It's a repeat of the previous one only with a few things added/changed.What exactly was added? A new and improved 64 bit engine Sun rays Realistic rain (doesn't clip through rooftops) Realistic water movement (doesn't just flow in a generic direction)That's not a lot at all for a new game that (maybe) took them a few years to develop. I completely understand why a lot of people are outraged regarding this new game given it adds almost nothing new. No bugfixes textures are still horrible etc. I'm also at a loss for why Bethesda had so much time to enhance the game yet added mediocre things. I will however say that I enjoy this game way more than the previous one despite these mediocre additions.Why I enjoy SE more than its predecessorFirst off the original Skyrim's 32 bit engine is pettiful. I have a GTX 1080 and the game runs at a choppy 40fps average with no mods installed. It does get 60fps no problem but as soon as I enter Markath I get hit with fps lag. In the original Skyrim you can't spawn a lot of enemies too easily either. It crashes too much. In SE you can spawn 500 bandits no problem. If I do the aforementioned spawning my fps drops to about 15. That's a damn good thing btw. Sure some of the bandits fly into space but I can actually still play after that performance hit.Secondly the lighting rain and water overhaul looks brilliant. Just go look at the screenshots for SE (ignore the flying horse that's normal for a Bethesda game).Thirdly the game has a 64 bit engine. I know I (technically) mentioned this in the first pointer but this is about the modding side. So many people complain/boast that their modded Skyrim looks so much better than SE. Sure it does. It's damn logical it does. This game just came out and has almost no mods in comparison to the old Skyrim. I do understand why they do this though as Bethesda had so much time to work on a proper re texture that would look much better than any modder's re texture. Ever think of performance? Skyrim can be run on almost any system. I do not know of one person who can't run Skyrim on their laptop or even mac. Now imagine Bethesda re textured Skyrim with super high res textures. They'll lose maybe 12% of their audience. Wait a few months and the texture mods for SE will outperform any texture mods for Skyrim no problem (hense the 64 bit engine).Would I recommend this gameWell... Yes and No. Here's why Do you own Skyrim LE and have received this game for free? Click install already. It's a damn good improvement. Do you own Skyrim but do not own all the DLCs? 1) If you've recently played Skyrim and are unsure about SE don't get it. Simple as that. Wait a year or so and if you're still interested get it. 2) You haven't played Skyrim in quite some time and are unsure about SE get it if you can. It boasts way better performance than Skyrim (I get 60fps average everywhere I go no matter what I do). You do not own Skyrim at all and are unsure about which one to get Wait for SE to become more stable and get more mods then pick it up if you can.Final note I want to add People who are against SE merely for the mods in Skyrim being better... Stop it. Just... Stahp plz. Given SE's 64 bit engine I'm quite sure Skyrim's modding community might slowly deteriorate until there are no more mods at all. SE will be able to run so much more mods at a time and still have amazing performance. People will want to rather mod SE than Skyrim. Sure you'll still have support. But right now all eyes are on the SE side of modding.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-30,1,4,94,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My opinion of this game is a little wierd and I might get some hate for it but hear me out.Five years ago I bought this game for the 360 still new to the gaming world and at the time didn't even know Steam existed this was however not the first RPG I had played as in I had played Morrowind quite a bit as a kid. I stayed up for hours and hours playing the orginal release talked with my friends about it in my small town of &gt 5000 everyone I went to school with had atleast played the game. I played it for a good two years straight it was my go to game. After the first 2 years DLC came and went I got busy and play on and off till I eventually got rid of my 360 and then soon after move over to Steam and good ol PCMR.Within my first year of owning a PC for the intent of gaming I bought Skyrim at full price giddy with the knowledge of mods and console commands being able to fix those god forsaken bethesda bugs and adding new content to the game. I modded it a bit and after messing around with SKSE I got it to run. I think I played for a total of like 10 hours the orginal appeal of the game had been lost for some reason or another still not sure why if it was the controller being different the gameplay differences or the modding. Sometimes no amount of no amount of horse armor mods can save a game from just not being interesting anymore.When I found that I recieved this game for free because I owned the orginal and the DLC I thought it was kinda funny me and a friend joked about it even got this game for free and literally not sure who on PC would even ask for it. Yes it is a bone for the console community this game was probably released to Steam because they didn't want any hardcore PCMR bros getting off and ranting about console exclusives. I literally installed this game as a joke knowing that mods didn't work on SPE and how much I didn't enjoy the game on PC before.This game made me want to play Skyrim again the fact that you couldn't mod it felt like a more pure experience kinda like you're forced to play a game the way it is a feeling I had forgotten about since moving to PC. I never had many problems with the vanilla game on 360 and I felt more like I was playing a remaster of a console game than a true PC game which yes I know I said that it is a console game more than a PC game. This game really and honestly did not need to be released for Steam the graphic update is from the free dlc they made for Steam back a couple years ago. This game in a sense took me back as in the dreaded word of all reviews and opinions that completely and I mean this non sarcastically ruin it.Nostalgia. This game gave me hardcore nostalgia to the days of being a kid in high school dealing with homework and trying to impress girls the nights of staying in the living room all night eating junk food and playing a video game in the dark wrapped in a blanket. The weekends of friends coming over and taking turns playing a single player game rather than a multiplayer game because of how much fun we were having with it. Those hours and hours of looking up cool items in the game and where the best loot is and what cool stuff we could do with our characters. This game gave me the feels reminding me of friends I had lost to the tide of time all the time I had bleed into this game before I knew the horrors of the video game industry and the curse of DLCs and microtransactions. Let me make this clear this very important fact of what I'm saying.Nostalgia is a .Nostalgia 100% ruins the legitimacy of my review and my opinion of this game. It is not a solid ground to stand on when stating anything I know this and everyone reading my review should know this. A game is not good because it gives you nostalgia you should judge a game solely based on it as a game and so I will. This game is fun has a lot of stuff to do and in a very sarcastic sense has everything you enjoyed from Skyrim Orginal. This is just a update to the graphics and engine as so I heard. I've gotten my fair share of glitches crashes bugs getting stuck in objects and graphics going to because of draw distance. Seriously though this game has had no updating other than graphics and engine. That exploit you could do 5 years ago? Yeah its still there you can do all the old exploits and glitches bugs haven't been fixed and nothing is patched. Bethesda is just another triple A or AAA gaming studio that wants money cash cheddar caps and septims. I would say no new bugs but I've gotten stuck in objects a lot more than I remember. Would I say get this game for 40$? No lol if you got it for free thats great but if you want this exact game with mod support just buy the orginal with DLC during a good sale. I personally enjoy this game as it is and I have no desire to mod it in any way. This game gave me the feels and the dreaded N word of opinions. Uh the Nol starting word of opinions. Game has me in a good mood to play RPGs even got me to play some more Fo4. Just to make the record clear I have no positive opinions of Bethesda solely playing their games because I enjoy the game.So get the game if you want to play some vanilla Skyrim if not than buy the orginal release for mod support or just play a RPG thats not Bethesda heard they're pretty good.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-11-03,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,"After reading a few reviews over this I've summed up one argument that I thought was particularly important to look at.""It's not SUPPOSED to be a remake. It's a port!"" This is true... but they've advertised it as a remake emphasizing GRAPHICS in order to make their sales. People have argued that nobody should buy this for graphics and they're right if you own this for PC there's absolutely no reason to purchase this again if you didn't obtain it for free. The fact of the matter is even if it is only a port it wasn't advertised that way. Technically that's false advertising.Skyrim is an extraordinary game. Even if its lore has been dumbed down compared to previous Elder Scrolls titles. However the Special Edition isn't worth $40. Not unless you don't already own it. The visuals are improved minorly with a few details like better shaders lighting and environmental effects like fog. It does run a little smoother but no previous game bugs are fixed which certainly proves ones point that it's merely a port. My biggest complaint is as mentioned before it's advertisement as something more. The Special Edition changes virtually nothing graphics wise and literally nothing in terms of gameplay. You'll be sorely disappointed if you're purchasing this because ""gwaphix!"" or are expecting some form of new content. There is none.This is a money grab. But not necessarily for PC gamers. Bethesda has given us the liberty of obtaining it for free if we've owned the previous edition before a certain date. That's all fine and dandy but the point of this re release was to obtain some revenue from console gamers. I definitely cannot complain it was free since I've owned a copy of Skyrim already on the PC. But everyone seems to miss the point that it IS port meant to improve gameplay for CONSOLE gamers to get MONEY from them. Not from us. If you don't already own Skyrim then perhaps the $40 price tag isn't a big deal. I would personally wait for a sale if I didn't already own it but that's just me.To conclude Skyrim Special Edition does NOT add anything new. My negative recommendation comes solely from the fact that I know people are only looking to buy it because they're expecting ""new new new!"" it's just Skyrim wiped over with a lavender scented wash cloth.EDIT Bethesda's mod browser is also absolute Steam Workshop was a far better and more convenient option and it was actually reliable. For those of you who didn't heed my warning and bought the game only to be disappointed by Bethesda's mod browser just find a tuturial on Nexus Mods. It's a lot easier than you think and beats the hell out of whatever Bethesda was trying to pull.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

God rays and rain occlusion are a very nice touch. A+2. Enhanced clothing textures are noticeable but things like quivers still don't close up to the body. 3. 64 bit. This is what will keep the game running for the next decade or two THIS is the core reason to have this version. 4. Lots of same bugs as before some new ones too. I don't get this part at all. and it's just sloppy. Mods fix this google ""unofficial skyrim patch"". I expected to not see wolves falling from the sky.5. Audio files have been downgraded but not overly noticeable for me with current headphones. Please release original or actual remastered audio files please.6. I noticed a significantly improved load time. That's a nice plus.7. Viewing distances seem much improved with much less graphical hit than in the past. Could just be me. 8. Alt tabbing no longer crashes the game or mucks it up. Alt tab first try goes to black screen second try (hold alt tab) allows me to navigate. Improvement I guess.If you own a previous version but weren't eligible to get the remaster for free don't bother. Hold off til it's cheaper and fixed. If you have the ability to download this free go for it. Just be warned that it will likely be a downgrade with stock settings versus your old modded version. Give it til 2017 for a full modding experience to come to fruition. I got Skyrim Collector's Edition day 1 at midnight and I've spent more hours in this series than I'd like to admit.

Sure it's still good old Skyrim including all of its previously released DLC from 2011 but (slightly) graphically updated... However you could achieve much better looking graphics out of the original Skyrim with mods. Sure you could get mods for Skyrim Special Edition... but you need some sort of Bethesda account whereas in the original you had the Steam Workshop by your side!Oh and yes this is a Bethesda game so don't expect them to have bug tested this game before release. There are a fair few new bugs. For example in the opening cutscene before you create your character Lokir the guy who gets shot trying to run away cries ""NOE! AM NOT A REBOL. YOU CAHNT DO THIS D &lt "" as per usual but after that nothing happened. He just stood there and the guards stared at him in silence. I had to start a new game to fix this bug. An assortment of old bugs carried over from the original too.Actually all of the bad from the original carried over to this edition. These ""bad "" include AI Broken (but admittedly hilarious) Stealth NPCs talking to me when passing by for no apparent reason NPCs repeating quotes over and over and over again Lack of Quest Variety (go here kill this go there talk to this guy) Immortal Children Uninteresting Combat Horseback Riding Gets boring after a while""But Yoshi you can solve the majority of these problems with mods!""Oh sure let's encourage the developers to let the consumer fix their game for them.

2016-10-28,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"If you can acquire the original Legendary release instead do that.While the Special Edition is nice in principle it simply falls short on every level 1) Graphics. The game assets are virtually identical to the original's HD textures. The updated game engine does allow for some added effects which can be really nice but they can also contribute to a ""polished turd"" look generally. It's a mixed bag.2) Sound. The Special Edition sounds like garbage compared to the original release. The existing uncompressed audio assets have been mangled under an ""updated"" encoding scheme here and the results are pretty bad. It's a shame particularly given how rich and immersive the original sound design was.3) Mods. The Special Edition jettisons the Steam Workshop in favor of Bethesda's own mod host. It's pretty obvious that Bethesda is just waiting to pull the trigger on paid mods again it's only a matter of time. It seems that the Nexus is still a viable modding option though. Regardless by the time Special Edition compatible mods reach any sort of maturity you'll undoubtedly be able to catch this game on a sale anyway.So yeah for a $40 asking price this ""Special"" release just doesn't quite cut the proverbial mustard.

The bugs in this border on gamebreaking. Somehow this remaster takes all the bugs that existed with the original game and has made them worse. I'm constantly looking up console commands to attempt to fix issues in the game. I can't use any ability that slows time as it ends up staying slowed permanently (Kinda neat for 5 seconds then really annoying) The combat music loops without end after you have finished a fight. I actually had to turn off the in game music because it was driving me insane. I've gotten stuck in the ground more times than I can count with no explanation as to why forcing me to noclip out. This is just a handful of the issues I've had without getting into the silly stuff like NPC's walking away from you during dialogue breaking quests shouts not working (Always fun to line up the perfect shout just to have it decide it doesn't want to work this time) and just overall shoddy programming for a full price game.

Old Skyrim according to steam stats has more users around double last I checked.Bethesada is becoming EA 2.0 Lets make it clear I got this free due to having Skyrim Legendary Edition before this came out and they know odds are most of us would not see a need to buy it as of now I would not recommend spending a dime on it. Nothing it offers is realy worth passing up legendary given your customizing options there. If your system can handle it just imagine how much Better it can handle Skyrim Legendary. Get 60 FPS on SE imagine how much you can handle an ENB set up on your Legendary. I play a modded Fallout 4 and still find myself back in Skyrim old version over this money grab I mean they hid the old version......Wow Bethesda shame on you. Hiding the original? Are you trying that much to become EA? I have spent lots of money through the years on your games and atm I'm thinking I wont be doing so anymore I got this free and see no value in using it over my Original. My guess is this is an attempt at forcing people to use the new paid mods aka the Creation Club. So much for paid mods wont affect anything in a negative way....Odds are they will claim error caused original to be hidden once things get nasty.

I will get straight to the point If you don't have either this version or the regular Skyrim I would rather recommend to buy the old Legendary Edition than this when it is on sale or somewhere else. Don't get me wrong the Special Edition is really good and the renewed lighting and the rest do look really good that is why I still give this a Recommendation but now that I have completed the 100% Achievements on both games I can say without any doubt that there are no changes with the gameplay at all (even though I did not expect any changes anyway). Also there are mods for the old Skyrim which make it look better maybe even better than the Special Edition and you can get it for less money.Simple list Arguments for buying the Special Edition Looks Good Reason to get into Skyrim again if you have stopped playing Comes with all DLC ALT + TAB worksArguments for buying the regular Special Edition instead Mods from the Steam Workshop can make it look atleast as good as the Special Edition if not even better Has the same Gameplay and may be bought even cheaperBut if you don't want to deal with mods and don't care about money I will not stop you from enjoying the vanilla Skyrim with this.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The one thing I have a problem with in this game is the punishment for using mods. The one true selling point Bethesda used and drove home with the remastered Special Edition which was the inclusion of MODS. Will get you cut off from Achievements in the game. WTF?! You're going to incorporate this in the menu of the MAIN screen that allows you to download mods from YOUR website which we have to sign up to ""Bethesda.net"" and then punish everyone for doing so. You can say that this gives people and unfair advantage or it isn't how you intended the game to be played. After 6 years of playing this game why do you honestly give a damn if people use mods or Console commands for that matter? Further more if you're that opposed to people using mods in your game why make it accessible in he game itself. That's like building a Resturant that you've always wanted to eat at in your Town or city.Then anyone who goes there can look at all the food but if they ever eat any. They get poisoned and die.

Which rules out about 90%of mods aviable on nexus. So personally I prefer 32 bit version. Does that mean that version is bad? Not at all it was meant for console players.

On top of that there's all that jazz with the creation club basically being paid mods.Also apparently there are a lot less available free mods for this version of Skyrim compared to the original.

2017-08-26,0,0,84,False,Recommended,The Elder Scrolls Skyrim what a way to continue after the amazing predecessor TES Oblivion. Skyrim has been an absolutely amazing title since is release in 2011. Again this game wasn't &amp still isn't perfect (Obviously because its from Bethesda D). I have spent a decent 1100 hours in Skyrim across PC Xbox 360 PS3 &amp PS4. Lets just say I am kind of a fan ) This game offers an experience that barely any other games can compare to. The map is quite large containing many areas to explore with a vast number of unique experiences in each one. Yes after your 100th dungeon you may start to get a bit bored because of repetetiveness but thats nothing that mods cannot fix.Playing the game for its first time will be a bit slow due to the inventory system &amp questline sometimes being a pain in the backside. It doesn't really matter in the end you'll quickly fall in love with the game despite the not so rare crashes that will occur (Thanks Bethesda). The main story will keep you occupied for well over 15 hours on your first playthrough but thats not it! The amount of guilds (Mages Thieves &amp Dark Brotherhood) offer a highly diverse questline that you'll never forget.FAQ Q Is this game good?A Dumb question just buy it and enjoy it like so many have since 2011!Q What do I do once I complete the main story?A You play the DLC's (Which are great btw) and complete the guilds &amp faction quests. Q What do I do after completeing most quests &amp areas?A Either quit (Lose out on so much) or you can hop on over to the modding community. The modding site called the 'Nexus' &amp the integrated modding system from Bethesda will easily get you well over the 100 hours mark.Q Why would I mod is it hard to do so?A Modding can be very simple by using the In game one or slighly harder with the Nexus one (Tutorials on youtube around 5 minutes long). So the reason for modding is simply that it adds an infinite amount of content. There are some absolutely amazing content creators out there that have amazing DLC sized mods which are FREE! Want new enemies FREE! Want new lands to travel to FREE! Want to turn Skyrim into a tropical paradise FREE!Lets be honest here everyone has Skyrim or has at least heard of it. If you're still hesitating after all this time just grab it on one of the sales for so cheap. Remember there is a refund button which you won't use it anyway ) Hope on over into this amazing installment in The Elder Scrolls series and explore Skyrim!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

My personal verdict is that if you don't already own Skyrim there's no major reason to not get Special Edition instead of the original. But if you have the original you might as well stick to it with the official high def texture pack and a couple water mods maybe a saturation mod and a shadow banding fix mod if you want to go all out. Which chances are you already have installed.It doesn't look much different and what few differences exist I personally did not like or didn't think were worth dealing with the couple changes I didn't like.Also speaking of mods if you want to use mods on Special Edition it apparently disables achievements. You also apparently have to create a Bethesda account or somesuch in order to use mods. I didn't look too closely into it so maybe it's not a requirement if you work around it. But it's worth knowing.I copy pasted a save file from regular skyrim into special edition and took a couple comparison screen shots. Below I will link the original version screenshots in their descriptions they have links to the corresponding special edition screenshots.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843562083http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561842http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561682http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561511Something I noticed that I didn't see in other reviews not that I looked too closely at them was that in special edition the camera is weirdly ""zoomed in"" in first person mode. Like it's as if the camera is a foot and a half farther in front of your face in special edition than it was in the original. It's very disorienting I kept feeling like I was going to smack my face into something or Serana would pop up and be RIGHT IN MY FACE.It is of course up to you to decide which version you like better. I and a couple friends I showed these screenshots to preferred the original. But if you own the original and are wondering whether to bother installing the special edition.... Nah I wouldn't recommend it.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-12-02,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I wish there was a neutral option for reviewing. I love Skyrim but this just doesn't warrant enough for a purchase and that's what my review is for. If you already own the game + DLCs then you have the game so no ned to worry. But when it comes to people who are looking to get into Skyrim for the first time I'd say wait a bit till the mods really start pourin in or for a sale.Right now the same bugs are still in the game so Bethesda still expects us to fix it. The textures are the same the only real difference is lighting effects some more flora and water textures. However the 64 bit boost is a huuuuge thing for mods but right now it doesn't mean anything since SKSE doesn't work yet.Anyway I'll change this when this game is actually worth its price. I recommend if you're a noob just get the original and soup it up with mods and you'll be fine.UPDATE Paid mods have come to skyrim and they hid the original.

People reported that cast speed could break the game and in some cases your save file could become completely corrupted which would also break the game.However you want to spin it I'm not OK with a 100% vanilla zero mod play of this game being broken to the point that I cannot cast spells from an entire school of magic.

The fact that it is true 64 bit makes the game run very smoothly and load times are extremely quick for me. I've also noticed plenty of new dialogue throughout multiple quest lines. It saddens me to see this revamped Skyrim get such a bad rap for all the wrong reasons and from people who don't pay attention to all the little beautiful details added to the game.

2017-06-14,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Skyrim is a massive open world action RPG with an open ended skill and progression system that adapts to and rewards your playstyle. Quests never feel like hum drum fetch quests and apart from the main questline even the sidequests themselves encapsulate stories within stories.SE also features 64 bit enhanced memory support and a plethora of visual upgrades that make the world sharper the shadows more shadowy and the sunrises well...more sunrisey.As a bonus it also fixes the game's previous alt tabbing problems.I've previously put hundreds of hours into the original console release before purchasing it on the PC as well.After purchasing it on PC I was pleasantly surprised when it was later announced that previous legendary edition owners would get SE for free as well...despite people claiming how greedy Bethesda is.Creation Club Bethesda recently announced (June 2017) that they would be releasing a curated content marketplace at E3. This caused an uproar on the Steam forums (for whatever that's worth) in large part due to the fiasco that was the previous workshop store on Steam which was widely panned.You can read about it here https //creationclub.bethesda.net/enThis led to many people mass downvoting the game and downvoting any positive reviews in protest as well as flamewars in the forums.Many of these negative claims are based on hyperbole and misinformation from people who haven't read the official FAQ and have made a lot of assumptions and rumors and then got outraged about the rumors that they made up. There has been some intelligent discussion on the subject in the Skyrim Steam forums but it was mostly drowned out.You can still purchase the original Skyrim on Steam.http //store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/SE doesn't require you to use its built in mod manager nor does it force you to buy content from Bethesda only. NexusMods has over 6000 mods that support SE.If you read the Creation Club faq Bethesda also states they will continue to support the free and open modding community.Content creators will be screened by Bethesda and have to show examples of their work before being accepted to the program and all content will go through an approval process and development pipeline so the kid that tried to sell $99 horse genitals on the old workshop store isn't going to cut it here.If you were following this drama you should also know that the mudcrab armor for Skyrim and the horse armor for FO4 were inside jokes based on old memes. Apparently a lot of people didn't get them and took them 100% seriously.Bethesda has also stated that they will not be accepting pre existing mods for the creator program and they will be releasing new and original content.If you don't like content marketplaces that allow users to submit content and if approved get a share of the sales then you shouldn't support CSGO TF2 Dota 2 and many other games on Steam. This isn't the first single player game to sell content like skins either. In fact this also describes how the Steam store works too. Publishers and developers submit their content Steam sells it and takes a cut of all their sales.Now if you just don't like the idea then there's nothing wrong with that. But there are/were many users on the Steam forums shouting profanities slurs bigotry telling people to themselves talking about murdering the developers and claiming that anyone who doesn't agree with them is being paid by Bethesda.

2016-10-30,0,0,828,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. TL DR longer review below. Don't bother modded Legendary Edition is just fine.Two hours is enough to remind me why I hated Vanilla Skyrim so much. The best game to play right now is the waiting game as we wait for the modders to port their mods over to this so called ""Special Edition"". If you played Skyrim on consoles or you don't care about mods at all then yes I recommend this game. It's not that Skyrim on release date was a terrible game. It deserved all the praise it received back in the day. But after several hundred hours of playing modded Skyrim the shocking reduction in quality playing Special Edition with no mods is jarring. Yes the graphics are better and because of this many HD mods become redundant which can help save hard drive space for those with only mid range PCs like myself. But how good are the remastered graphics? Sadly not very. Here's an excellent example at how lazy Bethesda is at remastering graphics. http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/? This mod shows in detail how low res the textures and meshes are even in this Special Edition. Now I know what you are saying ""Well of course mods are going to be better than vanilla that's the point of modding."" I hear what you are saying but consider the following. Bethesda is a huge developer/publisher with millions of dollars hundreds of staff and had months to work on this remastered project. This author worked alone and released the original version for vanilla Skyrim exactly three months after its release date. All the author needed to do was port over all the assets he already had for vanilla Skyrim and Bob's your uncle. Why didn't Bethesda take the time to give this Special Edition the love and care it deserves? Answer because they don't give a they just want your money so they take the game make it 64 bit slap some god rays on it and call it a new game. Also the lack of improvement was that the game could still run on consoles. When are companies going to stop treating PC players like second class citizens when they have far more money than console players on average? My PC was relatively cheap at about $1300 CDN. A PS4 can be purchased for $450 CDN brand new. A $1300 PC and a $450 console are never going to be equal. PC is always going to be the most powerful gaming platform. Deal with it stop pretending and stopping screwing over the customer base with the most amount of money. Even someone working a minimum wage job full time can save up to buy a console in as little as couple of weeks depending on how badly they want it. Don't fall for their nonsense. I got this game for free from owning Legendary Edition and I still don't recommend it. If you've never owned Skyrim before buy the original Legendary Edition and just add mods. The modding community has not abandoned vanilla Skyrim and is unlikely to for a very long time if ever considering that mods for Oblivion and Fallout 3 are still being released.To sum up as a remastered edition I am not impressed. Vanilla Skyrim was an awesome game modded Skyrim is even more so. This version? Just no don't bother. Don't reward greed and laziness by paying money for this game and if you got it for free don't rush to download it as the best mods on Nexus are going to be weeks and months away from Special Edition compatibility. Let's face it nobody buys Bethesda games for their vanilla content they buy it so they can mod the hell out of it and make a better game. Hell the whole point of this release on console was to add mod support. Even Bethesda knows modders make a better product than they do. Again do not reward this behaviour by spending money on this product or they will keep doing the same ad nauseum.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I'm not even kidding. I can't navigate menus with my mouse and in game I can't move my character. I don't have a controller plugged in but if I remember from Skyrim you had to actually ""activate"" using a controller from the options. And that would be pretty easy to fix... Or it would be if the game actually gave me an ""Options"" menu from the start menu which for whatever reason it decided not to do.I tried pressing escape to bring up the options in game but since I can't use my keyboard the menu isn't actually popping up. I can't even comment on how the game runs because I honestly have no ing clue about how well it works.

And sorry for my bad english I use my expandable english and google translate DI received this edition for free because I already have the normal version with all the DLC's and I loved the game and spent many hours in Skyrim. Therefore I recommend the regular version definitely but is it the same with the special edition? I would say maybe. NEW Short charging times due to the 64 bit Engine The new lighting effects look very good no stuttering when changing the current Cell Everything is generally more colorful and mostly realistic illuminated Dynamic FocusThe rest hasn't changed too hard. The quests are the same the faces are still emotionless ( D ) bugs were take... All in all it is ok but not awesome. If you played the normal version with mods that isn't a big upgrade for you...But it is still Skyrim in my view the best game of all time therefore I recommend it logically.The feeling is still awesome!

2016-10-29,17,179,45,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this if you own the original. Absolutely do not.This game is literally the same as the original release the only differences are the upgrade to 64 bit for extra RAM allocation and the removal of the Steam Workshop and replacing it with the Bethesda version which doesn't allow you to get achievements if you have any mods enabled in comparison to the original allowing you to get them with mods running.The audio is more compressed and sounds slightly worse on headphones and the textures were upscaled for some reason even though they look exactly the same. The only thing the graphics in this have going over the original is the better Antialiasing Depth of Field and the light diffusion that occurs with the god rays.Oh and there's more rocks on roads and a couple extra bushes.

It wasn't my cup of tea but I like the engine and idea of it. The graphics were okay and somewhat hold up if you have a very low end pc. Then bethesda announces their biggest project to date SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION the thing they have been spending all your time and money on. But what innovations does this game have? the water is 4k and it gives you all the dlc. That would be fine and dandy if not for it being unable to share the originals skyrims mods which was the main reason people even liked the original skyrim because it had so many issues. This was a big rant but buy the original if you actually want the game even if it costs more. I for one do not support this game even though i unfortunately had the displeasure of buying it on sale.Overall not worth it. The best thing going for it was mods which have not been transfered to its seperate nexus page and you do not want to use the bethesda given mods which encourage buying creation club mods Reading this is 500 creation club credits or $5.00 USD thanks for sitting through my ebic review bb.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The original is currently listed for 10.So the simple question is do I feel like I would have paid 20 for this upgrade?

2016-10-30,7,53,188,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. As fun as it is to play though the game again the only thing Special about this Edition is how lazy Bethesda is. I'm going to assume that most of the graphical upgrades were due to Fallout 4's development since they are the same engine. The same bugs exist once they stopped patching Skyrim but what's funny is the audio is worse quality than the original's. And there is nothing new nothing that really makes this edition special other than its 64 bit.A lot of the best mods need Skyrim Script Extender which from what I understand has to be completely rewritten for this version of the game. It's also not done for Fallout 4 and who knows when it will be released for this edition. At least we don't have to pay for mods like they wanted although if they had hired some of the modders to fix some of the issues this would of been worthy of ""special edition.""Morrowind's and Oblivion's main stories felt finished. Here in Skyrim you can defeat the dragons but what of the Civil War? You pick your side and the cities change factions Jarls change. That's about it. What about the Thalmor? It just abruptly stops there no moot to declare who is High King of Skyrim. What about you as Dragonborn? Could you follow the path of Talos and become Emperor or at the very least High King of Skyrim to unite the land against the Dominion?

2016-11-02,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. What did I like? That that it was free. What I don't like? As I've seen several others say I also agree that Bethesda wasted a lot of time and money working on this when they should have been working on more deserving games and I DON'T just mean ES VI I mean either Morrowind or especially Oblivion(which DID just turn 10 this year!)! All the other developers have been releasing anniversary editions for their 10 year old games so why didn't Oblivion get its anniversary edition?!Don't get me wrong yes it does look prettier but only by a VERY SLIGHT improvement over all the environmental mods I had in my Legendary Edition of the game. Is it worth paying full price for the Special Edition? ABSOLUTELY NOT! As several others have also noticed VERY FEW bugs were fixed. Also the other thing I've seen quite a few others complaining about is that using mods in the SE DOES DISABLE Steam achievements and console Trophies/Acheivements so if you care about that go pick up the older version for dirt cheap as using mods in THAT version unlocks them just fine.Btw why is it asking me to check a box if I received it free? Does that mean you readers are automatically supposed to discount my review just because I didn't pay for it? It was nice for Bethesda to do that for Steam users but it's extremely unfair to charge FULL PRICE for console users for a 5 year old game when I've seen the Legendary Edition going for $20 new!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I can manage with small bugs annoyances etc. but 1. Not being able to walk through open doors essentially preventing me from finishing quests without the use of the console or mods. Collisions are broken all around.2. Barnabas is EVEN MORE annoying which is almost impossible or so i thought.3. Random objects NPCs and animals can often be found floating in the air.4. Essenntially all of the original vanilla Skyrim bugs are transferred along with introducing new ones.(5. No achievements with or without mods or addons. EDIT I have not touched the game for a few days and suddently the achievements magically appeared go figure.)I'm sick of spending time fixing games instead of playing them. Considering that Fallout 4 is essentially Skyrim with guns and both games were released prior to Skyrim SE I thik Bethesda should do a better job working on a product rather than marketing it. After Thief 2014 i stopped bying Square Enix titles where you spend more time watching opening and closing windows rather than playing.

If you are willing to wait for mod support then be advised I expect some mods never will fully be compatible with this version of Skyrim due to minor issues. It is also stupid that using mods causes achievements to be disabled mods are simply necessary in Skyrim to fix some of bethesda's bugs e.g. Unofficial Skyrim Patch.Skyrim is the best TES game in the past 10 years hands down.

2016-10-27,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A welcome improvement but still room for improvement.I feel like graphically Skyrim SE is what 2011 Skyrim should have been a built in ENB (or very nearly so) better lighting high res textures depth of field (maybe even a little parallax?). The character models are oh kay good enough to play but still lacking the polish of say Mass Effect. The draw distance is still less than great and the water looks like flowing gel but as shipped it's 85% of the way there.The game also has considerable under the hood improvement. It opens in a near instant. Not a single crash thus far. Alt+tab works! (TOOK LONG ENOUGH.) Whiterun loaded in 2.5 *seconds*. I've never seen the framerate so consistently high or loading screens so consistently short. Took 10 years since 64 bit was common but it's here at last. Bravo.Gameplay wise Skyrim SE is still 2011 Skyrim through and through. It was actually shocking to remember what that was like as I'm coming from my heavily modded Frostfall+Requiem+EGO+Warzones hardcore gameplay installation of the original. I just beat Helgen on my first try not my 30th. Everything thus far has been a cake walk. Which reminds me of this article ( http //www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video games/columns/firstperson/9265 Skyrim is Soulless ) and underscores sadly that original Skyrim as shipped is a sort of Potempkin village lots of pretty things to look at but it's all only skin deep. No real challenge no real choices or consequences. This new Skyrim SE *needs* to be modded if for no other reason than to compensate for the critical gameplay elements that are still lacking.Which finally brings me to the missed opportunities. Though some bugs (crashing) appear to have been alleviated there is a huge and unforgivable missed opportunity. The unofficial patches at a minimum should have been included essential as they are and given that Bethesda has known about these bugs for years. It also would have been nice to have seen the original cut content (e.g. Pit Fighters Cutting Room Floor Civil War Overhaul Touring Carriages) restored the argument that they ran out of time doesn't cut it 5 years later. Other obvious deficiencies (slow horses no body in first person no multiple followers no open cities no built in SkyUI) still remain unaddressed as well. Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity is that at the dawn of the VR age there is no built in VR support. VR enthusiasts will rue this day for years.Should you get Skyrim SE? Of course. Skyrim (modded) is a great game. I just wish that after 5 years Skryim were finally shipping as it should have shipped 5 years ago.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Also all the mods that people have been making for 4 plus years for the original do not work for SE so not only does it not look as good as the original when modded with graphic mods but you also lose the 4+ years of work from modders just because they wanted to lick the bung hole of Xbox and ps4 users so they could grab a quick dollar off modders work.

2016-10-28,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. When Skyrim first came out I had been so eager to play it. First owned it on the Xbox 360 for which it was a mind blowing experience instantly fell in love with the game. I moved to pc shortly after which only improved the game vastly. It was a medium level laptop I ran it on but the game still felt fresh.Coming back to it five years later there honestly isn't much that stands out. Obviously it's the same game plot and structure but nothing about the new and improved graphics and atmosphere feels well....new. The special edition has had a five year gap and between the two games many modders have managed to achieve even more than some of the new features...they simply don't reflect on what should have been. Sun shafts some slightly improved fire physics and redone textures are about as noticable as it gets (even though the hd textures were already available years prior). Other than that there doesn't appear to be anything visually striking. Even the poor NPC's still have those lifeless eyes...I mean if interection with them is such a big part of the game could they not have made them nicer to look at? This is a strictly Ultra settings opinion...as for the console users I have no doubt that things look nicer. The new edition for PCs however if you aren't recieving it for FREE is not in my opinion worth it. Mods within the Steam community are far more effective and will make you awe at the little details whereas the new edition will make you question the hype you spilled waiting for it to happen. It is a shame that such a title as Skyrim suffered of recent and I cannot honestly see myself delving into another 800 hours of gameplay.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

In short Great exploration insane ammount of quests killing people with swords axes maces magic 'n stuff overall a sh*t ton of stuff to do. Now about the Special Edition First of all it's either better or just as good as the Legendary Edition in every way.The graphics are overall nicer with new Godrays depth of field and much better shadows.Things like bugs and UI (excecpt the new ""Mods"" category in the main menu) were literally untouched (so no bug fixes gotta admit I'm disappointed).But the biggest change is the ditching of x32 and upgrade to x64 of the engine meaning it performs better than original Skyrim expecially in crowded areas even though the graphics are better aswell not to forget that this opens up a whole new level of high demanding mods to be created from a modding community still working after 5 years sicne the original Skyrim came out.But as conclusion I have to say I wouldn't buy it for 40 (got it for free like many others for having the normal game with all DLC) but if you get this as game key or on a sale for 30 or less I can highly recommend it (oh and if you don't own Skyrim at all it's worth the full price IMO).",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

And this outstanding game has become my main go to game or only game. This game and series has so much going for it. With a brilliant story in depth lore too much of it in fact. As well as the exploration and RPG elements that are seen in game. Most favourably I'm in love that you create a character and that character can be whatever and do whatever you wish to do. Whether it be to ignore the main questline which is good but a little on the short side for me personally. With hundreds of diversions and distractions along the way is unbelievable. And I can see myself playing the Elder Scroll's games for many years to come. Playing Skyrim had also seen the purchase of Oblivion and ESO. Just to get a taste of the Elder Scroll's franchise as a whole. And I am amazed. Thank you Bethesda for bringing me THE game that I've been looking for.

2016-10-28,0,0,49,False,Recommended,8/10 for the graphical updates. It looks a lot better than vanilla skyrim (despite claims to the contrary). The vastly improved shadows are the real improvement here. At noon on a sunny day is where it's most apparent it's not the flickery shadowed mess it used to be. Other times of day have big improvements too and sunsets are beautiful (if a bit overblown).The Volumetric Lighting/Godrays are overdone in foggy weather especially in the rift but also stunning at times the throat of the world or markarth looming over you and casting a huge shadow is impressive. As for DoF I turned depth of field down (but not off) because my character isnt myopic.Also.... Precipitation occlusion has been added! This is the biggest thing for me in regards to the updates real shelter they didnt capitalise on that and add more violent weather however which brings me onto....3/10 for effort.I know bethesda never said this would be anything more than a graphical update. But I really think it was a missed opportunity to really reboot this game and fix blatent issues and gameplay problems. Bugs? Gaps in magic gameplay? (backpedal and die) Light vs Heavy armour gameplay? Archery? Many people have learnt from 5 years of modding and improvements and the games failings really came to light over the years (I would have happily payed for a reboot like that).Finally. The game runs super smooth feels great and loads quickly. Even with the open cities mod my game runs at a fairly stable 60 fps on my old GTX760 high settings... the modding potential for this improvement to performance cant be understated.PS Hurry up with the public CK release please.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This is a steady improvement over the original Skyrim allowing more objects to be on screen at a time higher frame rate and improved graphics it would be an ideal game to buy... If it wasn't being sold for $40 and that they hid the original version and dismantled the legendary edition they also punish moders and the script extender still isn't released yet. For people who had the OV (original Version) and all its DLC this game isn't worth a cent. The only reason I play this version over the other is that it runs better. My computer isn't high end with an AMD FX 6300 and an EVGA GTX 750 ti with 8G of ram. The fact I had to run a mod to re enable my achievements is ridiculous. The only reason achievements are disabled is because the Xbox uses achievements to give players small discounts sometimes.The game still has many of the same problems that plage Skyrim some of them I mentioned in my other Skyrim review.Do I get punished for running mods that fix your stupid broken game? Don't say that achievement isn't important to a game for it to be fun that isn't the point. They have been slowly taking features out of their games for years now just look at FO4 which in my opinion is a complete garbage fallout and a very generic shooter.

But we are talking about special edition and what it is specially on the start. It adds in game moding menu on standard we must use steam workshop. Some graphical updates and after my comparing they are not really big maybe on screenshots or with everythink on ultra the light is better but on high it looks only bit better no updated textures tho and some technical updates. Its nothink new in the game. Not even new achievements. For those who got it for free its fun way to play it again or finally finish the game but for new players the standard skyrim with dlcs is much cheaper and less demanding version. Overall i am still giving it positive this is one of the best RPG games ever made and with some future updates it should be more stable. On the start game didnt even worked for me so for anyone whose game starts for like 2 seconds but dont show up launch and closes after here is insturction how to fix it.1. Go into folder where you installed game 2. Go to _CommonRedist folder.3. Go to VcRedist folder4. Run installer and press repair.5. If it doesnt work uninstall and install again.Aaaand it crashed after 2 hours. Just Bethesda things...,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

All in all i dont feel like much has changed except for some better lighting. This special edition got a lot of hype and in my opion it was just a cash grab. 90% of the added lighting and textures could have been done by modding the original game. If i didnt get this for free i would have wasted a lot of money.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Unless you got it for free I would avoid paying 40 dollars for what is still essentially a five year old game bugs and all. IF HOWEVER you are in the minority that hasn't bought Skyrim until now I would recommend it because what it does bring to the table is the ability to mod the game to a much greater extent than the original which is absolutely essential for Skyrim. And you get all the DLC which is another plus.What disappoints me the most is the lack of effort on Bethesda to improve some of the major complaints from the original Skyrim. Just another ""Remastered"" cash grab to exploit console users like we saw with Bioshock.

For those of you who are looking into buying Skyrim for the first time I strongly recommend you just go on and get this version instead of the previous one.

2016-11-13,0,0,0,False,Recommended,TESV SSE is a beautifully optimized version of the original Skyrim. Some people will disagree with this but there are specific reasons for that. Let's take a look at some of them.For newcomers to the game this is the place to start. It features numerous improvements to lighting and overall experience when compared to the original (the unmodded special edition is superior to the unmodded original and addresses some known issues of the latter). Do expect a few bugs when playing the early builds especially weird NPC glitches as expected of a recent remake of such a complex platform.HOWEVER... if you are a veteran of the original one used to playing the optimized and modded version of Skyrim you will probably feel that the Special Edition is lackluster or even a downright downgrade. Why? Because you are used to 3rd party changes that took years to fine tune. What one needs to take into account is that SE is the new platform upon which future mods will be built... many modders if not most have already stopped working on the standard platform to begin porting efforts and SE development. This means that in a few months time the modded version of the Special Edition will (likely) be far superior to the standard one and that alone is more than enough to recommend it. Conclusion It's a must buy for long term players of Skyrim although still raw... some patience will be required for it to be modded enough to shine like the hidden gem it really is.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I'm not sure if it's my PC but I could only get 30 FPS playing this my thought is that it might be capped but I'm not certain. I love Skyrim I've played thorugh the game several times on PC and console but it would be better to not spend money on this and instead buy the original Skyrim and It's DLC if you don't have it already. Pack the original with mods and download the FREE DLC that will get you the same quality as Special Edition and it will be a way better experience then this.

Bethesda need's to step up there game if i want mods i use the nexus mod platform because it is so much better and well made it is less glitchy and has MORE MODS that are ALL FREE none of them are locked behind a paywall. I think i should have gotten legendary edition it has more mods and is cheaper it has no paid mods to make me want to uninstall the game I think that if you are debating between Special Edition and Legendary Edition you should get legendary and get access to amazing mods like playing multiplayer with your friend (Via Himachi) Excluding the rediculous mod situation and badly made patch's that i need to patch anyway the game work's it's ok the game is better than the original and to be fair it is abit more playable than the old one.TLDR the game is improved but paid mods make it worse The game is a better standalone game but not by much a good enough upgrade if i was on console but the loss of the mod's support and the fact that mods to legendary edition make it work better than this does the legendary edition would be my personal choice,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

In either case the fact that the game is now 64 bit (and the ability to adress much more memory) makes this a definite improvement over vanilla skyrim especially in terms of the potential for modding regardless of what you think of the visual improvements.

2016-11-24,0,0,119,False,Recommended,This game is the same as the Original no fixes or aditional quests. A little frustrating that the bugs didnt get fixed that have been glaring since 2011 including the internal timings being linked directly to FPS and refresh rate of monitor and as was mostly expected any modded save games will end up being incompatible from the original over to the SE version.. BUT that said It is an improvment over the original.. graphics aside for most people (myself included) this game will be more stable for you after then engine switch to 64 bit. I find the Graphics aditions to be noticable and enjoyable to have default with no modding needed to look breathtaking and modding it now only improves it further. The modding community isnt QUITE as dedicated to Skyrim SE or at least seems that way with a very slow process or no process in switching mods from original 32 bit skyrim to 64 bit skryimSE ... so unfortunately some of the bigger mods you may have used may not be available .. YET .. most major ones have been switched over and or are in the process of being converted. the primary holdup being the lack of the SKSE 64 bit being done (which is actively being worked on as I type this). Is it esential to make the switch to S? Maybe maybe not.. not yet.. but it shows immense promise. The base game itself will always be great and the modded content will only improve as time goes on to eventually bring it into the standard we were all used to in the Vanilla Skyrim. In time the mods will likely even be bigger and better for SE than the Vanilla one. TLDR It's not a Nirn shattering change from the original however there are enough things to make it worth the upgrade and in time I feel it /will/ have a better platform to work with than the original.

I hadn't played Skyrim in awhile it might be a fresh experience I thought.Reinstalled Skyrim to check it out after installing a few choice mods for SE fired up the Vive loaded the Vorpx started Skyrim and... there's several very poignant VR experiences out there like theBlu Batman VR Experience Vanishing Realms games made specifically for VR that give you that sense of ""being there"" Skyrim SE with the Vorpx Driver might as well be one of those games. When you combine these things you stop merely ""playing"" Skyrim and you start ""Experiencing"" it.

2016-10-29,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Some of the leaves look like virtual plastic and the animals could use some updating too.Overall the environment is extremely well done.

2016-10-27,0,0,155,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I would take most of the performance related reviews with a grain of salt. The framerate for me on ultra settings isnt perfect (40fps but with below recommended pc requirements) but this is to be expected considering the improved graphics ive also yet to experience a single crash. Now as far as the actual improvments go its a signifcant improvment upon the OG skyrim. Lastly the mods while i personally dont use many (especially with the special edition) the utter rage people have regarding mods on the special edition is idiotic. While yes some mods just wont work and others will need to be updated what were people expecting everything to just work all hunky dory? its a new engine for christs sake. If you dont like it play the OG skyrim with the mods that apprently make it look/run better anyway no ones forcing you to buy this. Anyways mods on the special edition should be bigger and better than before thanks to the special edition being 64 bit.So should you buy it? I would but it thats my opinion look at what the game offers and decide if you can justify spending the gold (and if your pc can handle it of course).,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The 64bit upgrade gives us a lot more options where modding is concerned and greater stability.Don't really get the negative reviews as some are saying that it was the same game as before which is what bethesda said it would be with some upgrades in certain areas i.e(lighting water shders etc) . This remaster wasn't supposed to be huge for pc it was meant to be big for the consoles. Which having played skyrim on the console I can see how the improvements listed would be huge for console players.Edit. After having played the game for a few more hours I figured I would give my review a little update.The stability in this game is amazing. I remember having a few texture enhancements and getting open cities of skyrim and going into Whiterun just to see my frames tank as soon as the gates opened (same rig with no upgrades between games) now I can open the gates and my frames dont change from 60. Also many of the texture mods from Skyrim work and more are being added to the nexus and bethesda.net constantly. So I still say that the upgrade in the engine was well worth it.Helpful tip run the game in fullscreen borderless it really seems to help performance wise.To those who were wanting to know.I7 4790k980tiGame on HDD144hz Monitor Locked at 6016gigs of Ram,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Now that the game is 64 bit expect much better mod support/ports of mods once SKSE gets updated.Impactful changes Borderless windowed works really well. I can alt tab easily even during loading screens and don't have any cursor glitches in the few times I tried it.Audio quality is a lot worse as they've decided to change the .wav files into .xwm with quite a bit of compression. I'm sure there will be a mod to fix this in the future as it just requires replacing audio files with .wavs or better quality .xwms.If you don't have this for free wait for substantial mod support before buying unless you know you're okay with Vanilla Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This is a GOOD THING. If you didn't already own the DLC for the original game which all came out within the first year and a half of a now 5 year old game and you didn't get the free upgrade the only person to blame is yourself. Clearly you didn't enjoy it enough to buy the extended content for it so why should you get that content for free now? This version of the game very quickly replaced my love for vanilla Skyrim with higher frame rates higher default color contrast and 64 bit processing. The trees are actually green now! I love it!For the best mods head over to the Nexus Mods website (just Google it). If you install all your mods manually and have compatibility issues or it kills your game you'll likely have to start from scratch and re install everything.

At this time the game still has many of the bugs that Skyrim originally launched with like some collisions issues with items ""exploding"" upon entering an area and being sent in every direction possible and clipping through doors when entering. Now these for the most part don't ruin the game really at all but the only thing that remains broken in both versions of the game now is Dragonborn. It is still an absolute mess and requires the use of the console just to fix the quests and advance. Now with these grievances aside the game does look quite nice the graphical upgrade is noticeable compared to the vanilla and the lighting effects do make a large difference especially in the southern forests of Falkreath at night. If you did not recieve it for free for owning the collection I would still say it's worth it just because it is still Skyrim but yes overall it is a small upgrade for the price. 8/10.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I dunno.Now I will give credit where credit is due There were some parts as I explored from an old savegame that DID look different. The character models are noticeably smoother. The fire looks cooler. There's a couple nice lighting effects.But by and large it looks the same as the Ordinary Edition.Downsides I noticed a lot of rings running through everything as I ran around which was not particularly immersive. As I ran through the wilderness in some places I noted that the extra grass shrubs little rocks etc. didn't appear until I got close to them and from a distance everything was flat unlike Ordinary Edition without mods. This was also not particularly immersive. Everything seemed to take a long time to load. Overall performance seemed notably worse even on rather low graphics settings at least when I was in outdoor areas there was a fair amount of general slowness and lag.May or may not be downsides First person view is a bit closer to the ground I think and everything is definitely ""zoomed in"" close up things are REALLY close and you can't see as much of your hands/weapons. This might be confusing to longtime players of the original. Also apparently you now need to have an account with Bethesda in order to use mods. And the main menu doesn't have a link to the options menu which is just dumb IMO but that's a minor point.In summary Updated graphics in some areas that are not that special is the only upside that I noticed. Performance was worse than vanilla Ordinary Edition and I'd say slightly worse than heavily modded Ordinary Edition as well though that varies depending on how much save bloat you have. I did not pay anything for this game and I'm glad I didn't. If you already have Skyrim don't waste your money on this. If you don't well both are about the same price so pick whichever you want.

2017-04-22,0,0,404,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I spent over 1 000 hours playing the original on Steam and thousands more hours on Xbox 360. It was my first Elder Scrolls game and after playing all of them from Arena to Oblivion it's still my favorite and the one game I always come back to after I tire of others.The Special Edition does not dissapoint either. It seems a bit underwhelming to some veteran players because the most noticible new feature the improved graphics have been available through mods for a long time. What I think is much more important is the improved stability. After 20 30 hours into a game the original Skyrim would start suffering all sorts of weird glitches and crashes and mods would often bring that on much sooner. Then there was the constant crashing from running out of RAM an other limitations of the original 32 bit build.Special Edition fixes this and while I'm still waiting for my favorite mods to update a lot of really great content has already been updated or made newly for the Special Edition.Disclaimer I did receive this game for free because I already owned Legendary Edition. If it had not been free I probably would be more critical of the lack of new content and the new mechanism that disables acheivements if you're using mods.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Not much of a difference tbh and having this game compared to the older game doesn't really make a difference to PC players because we could probably make the original look better than this with mods. I just think remastering it was a good business decision for Bethesda because of the current generation console players (PS4 + XBONE). Allowing them to play such a good game is a great decision and it could also entice those who had Skyrim on last gen who have then upgraded to buy it again and play it. If you're on PC and you didn't get it for free like most did I wouldn't buy it.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
2016-10-28,0,0,437,False,Recommended,"Heya All I am very happy for this update. I have played with Vanilla Skyrim SE and like what I see so far. However I am tabling it for now until some mods I like get converted. I beat skyrim on an un modded playthru during origional release. So I got that feel already. These days I prefer the modded experiance for some aspects of my play thru.SE Pros Updated Base World Graphics Asthetics and ENB (lighting). Seems to be nicer and more true to Bethesda fantasy but with better graphics. So possibly may not need as many visual mods. Played for a short while looked at many world textures and I personally am happy. Engine Converted to 64 Bit allowing game and some mods to function better on current PCs. This paves the way for potentially new mods that can do much more than before. Thats up to the creativeness of the community though.SE Cons ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" was not integrated into the base game to my knowledge. I do not know if Bethesda performed any offical bug fixes to the base game or not. But my hunch is we will still need the ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" to fix alot of things in the world. Some players have tried the patch on Skyrim SE but it seems to cause problems. So we need to wait for the mod to be updated to work better with Skyrim SE. Old textures on Armors weapons equipment house hold objects dungeon objects and thousands of other items don't look updated to me. Looking forward to the Static Mesh improvement mod HD weapon/Armor mods to be converted to Skyrim SE. Not looking for non skyrim items/equipment meshes. Just would like higher quality meshes for existing skyrim equipment. Kinda the bridge between lore friendly and better looking. Not older PC friendly. If you ran Skyrim on High/Ultra 5 6 years ago you might be at low/Medium settings today with Skyrim SE. If you've updated your computer since then like I did. You might still be at High/Ultra. No NPC or Character mesh/skin updates. Still have origional character looks/feels. Will need modding to touch up some people. Waiting for CBBE to be converted... Don't judge me... &gt .&gt Many older Mods may never work again unless the Mod Author comes back to update it or another mod author takes over the project and tries to update it.Other Notes PC Performance. Some users are reporting sinificant performance issues with their computers. When they list their system specs and I compare it to mine sometimes we're fairly similar. Yet I am not noticing any visual or perfomance issues. My rig is a Win 10 PRO i7 6700k 32GB ram GeForce GTX 970 and Samsung Evo 850 SSDs. Some users are reporting Bugs with the starting scene on the cart. No mods yet the cart still flips the fraq out or the Horses get in the way during the execution scene. Hopefully a bugfix will come for that soon. Mod Development will take time folks. Its up to you to decide if you want to play a limited mod experiance or wait for a while. thank you all and I hope you enjoy the updates and updated mods. Good luck Mod Makers.

No one is making you play this and if it's bothering you so much steam has a feature where they can remove certain games from your library. This wasnt meant to add content i do agree that it could of fixed some of the bugs but I'm happy they didn't. It just makes the game a tad bit more nostalgic. Did they have to do it? No they didn't. And the port to the new engine just makes it more beautiful and immersive. Take it as you will. It's literally the SAME game with the SAME content as The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim released in 2011. It just looks better and that is what they were marketing about it. Personally I really like that Bethesda did this and I honestly hope they do this with Morrowind and maybe even Oblivion.And before I forget YOU GOT THIS FOR FREE YOU IDIOTS SO SHUT UP.

2016-10-30,0,0,153,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Seeing so many people spitting venom at this special edition I'm a little dumbfounded.Why do they hate it so much Mods are now incompatible Bugs are still there Saves incompatibility because of mods Bethesda wants moneyWell first of all that's true mods played a hell of a lot in the popularity of Skyrim. They're awesome and indispensable. Without them Skyrim would never be the same. And now they're all broken in this special edition.But they're currently being modified to be compatible it's only been launched 3 days ago and a lot of those awesome mods are already available... So we can expect before long if not all but at least a big majority of the most popular ones to arrive on this version.Then Skyrim was always bugged as hell and this version is not an exception from what people say. However we can expect updates and bug fixes. On this point I have yet to play it enough to talk more about it.Another point was that saves which use mods might be incompatible and that's a shame. But on another hand you can't really expect anyone to give you a warranty on something completely different from what they provided you. And about Bethesda wanting more money. Well as most people on PC we received it for FREE because we loved the game and that's why we bought the 3 DLCs (even though I don't really consider Heartfire as a real DLC). Not only that it's a completely separate installation so if you want to keep your skyrim modded like crazy with your old characters you can play with them without any kind of problem or conflict. And the saves are also separated you only have to copy/paste them to play with your characters on the special edition (at least if you deactivated your mods and saved before). So why would you complain ? And also this special edition is a great way for those who never played this title to start. And I still believe 40e for getting everything is really not a lot for what this game has to offer on the opposite of several other titles where the price never went down with the time the price of skyrim was always reduced to the point of having it at 15e without sales.Now about what they added well mainly they improved the performances. Comparison just came out and the special edition performs better them the old one on the same configuration without mods. Hence you can expect to be able to mod this version more heavily before having performance issues. And that's something I'm waiting for. They also improved the graphics in comparison to the base game and I have to say from the little bit I played it does look good. I was never fan of big ENBs and prefered using IMAGINATOR so it's what I like to play. However for those who like to play with ENBs one of Fallout 4 is already available on the nexus and we can expect a lot more in the coming days. And for those who nerver played this game or don't like using mods it's a really good improvement.In conclusion I do believe this special edition is a good thing. It will help us mod skyrim to a new level and also adds some pretty nice features in addition.PS for those who use laptops if you're encountering stutters you might want to check if you launched the game with your chipset and not with your graphic card and if that's the case force the card to be used.

I have full faith however that pretty soon (once SKSE and SkyUI come out) all the mods really worth downloading will be on the Skyrim SE Nexus. Now if you've played the game before I would still buy it but not at full retail. Wait for a sale by then alot of mods will be out. What alot of people forget to point out is that not only is Skyrim SE a graphical improvement but it is also 64 bit meaning mods will be able to do bigger and better things with upgraded software and more RAM to work with. The game will be more stable and crash less even if you have mods galore. Very soon I think this game will be significantly better than the 32 bit version considering the move to 64 bit architecture.

I get it. Some mods are gamebreaking...but so is the ability to use console commands.Some such as myself only use mods that give the equivalent of Survival Mode.My character's need to have warmth and food should not kill my ability to earn acheivements.So while I am 99% happy with SE...that 1% is left to be disappointed that I have to choose between immersion and achievements.

Honestly a serious let down The difference between this and regular skyrim edition is that this version uses a very basic ENB setting it has Skyrim Flora overhaul lite lite version and i think a 2k texture mod instead of standard..The interface for addons in game is an improvement but in the long run there's way to many mods missing atm for it to be valuable. Also.On to the largest Issue I had with this...&gt &gt &gt Spoilers Below this &lt &lt &lt No Mods installed just booted up on ultra settings and starting a new game.The usual Cart you start on not sure if it happened to anyone else but mine did a 360 flyby of the world just shortly before arriving into Helgen. After that conundrum I got off my trusted cart and was greeted by a Horse that was stuck out of place idling in front of me. Legit a horse staring me in the face! Not to mention that the horse took up Hadvars spot so Hadvar kept circling the horse while reading his standard script dialog. After finishing creating my character the game runs nicely forward no big issue here some smaller AI screwups that normally happen when they get stuck on different objects here and there.After entering the Helgen Keep with Ralof and going into the Torture chamber there's the option to lockpick a cell to find a corpse and some items. Upon opening this cage the corpse proceeded to ragdoll the out of the cage flying about like a madman before settling down halfway through the wall.. After this incident it was pretty much smooth sailings until I arrived at the large room just before the drawbridge to the end cave.Here 1 of the archers decided gravity was not his deal and flew up halfway into the ceiling and proceeded to suffocate and die. after clearing the room he was still stuck up there in the ceiling.Moving forward into the area with the drawbridge Ralof goes up and pulls the lever afterwards he starts levitating up into the ceiling and flies over the drawbridge area into the cave area bouncing up and down slightly along the way.Confunded by this behaviour as I follow him into the cave when I take my first step on the drawbridge I am forcepushed forward about halfway over the bridge getting confused I back up towards the Keep dungeon again but I am met with an invisible wall and the bridge decides to become liquid form and I just fall through it.After this it was pretty normal up until the bear part which as the true basterd I am decide to sneak shoot him with my newly recieved long bow the Bear decides standing isn't enough but he flies up into the air a few meters and floats towards me with a savage roar... Screaming in fear of flying bears I run around like a crazy person shooting all my arrows into it hoping to kill it but it seems the hitbox of the bear was left on the ground because Ralof starts hitting the air and eventually the bear dies...At this point I'm very confused how this actually got released.. and after getting out of the cave I save and exit vowing to never try to best flying evil bears again.Hope you found it helpful.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-29,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Before we start I got this game for FREE. Think of it what you want but this may be somewhat of a biased review judging by the fact that I got this game for no cost but I will try to keep it as balanced as possible and address the views as if I was someone purchasing it. For free this game is a great add on to the original game. You get better looking graphics better looking trees better water and an amazing depth of field option. However the dissapointing factor is that some of the major bugs of the old Skyrim haven't been fixed such as the buggy physics that occur when you run the game at anything over 60 frames. You would hope that Bethesda would fix these issues that hundreds of mods were made to fix instead of focusing corely on the graphic enhancement but sadly that isn't the case. All in all the Special Edition removes the need for many ENB's and High Texture Pack mods but many of the bugs still aren't fixed. If you are able to get it for free through owning the old Skyrim as well as all of the DLC's then I would definitely recommend downloading it. If you are a new player to skyrim looking to buy this game I would wait and see what they do with it. I am giving this game a thumbs up because in my perspective I enjoy because it's free but there are still issues with it at release.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

If you're not one for dedicating mods into skyrim on the pc plateform for HEAVY graphical improvements then this is worth getting the rest of the dlc imo to get this free version. However if that deal is over i would strongly recomend just buying the original and mod it anyway. It can become a passion but thats not for everyone and i understand that. Personally I prefer the overall look of skyrim special edition over the current mods plus the fact that it is MUCH more stable even without mods. No crashes so far it has God Rays which no modder has made yet which is a nice touch and everything runs smoothly together. If you only need another dlc to finish off the deal i reccomend it.

A great remaster for an already great game getting mods for this game could not have gotten any easier as you can now install them from the game (though it was already quite easy using nexus mod manager). The graphics are great overall though you can achieve higher using ohter mods (currently not available in the special edition). I played skyrim when it originally came out and it is refreshing to replay it again it doesnt feel old at all. Alduin looks amazing as well as guilds such as the dark brotherhood thieves guild and the companions in whiterun. I highly reccomend downloading the unnofical patch notes from the mod menu in the main menu of the game they work perfectly and does not require you to wait for the develepors to fix. I am quite dissapointed they didnt add and extra quests or DLC but that is exactly why they are allowing you to easily the install the mods. Although the arent out yet i highly suggest you download the following mods FalskaarUnnoficial patch notes (is currently available)the grey cowl of nocturnal (i believe it is called) Legacy of the DragonbornOverall a great experience from the time i played i can easily see myself playing 60+ hours.

The depth of field blurring has been interesting as well.Pleased that an update has FINALLY fixed the alt+tab issue so you can minimize your game pretty worry free now which is nice.My biggest thumbs down for the remastered game is that they didn't really do much to enhance the ground environment. The trees and plants (not all) still have a very...choppy and 2 D feel to the foliage/flowers which I was hoping would've changed. Still some silly glitchy things like NPCs standing inside of solid stone structures but that kind of stuff is laughable and doesn't ruin anything.If you have the option to get this for free do it. It's not a disappointment in that aspect. Not sure I'd really be tossing out so much money for basically a giant texture overhaul though. From what I've gathered mods for the original version can do an even better job (I play un modded)...UNLESS you've never played any of the DLC which is included in this version. The extra bits do make for a fun and interesting edition to the game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

There is a reason why it came free for those who already own the full Skyrim game. I mean come on you got it for free why are you complaining? It is a great game still one of my absolute favorite and it looks stunning regardless of whether the original looks better with mod or not. Like I said this game is designed for Xbox One and PS4 it is not meant to blow the roof off for PC gamers. With that being said this is still a great experience and I recommend this for anyone who got it for free. Now whether if you should purchase it on Steam or not that is completely up to you. I don't think this game has any real values on PC hence the free upgrade. Anyways do what you must. Still a great game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-28,1,1,27,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. First of all everyone who gave this a negative review knows absolutely nothing about modding or what this this release will actually do for this game.It is sad to see that this has a ""mixed"" review pool on Steam already. I don't usually give a about reviews but I didn't expect you people to shut down this. Not because I love skyrim but because this is literally the best thing that could possibly happen to this game and I'll explain why below First of all this game looks AMAZING for a base version. There are so many people in here on it because (read this in Cartman's voice) ""I already have a modded version and it looks like this already. This is so stupid blah blah"". Let me explain to those of you idiots that gave this a bad review on the first day you exactly what Skryim Special Edition does for the modding community and what this game will become in the next 3 months if not sooner.Skyrim Special Editions main focus was not to put in a few new bushes give the game a new shine and greater viewing distance. That's a bonus. What they actually did here was repackage the game so that it can be executed in 64 bit. They also unlocked and fixed the RAM capabilities. What this means for those of you that don't understand is that this game is now so much easier to mod so much easier to work with and so much more optimized for the future. SO in retrospect all of those beautiful mods that you've seen for the original Skyrim that WILL be redone in due time will be TWICE if not TRIPLE as beautiful and nearly LIMITLESS in capability.. I can't stress enough how important this is. We're basically starting a whole new generation of mods for arguably the most modable game of all time and with it comes a staggering amount of possiblity..So don't just load up the game see that it's the same thing with a few new shiny upgrades and on bethesda and future players that actually read reviews by giving it a bad review. You must understand that they were not just releasing this to make you think the ing trees are prettier. Why do you think they gave it away?? It was to plant the seed of the Skyrim Craze all over again. And trust me this is about to get un ing real.10/10 would rant again",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-28,0,0,90,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Finally! Here it is. The ""new"" Skyrim. First off i would like to mention that I played Skyrim on the PS3 since 11 11 11. After a few years I got an old quad core pc and put a gtx660 in it I started with the Legendary Edition of Skyrim. It worked fine. HD Textures a few mods and I had an easy 60fps on ultra. Nowadays I have an i5 6600k gtx 960 4gb and 16gb ddr4 ram. I could not wait for this game so I got scared when i read the first few reviews. Starting the game it choose ultra settings. After the intro chapter i immediatly started wandering Skyrim. Outside in 3rd person mode and running around with a low sun i have between the 35 45 fps. So i wonder wich graphic card the other users use. Recommended is a 780 and with a quick look it looks like it is better than my 960. Anywho inside a dungeon or building it hits a steady 60fps. So please tell us wich gpu you are using just to know a bit better where the bottleneck lies. For the game itself (i just played for 1 hour now) i could say it is not a big difference. Just like other reviews the lightning effects the water effects and some bloom and flowers are nicer than vanilla. But if you walk past a nice piece of stone shining in the darkest dungeon you will see that the textures arent that nice. I could say they didnt even put the HD texture pack from the original in this game. (please correct me if i'm wrong) The quests are the same well the whole game is the same for that matter. Even the strange things like sneaking trough a dungeon spotting an enemy ready your bow and when you shoot the arrow the enemy moves almost a meter to the side without moving a muscle. I mean come on if this is the level of this ""special edition"" or whatever you like to call it its a shame. Just putting some mods togheter with a 5 year old game isn't doing anything nowadays. I am sure there are a lot more bugs or glitches in the game. They where in the original and if I see after an hour that there are still a few bugs then i believe all of them are still in the game. So maybe just maybe you should buy the original instead of this special edition. Don't forget after the announcement of the special edition all the other skyrim editions rise in price. If you don't like to mess with mods or whatever buy this game...in the sale... For the 10 euro more then the original you could better buy this version. And from now each evening I will pray to the Nine Divines that the Moddcloaks will rise up and modd this game just like the original version. I hope if i dont get lost in Skyrim i update my review. But for now i will recommend this game. Just because it is in my top 5 of best games ever. And hopefully yours too. PS bethesda THANK YOU! for this free game! I really appreciate it. But please come with some updates for the people who cannot play this game like they should with there specs. And please don't be a little tiny bit lazy next time and fix some bugs and some animations from the characters. it brings me back for like 4 years or something.But still try this.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Maybe not worth the full price compared to the old Skyrim but the game at least is definetely better than the original. If you got it for free it is worth to change from the original to this one even if you have to say goodbye to a few mods temporarily. (You can just wait for them to be remade on the SE version) If you're trying to decide wich one to buy i would recommend this one a lot more than the old one.

Okay first of all I'm sick of hearing all this whining just because your potato that you have updated your drivers on in 10 years won't run the game at 144fps doesn't mean you have to on the game. First of all I'd like to say this game is way more stable and better looking then the original skyrim and it was nice to recieve this for free as a long time skyrim fan. What's new you may ask? I'd like to address that this game is not a remaster so the content does not change but what does change are the graphics. The graphics are way more smoothed out and are higher quality textures then what they used to be the lighting and godray effects are awesome and make this game outstanding from what it used to be. There's people whining about how they compressed audio files which they did but the characters in the games sound exactly the same this also goes to the music and other sounds. The cons of this game are being so stretched out it's not funny. The greatest thing about this game is they converted Skyrim to 64 bit which means the game is not going to crash if you have half the mods on the Nexus installed and it also means the game won't suffer from too many items in one room moving. It basically increases the amount of RAM your game takes in. I will say something I don't like is the bethesda mod support replacing the Workshop but honestly they almost follow the exact same rules so it's not a huge problem.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I have already unsubscribed from all the mods to play the new skyrim because I thought just a small upscale in the textures would still support the mods but it apears they no longer want steam workshop. Overall it was a free upgrade so I can't really complain but all I can say it it runs like a charm on amd systems. I'm using a r9 280x and i have 60 fps even with 50 dragons on the screen.

2016-10-30,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"I can sum up what's wrong with this game in one sentence so bear with me as I explain that sentence. ""There is no native Linux client"" A significant number of developers publishers and gamers read a sentence like that and simply dismiss it out of hand for a variety of reasons with none of those reasons being valid. The point of developing a Linux client for any game or any software package is not for fiscal return in sales nor just for community goodwill. It isn't to showcase technical prowess or to grow a new market. Not is it just to hush up a very vocal stastical minority of players.The point of developing for Linux is that it enforces Good Coding Practices. Applications that are cross developed for Linux and Windows sets a number of high barriers a developer must address. One of those barriers is code documetation. With multiple operating systems in play code must be well documented so that anybody else reading the code later will know what the original developer intended.Developing with cross platform targets in mind from the start also forces the developer to avoid Operating System specific functions. Developers also have an incentive to avoid Operating System specific API's. Native cross platform development also makes it more likely that the developer will leverage more robust development tools check more of the code for errors before compiling get more detailed reports afterwards on what broke during compiling and ultimately produce cleaner code as a result. Native cross platform development forces developers especially game developers to actually test their shader code on a variety of different hardware types. Supporting AMD alone for example could mean making sure OpenGL and Vulkan shader code runs under as many as 4 different drivers. The more physical graphics cards a developer tests against in house and the more drivers against which those graphics cards are tested make it far more likely that bad or error'd code will be noticed and can be corrected. The sheer scale scope and ambition that Bethesda puts into their games is only matched by what appears to be the sheer scale and scope of Bethesda's apathic coding practices. Bethesda games are legendary for massive bugs glitches and any number of wide ranging issues that would normally spell death for any other developer. From what I've experienced players love Bethesda games because there's something to those games that is more compelling than the broken clients used to play those games.For years players have begged Bethesda to open up their game clients under Open Source licenses. For years players have begged Bethesda to let the players fix those game clients at the code level not at some downloadable mod level. For years Bethesda has responded with a flat ""No"" I harbor no doubt that if Bethesda had released the Fallout 4 engine under an Open Source license and let the player base bring Skyrim into that engine then there would have been something special. There wouldn't have been sound files that were compressed using some well let's just leave it at noting that the sound is not compressed using a format from Xiph. There wouldn't have been texture packs that were left untouched. There wouldn't have been broken shader codes. If anything it's likely that the extremely talented player base would have ported the graphics code into Vulkan.When I saw Skyrim Special Edition land with no native Linux client as a Zero Day Launch I knew without even checking anything else or even loading the game up that Bethesda hadn't followed coding practices. I knew just from the lack of a product that the code probably had not been tested on a wide range of hardware or driver sets. I knew that Bethesda probably hadn't used platform agnostic development tools and likely had a wide range of Operating System workarounds black boxes and kludges in the ported game. Other developers might want to take notes. Supporting Linux platforms during the product development process as a cross compile with Windows isn't just to make the fan base feel good. It's a very practical and very effective method at making sure that when the product launches... it's a product that works. Not one that locks up and does nothing for hours on end.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

While I normally will play at 1080p Medium settings (which results in between 45 and 60fps ) playing on Ultra sets it between 30 and 40.UPDATE 3 Can now play at 900p Ultra with a more than adequate frame rate.

Really don't see the problems people have with this There's a lot of improved stuff in this game (except the bugs but I'm talking about the engine. For the people crying about mod support it'll always take a while and this version will be a LOT better than the original 32 bit Skyrim. One of the main reasons why this version is a lot better already is cause of the variable FPS. youre not forced to play at 60fps all the time like you did before really good for people with high refreshrate monitors. I'm pretty sure a lot of people will disagree with me but I'm just stating facts. If you have problems with the bad textures just mod them right now Bethesda has confirmed that all old texture and mesh mods are working with this version.Pros64bit / DX11 surely a lot better for mods than 32bit and DX9Unlocked FPS just think about the physics that glitched heavily in 32 bit when uncapping the FPS with the config file.Few environmental additions and improved lighting.ConsExactly the same game without any bug fixes at all. There obviously won't be any new content though.The last time I played Skyrim was on it's release on the Xbox 360 and it's really refreshing to play the somewhat remaster.

2016-10-27,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Do you like Skyrim or have you always wanted to try Skyrim and have been waiting for the perfect edition? Well this is the one to get.It looks better plays better and works better than the previous edition. Mod support is baked into the game so you can load mods in a manner similar to the way they do it in Fallout 4. There's an actual Mod menu in the game and getting mods is as easy as scrolling around picking the mods you want and clicking a button. You don't have to dink around with the Nexus and manual installation nor do you even need to worry about the Workshop on Steam. It's really very nice to just load and go. The Vanilla version of the game without mods looks fantastic. I'd say it's comparable to the previous edition with some heavy graphics mods but the bonus here is that this doesn't compromise your PC as much. The Special Edition is designed to take advantage of Windows 10 and manage memory a lot better. If you're on a 64 bit system with a bunch of RAM you'll finally get to use it. The end result? A gorgeous game that doesn't crash because of memory holes or other weird issues. There's nothing new here in terms of content. It's the full package of Skyrim with all DLC but they didn't add any new areas or quests. The towns and villages all look fantastic with new plants and improved textures but there are no new secrets to unlock. The landscape is covered with more grass more flowers more plants thicker trees and really excellent lighting and shadows but you won't find any new caves or castles. This is just the ultimate version of a game you've probably already played for hundreds of hours. That said Skyrim really is another life and a way to just wander around in a new world for hours on end and this is the most immersive gorgeous way to do it without going through the technical tweaking of old style modding. Yes you can get more mods (at the time of this writing) for the previous edition and do a lot more graphics wise with those mods but they are harder to install and each one takes a toll on the game's performance and might potentially lead to frequent crashes. If you want to skip all that the Special Edition is a great compromise. While the PC version of Skyrim Special Edition won't be as much of a surprise in terms of graphical improvements as compared to the console versions (which are vast improvements over the last gen hardware's graphical capabilities) it's still the most simple way to get into Skyrim with the best possible graphics and most stable engine on a modern PC. Future mods will no doubt make the game even more attractive and now those mods can take advantage of the memory and power available to them. I dig it. I mean it was free anyway so what's not to like? You should definitely download this one though whether you're a new player or an old hand.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Now that the price has been lowered from its original 60 dollar price I can for sure say it is worth it to grab this game if you didn't get it for free for having the Legendary Edition of Skyrim.As far as modding go the in game mod loader is pretty decent. If you play Fallout 4 its essentially the same format. Also locks achievements however which is easily mendable with a couple added files. The modding community for this version suffers due to the lack of SKSE support. There is no foreseeable release date for the 64 bit version of skyrim script extender and thats a fairly large issue for people that relied on a couple big name mods in the previous version (SkyUI to name one.)Aside from that the game runs great and was well optimized.

Skyrim S E works with my game saves from the original Skyrim. Just copy and paste the files from the one save games folder into the other. You don't have to restart the game from the beginning. Also on Steam this game can use Steam Cloud to backup your game saves in case your hard drive crashes.Skyrim is the best game of it's type. It is a first person (and/or third person) adventure game set in a medieval fantasy world with magic dragon's elves and other mythical creatures. This game has a story line based on games of the Elder Scrolls series Morrowwind Oblivion and Skyrim.. However you are not stuck to the story line were you move from one battle to the next with some story line to tie them together. You can wander around on it's open world / sandbox map choosing which quests to do and when. If you can't win a boss battle you can do other things then come back when you are tuffer.Not only is it a stable high end game 10/10 in it's standard ( vanilla/ un modded ) version. but there are 1000's of mods you can add to the game to change almost anything you can think of. This makes the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series twice as good. Below is the Nexus website link were you can get game mods the tools to install them and make your own mods.

It's expensive. It's just shy of being a full priced game. I don't necessarily agree with this but I accept it because of the reasons mentioned below.I am putting my review up recommending skyrim special edition because Skyrim and it's DLC has been on sale for almost no money multiple times for years. Even as part of the marketing campaign for the Special Edition Skyrim and it's DLC was put on sale so that people who were missing certain DLC or wanted a cheaper upgrade could get that upgrade at a significant discount. I feel the effort made by Bethesda to accommodate PC players leading up to this release cancels out the vocal minority who missed news and updates about the arrangement and are now complaining about the price on PC.Also a side note about the console versions. I feel like the console version is reasonably priced. Modded Skyrim for PC is one thing but to bring Skyrim back on consoles with impressive visual upgrades and mod support is huge. It looked average compared to PC on the PS3 and 360.The effort was made for PC players to get this upgrade for free or at a discount because to us it's not really much of an upgrade. Some people didn't get around to preparing for the upgrade and will now bitterly have to cash out full price if they wanna play now or wait for it to go on sale.

This is still the original Skyrim + DLCs but it looks and feels much better. Highly recommend if you were a fan of the original version like me. PREVIOUS REVIEWSPlayed through the opening scene early today and experienced some serious issues. No full on crashes but I was experiencing some nasty FPS drops down to 7 8 from 110 for seemingly no reason. It happened specifically when the dragon comes down when you're about to get beheaded and while you're making your escape during character creation and in the catacombs. I was able to kind of hack my way around this by Shift+Tab opening the Steam Overlay briefly and that would bring the frames back up for a little bit.Skyrim is one of my favorite games ever and I will 100% play this but I'd wait to buy if you haven't until Bethesda can fix this and the other issues being reported.Update November 18 2016The framerate bug still exists bug crashes seem to have gone away for the most part. I've moved to the beta patches and would recommend those for everyone experiencing similar issues to me. Also I have found a workaround for the framerate drops. Go into your Nvidia Control Panel and under 3D Settings &gt Manage 3D Settings Program Settings &gt Sykrim Special Edition (full path of executable) Change ""Monitor Technology"" from ""Use global settings"" to ""Fixed Refresh"". You'll be capped at 60fps but it makes the game playable.Update November 24 2016Haven't been able to get a consistent 144fps for some reason but I think it may be due to the game not picking up the display adapter settings for whatever reason.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-11-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,This is coming from someone who already has 700 hours in TES Skyrim Legendary Edition (LE).Skyrim Special Edition is basically Skyrim with all the DLC's wrapped into one package and a graphics update from what I can tell. How can I tell that the graphics are updated? When I had the LE of Skyrim I usually played with mods that increased UI elements as well as certain aspects of the textures like blood. Now the graphics update that I am referring to is that the worlds seems to be more alive than it was in previous editions of Skyrim. Another plus is that from what I've read the graphics engine has been updated to use DX11 and from my experience it runs very smooth now compared to the older versions. Pros +All DLC s available as well as the High Resolution DLC. +DX11+Defacto modding version now+Updated graphics+All the pluses of Skyrim are combined into this as well. +From what I ve experienced the load times are much faster however this could be because the game is now on my SSD.+From what I've experienced the game is much more stable than the old Skyrim was.Cons No Steam Workshop integration yet Some bugs remain Duel casting bound weapons are still automatically set to the left hand Dragon fights are still bland,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

For the people new to Skyrim buy this and see yourself lose at least hundreds of hours in the game. Top notch RPG.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
2016-10-28,0,0,72,False,Recommended,So... yeah. Skyrim Remastered is basically the same game as the original version launched in 2011 but with some nifty new graphical effects and the DLC already bundled in. Textures actually seem to be... average at best but mods should correct that in time.The new graphical effects could be achieved on the original game by using mods but their quality varied and performance tended to tank depending on what you were you using. A powerful enough computer could have the OG game looking better than this remaster but more likely than not would have worse performance.Speaking of mods they changed the standard way to use mods! To something far worse. Now you download mods in game and need a Bethesda account to do so. The interface for selecting the mods is the same as on the consoles(I'll get to that) and are ill fitted to navigate with a keyboard and mouse. Also using mods disables achievements.Thankfully Nexus Mods has already updated their Mod Manager to support this new version and there's already file to enable achievements on modded playthroughs.Quite honestly this version doesn't feel rushed or badly ported but its focus is clearly on updating the game to the new generation of consoles and also allowing mods to be used on them. The PC version isn't unnecessary but it is certainly less than it could/should have been.That being said this version IS 64 bit and in time should allow for more things to be done in the game especially once the Scrypt Extender gets a new version. THEN we'll have something truly special in our hands.Owners of the old version and it's DLCs were given this new version for free so I won't complain but until the mods from the old version are properly ported over and/or new mods are made that take advatange of the 64 bit executable the original game CAN look better with the right mods and will have the same content. Recommended but for newcomers stick to the old version for now. I will update this review in case this situation ever changes.Here's to another 100 hours in Skyrim,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2016-10-28,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I have only played it for a little bit so i do not know everything...First off i'd like to point out that Steam/Bethesda was generous in giving this game for free to those who already have the game + all the DLCs. It made me download it immediately and try it out.From what i've seen so far is that the graphics are improved... yet only the enviroment. The rocks boulders roads trees caves etc. all look better than in the original game. It is easy to notice and it does make the game look nicer than before. HOWEVER..... that is basicly the only thing that is improved. The enviroment got an update and that is it.(I noticed the following... maybe others will notice things i didn't or disagree with me) The characters still look basicly the same... with maybe the faces being a bit smoother. Wood as in houses and wooden structures/objects still look the same or there is little improvement. Weapons/armour still look the same. Hair looks the same. No improvement when it comes to clipping (objects passing through each other.... the guy who got executed before you sunk half through the ground) No smoother gameplay... as in it is still heavily scripted and the character's dialogues still don't smoothely follow up on each other.Despite the little changes for some reason it takes up massive amounts of memory and i get lag all the time. I run Skyrim with tons of mods without a problem and here i can't run low quality normally. Not sure if that is my fault or the game not allotting memory properly.In the end it is still the exact same game. Would i play it because it got a bit of an upgrade? No i would rather play Skyrim with tons of mods than a remastered version without them. Maybe i'll check out more of the game later but for now i'll go back to the original game.I would not reccomend it but purely because there are too few changes to make a real difference. You can try it out and see for yourself but from what i have seen so far.... nah... no thanks.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

It's always a game you can come back to. I've played it since the Xbox 360 in 2011 and the game itself is one of the most immersive I have ever played in my life (which is a big deal for me to say) and the content in this game can make you smile frown laugh shake your head in disbelief and many other emotions. You can do things that make you feel completely all powerful feel like the richest man in the world or make you feel downright diabolical. This game basically just a graphically updated verison of the original which is great for those that haven't played it yet but so so for those that have as much more was possible graphically with mods on the original. However the best way to look at this for veteran players is think of the new engine this verison is built on. The possibilties and stability of mods from the original game or completely new ones will be much easier to achieve and realize. Once again this game will become like wine and will only better with age thanks to the mods with the main game still offering 100s of hours for anyone. Overall this game will forever be among my most coveted of games that I will always recommend. Although the bugs of the old version are still present again mods already are taking care of that. One of the best things a game can do is make you feel like you're in the world itself feel like your character is you and what you do has an impact or makes you FEEL something period. And this game does that.Here's to another 5 years of Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Sure it doesnt have the realistic graphics like my modded version does but it least its more stable and crashes less. As far a adressing the complaints those who say that their framerate is terrible porbably have less that desireable computers. the recommendation is a 780 so im not sure. I personally have a 980 ti but im not overclocking. Im running the game at max settings and im getting well over 60fps. If you dont like the graphics then dont get this and just mod the original.

Running a GTX970 SSC EVGA and still maintain 60fps on Ultra settings however when the game loaded a message popped up saying ""high quality texture pack not supported.""Cons Achievements did not transfer. I read somewhere that it said it would have different achievements. Maybe I was misinformed. But there a long list of achievemntes that are the same and did not transfer over. simple as ""reach level 15"" are greyed out even though I am level 32 lol. Overall I would not recommend paying full price for this game unless you have never downloaded it. Its your money though so do what you want with it. I have not experienced any of the laggy buggy gameplay that other are describing on this thread. Load times are the same and it runs smoothly...so far.

2016-10-28,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Just to clarify this game is amazing If your new to this game and your thinking of getting it just do it. If your returning to this game be warned as obvious as this may be the MODS are NOT Steamworks and DO NOT support SKSE (yet) meaning there will be some time before any UI mods come out (as well as many other types of mods.) As silly as this sounds the base Skyrim UI is just terrible and makes the game for me feel like a console game. SKYUI was and still is the perfect PC Skyrim UI it made playing this on PC a dream. Again thats my opionion dont shoot me. (Also i havent checked the Nexus yet ) )If you just want this because you do like Skyrim then get it as a base game its still an absolute cracker! it looks and plays fantastic.Oh its worth mentioning i have everything cracked on ultra at 4K and i get solid 60fps. Once or twice it has dropped to around 49 but thats only during the intro when everythings going down it really didnt make a difference having sunk hours into the OG version its just nice to see it run like butter. If that matters to anyone take it or leave it. (GTX 980Ti i7 4770k)I also found it funny that the game looks realllllly nice the graphical update is 100% better but the player models still look like over cooked potatos.

But all in all its skyrim in all its beauty. However while I do reccomend this game I do not think it warrents a 40$ purchase if you already own the normal copy of skyrim without the DLCs. This is a great version to buy only if you have never played skyrim. Otherwise keep your old copy and just buy the DLCs. While this game has great graphical improvements I cannot bring myself to tell you to spend 40$ on something you already own.

2016-10-28,0,0,12,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Regarding modsI have 2 000+ hours on the original Skyrim due to the unlimited possibilities of modding. While there is barely anything now I believe this will give way for a promising start to an already matured modding community. In a few years time this might possibly be even better than the current original Skyrim modding scene as the new engine packs more of a punch than the original Skyrim. Hopefully paid mods don't make a come back.Pros +Same game nothing much changed story is the same same bugs same everything physics wonky at 60fps etc+Includes all DLC+Slight graphical upgrade from original vanilla Skyrim+64bit also Alt tab works properly now+Really great potential for future modding sceneCons Why default to a controller? The graphical upgrades does not justify the framerate loss. I know plenty of mods that makes the game x100 visually more appealing and does not shed a single framerate Personally don't use it but Steam Workshop is gone Not really a con but if your a big modder like me the scene is nearly non existent right nowMy opinion on The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special EditionPersonally and in my own humble opinion maybe this version would have benefitted more as a ""console only"" title. By putting it on PC Bethesda has successfully divided the modding community as people will be making mods only for one version and exclusive on the other. Mods with inactive authors won't be able to be ported over to new Skyrim unless someone volunteers to do it. Yes most minor mods can be ported over easily but more complex script orientated or gameplay overhauls will take longer and some mod authors might not even have the incentive to port over.

I want to say that Skyrim Special Edition is a considerable upgrade of the original with way better graphics and enhancements in the vanilla form and now with the constant grouth of the community who keeps porting or re creating MODs from the original Skyrim into the Special Edition this is litteraly the Skyrim to play from now one. The old version will most likely become obsolete soon.There's a lot of bugfixes and waaaay more stability I experienced only bugs and/or glitches caused by my improper installation of MODs or their load order. The vanilla game works flawlessly and if you mod it well you'll have no problem whatsoever.

The updated graphics textures and lighting etc. is a major improvement over the original release. For those of us who spend hours modding our Elder Scrolls games it may not be immediately apparent just how much of an improvement this release actually is. Take a moment to compare the original vanilla release and this new release and you'll see for yourself. This game will only continue to improve as mods new and old are created and updated for this version of Skyrim and you will find yourself returning time and again to play.I have nominated this game for the Just Five More Minutes Steam Award as I've often found myself playing the game into the small hours of the night.If you enjoy exploring an open world in a Nordic fantasy setting then you can't go wrong with The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I was hoping the graphics would actually improve and that modding would still be an option. Mods aside the game is fantastic still and has a new beauty to it with the re work. Some people complain that the graphics didn't improve enough but I think that's complete nonsense. Adding modding into the equation I really like the new mod selection system and how it loads/manages them for you. The customisation options are splendid and I couldn't be happier with the new system aside from some old mods being harder to find. This game has had some crashing issues but nothing that can't be 'rolled out' with some updates. And if you aren't constantly quicksaving in Skyrim do you even care what happens?

Bethesda Softworks decision to reintroduce paid mods to Skyrim is their problem and as far as I'm aware Bethesda Game Studio had little to do with E3 this year. Most of it was handled by Zenimax and Softworks. In such a case I do think a lot of people are hating the game studio for a sin they didn't really commit.If you're willing to get past this fact and have a rather decent computer Special Edition is Skyrim but prettier. Of course mod transferals for a lot of popular mods are complete but some of the smaller mods and the unsupported aren't. I recommend this product simply because it is not a bad game. Bethesda SOFTWORK's decision to do this to Bethesda GAME STUDIO's product is indeed moronic and a corporate failure.

2017-10-04,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. TL DRDecent changes to an already good game but Bethesda deserves a thumbs down for stabbing their customers in the back... twice! If you wanna know what they really done to earn the hatred against them then make sure of reading the rest of the review. The whole problem started with Bethesda and Valve trying to introduce paid mods back in April 2015. It was a complete disaster. Valve took the whole system pretty much immediatly down due to the massive sh*tstorm the playerbase unleashed.As reaction to it both Valve and Bethesda apologized for it here's Bethesdas reaction ""We have retracted our paid mod programme and do not plan to reintroduce this system again as it was heavily disliked by both users and creators alike. We at Bethesda apologise"" BethesdaWe all know how that turned out right? Not only did they introduce a new paid mod programme but also they didn't really waste much time to work on it. Because with the release of Fallout 4 in November 2015 they laid the first part of the foundation of the Creation Club.By disabling achievements for modded games they made the first attempt to lower the reputation of free mods. Some might argue that there are good reasons for it because with mods you can make it a lot easier to get certain achievments and there were even mods to unlock any of them in an instant. Those arguments really have some good points but if Bethesda wanted to look after ""fair play"" then they should have penalized the use of the console commands too. Since they didn't it should be clear that ""fair play"" wasn't the intention behind this decision and the Creation Club is proof of it. Creation Club mods doesn't disable achievments.Then Skyrim SE got ported to the 64 bit engine of Fallout 4 with the same ""no achievements when modding"" system. And while they tinkered a bit on the graphics I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who thinks that Skyrim SE only got ported for the Creation Club. If they really wanted to create a real Remastered Skyrim and want it to be the successor of one of their most bought games than they would've fixed at least the biggest and worst of the thousands of bugs Skyrim has. But they didn't really fix any bug. In my opinion this is one of the biggest arguments to show that it's solely a rushed port to get another game ready for every platform to bring in the ""big money"" with the help of the Creation Club.Some might say ""But they gifted Skyrim SE to so many PC player that shows that they care for their fans.""Ye... uhm... NO... not really. That's all strategy. Pretty much the same strategy Microsoft did with their Windows 10. Bethesda surely knew that there wouldn't be that much player on PC who would buy the Special Edition when there are that many mods for the old Skyrim available to mod the ever living crap out of it and make it even look far better than Skyrim SE. Because of that they gifted it to every PC player who had the ""Legendary Edition"" (All DLCs) of Oldrim. Like I said similar tactic as Microsoft give the new version away for free to make more money afterwards. MS does it with selling the spied data and Bethesda tries it with the Creation Club.""But you don't have to buy from the Creation Club it's completely optional just ignore it.""It's not really that easy. As any publisher/developer is just interested in one thing Making money period. Some others started with those greedy anti consumer tactics a while ago and guess what? Bethesda now tries to hop on that train too. They are trying to use the modding community which keeps their games alive to make money for them. As of now yes we don't have to buy anything but when we don't make a stand it can and most likely will get worse. Do you really think they keep this model of the optional Creation Club in future games? If we don't make a stand then it soon will be ""Game Over"" for free &amp sharable mods. If they get away with the Creation Club it will be CC mods ONLY in future games. The Creation Kit will be locked away behind the Creation Club and/or mods can only be shared via the Creation Club and the price tag Bethesda will put on it. And yes I know that's pretty much the worst case I'm describing but will you really find out if I'm right or not?One big problem is that there are many PS4 player who will buy from the Creation Club because they can't really get mods because of Sonys BS. And of course sadly there are also some naive idiots (sorry but imo they are) who believe in Bethesdas marketing lies.So I beg all of you to stand up and fight against Bethesdas greedy anti consumer tactics and STOP countering this fight just because you don't understand why we are fighting. But here I try to give an explanation to each and everyone. We need to get an even bigger sh*tstorm going than back in 2015 because this time there is no Valve who stops them and they really try to force this BS this time. Some might say we overreact but that's not the case here. Bethesda don't care at all for their fans and they stabbed us in our back for the second time now. They're just sitting it out now and are waiting that the storm of negative comments and reviews calms down. The only reaction they gave to their fans was that they lowered the price tag on the sh*tty Survival Mode in the Creation Club. But they didn't say anything about this huge and obvious sh*tstorm and that exactly tells you how much they care. The price of the Survival Mode was in close to all cases just one little part of the rants against the paid mods as a whole and how damn greedy and out of their mind Bethesda got. But no Bethesda don't say anything about the sh*tstorm and they surely wanna completely ignore it and sit it out. If they would mention or comment it in the slightest it would be all over the Internet via some news sites in no time and boy... that would be bad for them.I hope there are many who will make sure that Bethesda won't forget their bad decision until they hopefully shut down the Creation Club cancer. And if we do not prevail because of Bethesda ignoring us then do the right thing and ignore their games and don't buy any of them as long as they continue their greedy ways!Summary Bethesda f*cked with us back in 2015 apologizes when Valve pulled the string and Bethesda started immediatly to f*ck with us again disabled achievements for modded games in FO4/Skyrim SE are most likely to be sort of a bad reputation for free mods port of Skyrim to 64 bit was just another step to spread the Creation Club to more people gifting Skyrim SE to PC player is just a try to get some of them to Skyrim SE so they can possibly make more money afterwards if we don't make a stand and ignore it OR even counter those who are fighting against it will most likely result in ""Creation Club mods only"" Games in the future We will need everyone in the fight against this anti consumer method because there surely are some people who will buy mods Bethesda ignores the storm of negative comments/reviews and tries to sit it out. if we don't let this sh*tstorm calm down we might have still a chance against those forced paid mods system last but not least Fight with your wallet! If they don't stop ignoring our wish to take down that paid mods system than ignore Bethesdas games tooWow quite a wall of text.

This is what's supposed to be the definitive version of Skyrim with Remastered graphics and various improvements over the original game along with coming pre installed with all addons from the original. That's not to say that this version doesn't come with it's own flaws as well. A number of old bugs from the original still remain and some new ones have been created. When I first installed the game upon release it was REALLY buggy black screen CTDs (Crashes to desktop) and could only when I did manage to get into the game there were flashy light patches everywhere and a nasty 10 15 fps.To fix this Nvidia has released a new driver update which comes with optimization support for Skyrim Special Edition. In addition going into C Users USERNAME Documents My Games Skyrim Special Edition (Or whatever it is for you) and setting the iVSyncPresentInterval value to ""0"" (that's zero without quotes) fixes the problems. I feel the horrible performance issues was due to Steam releasing the game a day early prior to graphics card driver support optimization being released for this game. Basically just update your drivers and disable Vsync from the game's .ini file and you should be fine.Some things to look forward to in this version The original Skyrim was running on a 32 bit engine resulting in a max of 4 GB of RAM usage for mods which was the sole reason why the game gradually became unstable the more mods you had. This version runs on a 64 bit engine holding 16 Exabytes of RAM (which is equal to 16 billion gigabytes) which means the game is more stable and is capable of carrying basically a near infinite supply of mods without crashing. So no need to worry about ridiculously long mod load lists you can indulge and bask in nearly as many mods as you like without worrying about CTDs. For those complaining about mods disabling achievements there's actually already a mod released on Nexus that disables achievement disabling due to having mods. The atrocious load times from the original game have been fixed. Expect less time waiting and more time playing Skyrim. While the original game can still at the current moment look better with ENBs (visual enhancement mods) installed players should remember that this is the BASE GAME. This how beautiful the game looks without any mods imagine the possibilities for when the modding community in this game begins to mature? With the new 64 bit engine this game's modding future looks brightly promising. Players should expect a modding community that will grow exponentially faster than the original.Can't really say the game's full price is exactly ""worth it"" in its current state since the modding community is still premature but if you recieved it for free might as well give it a shot. Try the above optimizations mentioned previously it may or may not help your case.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

2017-07-09,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Along with other dedicated and slightly cultish fans of this amazing videogame series known as The Elder Scrolls it pains me to say thisI'm not going to on bethesda as Skyrim Special Edition was and still is a blessing for all console players. In bethesda's credit they have ventured and battled for the concept (now reality) of mods on console although these mods will never amount to the ubsurdity nor creativity that you can find on PC it gives dedicated fans enough to stay happy and entertained. Although i belive this is a great breakthrough they've made a grave mistake implemeting their mods system into the PC version (and obviously paid mods i am not getting into detail with this as you've probably already seen a paragraph about how this is the coming of satan). Steam workshop was thriving and although we had some hicupps everything got back into fighting form bethesda understandably want to get more users on their platform it's called making profit and growing your mailing list.Here's my problem with most reviewing this product they're focousing on mods and or bethesda although a vital part of the game for many it is not a review about the game it's about the community created content and the worsening ethics of the company behind said game if people reviewed the game for what it is the game then these reviews would be astoundingly positive although there is the far superior and better game (the original skyrim) the only thing that has changed in this game is the mods system wer can all agree on this skyrim is a special game along with the ES series this game hasn't ripped out its beauty nor stupidity thus to me it is a great game although i would pick the original release over this every day it is still worth it if you don't plan on modding your game to hell.I am reccomending this game as it is the game.

2017-01-03,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Game in Brief /b I recieved this free as did everyone who already purchased Skyrim prior to the Special Edition release.Truth is there's only really a small handful of changes to me. The enhanced graphics the replacement of steam workshop with Bethesdas own catalogue of mods on their website and lastly the ability for console players to utilise the mods too rather than them being confined to pc players like usual.Graphics Overhaul /b The graphics are undeniably breathtaking. There's a new abundance of airy atmospheric purity when venturing through the tundra of Skyrim. The immersion doesn't just stop at textural updates either there's an increased wealth of nature both creatures and plants/trees/bushes and so on... Yet I find myself still having to use additional graphic related mods despite the magnificent landscape improvements. For example the water appeared to me as just the same as the normal version of Skyrim as did some other general aspects like the textures of indoor objects for example. Replacement Modding System /b The new mods system could be either viewed as either worse off or just the same as the traditional Steam Workshop but I can't see anyone saying that it's better. Essentially it's just replacing the Workshop with Bethesdas own catalogue of mods. This also means a change to the system of subscribing to mods before starting the game to a system where you essentially do the same except from the modifications section in the start menu before you load your game. So it's different but it's not really that different other than the fact that you have to create an account at Bethesda and start using an additional modding system when the initial one from Steam was just fine. Luckily you could just use Nexus Mod Manager which is good considering that most people used it over steam anyway for the original Skyrim.Bugs /b Finally a lot of people have told of how they are experiencing bugs glitches and so on with the game. So many players reported bugs in the questlines that it gained a reputation after a lot of the bugs ended up being quite funny in the end. I can't say I've had the misfortune (or fortune depending on how you look at it) to experience any major or even minor issues but it's still worth mentioning just in case.Conclusion /b Concluding I don't think it's really worth it for PC players when you could just carry on with the original version of Skyrim and use a combination of ENB mods to make the game look beautiful and carry on with your favourite mods in NMM ignoring the new Bethesda direct modding system. Perhaps that's why they gave it to us for free.For console however it's worth it just for the ability to mod without having to find a special type of console and so on. I just wouldn't pay too much for it to be honest.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This is the best version of Skyrim that exists presently and so if that is what you're seeking you'll find it here.I find people's negative reviews to be rather odd given that this product was very upfront about what it is. This is a re release of Skyrim remastered as 64bit to enhance mod support. It allows for greater object placement greater RAM utilization in a game that historically has been very resource intensive and mod support for systems that previously did not have this option.If you previously owned Skyrim this version was given out free of charge.The game is exactly what it advertises to be and nothing more or less. They ported the game to 64 bit and fudged around with the shaders/FX. All the old bugs are still there as is the Unoffical Patch that fixes them. The negative reviews baffle me particularly the ones bemoaning the lack of an Oblivion or Morrowind remaster. Complaining that a remastered Skyrim isn't a remastered Oblivion/Morrowind is like complaining that your Hamburger isn't Spaghetti. It didn't advertise itself as spaghetti didn't promise to be spaghetti and no reasonable person would begrudge it for not being spaghetti.Reviewing the product on its own merits like a normal person all I can say is that this is Skyrim ported to 64 bit. It has enhanced resource utilization and I was given it free of charge so I'll be playing it. If you like Skyrim this is for you.

However now that Skyrim is on a 64 bit platform the new mods for the game will have far less constraints. If you have an unmodded save however you can directly copy the save into this version and it will work. Honestly asking if you like this version is the same as asking what your favorite color is.

Average It has an intel i7 and 10 gigs of ram It can run PUBG at a solid 25 30 FPS if I have settings at mid low but this game will barely run at 15 FPS. Not to mention the numerous graphical errors! As soon as I started the game up I went to the mods section which you need a Bethesda account or something to use. Then I started up the game and noticed a horrible lag and for some reason random parts of everything would flicker in and out of existance. Not to mention how the game looked like the original Skyrim but the draw distance was worse then your average N64 game with fog everywhere to compinsate! However my biggest problem is the fact that Bethesda had the balls to hide the original Skyrim just so they could charge an extra 20$ for this. I personally reccomend The original Skyrim which can be found Here http //store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/ The original works great and looks better too the only problem is that it does not come with the DLC but I got over that when I saw this pile of garbage.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I coping and pasting my review for the original version my review for this SE version will be at the end ""The best part about this game is you can mod it so its nothing like the base game which is... mediocre. If you have havent played oblivion you were robbed of the ability to know this game is bad but its ok because its not your fault you dont know any better. Still I reccomend this game because there are so many mods there are truly limitless possiblilties While betheda tried their hardest to take the fun out of this game( magic that doesnt scale no spell creation like in oblivion/morrowind no improvement on sword combat removal of agility and hand to hand skills cant use magic and two handed swords at the same time anymore because you have to have magic in your hand now becuase it looks cooler and I cant drink 100 bottles of skooma and vault over an entire city). Moders are the true reason this game deserves to be bought.Also DLC is actually pretty good imo.Seriously dont be an idiot and use the steam workshop for mods use the nexus its 1000x better the steam workshop has about 1/50th of the mods.I give this game 1 circle out of 3""Everything I said still stands. This game currently however lacks a build of the SKSE which is a tool that modders use to create the more complex mods so right now there arent very many good mods because the majority of the ones for the original version cant be ported over yet.However if youre willing to except that than this game loads a ton faster and overall is much more sturdy so it has the potential for more and greater mods.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Then when you feel like there's nothing else to be done you find a few mods to play with and suddenly it can become a whole new experience. After that extended period of fun you'll go play other games for a while. Then you come back and repeat the process forever and ever. At least until you hear from your grandkids that The Elder Scrolls VI is coming.

Yet the graphics are very blurry turning is laggy LOD is too short FOV too narrow picking up objects makes me want to puke. And the bugs are still there e.g. Alt Tab doesn't work properly. I have played the 32 bit version heavily modded for a few thousand hours over the years on a pc built in 2010. It was a lot of fun. The modded graphics on that version are light years in front of this ""special edition"" version. And the gameplay is smooth and responsive even modded. So in my opinion $40 USD for this version is just not worth it. Even free it isn't worth it !Update after 20 hrs play there seems to be a major lagging problem with the game engine. Objects pop at short range bandits don't fight back but just stand there hunters pop out the roads at short range. The graphics away from the Whiterun area seem to be low res more like Fallout 3 than the old Skyrim.Update after 50 hrs play patches have improved the lagging. But objects still pop at short range.

This is a great game and it will replace the original oldrim just due to the game being far more reliable and able to handle alot more mods in the special edition.

So stop crying and if you want a more stable skyrim experience pick this up most mod authors have already transfered their works over and soon enough even bigger better mods will only be available on special edition.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
2016-10-30,0,0,143,False,Recommended,"I gota say i am VERY pleased with this Remaster.People need to understand this is a Remaster not a Rerelease not a Update or a Add On.What this does is it upgrades the engine to a 64 bit more on this later adds in WAY more stability removes alot of bugs (and yes there still some in here/new ones but nothing game breaking theres already a mod on Nexus that fixes these bugs) way prettier shadows and lights and better audio from what i can tell.For those people who say theres no mods or their old mods are broken?DUH!!!!!! You Dumbasses. SKSE stands for Skyrim Special Edition not script extender anymore for this we need to wait for SKSESE Skyrim Special Edition Script Extender thats what MOST mods work off of and will NOT work until an update is out for SKSESE which will take a couple months as the workers of SE can not do anything until the game was released. Now you can use Wyrebash to convert some mods over like Skeletons like CBBE or UNP ApachiiHair and Eye mods while theres plenty of other mods that are already up on the SKSE page on NexusMods.http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/?Majority of these mods can be installed Via NMM without having to do anything and others you can do manually (which is always the best thing to do) I myself am running a reshade covered up ontop by a ENB texture updates and all.My SKSE looks like a gritty old film with grain effects on screen with crazy sun and weather i LOVE it way more than my Realvision i had on Skyrim. Now to the Stability. In old Skyrim you could spawn in 200 NPCs and nuke them and your PC would drop to 5 fps no matter what your rig was and possibly crash. Now though i can spawn 500 NPCS make them fight FFA style watch them fight for 20 minutes and all lay there bloodied and dead with only one person left without going under 50 fps (Note i have a 980 GTX). So where all these people are going ""hurr durr my old mods dont work hurr durr its not that much better"". Yes yes it really is this is like comparing Oblivion to Witcher 3 in terms of stability and visuals.

2017-02-09,0,0,120,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I didn't review Skyrim the first or second time I played through it in the original version and it almost goes without saying the game is fantastic.Any meaningful discussion about it has to be relative to something else be it the other Elder Scrolls games like Oblivion or Bethesda's other series like Fallout. Skyrim is clearly an evolution of the Western open world RPG genre both within the industry as a whole and specifically with its place in the Bethesda lineup.Compared to Oblivion the questing system is simpler and for me that means much improved. The leveling system is somewhat similar it's use based which is usually my favorite kind. Here the Special Edition beats the original with the inclusion of the Legendary skill feature which allows a character to reset a skill and therefore continue using it to level up. Without this it was a lot harder to improve at higher levels.Skyrim is smaller than Oblivion both in raw physical terms and in the number of NPCs and quests. Oblivion itself was smaller than Morrowind and so on. This is a sacrifice for the high fidelty we get great writing and voice acting throughout. It's almost not worth mentioning though because the number in Skyrim is still so high that any discussion about size borders on meaningless. I'd rather have fewer high quality quests anyway.Skyrim feels a bit sparser and certainly more mountainous than its contemporaries. This isn't a complaint merely an observation. It lends to the sweeping feel of the winter landscape. And the verticality is a nice change from other relatively flat maps.The Special Edition ramps up the graphics fairly significantly. The textures are equal to the high resolution pack available for the original but the lighting and particle systems are much improved. There's also the inclusion of depth of field and other blur effects that really help modernize the engine. Strangely the field of view was changed to be much tighter. This aligns the game more closely with FPSs like Call of Duty but it is an odd choice here and it threw me off initially. I think I prefer the original.Other than that there's not much to say. Skyrim is so prolific in modern gaming culture that everything from the Dragonborn to the iconic helmet to the made up phrase ""Fus Ro Dah"" have become common things to see on forums or in web comics. The Elder Scrolls are a beloved institution and this entry does them justice.It was really nice of Bethesda to make this version free for their fans. It makes me feel well special.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I want to be able to apply textures and off Nexus to actually make the game look like it's actually a remake instead of this. Overall you're better off sticking to the original Skyrim and modding that to look good if you want your achievements or waiting for someone on Nexus to release a reenable achievements mod or just modding this to look good if you don't care about achievements.

2019-01-02,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,The game is fun and I enjoyed playing it for a little while with a friend through multiplayer.My negative review stems from the fact that they seem to advertise Linux support when in reality the Linux build of the game is very very old and does not work online with users on other platforms. I wasn't able to really play the game at all on Linux and I think this is pretty crappy practice since Linux support was a big selling point for me on this one.,Human: Fall Flat

2019-01-03,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"Sonic 3D Blast also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming serving as a spinoff to the franchise and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.There also were Saturn and PC versions made near the end of development of this supposed Genesis swan song replacing the cancelled Sonic X Treme. Saturn had improved graphics redbook soundtrack different actual 3D special stages analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages yet had autosave feature.Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing wise.The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.I don't usually talk about mods but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi official. None the less back to what Sega gives us there.Now technical part about Sega's emulation here The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive &amp Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.However Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!Emulation itself mostly sound isn't that good but it does it's job. Also yes emulator supports quick saves.As alternative you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.Protip You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility extra life speed up so on. By the way Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity red shields protects from fire golden one gives you active ability where you do Protip Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.Each zone has two acts along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually they look like Halls candies which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first just chilling. Both of them appear in each act hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him then avoid his stuff repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.Protip For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.Music is great too. Chiptune goodness the best from few composers on the project.Overall eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game. Pick only if you want some chill isometric platformer.",Human: Fall Flat

There are very often nooks crannies and alternate routes to be found which is also fun to explore as I did. However the game can be finished in a day and I personally don't feel it has too much replay value if you've already thoroughly explored the maps you play on.

2019-02-01,5,210,15,False,Recommended,On paper an indie game made by a lesser known French studio where a lesser known faction of the 40k mythos is pitched against a lesser known enemy of the 40k mythos using a plethora of weird mechanics and opaque systems has all the hallmarks of that most well known of gaming phenomena the utter waste of a Games Workshop IP.It is of note therefore that the Tech Priests of Bulwark must have anointed their design work with blessed oils and the studio must have been thick with the righteous smoke of the holy cencer because as it turns out it's a quite remarkable little game and one of the best and most original uses of a GW IP I've seen in a long time.Firstly there's the quality of the writing. I honestly cannot remember the last time the 40k universe felt so visceral and real. There's a genuinely deft touch at work here which makes it feel like actual science fiction rather than genre fiction. From my 15 hours of play I know and care about the AdMech more than I've known or cared about a 40k faction since the 1980s. Also of note is how the writing and the awareness of the lore feeds directly into the game design choices the writing doesn't feel like a layer than sits atop the mechanics but rather a well executed design facet. It's really very clever and a joy to behold.And so to the meat of the thing how does Mechanicus play? Well the AdMech (short for Adeptus Mechanicus) are the faction of humanity who act as the scientists the engineers and the guardians of ancient lore all rolled into one. They make and maintain everything from Storm Bolters to Titans and they do so with a pseudo Catholic religious fervour. They also self augment machinery into their bodies which makes them as much Cyberpunks as Apostles. Anyhoo a Mechanicus spaceship rocks up to a dormant Necron world and triggers it's slow but inevitable awakening. Your commanding officer soon determines that your cohort will either stop the Necrons or die trying.Play consists of talking to one of your Tech Priests and taking a mission from them which you will lead down into the many tombs that riddle the alien world. Each Priest has their own agenda which in some cases is in direct opposition to another Priest. Scaevola talks in a datastream it's humanity and emotions almost non existant. Scaevola wants to acquire knowledge from the Necrons. Scaevola clearly admires them and expresses pleasure when new enemies are discovered. Videx speaks in aphorisms culled from the holy texts of the Omnissiah. Videx believes that the tombs should be scourged of all xenos influence. Videx constantly counsels that humanity courts corruption by examining the Necrons and quotes scripture to back up his stance. The banter between these two and their commanding officers attempts to mediate between them is really very entertaining! Who you choose to do missions for appears to have a direct effect on how things pan out.Mission picked you then choose the troops you wish to deploy. These consist of varying types of meat shield (which you diversify the roster of as the game opens up) and your precious Tech Priests. The mission itself is then a top down affair where you are shown a map detailing all the available rooms and corridors. From here you plan your path through the tomb. Most rooms offer a Choose Your Own Adventure style choice wherein various rewards and penalties will be levelled. Within each tomb there will also be at least one fight where the map dissolves into XCOM esque isometric turn based combat.Here's the weirdest and for me one of the loveliest parts of Mechanicus the turn based combat has very little RNG going on. It's more like a game of chess on a procedurally generated map where your meat shield troops are your pawns and your Tech Priests are your back row. A universal pool of points exists which you harvest and deploy as you see fit between your troops as the turn progresses. You can choose to burn the lot on one hero priest who goes on a solo killing spree or spread them evenly amongst your cohort as you proceed the choice is entirely yours. The nuances here are surprisingly subtle and as the system doesn't correspond to many (if any) other games I am finding the process of discovering what I am capable of to be very rewarding. A successful mission awards you new kit and a substance called blackstone which you spend on your Priests to open up the various skill trees. Sculpting a Priests build by working out what skills dovetail with what items is proving pleasingly complex.Of final note is probably my favourite aspect of the game the awakening of the Necron planet and the triggering of the final boss fight is hard capped. Each mission will advance the awakening a minimum of 3% but poor choices and bad luck can easily make it double that so you are permanently searching for the sweet spot on an invisible bell curve where you get the most experience and loot for your troops whilst minimising how much you awaken the planet in the process.It is commonly held that the challenge drops off as you get further into the campaign and I have to say that in spite of a recent patch that apparently addressed this issue this still appears to be true to a certain extent. However. I am still finding the originality of the ideas their excellent implementation and the overall quality of the product continues to outweigh any levelling out of the difficulty curve. To this end I would recommend figuring the game out from first principals and steering away from any guides that tell you much more than I've done here Mechanicus really is at it's best when you're trying to make sense of it.8/10 Would happily aspire to transcend this crude biomass again!,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
2018-11-16,46,174,13,False,Recommended,"Man AdMech. I'd wanted them to get a proper army since I was in middle school. Back in the day I would paint up metal Vostroyan figures in Mars colors and call them Skitarii. I got into Forge World's Horus Heresy just so I could play a Mechanicum army. When they finally got a proper 40k release I immediately dropped several hundred bucks on building a War Convocation which I later bolstered with a Warhound Titan for my group's Apocalypse games. I regret nothing. I love the Adeptus Mechanicus.I also love isometric tactical games and man this game is like a dream come true. Think Jagged Alliance 2 with cyborgs. If you don't think that sounds awesome you need the lameness and suckitude centers of your weak fleshy brain excised. Unfortunately ever since THQ went down (RIP) 40k games have had a pretty sharp drop off in quality so naturally I was a bit wary. I mean hell even the latest Dawn of War wasn't all that great. Worry not. This one is a solid entry.It is the year 40 000. Everything sucks. You play as Magos Dominus Faustinius of the Adeptus Mechanicus a group of fanatically religious Martian transhuman cyborgs who extoll the weaknesses of flesh and probably listen to way too much Mega Drive. You are waging a campaign against the Necrons billion year old super future Egyptian robot aliens that want to literally kill all organic life in the galaxy (and could probably pull it off too). They probably also listen to too much Mega Drive but most likely believe that 198XAD was a better album than Hardwired so that's reason enough for these two factions to go to war.Along the way you do the typical Squad Based Game song and dance. You wage a world map campaign manage the inventory and upgrades on your dudes listen to your advisors the works. Interestingly the game differs from XCOM in that it's more about the mission than your squad. Life is cheap in the 41st millenium and this game nails that feeling. Rather than cautiously inch forward with your veterans you are encouraged to throw cannon fodder ""troops"" at your enemies which will be replenished once the mission ends. And the missions themselves are damn solid affairs. The Cognition mechanic allows your Tech Priests (read heroes) to use more powerful equipment and increase their action economy by harvesting knowledge from objectives and slain enemies. This keeps the turn based combat feeling surprisingly fast paced and it's a refreshing departure from the XCOM gold standard of alternating activations and double actions.All in all damn solid game and worth a playthrough or two. I would highly recommend it if you're a 40k fan. Otherwise worth grabbing the next time you catch it on sale.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"

The aesthetics are truly wonderful and the sound design is unforgettable. It is well paced not over simplified yet not too caught up in tactical micromanagement. The basic gameplay loop is expansive and interesting.Bugs are very exceptional the controls are crisp and responsive.When you juice up your tech priests the game can get a bit easy but it is still fun. Actually it is so much fun that time flew by and I finished it in two long sessions. Still loved every second of it every weird and alien sound every new upgrade and every instance of shooting a damn necron back into wherever their ugly xenos face got spit out from.This game is a gem. It is evidently crafted with lots of love and care and lots of thought came into this unique and nightmarishly beautiful depiction of 40k. The basic conflict between necrons and the adeptus mechanicus is interesting as well and it makes you think about the similarities between them as well as about the whole relationship between mankind and machines.What is left to say?

2018-11-15,2,110,44,False,Recommended,"Mechanicus is a game that shares a few similarities with XCOM. However has a lot of unique mechanics that make it very much its own game. Video Reviewhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v PQWgBoWvSbk Written Review Set in the 40K universe you play as a squad of Tech Priests trying to keep Necrons at bay while exploring their crypts. As someone who has never delved into the 40K universe this has been the first time I have been so excited to experience it as the lore behind these guys is very interesting. The game's characters are all very unique and have distinct personalities. They disagree on a lot of things and these conflicts are well written as well as the descriptions of rooms which create a strong and vivid atmosphere. The music and sounds that accompanies all this really helps drive a tense and immersive world. As for the gameplay once you enter a crypt you are given the choice which rooms you want to enter and in doing so will be met with random encounters that you must deal with. For example you might find a wounded enemy. You might be able to finish it off capture it for research or just leave it be. Depending on what you choose you will get a different outcome. You might earn material rewards take damage alert the enemies to your presence etc. Different characters will comment or react differently depending on their interests which makes your choices that much more compelling As you progress through the crypt the ""awake"" meter will increase which means you do not want to linger too long and fully explore. As the meter rises enemies will be buffed making the mission a lot harder. Once you've completed the mission that ""awake"" meter will carry over onto a global ""awake"" meter similarly to the ""Avatar Project"" in Xcom 2. This forces you to be very careful about the choices you make and to try tread quickly which I really enjoy but I can see it being a negative for some people. Once you encounter enemies you will be placed into a battle mode. It is NOT like Xcom where you as the player control all units at once and then the enemy has their turn. Instead each unit has its own turn that you can see on the timeline. Each unit has a set number of tiles it can travel. As an example if your unit has the ability to walk 10 tiles away if you only walk one tile and then shoot you will then still be allowed to walk the rest of your 9 tiles if you choose to. Also you are allowed to use multiple actions at once including multiple guns melee healing etc provided you have the CP for it. CP stands for Cognition points which is a currency you use in battle. You can use this to walk further than your usual walking distance. It is also needed to attack with certain weapons. You gain CP by absorbing it from enemies and pillars throughout the battle. Once a whole battle round has ended (meaning everyone has played their turn) all pillars will refill their CP allowing you to gather more. Gameplay revolving CP can be really in depth because it's all about spending it correctly. You could in theory traverse the entire battlefield as long as you keep absorbing CP on your way there. You can also send your companion servo skulls over to distant pillars in order to absorb some CP for you. Cover is not used in the game like in Xcom. Yes you can break line of sight by standing behind a wall. but your characters do not actually take cover nor are there bonuses for full/half cover. Instead you send expendable units known as troops. One example of a troop is called ""Servitor'. Which is a throwaway unit that is meant to be cannon fodder to protect your more valuable Tech Priests. They can only melee don't have much health and can't walk far but will attract enemy fire and once hit will actually give you CP. Under the explanation that the Tech Priests are ""studying the enemy weaponry as they attack the Servitors"". It's a really interesting mechanic that also builds upon the lore. There are a few other mechanics during battle that make it interesting like resistances to certain weapon types or one time use spells as well as charging weaponry after usage but I don't want to oversaturate the review. I've explained the core mechanics. To summarise the combat feels very original to me and is quite enjoyable. Once you're done with a mission you will earn rewards. You then have the choice of what mission to undertake next as well as what units to take with you. In your ship between missions you can also customize your units. You have the choice to rename and colour them whatever you want which is a welcome option. You will then use any blackstone you've acquired in order to upgrade your units. You can choose perks from multiple trees that focus on different things. Upon doing that the next upgrade will cost more and you will earn an augmentation slot. With this slot you can now equip a new weapon/armor or whatever you desire to the unit. This allows you to have multiple weapons and gadgets which makes your character look like a badass.Overall I'm really loving the game. The soundtrack is so cool and really compliments the atmosphere created by the well written descriptions and characters. Gameplay is original and gratifying and upgrading your characters feels satisfying. I'm very happy to finally be introduced to the 40k universe through a side of it I find incredibly interesting. I highly recommend the game!","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"

Nothing!Because the goal isn't to finish the game before the countdown runs out (although this is possible as i achieved it on my first playthrough).The goal is to gain as many ressources and upgrades as you can while the countdown is running respectively to weaken the bossboss by taking out the other 5 bosses that will come to aid him if they're still alive.The combat is fairly basic as in if you've ever played a turn based strategy game you will feel right at home however it is pretty fun as the game contains a lot of different equipment enemy types and such although i'd have to lie if i were to say that there isn't some degree of repetition involved.The game takes some cues from the xcom formular as your core troop consists of 2 (upgradable to 6) Tech Priests each with 12 equipment slots and 6 little skillstrees.Unlike XCOM there is no permadeath involved as WE HAVE CASTED AWAY OUR WEAK VESSELS OF FLESH and instead dead priests will simply be repaired after a mission although at a fairly high cost.The game expands on this formular by additionally giving you access to different stormtroopers who are meant to be disposable and cost a little bit of ressources to use.All in all the core gameplay loop of EXTERMINATING THE XENOS HERESY is really fun and enjoyable the biggest issue this game has is that the game only has one difficulty and is designed around the idea that you occasionally will fail a mission however if you don't you eventually start snowballing really hard because your own troops become stronger at a much faster rate than your opponent.Nonetheeless i'd definitley recommend checking this one out.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
2018-11-17,3,41,38,False,Recommended,"Domini and Dominae I believe what we are dealing with here is a jewel. That very rare and elusive beast of a game that comes every once in a blue moon cycle (Terran standard) to give an exceptional example of what a Warhammer 40k tale should be.It is incredibly loyal to the fluff not only by the binaric lines of the protagonists but by the very mechanics in the game that will make you catch yourself thinking like a Magos of the hallowed Mechanicum in exactly (t 32*y &lt 2300/# x (alpha.phi)) minutes into the game.A race against time both in the campaign segment and in every Mission and battle you will be driven ever onwards in your Quest for Knowledge to both uncover the relics of mankinds past and beat the clock ticking away the days to the full awakening of the Necrons.Standing on the shoulders of Giants the developers used 20+ years of fleshing out the Cult in the lore to bring you every possible facet a Magos may adopt represented in the cast that advise and guide you on your journey the Grounded no nonsense one the ambitions borderline Heretek one the Conservatic dogma spouting one and others (""lets just pray harder at it!"") who all speak via the lingua technis immersing me in the fantasy that I'm but a Techpriest on mission from Mars. Contrast that to the filthy awakening Xenos who are voiced in perfect English.Making the first boss encounter basically ""Beep boo boop beep?""""Pzzt baaa bee beep boo 1101 0101 1101 1000""""What the hell are you doing in my house? Get the hell outta here Imma kick your """"Beep boop!""Joy.It's turn based giving you plenty of time to ponder your next step into damnation team based so you *have* to coordinate both your highly customizable Tech priests and your Cohorts of sorry subDomina Disposable troops but unlike X Com it removes an element of chance where your 95% hit chance misses for the 3rd time in a row. Well damage still comes in ranges and unless you scan it you have no idea how much more the enemy can take or his armor. Foes have advanced reanimation protocols so that's cool that you've killed it but now you have to stomp it while it's down or else it's coming back!To give you an edge while losing you may be choosing one of the many Canticles of the Omnissiah a single use per mission buff that when played correctly gives you that needed armor shredding or extra movement to finish the mission this turn and avoid disaster in the next.I cannot reccomend this enough Mechanicus is a legend in the making and you should NOT be missing out.I'm definetly hooked.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
2018-11-20,0,0,36,False,Recommended,First off if you like X Com style of games you will most likely like this game. If you like Warhammer 40k then this game will also appeal to you. This is one of the best Warhammer 40k games I have ever played and the unit management upgrades combat is fantastic.One thing to note the campaign is relatively short and I beat it in 17 hours unlocking 17/22 achievements in my first play through. The game is relatively easy if you are used to X Com style games even the hardest settings are easy and I was able to kill the final 3 bosses in just 3 rounds in the game with the final boss with 1 character in 1 round. Still recommend the game just immersive fun just not long enough. I would love to see Expansion packs in the future.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
2018-11-18,1,44,12,False,Recommended,As a disclaimer I'm an AdMech player on the tabletop so this review is going to be completely biased. A lot of games come out in the 40k universe and there are very few that are actually worth the price. By the grace of the Omnissiah 40k Mechanicus is one of those games that every 40k fan out there should support. Its not without its issues notably the game gets too easy once your tech priests are half way equiped and you can field proper Skitarii troops also the Necron AI at times is less than intelligent.There also doesn't seem to be any method of reducing the Awakeness gauge or an endless mode so once you beat the main game its pretty much over (I'd advise keeping a backup of your save just incase DLC or something gets added).All that being said Mechanicus is still a lot of fun. At its core its a rather simple but addictive turn based tactics game. I consider it sort of XCOM lite. Cover is pretty much just line of sight (which lets you cheese pretty bad) and the maps aren't very big but they get the job done. Once you start understanding what each troop unit can do what combos of tech priest upgrades and equipment work well together you'll be blasting through the Necron tombs with ease. Ultimately what sold me was the ability to play as the AdMech. I'm so used to the Space Marines taking center stage with everything that its so refreshing to see a 40k game that does not have an ultra smurf running around. Bottom line is that if you like tactics games (think XCOM) you like 40k and you want a game you can just sit down and enjoy Mechanicus is totally for you. If not still buy it cause I want more AdMech stuff and this is great advertisment. Now if only I could convince the devs and GW to release a Kill Team or Necromunda game...EDITED Cause I cannot English.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
2019-01-21,1,28,20,False,Recommended,Don't listen to people who claim it's the game only for Adeptus Mechanicus lore fans I had zero knowledge about AdMech (coming from that minority who prefers Warhammer Fantasy Battles to 40k) and I'm really enjoying it. It's fun has soul and spirit is not overcomplicated or frustrating.+ Great atmosphere (especially banter and disputes between characters who give missions and track the progress of your squad during missions)+ Solid tactical game with some good ideas+ Good customization options for your TechPriests+ The story is interesting enough the dialogues are fun+ Nice OST really helps to immerse Only one enemy faction (Necrons). But it's the matter of Games Workshop licence and not really developer's fault. Besides Necrons are the most fitting xenos enemy for AdMech lorewise. Once you level up and customize your TechPriests well enough the game becomes much easier. It's still fun for me but might not please those who want more challenge. Level mission maps seem to be scripted and static not randomly created (I might be wrong though),"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
