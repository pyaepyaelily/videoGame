19,32154046,english,"BETA game its far from done!!! devs are just to lazy! 

Its the game where the M16 has a higher caliber than the AK-47.

Its the most buggy FPS shooter ive ever played. ... it still has ALL the bugs and animations from RO2 its just all reskinned, and they freakin REMOVED the COVER system?? !!!!  they added choppers (choppers are awesome though) 
RO2 is in my opinion still 10 times better it has more maps and the spawns in that game are much better, in this game you often get spawnkilled in your main spawn it makes a lot of matches unplayable.
the gameplay in general is alright it still has the awesome mechanic from RO2 but they are lazy and don't fix the BUGS and GLITCHES from RO2.
the tunnels are mostly not even placed!! because a lot of people think its Shitfield 1 or something??  the ARTY in this game is to buggy when youre in a house or tunnel you will mostly get killed by ARTY/Napalm/Gunship, the creators did a really bad job on this title. 
in my opinion its one of the worst FPS shooter to date.

The new FLC is quite good!! love the maps and the guns just that the main weapon for the Australian army is bad real bad (L1A1) you have more chance with killing someone with the bayonet than shooting the thing. 

SO DO NOT GET THIS GAME!! (im going back after every update to see if they made progress) they did with the general gameplay the Vietnamese in my experience win more (like they should) they are still loads of bugs. they have updated the m14 and its now actually usefull. but with the AK you still have to shoot over 10 bullets to kill someone. 
Its clear to me that the devs have the worst map desingers, you can clearly see that after the last major update. The maps are just sooo poorly designed no flanking just linear gameplay with death zones for the attackers like the map A Sau (ASS) 

The hit Registration is the worst ive seen in a long time, you often unload your whole mag into someone and still no bullet hit. What i also have noticed lately that some bullets can Pen anything, ive been killed multiple times inside a tunnel from over a 100 metres. 

For some reason the Flamer is debuffed? i have used it an entire match and it has become useless at short range,fire does less damage now apparently.

The maps are really badly designed, the main spawns are often way to open. So when there are choppers in the match youve lost pretty much. 

As of June 1st 2019, they have added a lot of new maps, creator/player ones. Which are the worst ive ever seen in any video game, the vanilla ones are even better. The guns seem to deal, barely no damage just like the grenades they are pretty much useless. The spawns are even worse on the newer maps. 

Only good thing i can say about this game is that the updates are all free, you don't see that anymore.


this game is just a reskinned version of Red Orchestra 2.

If you still want this trash, get in the sale when its around 7 EU.

As of August 24 2019 nothing much has changed, most server now run the Custom maps which most of them are really bad, Battlefield kind of bad.

As of January 13th 2020: Its still a terrible game, all the stuff mentioned above are still there. They did add the feature that you can basecamp the attackers/defenders.
