2014-01-08,0,0,812,True,Recommended,Rust.. at first its a to navigate the map and figure out whats going on. When you get past that and start learning the map and understanding the crafting this game becomes amazing. Deffinately a game that has the potential to kill DayZ especially if Rocket doesnt stop being a lazy bastard.,Rust

2016-11-03,0,0,501,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a good game. it isn't a bad game but if you are playing by yourself don't even bother like others have said you farm build a base then it all gets taken away by a clan or group whatever you want to called them! Thats between your farming and being killed while doing it Rust should be sold to people only playing in groups the way it is at the moment.,Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,130,True,Recommended,This is a pretty great game. I'd honestly love to see them add in a map of some sort so you can at least tell where your friends are. Also maybe add in a few more options for graphic changing. But this is only in alpha so this game does still have a lot more to give. Honestly I give this game a 10/10. I just wish I had a computer that could play it better.,Rust
2014-06-02,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,If thought it would be something like Minecraft HD Multiplayer or something like that I'd avise you to stay off this game. Firstly because there is no singleplayer that means you have no way to get used to the game before hopping to multiplayer secondly most servers are a PvP hell everyone wants to kill everyone except the people on their friendlist most of the time.If that doesn't change your mind the multiplayer experience is just disgusting. Not casual player friendly AT ALL... By all means you'd rather buy Terraria for you and a friend with the BS cost of this game and the horrible multiplayer experience.It's kinda sad the devs don't want it to be more about exploring and fighting monsters rather than the PvP hell it is.,Rust
2014-02-20,0,0,45,True,Not Recommended,I origianally bought Rust because i wanted to play a good zombie survival game. Then the zombies are yanked out ruining most the fun in kiting zombies the animals are a bore too me this makes the radiation areas make no sense and the fact that it was originally marked as a zombie survival is why i bought this game and now its just a wild life survival game.,Rust
2014-06-02,0,0,400,True,Recommended,Game is awesome.,Rust
2014-06-02,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game... I really did. I watched tons of commentaries on YouTube before buying it and all they did was make me long to play it even more. It looked so fun and exciting... but boy was I wrong. Now I understand the game is in Alpha so I'm not going to rag on it too much or be to unfairly critical but there are some things that need adressing.The map is huge from my taking and sometimes it looks truly beautiful but you'll soon notice that every rock looks the same as the other and the same goes for every hill and tree and valley and mountain... this was my first major problem. There is nothing that can be destinguished from anything else (apart from a few small buildings) so I end up feeling like I've ""been there done that"" rather quickly and getting lost feels more like the games fault rather than my own.This game also seems to discourage me from exploring at my own free will as some parts of the map are completely devoid of animals to hunt or recourses to gather (apart from trees) so there is no reason to go there at all unless I want to starve to death in the middle of an empty field that is.I will say that the crafting system is well thought out and so is the contruction system. You do become full of pride when you finally build your own little shack to shelter you away from the dangers of the night. Unfortunatley I can't think of anything else that is worth mentioning in a positive light as there are other games out there that do similar things far better.The game also has one of the worst communities out there but you'll find that out for yourself. In the end Rust feels pretty sub par and unworthy of the current hype. It can be fun but it's clunky and feels rough (though of course it's in Alpha). Overall the biggest con is that Rust feels somewhat aimless. I don't know where Rust will be in a few months time or where the creators are planning on taking it and I can't help but think they don't know either. It's a sandbox that is rather restrictive in it's very foundations so only time will tell. Get it if you really want it and you have a little bit of cash to spare but personally I didn't like it.",Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,this game would be a good fun game if only they would up the anti hacking in the game it is point less to play if you only have to restart on everythang when some hole hacker walks raight threw your wall and kills you takes all your stuff and then you have to move and rebuild your house somewhere els just so the hacker dose not come to your house too soon. so you have to rebuild your house that you worked so hard to get all the wood and metal to make in the first place just so the hackers can find you later and take all your stuff then you have to restart all over. they need to fix that problem before i would ever recommend this game to my friends. if i could i would just get my money back and say it to this game.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,201,True,Recommended,Yes,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,321,True,Recommended,This game is a strange combination of grinding like in an RPG or MMORPG withg the cmaping ofRadiation Towns and gathering but it also has the survival aspect and building of Minecraft. It's a strange one but it works once you can get past the roadblocks of the settings and the spawnkilling in certain servers it's a ton of fun with a group of friends.Also if you have the machine to run it the grass effects and the Sun/Moon lighting make it quite thbegame to look at even in the alpha.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,One thing I do want to make clear is that somewhere in this game is a deep world of exploration and survival that not many games attempt or succeed at. Rust is basicly a survival game with no rules you are thrusted on to an island with nothing but a rock torch and some bandages with the only goal given being to survive. At times it can be really fun but does have some issues that make it flawed. First there is no singleplayer. The only way to play is join public servers with other people. If your internet isn't reliable this game will essentially be a 20$ screensavor. You can't make private servers either. To add to that most players are hostile shooting on sight and/or raiding other players.Second issue is with the resources themselves. There are a ton of things to collect/craft/build/etc but your common and most vital resources early on are wood stone food and cloth. These are needed to build the basic tools and shelter that eventually leads to guns armor and explosives. Excluding wood they are a massive pain to get early on. Stones can only be found on specific rocks littered throughout the land scape while food and cloth are found animals you have slain. Stones are a strange case in that they spawn near populated areas (Although I can't prove that it certainly feels that way) and of all the animals in the game only two are harmless. If you get unlucky and spawn in an area with no stones and the only animals in sight are bears and wolves...tough luck.My final issue is with the crafting system itself. Its not bad in fact really useful. It tells exactly what you need and how much make something...of things you know how to make. See there are some items that can't be initally crafted. To craft them you either find a random bluprint off a zombie or other player or find said item you want to craft and make your own bluprint. If you choose the later you need an paper (which you can't craft initally) a tool (which you can't craft initally) and use both on the item. So for example you find leather boots and you want make bluprints for it in case you lose the original. So you find a paper and the tool (most likely off 2 seperate zombies) and do exactly that. You find out that you need leather to these boots which is an item you can't initally craft and still can't. So if want to craft those boots you first need to find leather more paper and another tool. In addtion any items learned do not carry over on other servers. If you leave that server and play on another you will need to learn how to craft those boots again. This makes high level crafting worthless.Bottomline its decent game and it is in alpha so these issues may get fixed and for what it is it can be really fun once you get into motion. However I can't fully recommend it right now for 20 bucks. Minecraft is a better choice for now. Check on this game if it gets on a steam sale or if issues are fixed.,Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,Game is interesting. You can find various stuff in it. But at the basic level your house is not protecting you surviving in game is ultra hard. Some people get really powerful very easily so they destroy your house and you lose everything what you have done before. So surviving is pretty hard. Also there are planty of Cheaters/hackers on the servers which says that playing game is worthless. Hope they will fix these problems!,Rust

You WILL die from other players hitting you with a rock or a pack of wolves jumping out of a forest or breaking your legs by falling off a mountain and then getting eaten by a bear. But it's all part of the fun. Grab a bow and arrow learn to hunt gather resources and build yourself an isolated settlement. By the time you learn how to survive you'll understand how insanely fun RUST can be.,Rust

After playing a few different servers to try my hand at different play styles ranging from total bandit to complete noob hand holder as well as interacting with a myriad of other player survivors one sees how truly massive in scope the gameplay can be.

2014-05-04,0,0,483,True,Recommended,My time on rust has been 50/50 with certain servers and admins but the core of the game is what's most important right? Well in this case no.... most servers take away the core game of rust and you just spawn in with full kev and a m4 with 250 bullets. There is also many vanilla servers which really balances the game out so all in all i think rust has a long way to go from alpha but i'm sure the dev's will do a great job. Server admins really do need a little bit of a check everyonce and a while (I realize it is their server but.... it is facepunches game). This game shows great potential and im sure a lot of HUGE changes will be made by the community and FacePunch.,Rust

Upon closer inspection I discover that they're zombies and proceed to attack with my rock.One second later.....I have awoken in a different location and upon turning around an arrow flies into my head. A man with the voice of a 13 year old proceeds to tell me I am his unicorn slave and bandages my wounds.He then hands me a hatchet and pickaxe and tells me to fill my inventory with any resources I gather and return to him.5 seconds laterI now have a bow and a pair of pants along with some other neato trinkets.

My dong seems larger and darker but whatever.I start to wander the area and come across a large strange looking house with spike surrounding it.

2015-04-29,0,0,88,True,Recommended,"Still an early access game but i think it's worth a try. The developers should focus more on things like wild animals and PVE than PVP because a lot of us thought that this will be a survival game between gamer and nature and not a FPS game that puts ""Green Arrow"" to fight with ""Lex Luthor"" with a full battle suit because some time when you just entered in game for like five minutes someone comes to you and kills you with a ing AK47 and you just have a rock or in best case scenario a bow and a few arrows.",Rust

2014-06-26,0,0,121,True,Not Recommended,"I used to really like this game and it is still fun. However it is plagued by the early access curse. This game was released December 11th 2013 after about a year of development the developers scrapped the game entirely now these last 2 and a half years there have been improvements but overall it's still buggy and runs poorly.After only 2 months the game had sold over 1 000 000 copies. By February of 2014 the game had made over $30 000 000 and by the end of 2015 the game had sold over 3 000 000 copies. Considering the amount of money this game has earned you'd expect a bigger team of developers to be able to finish it but I think greed has gotten in the way. Almost 3 and half years later it's still not finished nor do I think it ever will be. They will always be able to hide behind the curtain of early access and ""alpha gameplay"".Overall I do not recommend Rust.

Man i love this game I never usually like open world games with no real objectives but i guess the objective is to stay alive aslong as possible! In a world where games are all about the movie and story mode they make them super easy and usually auto save has occured right before you die. In rust you get that feeling of dread and fear cause the past few hours of your hardwork could all come to an end due to a lucky spear chucker.

2014-01-11,0,0,147,True,Recommended,This is the best survival game i have ever played. I just love it. 1000/10The graphics it's not that good cause it's a alpha version so they'll probably change this and even with poor graphics the game is beautiful. I fall in love with this game when you disconnect of a server you character staying unconscious (they call it sleeper) and you can be killed even when you're not playing and lost everything. Then you come back to your house that took over 1 hour to build and see a thief in there that's so frustrating. Besides that you can rob too. Yesterday i was playing on my house when suddenly i looked through the window and saw a guy building some stairs to get on the top of my house to kill and rob me. It's funny to rob animals from other players or rob their cooked chicken breast i laughed so much in this game that i want to buy it again. THIS GAME IS JUST AWESOME.

2014-05-10,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Literally within my first ten minutes of game play I was invited/tricked into going into some guy's huge house and ended up being locked inside of a cell that he built on his top floor. But that's not even the best part. My cell has two doors to it. The one I was led through to be trapped inside and the other one that leads to a room that I've come to call 'The Pit'. The Pit is basically a large square that has walls on all sides of it that keep me trapped down in it but has no ceiling so that I can see the sky and that the guy who trapped me and his friends can look down and watch the 'games'.They always hold the games at night so that they have someway to pass the time while it's too dark/hard to scavenge. They light the arena with fires at each of The Pit's corners so that there is just enough light to watch. I'm forced to fight other players they've tricked into the pit with whatever weapons they drop into The Pit for us to use. One on one with stones free for all's with bows so much blood is on my hands. I've survived over 20 games. They now let me out of my room and into The Pit for most of the day time for the fresh air and I like to be able to see the sky. I'm usually rewarded with logs and chicken meat to put into my fire pit that's been allowed in my cell. They say if I survive 10 more games they'll reward me with a storage box and upgrade my sleeping bag to a bed. If I can make it to 50 they'll look into figuring out how to build me a bigger room that'll have a window!Overall I give this game 5/5 rocks. Highly recomended.,Rust

2016-10-07,0,0,516,True,Recommended,This is the kind of game you play when your leg is broken and you have a lot of time on your hands. Otherwise you're going to get pretty frustrated with the reward to time spent ratio because you can spend 3 or 4 hours building a small base only to log back in the next day in a completely different place because somebody raided you and destroyed your sleeping bag. The servers kinda suck too and sometimes you'll gt established on a server only to have it crash every 10 minutes or just shut down completely for over a week. I'm not even exaggerating here. Seattle 2 is notorious for this. Rust was also a lot more enjoyable before the update that forced you to grind levels to build anything.,Rust

2015-03-07,0,0,379,True,Not Recommended,"Rust a survival game for the patient and cunning....or so it was. I remember having all sorts of creative ways to survive in the older Rust version. Sure there were hackers but that never really was as off putting as what has happened as of recent. Recently Rust went into alpha with a cool new map new textures and all sorts of interesting things. Seemed cool but for a small problem. Raiding. Raiding could only happen with assault rifles(or the rare case hatchets though i never understood the requirments for the hatchet thing) since explosives were yet to be introduced into game. Makes sense so higher tier players raid lowers work. But then a more recent patch came that made Rust perma dead to me until i see VAST improvments. A more recent update made it so doors and walls have a non replenishing durability meaning anything that hits can break houses. And mind you YOU NEED houses. It's the only way to get metal after crafting a furnace and having a respawn point and such. The dev's may want you to explor and thrive in the wild but at the end of the day to get guns to get metal you need a house. To log out? you need a house so someone doesn' t axe your sleeping body. Well there was a strategy build so no one else could build up to your base. Then cheap c4 blueprints came. Blew down my entire house for cheap and made a huge profit. Well and there's no point redoing it all that happened again and again within like 2 hours of off time from the game it would happen. So i said fine i'll play smart and build ontop of a rock that is considered non destructable so i can be left alone. Well as it turns out someone of the very outskirts built a massive tower and jumped into my base. Now there is fall damage but apparently if you logout and become a ""sleeper"" from what i understand you don t take any. So now there is no way to build a safe house unless it is super massive best materials being used to build it easily 20+hours put into it with someone in the place logging on every 2 4 hours. Yeah thanks but no thanks i paid to play a game not a life job of managing my place or just running around like an idiot and restarting from nothing so everytime i log in i need atleast 10 20 minutes before i can start playing. And it isn't just me. few houses in rust are untouched and they are massive and generally owned by 3+ people. Everytime i log on i see tons of scrapped out houses litering the world. Do not buy this game unless you want what i have explained. I will change my review if this game improves but at the moment i cannot reccomment it like i would their older version.",Rust

You have no job/school having endless amounts of time to throw at the game will get you ahead.

2015-03-09,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I feel that there are several things that need to be updated.1st the history server finder option does not work at all.2nd more radiated areas need to be available meaning more chests and so on. ther also should be areas where you can find chests in none radiated buildings.3rd i dont kno if this would be way way in the future but there needs to be NPCs or shops. and money to find in bigger amounts in chests and smaller amounts randomly laying around.4th maybe also way in the future i think that an urban city map may be interesting to keep the abandoned feel the city could be abbandoned or hit by an apocolyps.5th maybe not a lot but new players should start out with a bit more. i know it is a stranded game so at leasts a weapon easy to make with wood.6th animals need to be slower then humans. i know its unrealistic but once an animal sees you your dead.there are some others. but overall i love this game and cant wait for it to get even better and better.,Rust

2015-03-09,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,My computer nearly meets the EXACT system requirements posted for mac but the game is so laggy it's nearly unplayable in this stage and to make it worse there is NO way to turn down the graphics settings or anything!

2016-10-16,0,0,765,True,Recommended,i really like Rust and i play it alot but ill be honest. i like it cuz i run my own server. to play on PUBLIC servers is just stupid you will get killed over and over and not one other person will have mercy. The only way to play on public servers is to play with friends or a clan. and now that they have brought in the xp system if you have a life or a job good luck on public servers and the constant updates that cuz server wipes really sucks you spend the weekend building and the next weekend its gone waste of time if you ask me.....but i do give it a thumbs up as i love it. the game play is great graphix rockthe building is fun and that is why.,Rust
2016-10-16,0,0,416,True,Recommended,Rust The game where you can power through the deadly clans bears wolves and little kids with AK47's or Die trying!In rust you collect resources build your base and make weapons to defend yourself. It is an epic survival game that is very fun. However most of the time large clans will screw you and your friends so I dont reccomend playing solo grab some friends and spear some nakeds. Also there are many other servers with different gamemodes such as Battle Royale Gun Game Embankment which justify even more why the game is worth $20. I reccomend picking up Rust.,Rust

2016-10-16,0,0,1669,True,Recommended,Rust is the kind of game that you can vehemently hate and generously love all in the same day. Your experience will vary server to server and you will never have the same interaction twice. I have played on vanilla modded community run Facepunch sponsored RP Arena and my own servers and I have had fun times and bad times on all of them.Stepping into Rust for the first time you must be open minded YOU WILL DIE. You will without a doubt die be it by another player an animal or a stupid mistake. You will die and you will lose something time resources a base a weapon. Whatever it is it will be frustrating especially if you are a new player and you lose all of the new resources and crafting you gain access to. But the more you play the better you get. Even if you are terrible at PvP you can be better at base building. The opposite is also true. The more time and effort you put in the more you will enjoy the game.The more friends you will make and the more knowledgable of the type of people you fight against you will get.At this point especially with the new updates the game becomes more fun because you know that even if you lose everything it isn't hard to start over again. And even if it is other servers await you. Other opportunities and experiences call for you.And if you haven't experienced modded yet WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?,Rust
2016-10-16,0,0,1089,True,Recommended,Has to be my favorite game of all time. A development team that monthly updates and impoves the game.

2016-10-17,0,0,342,True,Recommended,In my opinion this is one of the games with so much potential but it took a wrong turn along the way. I LOVE this game its fantastic if you're in a group of people but can be a filthy grind playing solo.The new XP system was a great thought but takes too long and again rewards groups with a way of XP sharing by using each other's tools but is a disadvantage to SOLO players.Another let down is the fact that there is NO single player option. (You can create your own server but I can't find a way of loading an old server.) However Ive played over 100hrs and STILL love this game it looks beautiful it runs well on my system (i5 2500k 3.3 3.6GHZ 16GB DDR3 Corsair RAM GTX 970) Personally I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a really beautiful survival game with lots of crafting options smooth controls and a large variety of ways to survive.All this game needs is a better XP system and a SP option.

2013-12-19,0,0,250,True,Recommended,I can't remember the last time I spent so much time in one sitting in a video gameAfter very much consideration I decided to invest into Rust as I heard that they have been cracking down on some of the cheaters that seemed to ruin the game. What a great decision that was. I literally spent 20 hours in my first sitting of the game with nothing but a couple bathroom breaks and a small break to grab a plate of microwaved pizza. This game will have you laughing at the rediculous things that people say and do to sitting on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding loud enough to feel and hear it from your chest. Literally the most intense moments in my gaming history.If you can't accept the fact that people WILL screw you over and you WILL lose hours and hours of hard work from a raid then this game isn't for you. But if you play the role of a survivor and make the right choices it is a gaming experience like no other. And it is only in Alpha.,Rust

2013-12-19,0,0,93,True,Recommended,"A very immersive game. Satisfying in every way. You start out with nothing but a rock a torch and 2 bandages. (No clothes you're butt ing naked). But there is a censorship option turned on by default! Even in the early access stage there is still much to do! So many great adventures and it isn't like WarZ or should I say ""Infestation Survivor Stories""where everybody just ing caps you on sight (Still be cautious about other survivors as survival of the fittest still applies in this scenario. Much like DayZ!) The environment and lighting is beautiful. I hope in future updates there is more wild life species (there more than likely will be). The crafting is more than excellent many different ways to get or make ingredients and even if you don't have the blue prints to make guns you can make some home made firearms to start you out. Like the one shot pipe shotgun or the wood handcannon. It's survival aspect is down to the fullest. Since you start out with no clothes to keep you warm no weapons to help you hunt and no shelter to keep you protected you must use your rock to chip off stone and wood to make a hatchet. Use the hatchet to kill an animal (Do NOT try to kill a wolf or a ing bear with a stone hatchet). Kill the animal take its meat to cook so you don't starve and use it's cloth to make warm clothing (or a bow). Follow your natural survival instincts. It gives you a real chance for your natural self to survive in the wild. We aren't naturally born with clothes and hygeine. We are animals only more sheltered and civilized. But in here you either become an animal or die a human. Ever wondered what it's like to be a caveman? Here's your chance! Once you've set up a shelter and you get certain minerals materials a furnace and you can use blue prints to make guns. MP5s M4s etc. Better clothing and all that good Find other survivors looking for strength in numbers and you can even set up your own damn community (yes it IS that immersive).Okay I normally never go this high but I'm going to have to give this game (in early access) a 9.5/10.Worth every ing penny!",Rust

2014-01-12,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,Theoretically this game should be great. However the community is simply one of the worst communities I have seen. The larger servers are filled with chat spam. All servers are filled with mindless killing on sight and bullying of other players by server veterans all made possible by the game's huge disparity between the top and bottom tiers. New players starting with a literal rock as a weapon and server veterans with M4 assault rifles combined with the disastrous state of the community means that you will be killed for no reason repetitively. If you manage to make a small shelter it will be broken into raided and emptied within less than half an hour by a player with kevlar body armor and an assault shotgun. Your base can even be raided and cleared when you are logged out. I believe that it states quite a bit when I say that the most fun I have had on this game was when I played in a completely empty community server. Even then I had finished the survival content absurdly quickly and there was no reason to continue playing.I would pay five dollars for this. For twenty it's a waste of money.,Rust

2015-05-31,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Definitely not ready.Downloaded the game and got the EAC error look for solutions none found. Launched the game from the Steam Folder set the options and was able to join a server. Game was nothing but pure lag. Press F2 turn all graphics down to nothing didn't improve lag at all. Didn't see any option to turn shadows off which would've been nice just to see how it affected the lag. Most of the time my cursor wouldn't line up with boxes to change options or select servers quit or cancel button. Had to click way off center to get buttons to work and this was at multiple resolutions. In the whoppin 30 minutes of trying I would say this game isn't even ready for Alpha 1.My machine may be older but it runs Fallen Earth Everquest II 7 days to Die just fine.I will give it another go in about a year or so.Edit over 1 year later...Tried again after waiting for the game to launch for over 10 minutes I noticed that the lag is just as bad if not worse. In my opinion this is pure garbage. There are games out there that run beautifully on my machine and from what I seen of the trailers this game doesn't not have epic graphics that should be causing this.

2014-01-14,0,0,148,True,Recommended,Rust is an interesting challenge. If you play like me that is as a one man wolf pack Rust can and will knock you down call your mother fat and then steal your lunch money. I tend to go it alone. I don't use the chat that often and the voice chat even less. I had played a server long enough to the point where I could craft most everything in the game and was feeling pretty good about myself. I had avoided death at the hands of my fellow players well enough and decided it was time to settle down. I picked out a nice quiet place as far away as I could reasonably get and still find resources where I started to build. I started building up my house trying to make it as secure as possible or at least make someone trying to get in go through a whole lot of trouble. All was going well I was hidden my house was almost complete and I hadn't been shot at in awhile. Then my front door exploded. There were two of them. One began moving through the first floor searching for loot or a way up. The other stood just outside M4 trained on the staircase door. Never leave your staircase unlocked children. Unfortunately for him i had roof access and my trusty rifle. He went down but the one inside got a lucky shot on me as we fought in the foyer. He bugged out but stayed just close enough to keep an eye on me and my house. That's how I knew this wasn't over. They came back four of them dressed in kevlar and armed with shotguns and assault rifles. The standoff lasted three nights. I killed another one or two in an attempt to banish them from my house but only resulted in losing the stairwell. Now trapped in the upper floors of my fortress surrounded by men and boys who wanted me dead and my possessions in their hands I waited. I waited for them to bring the explosives. By no means would they breach my sanctuary with anything less. I settled in to the corner with my shotgun and waited for the end. I would view my experience in Rust as the typical experience of a player who goes it alone. You may find yourself a secluded location and build your house strong. Craft your weapons to defend yourself from man and beast alike. Sleep comfortable at night secure in your home and in your defenses. But they will come. Through the night and the wilderness the men who wear black will find you and all that you have made will be as dust. Find your friends and bring them close for only together will you be safe. So that when the men who wear black come to your door you will be ready.,Rust
2014-01-14,0,0,158,True,Recommended,Its hardYou spend the first couple of hours trying to figure out what the hell did i just buy. People shoot when they see you. There is no map. When you die you lose all your items. And when you respawn at first you have no way of knowing where it was that you died. Then finally you get some wood together to build a shack. Maybe enough to add a door. Takes many tries to figure out exactly how to kill animals to get cloth for your sleeping bag. Now you have a respawn point. And even that can be destroyed. You collect enough wood to build a real house. You keep building it. In the process you keep getting killed by players zombies bears wolves radiation hunger an occasional fall and suiciding just because you got stuck.In the end.I LIKE IT!!!!!!!,Rust

This sounds disheartening I know. But training yourself in the art of spear throwing and bows makes your newman experience 10x better. Nothing is more satisfying than headshotting a worthy opponent with an arrow.,Rust
2016-03-13,0,0,569,True,Not Recommended,The experience is awful. Full of broken game mechanics terrible performance on even the highest end of machines and the worst player base I've ever seen. Understandably the game is in alpha but that's been for two years now. A survival game where you can build a base and craft everything from a spear to a sniper rifle sounds fantastic but the reality is so much less. It ends up being just that players with wooden spears and another group with sniper rifles where potshots at the defenseless from tall towers is the expected norm. A sadist's dream kindness has no place in rust and the amount of work and time this game requires to get anywhere past wooden spears is always more than you'll be able to put in.

2017-01-24,0,0,1889,True,Recommended,"TL DR This game is an absolute must have for its low price. Great Devs Great PvP Amazing Building/Sandbox Features.Highly Recommended.After over 1.5k hours on this game i feel like its about time to write a rust Review. Ill keep it short and simple. If you want a super enjoyable sandbox survival/pvp experience...this is definately the game for you. You can get lost in this game for hours on end without even realising. From the ridiculously advanced building to the cut throat pvp aciton and procedurally generated map which makes each wipe different.I will say that after 1.5k hours i have started to get a little bored occasionally of the game but who wouldnt after so many hours!One negative i would definately say about this game is the clans. The game is very server dependant and it is difficult too solo but that being said the community is although quite toxic in terms of badmouthing you will definately find many people who solo or duo and would be happy to have another on the jounrey. Yes journey. Each wipe you feel like you are really part of this world and i feel thats what makes it so special. Whether you are at work or Study etc you are always anxious ""will i get raided"" ... ""whats the plan for tonight"" etc.",Rust

I am 31 and have been a pc gamer since z dos ) Gaming is a part of my life and I have been desperately looking for an enticing game to wake me up. I have been tired of the same old genres platforms and designs. All I can say is that ""I am hooked""! For being in an alpha stage the game plays well. Best open sand box survival fps currently on the market. Minecraft meets fallout. The potential for this game has me so excited that I cannot stop thinking about the game. I honestly have not been so intrigued and enamored with a game since I beta tested WoW.

Rust IS a great game EVERY week we have updates.I like ""The Forest"" but you know they launch updates every Month and no other game is doing and updates every Week.The people who have more than Thousand hours of game play just played the old rust like i do but hey let's not forget that this game is a Survivor Semi Rogue like game.You WILL be raided.You WILL Die.You Will be shot when close to the Air Drop.You just have to survive you have to build and to conquer. Every game is like Rust but rust got the attetion of the Devs and i can say because when i stopped playing rust almost a Year ago (i'm back now D) they put the new version online and was ""WTF? the map don't have a single tree everything is glitch ed and yada yada yada..."". And the Dev blog was out Dev blog 1!Now almost a Year we have Dev blog 52!! Every Damn week they launch and update and still have players that ruin the feedback of the game because the server he is playing is wiped!I know what is getting too much resources and build an house castle or whatever but you can easily build again because when you learn the basics you know what you need to get up and survive!And for those who think that you will die after you spawn no... you don't just don't play every time in the Dev's Server go play on community with 10 to 20 peoples to learn the basics after some time you know how dangerous can be an air drop and with a logical thinking you know that you are not alone out there and you have to be cautiousnessSorry for my english but i trying to help those new players...

2013-12-25,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I have i decent computer and cannot run this game on the lowest graphics. I have no problem running games like warframe saints row or even dayz. This game is extremly demanding on pcs and should have some changes done. I know this is only alpha but until this is fixed people with average computers should hold off in the purchasing of this game.,Rust
2013-12-25,0,0,148,True,Recommended,Should not have been released yet. Seems like a pre pre pre alpha. The game is almost unplayable. Can't join anything but official servers which are almost always full and have no resources left. Super lag and hit detection is terrible. Zombies appear out of nowhere and one shot you. The graphics are buggy Slide and view through trees grass flashes on and off screen while you walk/run around.I'll give it a few months and a couple of updates and try again.,Rust
2013-12-25,0,0,58,True,Not Recommended,Lags like hell and has to many players in servers and won't let you join community servers. unless you have an extreamly good gameing computer don't wast your monny on this game.,Rust
2013-12-25,0,0,120,True,Recommended,id recommend this game to anyone its the sort of game you need friends to be able to enjoy but you can still manage quite a bit alone once you get arouund learning the basics and the map its quite good,Rust
2014-01-16,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Still in very early alpha the game does have it's glitches obviously but considering it's early state it's well on it's way to being a solid game. Right now the biggest issue is the steep difficulty curve in getting started. Gathering materials finding resource spots for somethings like stone can be rather difficult and if you find help by asking in chat then I would remember who helped you since the only help I've gotten is help dying. Something I was doing just fine on me with the lack of food! But gathering the resources to establish a more permanent residence with a sleeping bag (sets your spawn location) takes time and theres a high probability you will die while gathering wood to build a cheap shack and a door nevermind finding more important resources. So expect dying a lot only trust people who don't backstab you when they offer help (catch 22 I know but it's weird since there are people who don't just want to kill you but they want you to think they're nice first give you something that is helpful. Then shoot you. I guess murder isn't tastey if it's not from someone who just thanked you.) and remember this is really early alpha! And you will die a lot. And it's players consist of people from the internet so expect the type of behavior you see on ... the internet.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Great game kinda slow for the first 10 30 mins but after you get a hatchet bow and a lot of mats the fun just starts to go up from their goes up even faster when you find a random dead player and find a very great gun or explosives. My first four hours were in a single run it gets addictive fast.,Rust
2014-01-17,0,0,105,True,Recommended,This is the DayZ killer day z WAS the best zombie apocalypse game until rust came up. You will spend lots of fun time creating your base/Condo or base/Castle and if your thing is not building the house dont worry you will get enough time to kill and be killed alot by players raiding your house wolves zombies and bears in this game.Your first day i would give you a life expectancy of 4 to 5 minutes until you understand how to survive and craft once you learn the basics i give you 10 to 15 minutes life expectancy after you build your first house then you get to live more and progress better in the game. Now the downside graphics are not that bad but they do look a bit outdated theres rubber band lag in all servers sometimes because rust devs were not expecting this game to sell so much in so little time and worst of all..freaking HACKERS. You need to find a good server with active admins because hackers will make your life a living misery flying and running like flash through walls to get into your base and steal all your hard earned resources. DO NOT GET IN AN OFFICIAL SERVER they do not have admins and do not have the door share feature to your house which is a blessing and not a game breaker at all.Conclusion this game is worth much more than $20 for all the fun ive had ive been playing almost 40 hours and still want some more. My hat's off to whoever came up with the idea for this videogame!!PS let players remove and edit an error on their house because if you mess up its there for life and it hurts.,Rust
2014-01-17,0,0,4,True,Recommended,This game is very fun and my only two qualms are that there isn't enough to do yet and the map is bland making it hard to identify your location. These are details that I assume will get fixed as development continues though. I really like the direction this game is headed but in its current state it's easy to become bored unless you're playing it with someone. If you have friends who own it definitely buy it.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,133,True,Recommended,All the talk about rust had to give it a try and I was far from disapointed... PVE servers are friendly and eveyone helps each other.. to be hones it gets a little boring... The PVP servers on the other hand are the oposite with people pulling any tactic to make your life a mysery. That being said if you can grow on a PVP server you feel you have accomplished something.. People are plain nasty out there. I even had one guy run around my camp for 2 hours playing Benny HIll theme as soon as I made a complaint about how annyinghe was the mods quickly placed a 2 day ban on the person and the guy encourageing his actions..All that being said... for an alpha Rust is a Must !! (see what I did there). Go into a PVP server expecting to be whiped back to cave man status and you wont be disapointed ) Trust no one..,Rust

2014-01-16,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,While the game is fun and interesting it is very buggy. It may be that I'm a mac user but it takes multiple attempts to even get the game to load right let alone play it without it jumping or glitching. And it isn't a matter of the server internet connection or a multitude of reasons for a server based game to act that way. No matter where I load and into what server there is probably only a 1 in 10 chance of the game loading something other than a black screen that freezes. I wouldn't waste your money on this game until they smooth this out.,Rust

2014-01-16,0,0,1279,True,Not Recommended,im not gonna lie........ this game can be pretty fun at times. However most of the time you will die as soon as you spawn because some guy wants as many bandages as he can get. Is it anoying as hell? Yes. Will you eventually do the same because you want revenge and just dont trust anybody else? The answer is yes . Another thing to point out is that the game is obviously not complete by any means. that being said most servers are constantly being wiped because of constan updates hacking because the admin got his feelings hurt etc. I believe the game could possibly have the potential to be great and it is increadibly fun with friends. As for right now it is infested with the gmod community. Which means there are many young autistic kids playing this game.If you can handle that fine. More fun for you.BUT i do recommend that you wait to actually purchase this game. and if you do get it make sure you have a group before hand or else your only friend will be the rock you carry.,Rust

Communities in this game are RARELY welcoming and it's become more of a KOS do it yourself survival genre. This is my only complaint. I love this game and the content released for it is always great this game is growing.

2014-01-18,0,0,156,True,Not Recommended,"i loved this game to death. Building a house banding together with others raiding radiation areas with zombies for gear then go out and pvp..but as the game stands now they are removing the zombies as they dont want to be a ""dayz clone"" which is all good and well. however with that the only thing remaining is to raid / grief other people as the only activity left in the game.dont get me wrong there is ALOT of gathering involved but before they decided to remove the zombies you had those to kill off for loot as an ""alternative"" end game if you want to look at it that way. Now the only thing you can do is A) gather more or B) break into others house.i personally have a server myself and without the zombies..you find yourself breaking into others houses and killing off the server population that way since they loose all thier stuff. with that said they never meant zombies to get into the steam alpha ""source playrust.com"" so id strongly discourage anyone from buying this game before they have manage to sort that issue out..otherwise you will only loose all of your stuff to already established players on the server you decide to join.",Rust

2014-01-18,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Rust is essentially an fps minecraft. The developers have detailed the first person view well although when looking at other players holding weapons the game lacks textures (it is only an alpha). For a example a player is holding a shotgun but to another player it looks as if they are holding an M4 without a mag in it. This game is a very fun crafting game and is forgiving. If you die and have a sleeping bag placed you can choose to spawn there. The building physics are not a simple as Minecraft but the game is still very fun.If you truly want to see just how much fun you can have with a friend in this game I suggest you go on YouTube and watch the series of videos posted by Markiplier. I would reccomend this game.,Rust

This game might be fun if there wasnt so many hackers the graphics are not the best and the landscape flashes as you walk and its not because i have a old comp. dont waste 20 bucks like me save you money. maybe i will check it out after a few patches.,Rust

2014-08-07,0,0,457,True,Recommended,"What can I say. Both Good and Bad experiences with the game.First session on an official PVP server. I did not get far. Continously head shot by people using hacks to fly around. BADSecond session I went onto an Official PVE server. Spent a few days building and collecting resources. Had some fun. However every night while tucked up in my seemingly secure base i'd wake up naked in a field by morning. My base was still secure. i'd not be ""Raided"" but hackers had ""Walked"" through the walls of my base stolen my loot and killed me (As sleeping characters can still be killed on PVE servers). As it was a busy server collecting resources was very time consuming so to loose everything each day was tiring and frustrating. BADHacking is rife and as the devs are not supporting this current version of the game but are developing a reboot of the game which is currently unplayable we are in a situation where you can play legacy RUST but have to put up with a large amount of people cheating.Since then I've gone to a private PVE server where so far its been a positive experience. Although hackers do come in and do try to steal loot the admin is online to try to sort issues and ban known hackers. The community on this privately run server are helpful so currently enjoying the game. I do keep a hidden base with a store of resources incase my main base is hacked into. So the game itself. Yeah having fun. Some weird experiences. Caught a couple of guys bashing down the door to an old wooden shack of mine with stone. Opened the door and they ran in. Then closed the door behind them. Boy did they swear while breaking out of there. But too bad for trying to steal my stuff from me. Only wish it was a metal door now.Also had a guy camp outside my house begging for food. He kept banging on the door then resorted to singing me songs over the mic while playing a guitar until I gave in and threw some scraps his way. I now keep a ""Poor Box"" outside my door with a few items for new players such as food and cloth.If you buy this game expect both laugh out loud funny incidents but also severe frustration with hackers. You also need a thick skin to deal with whiney kids. Try to find a server with a good community and an active admin.Once the new RUST version is out hopefully there will be more done to actively ban any hackers in the game.",Rust

Get sprayed in the face by a hacking russian!! I call him out on the hacks after he kills me 3 more times INSTANTLY... He turns off his aimbot and I fight him for 4 more lives at rad town I succesfully spear him 3 times then he dies from radiation poisoning XD.. He rages the server and I promise To raid him and remove his base.. 2 hours later... His base is removed His friend that lived with him logged in played for 30 minutes got killed left the server... the Russian that I speared logged in cursed me out then left... 9/10 WOULD EXTERMINATE Bandit Russians again and again!UPDATE 9/19/2015A fellow rust player once said...

Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town."" is a description from rust most is true. However people don't form towns just massive structures with multiple walls to keep people out. However if you are patient and willing to learn the mechanics of the game. You will finally get used to it and it will be a lot more worth it in the end. Starting out don't go straight for Vanilla/Official Servers go to 5x servers where you can get gear 5x times faster just to learn the mechanics of the game. Avoid everyone you see they will most likely attack you. Stay away from the spawning beaches most people will be there (geared and nakeds). I only started the game a week ago or spent a week on it. After 2 3 days I got used to it but it took 4 5 hours of non stop gaming and searching online to see what I was doing wrong or if I'm doing something the way it's meant to be used. All in all the game is worth it if you spend a few days and hours to practice gaming learning how to built learning how to survive and learning how to kick some when you get ganged.7.5/10 Some negatives include bears going right through mountains then murdering you in 1 3 shots.

You collect everything and will have nothing to do but build. Playing by yourself on a server with a lot of people may get frustrating. People are major trolls and will kill you just for fun. I believe the best way to play is here Play with a large group of friends on a server with a decent amount of people. Not too little not too much.

2014-01-19,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,In it's current state... would not recommend might be against the consensus but only buy if you want to support what MIGHT be an okay game in the future.Actually playing at this stage is an interesting experience. Next tier of crafting is limited by stone which is very hard to find other players have already built encosures on spawn points and running around trying to find any will more often than not result in being killed by another player if lucky... stravation otherwise.The official servers are littered with one room shacks of the multitude that have started and abandoned the game so should give an idea of what current world is like. If you want to spend the time eventually you may be able to become one of the player killers instead of the killed... which is really the only reason to play at this point.,Rust

2014-01-20,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Rust is an incredible survival sandbox game that is formed from the combination of the best parts of Minecraft DayZ and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The game is fun to play challenging and easy to pick up for the first time player. The two things I would like to see implemented into the game sometime in the near future are a singleplayer feature and a better Anti cheat/hack system. overall this game is well worth the 20 dollars and probably more.,Rust
2016-09-23,0,0,167,True,Recommended,The best way to describe Rust is with the word Chaos.It's a fun game if you join a large community or bring one into the game. It's also not one of these games you can play for 5 minutes and come back two weeks later where you left off. do not buy this game if you can't log in on a daily basis for extended periods of time as your enemies (or people you've never met) won't hesitate to blow up your to see the explosion.To me this is a fun game I go back to from time to time to stir up but even then expect to spend a few weeks playing little else.,Rust

If you get onto a server with a whole lot of people dont expect to do to well people who are already geared will kos you for no reason at all.

2014-07-14,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,While playing this game it is fun as heck.. But I can't get past the part where you can't play single player LAN or anything like that. You HAVE to play on a server that someone is paying for.. You don't actually pay for the game. You pay for the ability to play it online. That's not really the point of buying a game.. Before I have my friends buy this game there needs to be something like single player and LAN capabilities.. I mean really? You have us buy the game but you won't give us the server files to play with our friends in a private game.. That seems a bit dumb to me.. Wish I would have saved my $20 for awhile longer until this game gets better playing cabalities..,Rust

2014-07-14,0,0,36,True,Recommended,"This game is AWSOME. Some people might think ""Oh this is just another Minecraft clone with Day Z mechanics!"" Wrong. Rust offers something that a lot of other games don't A Challenge. It's actually difficult to survive and you actually have to look at things strategically. For instance You can't just go in Guns Blazing and try to kill a bear as soon as you start you actually have to 1) Get the supplies to actually stand a chance against it and 2) Evaluate the situation and find a way to not die in the process. Also the nighttime in this game is AWSOME. You actually NEED light to see and there aren't any mountable light sources (as of right now) besides campfires which also adds a LOT of realism to the game. The only thing that bugs me about it is (as of right now) it is hard to first find food because animals from what I have discovered myself are not always plentiful in some areas and sometimes don't have any at all. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 it's only flaw being the scarcity of food in some areas of the map. This game is DEFINATELY worth getting and I look forward to playing with my fellow friends in the future!",Rust

2016-09-25,0,0,946,True,Recommended,I've put many hours into Rust and it never gets boring I keep wanting to come back and experinece the community and the features they frequently add tothe game. Garry creator of Rust and his team are very vocal developers and not in a bad way you can commonly see them reacting with the community on the rustwebsite they write a blog on community videos suggestions and base builds so suggesting good ideas to the team should be easy as long as the contentyou are giving to them is good. Now into the review.Rust is a PvP Sandbox Community driven game most of the experineces on the game depend on theplayers that you meet getting your base raided isfrustrating and can often make you lose motivation inplaying the game any further (I think I recall the developers saying that they are working on this) butdon't let that discourage you fighting people isn't theonly great thing about this game the social interactionson many of the different people you come across in myopinion is where this game shines in fact I've never reallyfound a better game with better interactions and the possibilty of future allys working with you. Even if you're playing solo finding players who are willingto work with you is often a easy thing to do I've made manydifferent friends on my friends list because of this and thishas actually prompted me to host a server myself (notadvertising don't worry).Building in this game is fairly easy to pick up make a buildingplan and you can see all the building options you can needand the hammer which tells you what meterials you need for the upgrade. Making items is also easy just search it up and it tellsyou the meterials needed though it is a tough thing to get wrong.Thank you for reading my mini review I hope I convinced somepeople to buy the game my rating would be 8 / 10,Rust
2016-09-25,0,0,203,True,Recommended,First of all play this with loads of friends this game is extremely boring when you don't have friends to rely on almost always being outnumbered because nobody roams alone.But other than that if you do find yourself a good clan or have good IRL friends then this game is a blast it's endless fun and the Devs update this game weekly. The only bad side is the fact that new players watch youtubers playing this game getting into gunfights at every corner raiding bases like theres no tomorrow and getting unreal amounts of loot but it's not anything like that the game is pretty slow at first it's only starts getting fast when you start making friends/enemies with the neighbors/a clan across the map.But making friends and enemies isn't the meat of the game some people prefer building giant bases and that fun is as valid as having fun shooting people others like slaving away for big clans and then being accepted into the clan for their service or even just painting elaborate peices of art. But the main source of fun is the PvP and loot system but like I mentionned earlier PvP doesn't come immediatly it can be quite rare at times so when it does come time for PvP it draws everyone in I'v seen a 2v1 conflict become a 10 person FFA for loot.Other than that the game WILL make you rage it happens everywhere your mates confused you for an enemy and shot you your gun broke at the last second 3 geared guys pop out of nowhere and annihilate your squad coming back with loads of loot and lose it all on the way home.Imagine the top 5 most fustrating moments in your life and multiply that by 20 now that what's we all call Rust.,Rust
2016-09-25,0,0,305,True,Recommended,A great game... I just can't play it anymore. It's one of those games that you have to set aside time pretty much daily or else you're going to get murdered and plundered.

2013-12-30,0,0,243,True,Recommended,Brilliant game! It has all the makings of an epic game to be truthful. As it is in early alpha testing it has it's issues however it has a rich beautiful environment and a ton of insane psychos ready to hand it to you the minute they get you in their sights. It's exhillarating to creep out and mine survival items without knowing what's lurking in the shadows. I give this game an 8 of 10 already and will excuse the server issues for now. I hope the developer realizes the quality product they have and continue to press forward this is a highly adaptable game and I sense they could make this run for years and have steady players. Get it and enjoy and realize it is in alpha testing so temper your expectations a hair you may have server access issues at times but when it comes down to it your purchase is getting this game solidified sooner. See you in game...,Rust

Second find wood stone and 15 pieces of cloth from killing animals so you can make a sleeping bag. Three avoid wolves and especially bears because its hard to kill them just a rock or an axe and it will hit you like 3 or 4 times and you'll be dead. Health can be regenerated by standing near lit campfires. don't eat raw food. Servers will lag now and then but will clear quick enough. Don't trust any players because most players will betray you even if you don't have anything. Once you have you bed craft a wood foundation 3 walls a wood doorway a wood door and a ceiling so you can boxof your own boxed in sleeping area.YOUR BODY STAYS IN GAME WHILE YOU ARE OFFLINE!!!!! SO make sure you are in your house when you leave. Your bed is your spawn point. If you press ""F1"" then type up grass.on false it with flatten the land so you can see animals better.VAC protect this game now so there are not cheaters.

2014-01-21,0,0,74,True,Recommended,"This game is probably the most rage inducing game of all time. I'm player who is really against rage quitting but this game was just too much for me. You start off a noob with only a rock some bandages and a torch. You slowly work your way up to survive in the wild by hunting animals looting corpses and by crafting. The first time i played I made friends with three other random players and we made a little town. I was really getting the hang of things until these two bandits came and raided our homes. We were defenseless because we only had a bow and a hachet to fight while they had shotguns and an m4. After they killed us looted us and took all of our belongings i switched to a new server. This time however i wasnt planning on being a good citizen anymore. FIrst thing i did was join my friend who was already well off to join me. We made a BIG 4 story home in the mountains where no one can find it and we were able to progress quickly in the game. We ruthlessly shot down any civilian in the way and went on daily raids. I was finally feeling great because we were fully loaded with an action bolt rifle and m4's and a mp5a4's (heckler) but then one day while we were crafting something in our home a random dude just pops in and shoots us down. TO THIS DAY I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE GOT IN. OUR HOUSE WAS CLOSED OFF AND LOCKED. JESUS FREAKING CHRIST. So then i broke my moral code and just rage quit.I do play this game from time to time but the feeling of all that hard work going to waste just because of some just makes me want to stop playing again. So the moral of the story? ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" And even when you do become the villain it doesnt last long.

2014-01-21,0,0,260,True,Recommended,This game is amazing you can craft new weapons guns and make friends and enemies. You raid get raided its AMAZING! Even if you get raided and die it does not take long to catch up from where you started! This game is truly great in alpha. Just think about it when the game is released there would be amazing mods put into it on servers people can add new weapons and a new structures in maps but currently its great. If you have patience i believe you will enjoy this game.10 wood/10 wood!!!!!! Amazing,Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,"A mix of Minecraft and Dayz basically.Plenty of hackers and if they don't get you people who simply have the better stuff will kill you before you macro anything forcing you to restart. If you play solo and you want to make any progress you need some luck and patience and caution of a turtle. And hope people don't C4 your house when you d/ced and send you back to day 1. Or just break into it with a hatchet if you only have a wood door. If they do get in then not only will they take you stuff they'll make your house uninhabital.Just for a reference I've played this game for a week and out of the hundreds of players I've met only one person actually got on my fl. And no I'm not abrasive I was actually pretty passive in this game. So if you plan on making friends in this game you might want to reconsider.There's also a lot of server instability it's actually ptetty horrid right now. Many times you'll think you hit someone dead on with a shotgun on your screen only to have them kill you with a hatchet Really really inconsistent. It could also be the hit detection isn't too polished. There also seems to be random button lags when I hit R often time the guns doesn't reload. I had to hit it several times for it to reload once and that will basically get you killed. Same thing with doors in your house that get ""stuck"" and won't open/close. Lot of clunky movement random slowing down when moving under door ways. Gunplay seems very random. A lot of chugging especially going through towns or even in your own house. There are also lots of random dcs I literally lost my house when I dc'ed during a gunfight when somone was trying to get into my house. When I respawned to try and get it back there it goes another DC. Whether the servers were garbage or he was d/c hacking doesn't matter.Oh and the rubberbanding...it's chatoic. Makes melee fights and coin flip when people chase you they seem half a football field way run in the other direction then your pulled like a magnet to where you were five seconds ago. Surprise that guy with a shotty caught up to you. Amazing. You walk downstairs in your house lies now your upstairs a second later. It's like a funhouse.Getting the best gear requires you to have to go into towns but going into town is suicide unless you go in their with a raid. Otherwise you'll never make it 5 steps out unless it's a 2 person server. There are no player built towns because there are no communties except 4 man squads. The only towns are shanty towns from all the huts of dead caveman. This game in it's current state is a FFA PvP.The concept is neat but right now playing this game solo a maschostic chore. If you're solo I would not reccommend it. It would be better if they had some social features to help let friends get together or let solo's buddy up but as of right now it's zilch. They toss you into the wilderness with no sense of direction and no navigation so finding a friend on a server is tedious(combined that with no transportaion except walking). Otherwise you can't trust anyone. And nobody will trust you.If you do have buddies the above problem still hurts and you'll still have to deal with all the alpha problems but the game is actually fun if you have a crew.Otherwise I'd wait on this game you'll just get frustrated as a lone player getting killed by groups or randoms with decent gear and making extremley slow progress. There is no neutral button so I'll lean towards thumbs down for now.You shouldn't pay 20$ for this alpha wait on it when it the servers become halfway decent and anti cheating is actually enforced. Trust me It'll save you hours of time and progress that was for nought. If anything the devs should be paying the players 30$ for testing this stress test that's out of control.",Rust

It is sooo hard to start fresh 3 or 4 hours after everyone else does and make it. That being said though the game scenery is beautiful and the game devs are constantly updating. The game itself is fun it's just the community that is cancer. I fear that the community is what will kill this game.,Rust

2017-01-17,0,0,141,True,Recommended,If you can find a server where people aren't just killing everyone they see on sight it can be very fun. The most difficult part of this game is finding a populated server that isn't filled with blood hungry a55h4ts. But if you can avoid the jerks and get a base established you'll be golden.

2017-01-17,0,0,46,True,Recommended,One of the few early access games I've played and can honestly recommend. I've read some really things about the community but honestly if you just find a low populated server to start out before your get good you'll find people who will help you. This game is better with friends and I recommend buying a game key from a site like humble bundle or You can get it for cheaper. I doubt this will ever not be early access because it's been out since 2014ish and is still undergoing changes but is also developing slowly from what I've seen with major changes over time. I doubt it'll ever be completed fully but so far my experience has been great. just get another friend learn how to build and use a map and you can find each other no problem. Big learning curve but much less than most other survival MP games. This game is a blast with friends no doubt. I don't have that much time in to it but I've been on a low pop server during my time and it has been enjoyable once you learn the basics. Just avoid the servers with heads building bases at spawn points and you'll be good.,Rust

ConWhen playing on modded server you will have a problem on vanilla (official) server. On some servers you can pay with real money for c4 etc. cancer Prepare to be raided every second. No real life anymore. SumI recommend this game to everyone. Totally worth that money would spend even 40$/,Rust
2017-01-18,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Great game. Amazing graphs. Really like it.,Rust
2017-01-18,0,0,355,True,Not Recommended,This review is based on my own Rust experienceI'll be organizing this review in 2 sections pros and cons.Let's start with the cons Game takes forever to load. It takes me at least 5 minutes to open the game and get into a server. My friend takes about 10 minutes. I have a good rig too which runs GTA V with everything maxed on a smooth FPS (30 60) and 1080p resolution Game has been in development for almost 4 years now and it's still in early access. Some people even consider it pre alpha due to the amount of bugs It is not very noob friendly you get tossed into the world without any tutorial whatsoever unless you research it on the internet or something similar. Crafting may be easy but some game mechanics are a little confusing at first like building upgrading structures making use of the cupboard using a map (just press G with the map in your belt but the game doesn't tell you) or other stuff. My friends and I had a hard time adapting to this game It used to be focused on survival with salvaged stuff now it's more focused on PvP with guns No end game. Once you get the hang of the game you can get into a server build yourself a base get yourself a lot of resources guns some explosives and go raiding other players yourself in a matter of a few hours. Then there is not much left to do other than finding a new server waiting for a server wipe or keep hoarding stuff for no reason at all There seems to be a bug causing the game to crash for many AMD video card users two of my friends included Now the pros Game is relatively cheap despite still being in early access it's a lot of fun for its price Building yourself a base and painting pictures can be a lot of fun. Too bad they'll be gone in a week or two because you either got raided or the server was wiped. But still fun There are many items to craft including guns weapons decorative items and other stuff This game gives you an adrenaline rush every now and then be it trying to run away from an enraged bear while you're carrying a ton of resources or getting into a gun fight/base raiding/base defending situtation The graphics are now quite beautiful and not THAT PC demanding despite taking really long to load even on an SSD Despite still being in early access you can see that the devs are working hard into this and listening to feedback New content is added on an almost weekly basis Despite being fun and all I won't recommend buying this game as of now because it is still lacking lots of features the main game goal hasn't been set despite being 3 years in development there are a few game breaking bugs (like the AMD crashing bug) and bad optimization for many rigs.As soon as this leaves its early access build I'll be updating this review.,Rust
2017-01-18,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,This game runs like a joke. It plays like it was programmed by monkeys it used to be good but then they tried to modernise it and make it look nice.

2014-01-23,0,0,38,True,Recommended,Where should I begin with my review. First lets talk about the amount of content. For a early Access game it has an AMAZING amount of content with quite a good weapon selection and a decent food and other items. Now on to the gameplay the gameplay is amazing it really is a mix of dayz and minecraft with the amount of stuff you can make and yet it still feels like a challenge to stay alive. Overall for a early access game it is suprisingly bug free and very playable. I would highly reccomend it.,Rust

2014-08-20,0,0,148,True,Not Recommended,I do NOT recommend this play. I have had this for long time and it is always the same. There is a lot a cheats and it is really frustrating to play in any server. That is a total waste of time.,Rust
2014-08-20,0,0,53,True,Recommended,"Where do I begin about this game and my mixed feelings.Pro's This game is a very addictive survival genre game. If you like games that play out like DayZ or even like a minecraft play style then you will enjoy this game. The game doesn't have as many bugs as i thought i would for being an alpha. although this game isn't really meant to be played with your friends since it takes years to find them if you do manage to locate your compadre then it makes the game better as you can share resources and what not. Another really good feature is that experimental looks f*cking beautiful. That's about all i have for pros.Con's This game has few bugs but they are very annoying. One of the bugs is (well some people have this problem like me) every about 40 seconds there is a bout a 1/2 second stutter. It can be very annoying. That problem however that problem is fixed in experimental i believe. Another thing is that experimental as of this moment does not have any animals or they are just very scarce. That will obviously be changed in the future. When you die in this game because some servers have the ""sleeper"" mechanic is also very annoying. Your sleeping body may clip through your house leaving you open for people that have a blood lust to come up and murder you in your sleep. Another con is that even though you are on a non pvp server you can still be raided and killed if you are in the middle of being raided. Not so PvE is it. My last complaint is that you cannot host your own local server with just your friends (i.e hamachi) without paying around another 20 bucks.All of this is just my general opinion so don't hate and remember what an opinion is. Overall i would recommend this game when it would be FULLY released not just an alpha. Thanks for reading my review peace.Overall stars 6.8/10",Rust
2014-08-20,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,I absolutely loved Rust from the first minute I got it. I was into the madness of survival in no time. I was collection resources learning to craft new weapons and going out on the hunt. I loved it... until about the 35th hour of my gameplay. I then discovered the extreme problem of hackers. There are so many hacks to ruin your gameplay. There are aim hacks speed hacks and even hacks that let people walk through your doors like they don't even exist. The worst part is that these people aren't being reported or removed from the game. Hacks such as these make the game nearly impossible to play. Until these hacker problems are solved... I simply cannot recommend this game.Get the hackers removed and this game becomes incredible.,Rust
2014-08-20,0,0,94,True,Not Recommended,You want bad? We've got bad! You want hackers? We've got hackers! Want all of that shoved into a horrible game? We've got that with this horrible game called Rust. Just so you know that little hacker warning doesn't mean anything. It's a piece of code. So just turn on your hacks and with as many people as you want. I mean you have a better chance of getting banned for hacking on a community server than on an offical one. 0/10Maybe in 1000 years this game will be good.,Rust

2014-01-24,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,&gt Rust In a nutshell http //www.youtube.com/watch?v I_qTqZaMkn8&amp feature youtu.beI know this game is in alpha and its constantly being updated. I know that this game is probibly in the same state that Minecraft was when it was in its own alpha years ago. But I dont think this game is 20$ good yet. 10$..yeah maybe. But not 20$. The launcher is terrible the map is non exsistant (last played couple of patches ago) and there are a slew of other things that make me feel that this game will be probibly be much better sometime late summer. It's too early to invest in this game steer clear.P.S. if you do end up playing this game. Don't expect it to be a game you can win. put that mentality asside and just survive as long as you can. But don't try to win.,Rust

There are a lot of great things in this game but on the other side there are are also lots of things that need to be improved. One thing I would like to bring to your attention is that I would like you guys to add the option to be able to save servers. I hate playing with all my friends building lots of houses and stuff but then needing to get off. When I want to find the same server to play on it I cant.

Am i excited about future content absolutely. i can write a novel about the pros and cons but ill stick to a TLDR versionpros beautiful game that doesn lag ( i can play at around 50 60 fps on medium settings)diverse content and items (plenty of items from newbie/fresh spawn to high end high tiered items)lots of playerscons beautiful game that lags for other people who accuse you of cheating or hacking because you teleported on their screenif you dont have any friends youll have to grind your way to high end items while people who have friends just have the items gifted to them and not have to do any amount of work for it99% of players (this number seems high but it isnt) ARE TOXIC AS they will kill you on sight for your rock if they have mics they will brag and call you noobs when they kill you and when you kill them back they will scream like they are 8 year olds and claim they have sexual relations with your entire family including the pet fish/dog/cat/bird/whatever you ownwith that out of the way yes there are improvements to be made but find me a game that doesnt need improvements. this game is worth every dollar even more if you can get some of your friends to get it as well,Rust
2016-12-31,0,0,775,True,Recommended,Well not going to lie i usually dont find these type of games very fun or very good for that matter. But I will make an exception in this case i bought this game during the winter sale for cheap and decided to give it a whirr because i was bored playing my other games. HOLY this game got me hooked and hooked fast I have put my 20 hours into this game in just two sessions. I have a couple of friends i was able to con into buying this to play with and so non of us can put it down.10/10 would buy all over again.Pros1. Beautiful graphics2. Great sound design3. Pretty rock solild crafting 4. Hunting animals is a ton of fun 5. This is more terrorfying that most horror games. 6. You truly forget that your playing a video game and7. The feel of looting other peoples bases is amazing.Cons1. Animals will teleport through your building and kill you in your sleep.2. You cant make a bag to hold extra loot3. More unique crafting abilities would be awesome4. The Attack helil will rek you face 5. would like to see more realistic movements from the animals.,Rust

2015-11-22,0,0,2316,True,Recommended,"Introduction""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.""Very few games can make you as excited depressed satisfied and disgusted all in the same 2 hour session as Rust does. Although I have 3 pretty serious gripes with this game that hopefully will be addressed.EDIT I had to change my review from a positive to a negative. I just lost my 2nd engagement with my clan on the same day due to sh*tty optimization. I get close to their base 8 fps. I'm inside my own f*cking loot room and I'm at 6 fps.Single monitor no other programs open except Steam TS3 and Rust and that's my perfomance with an i5 2400 Nvidia 760 GTX and 16 GBs of RAM? I'm done. Once this game is playable again I'll reevaluate my review.ProblemsRaiding needs to be buffed.The forum in general is the worst place I've ever seen in a gaming community.The game is almost so unoptimized that it's nearly unplayable.For one there's almost no viable alternative to C4 raiding. You either spend hours gathering enough C4 to blow into a base and get loot or you just don't raid. There needs to be some sort of alternative to this. Tower cowards are people that have an IQ hovering just under 80 and sit in their base shooting at ANYONE that walks nearby but spending such a large amount of time gathering the necessary firepower to breach and clear isn't worth it.On the second note the forum is a place of scrutiny repulsiveness and just outright bigotry by not only the players themselves but the staff as well. The latter of which prefer the finality of a swift banning over any other tool in their arsenal.Last but not least is the optimization (or lack thereof) in this wreck of a game. I love Rust and I respected legacy but holy balls is this a flaming pile of at the best of times. Nearly every patch carpet bombs the game's stability (no pun intended) and unleashes havoc on what little balance there is. This third point is only really forgivable due in part largly to the fact the game is still in Alpha and therefore we cannot rightfully curse this game on the basis of expectations that are unattainable this early.Closing SummaryAll in all it's a great game and it's too early to really judge this game fairly as we don't know what Garry is going to do. As it stands though survival games have a really poor success rate in terms of developer abandonment. Pick this up on Christmas and play it then when it's (hopefully) on some holiday discount.If I had to give it a numerical rating it's a solid 8/10 but it is prone to getting dangerously boring fast unless you don't mind farming A LOT for the materials necessary for C4 mass production.Back AgainWell it's been a year since I posted this. The optimization is A LOT better the skins are a cool addition and support the community and the devs are still making regular blog posts about their progress and aspirations.I've changed my recommendation to a 'yes' for now. Really dislike how they cut the XP system this new component system is really bland and just overall worse for newer players.",Rust

2017-01-01,0,0,110,True,Recommended,this game is an amazing game. the game is so much more then the preview shows. i hate to compare it to minecraft but really what you do is gather resorces via stones and trees then build a house and hope not to be raided. the diffrence between minecraft and this is realistic graphics guns machinary and online interacting. If your computer is ment for gaming then the graphics are amazing me i have mac so i cant have the best graphics with out getting like 5 fps lol but i can play the game with good frames and good graphics. its completely open world multiple servers for best internet connection and of corse steam workshop.

2017-01-02,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,Not even worth the $13 I paid for it. Everytime I've tried to play I get disconnected right as I'm about to build my shelter and I lose everything. I also find the maps to be very overpopulated. It would be nice not to spawn in an area that is covered in other people's shelters. I was only attacked by other players a couple of times and then they healed me I'm assuming it's because I'm a girl so anyone who does like the game and isn't disconnected all the time should consider using a girl's name if they want to avoid being killed repeatedly. Oh and it's ridiculous that I'm chasing a pig with a rock and the bugger can run through all boulders and structures to avoid me.

Even doh this is an early access game i can strongly recommend it to any friend out there looking for something hardcore this game is a hard game and very frustrating for some people since you get killed and have to start over alot of times however if u meet the right people or find a good hiding spot your all set. Brings out the worst in humans this game and god do we love it.I must say i miss the females in this game i know alot of Female players would like to not be a dude my gf included and i hope that Rust will continue to update on a fast basis because of the gamebreaking bugs that sometimes bothers us all.All in all buy this game if u like the survivor fealing and like the rush of being hunted by players animals and everything else that whanna eat you or steal ur stuff. make friends and have fun. and remember its just a game a awsome game 8/10 because of the lack of options to change AA settings and also the spammers in chat can not be ignored.In rust we trust indeed ),Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game. It's unplayable. I've played on the official and unofficial servers. They're too laggy if there's more than 80 players on one. Most servers go up to 200 players. If you can find a low player server it's very boring but if it's a high player server you will get killed within 1 second to 10 minutes. If you're just starting and someone shoots with you a gun. That's it. You can't run dodge or hide. This is unlike Dayz where you can enter a building exit the other side of the building and hide somewhere or crouch in the grass. Also apparently there are a lot of hackers. I personally haven't seen it but that's what everyone complains in chat.The game itself is a similar to Minecraft with survival elements. Only there's a lot less building and a lot more searching for wood stones and animals to kill.I recently started playing this game again. It was fun but it's still unplayable due to the amount of people cheating the game.,Rust
2014-01-04,0,0,499,True,Recommended,You start out with a rock. That rock becomes your friend until you get more resources to make a hatchet. There is a definite DayZ mentality in this game.

HOWEVER if you wish to purchase this and hope to have something playable in the present buy something else and buy this in a while after a few patches fix the gamebreaking glitches and graphic errors that make this great game unplayable.

2015-02-24,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,"So i've never written a review but this needs one. I purchased the game maybe 4 days ago. SInce then I haven't gone more than 10minutes a game without being killed. Don't get me wrong I know the main description says ""survive"" however when you get into a game and every other person has a gun or bolt action there's not much you can do to enjoy the game. It's literally like playing a game with a bunch of serial killers. The game concept at it's core is wonderful and amazing I would love it if I could at least enjoy the process of building something at least. Seriously 15hrs and not once could I even amass enough to build a house without someone killing me for meat. Cause obviously it's much easier to kill a person for food than to catch the pigs and deer that run about. Either way idk thought it would be a fun game but turned into some for my experience not what I was expecting. Maybe it will fair you better or on the final release somethings will be different. Or best to play with some friends but not alone.",Rust
2014-04-26,0,0,246,True,Recommended,"This is by far one of the best survival games I've ever played. While having some disadvantages it is still 100% awesome. The way the game works is also stunning. Starting out with a rock some bandages and a torch you must fight off bears and wolves build a home craft eat and stay alive. You then pick it up get used to your surroundings and start travelling. Going far and wide even going on ""hikes"". Your house gets bigger your resources pile up and end game you've got yourself a massive home all the food you'll ever need tools and supplies and a secure home. At least ideally. It's a tough world on the rust island and meeting desperate people can have a big effect on your life. Get mugged shot on sight stalked back to your house or even some idiot who decides to crack into your house and steal all your goods. No game ever runs smoothly but that's good and adds a huge realism factor. The fact that this game is amazing and almost feels like a full game and is only in alpha makes playing it feel like it's going to be the best game ever. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND and hope that more people buy and support the amazing developers (Garry Newman aka Mr. Gmod is a developer).Head on over to the steam store and get this game right now! Totally worth the 20 USD.",Rust

2017-01-28,0,0,961,True,Recommended,This game features many kinds of people as you walk across the glorious land of sandbox called Rust. You meet necessarly two types of people sort of like college. You team up with two friends and typically one friend likes to do the homework and better the team however the other one just s around and waits for us to finish the homework. In this case the homework is considered resource hunting in rust which is an important key to the factor but in other case of the guy who s around until the homework is finished is the person who uses the materials just to raid. Typically these people who get on just to raid is wortheless af and dies too fast wasting your material. In any other cases the guy who only raids and jacks off at base.

2015-03-27,0,0,37,True,Recommended,I spawned into the world and built myself a shack on a mountain overlooking a road. My friends joined me and we had a small village complete with fires and storage boxes. The next thing we know we were given guns and armor by fellow players. Eventually we'd set up such a good trade agreement with them that they'd offered us a home. We lived there for a little bit while we gathered resources then they offered for us to move into a walled city. Protection? Stores? Larger house? All of these things beckoned for us to move in so we did. We figured it was good for us to log off for that night When we logged on the next day we were shocked to find that the village had been raided by a group of bandits. We quickly took our items out of the giant metal building we had and made our way back to our original shack village. The disappointment was overwhelming but we got our revenge when the bandits walked along our road. We had the guns and it was their turn to run.,Rust

2017-01-08,0,0,204,True,Not Recommended,It has a very interesting concept though the players will delete any reason you could casually want to play. The idea of constructing and building everything from your weapons to your base was very appealing and the idea of a sandbox pvp was neat. Everything uplifting ends there.

2017-06-30,0,0,494,True,Recommended,"Overall a great game but it would not be a review if I did not tell you why I think so let s begin.Rust is an amazing survival game that turns into a survive from players really fast when you get a base going. Animals are not easy to avoid but not hard either keep your distance Around a corner or behind a bush might be a wolf that you could not see be ready to fight back. Bears are OP as hell you will need a gun to stand a chance against one head on. The building system is gorgeus perhaps the best in survival games like these. The servers will restart from nothing between a week and a month depending on the server. With updates comes forced server restarts. So that is something to keep in mind on top of the fact that raiding other people and their bases is one of the main aspects of this game.Pros Amazing graphics great sounds excellent controls best building system perfect day and night cycle (IMO) quite balanced pvp You won t get bored since the servers restart and you get to start again. Tons of fun.Cons Terribly optimized WILL REQUIRE an gaming rig to play. Other people might lag on behalf of their crap internet connection possibly screwing you over in pvp or if they are running from you they might stay still for a split second from time to time letting you hit them with melee when in reality they should be out of your reach so a silver lining. Bears are (too op) advanced gun parts (ak bolt action rifle etc.) Are extremely hard to find at this point too rare IMO. Giving the players who have them an undoubted upper hand in pvp especially if they are in groups. You might get salty when people raid you and take everything or kill you when you have too much on you. Do not let the long con list scare you only the optimization hard to find parts are something you should consider.For 100+ FPS on fantastic graphics (best) you will need a 1060 6GB or better. (with 3GB you will need to tweak some things in your settings to get 100+ FPS on fantastic) Check if your build can handle the game at ""GameDebate"".",Rust

2017-06-30,0,0,56,True,Recommended,This is a fascinating game and while yes it can be a bit frustrating having to start over with progress once you are killed this game is fantastic as to understanding the variety of mental behaviors in this world. I have yet to run into somebody in the game that has not shown some form of aggression resulting in my demise. What I have learned is to hide and sneak and quietly gather resources. Creating or finding a home in the game is pointless and I have found a different system vs. building a home which eventually will just get broken into anyway. I often think my approach would be similar to what Robin Williams character had to do when he was trapped in Jumanji. Overall the game is great and with the weekly updates there is quite a bit of potential here. I would love to see some form of reward system if you befriend people or go for period of time without killing somebody. The senseless killing of people just spawning on the beach is unfortunate but does fuel the sensation of existence and survival. I love the concept and the fact that you do have to start over upon your death does keep people in check but also creates mass paranoia when you run across somebody.,Rust

I want to comment on the Developer who started in the right direction and then did a 180 in regards to gameplay and can pretty much go jump off a tall bridge as far as Im concerned. Im a gamer like all of you and im tired of some telling me what I would like seriously the original alpha of Rust that had stupid radioactive zombies in it (and I hate zombies) was 1000% better than the current hacker paradise that the developer has created. Great Job guys.,Rust

2016-08-10,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Quite possibly the least fun experience I've had in a steam game. The learning curve is quite steep and the server population is incredibly unfriendly. That's not even mentioning the time investment required to build yourself up to *some* sort of competitive level so you don't get murdered every 5 to 10 minutes. There are plenty of other games worthy of sinking time into where you *don't* lose all progress you've painstakingly built up.,Rust

2016-08-10,0,0,789,True,Recommended,I've gotten hundreds of hours out of this game. So its well worth the money.I'd be very surprised if it ever left early access (Whatever that actually means.. I paid money for it so its a product in my eyes). None the less its still very engaging and enjoyable.There is no endgame to this one just continual resets and retries. Which works really well. You'll bounce from server to server trying to find the perfect place to play and never find it but you have a lot of fun on the way.Must play with friends or a group and you must have an enemey or rival group. The legacy version was a lot of fun and the remake wasn't great for a while but its at point now where its very fleshed out and engaging.You'll definitely get your money's worth from Rust if you like aimless chaos crafting survival games.,Rust
2014-01-27,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Amazing game. Also very fun to play with friends but kind of boring playing alone. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games.,Rust

2014-01-27,0,0,260,True,Recommended,Its a really fun game but its hard to find the right server with balance of challenge and fun. Some servers are overrun with bullies and that's a real bummer. Mainly because it just makes me sad for the human condition that certain people feel so powerless in their real lives that they feel the need to spoil others' fun an a video game for kicks. Go ahead and try to find my base and try to break in. Its all in fun. If you succeed then its a challenge to me to build a better one next time. But preying on the weak and players who are truely no threat is sick and it turns my stomach to see it and read about it in chat. What's worse are the hackers and cheaters.So if you find a server with minimal hackers and minimal griefers its a rare find. Once you make it to the top you have all the blueprints all the guns tons of ammo and supplies and have everyone's respect then its just boring unless you turn into a bad guy yourself.There needs to be more of a challenge from the natural enviroment and less opportunity for griefing. I hear they are going to remove zombies. That will be okay as long as they are replaced with something more challenging like natural disasters disease or more fearce beasts (the bears and wolves are not much of a challenge after the first half hour of play).100hours in I'm looking forward to what comes next and I'm hopeful that these shortcoming will be addressed by the time the full game is released.,Rust

2014-11-07,0,0,268,True,Not Recommended,"Apart from the obvious KOS issues and (up until recently) no other enemies the game was actually quite fun. Bearing in mind that it used to have zombies (long gone) animals/mutant animals (also gone) there isn't really much to actually do. Coupled with the fact that anything you build degrades after a matter of days if you dont log in that side of things isn't much fun either. Not to mention that the constant recurring bugs need server wipes every 10 mins anyway.I've played a heap of Rust in its various incarnations and the idea behind it attracted me in that same way it did my friends. We had fun knowing that we were playing an unfinished version of the game and took the bugs in our stride. Not so long ago the original version of the game was shelved and replaced by the 'Experimental' version. The experimental game might aswell be called something else and have its own store page for what its worth. It simply isn't the same game. It was at this point that I realised the bugs were too big and too numerous to continue playing and coupled with the Dev's rather shocking attitude towards their customers I decided to uninstall and move on. Recently I thought that i might try and revise my opinion and give it another chance hoping that the bugs and gameplay had been fixed ... nope. I have a good friend who has paid to run a server (glad I avoided THAT money pit) and so I jumped onto his server for a looksee. I tried this 3 times over about 2 weeks. The first time I logged in I was greeted with a semi playable game that had promise but also had terrible terrible graphical flickering that really killed any kind of immersion so I logged out. The second time I logged in I was greeting with completely broken ground textures so the entire map was coated in a bland brown solid color so I logged out again. The third time I logged in when I thought 'Surely they've got this playable by now ... "" I found that the trees had huge sqaure wood like textures until you were about 2 metres from them so I logged out again. The final straw came yesterday when I jumped online and saw that the game had gone full circle and was now flickering uncontrollably all over the place. This was when I deleted it and decided to post this review.In conclusion I would strongly advise you to hold onto your money and not waste your time with this shocking peice of broken rubbish. Spend your money on a game like 'The Forest' where the Devs are actually doing something constructive and making a really nice looking game that puts Rust to shame. I know its in Alpha/Beta but don't even think about it until its 1.0 or later.",Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,89,True,Recommended,I would reccomend this game as I've seen a lot of gameplay and the concept graphics and execution seem great.However I'm running a Macbook Pro 8GB RAM 2.4GHz Intel Core OS X 10.7.5. No other programs are running I constantly make sure it's optimised through cleaning programs and removal of clutter but I cannot run Rust for the life of me.Render distane at it's lowest graphics set to 'Fastest' and tried all the resolutions. I managed to get it up and running once on one server and was rewarded with around 4FPS. So while objectively this is a great game my experience has been very poor.

2014-01-11,0,0,27,True,Recommended,"This is a long read but well worth it.. So I bought RUST on steam a few days ago now. Basically for the uninformed it's a game where you're put on an island with zombies and told to survive. You have to harvest wood stone and metal to make tools and weapons that get progressively more advanced. Now you can build a home but homes can be broken into and destroyed by other players while you're not even on the game. So you can make alliances and work with others but I hadn't seen very many people and decided it was better to be a hermit out in the boonies than in the middle of the map. So i'd run out collect materials and designs go home at dark and keep to myself while occasionally talking in the server wide text chat.So about an hour ago I was out and about looking for blueprints and loot when I got rushed and killed by a zombie in a radiation zone. I respawned at my house ran back and was killed again. Now since I had just respawned and you can only respawn at your house every 5 minutes I was panicking. I was then thrown into a randomized location and had essentially started all over. But my stuff was still out here and I was determined to get it back. So I figured out my bearings and ran only stopping to look out for zombies so they wouldn't chase me. I freaking made it and no zombies were hovering my stuff. YES! So I started taking my stuff trying to get it as fast as possible because I wasn't sure if it would disappear. After about 4 of five items had been transferred to my inventory I heard over the local chat(microphone so I could actually hear this guy talking) ""Why the do you and your goonies keep coming after me."" I bricks. I had been in such a hurry I hadn't seen this guy come up at me with an assault rifle. So he's aiming it at me moving around and I can't even see his name. He keeps talking ""So what is your freaking deal? What do you want?"" Now I'm such a noob I'm lucky I even could remember the microphone button. I'm lucky I have one! ""Uh I don't know what you're talking about pal. I'm just picking up my stuff. Who are you anyways?"" I look up and his name is now displayed over his head which it hadn't been before. I have never been so terrified to read the words ""Mr.YumYum."" Now Mr.YumYum was a guy who as far as I gathered killed some guy named Randy who had been making thirteen year oldish threats in all chat since. After a bunch of messages about it in all chat threatening him I later asked if some guy who Randy said he saw was hacking was ""Mr.YumYum."" So that was what he was referring to.Here is what happened over two or three VERY tense minutes.""Oh so you're that guy. Dude I don't even know who that guy is or what happened."""" t where are they.""""Seriously man I'm noob who's been hermitting in the corner."" Not sure I should of said that I'm alone. Too late now. I look down and keep looting my old stuff and talking to him just to distract him from me looting. My Geiger counter was now freaking out because I've just been standing there at gun point getting radiation poisoning. Not so wisely I decided to equip my radiation suit pieces to try and buy me time. ""IS THAT KEVLAR?!"" . I panicked and couldn't mash the voice button fast enough. ""NO NO NO NO NO NO RADIATION GEAR."" I looted the rest of my asap.""Listen i'm going to move myself out of the radiation over here. Just let me move over here."" He started following me still keeping me at gun point. Cool. Now I'm a hostage.So I moved like a hostage announcing every few seconds ""Still moving out of the radiation... Still moving... Still moving..."" til I reached safety. ""So...ummm... did you want my or something?"" ""Depends. Have anything good?"" ""Uhh... some flares? and...uhhh..."" ""What are you making?"" ""...what?"" ""What are you working on?!"" ""...nothing? Just....playing?"" He stopped... sighed... and started throwing on the ground. Weapons mods things I don't have yet. ""Oh...that's cool...oh...that's alot... uhhh..are those for me? Can I pick them up."" ""Listen you make an alliance with ANYONE else and I'll kill your family. And i'll them. Actually no I'll grape them."" I laughed at the joke the guy who just was about to rob me made. Wut. So he runs off and says ""Don't follow me"" and kept walking slowly fading out of voice range. So naturally i walked towards him to hear him better. To which he of course said ""Stop following me."" Dammit it. So I turned and RAN. I got aways turned around to see if he followed and then ran more. I did that a few time but nothing. Didn't see him. So I ran to my house. I was pretty happy. I was about to be robbed and the guy took such pity on me that he gave me Sweet. So I went over to my sister's room and told her about all of the above since i told her I was getting Rust or Dayz. When I came back I saw my name in the all chat. It was Mr.YumYum. He said he had some more and to meet him at this hanger in the middle of the map. I figured that sounded a bit dangerous but said fine. As a precaution I stripped all my gear and items and put them away. Right after I was done with that he mentioned to do that so i could carry more. Alrighty well i'm one step ahead. So I went to the metal door on my house opened it and was slightly confused. Why is Mr.YumYum outside my house kneeling down by the door with a shotgun?So Dani comes in and I go back to the door where I think the guy is. ""Alright so how do you want me to do this... Want me to open the door and give you the explosives stuff or...what?"" ""Open the door then walk to the back wall and stay there."" So id o as he says and he comes in aiming at me and goes box to box. ""Oh... Yeah I took the stuff you wanted out. I'll drop it."" So I drop the items in front of me and he comes over picks up some of it and then actually drops some of it back. ""Oh you don't want charcoal? Don't you use it to make gunpowder?"" Why am I ENCOURAGING THE MAN ROBBING ME TO TAKE MORE? ""Nah I have plenty."" ""Alrighty then well i'll grab it back."" He checks the last two boxes by me and says ""Well you have a few guns so that's not so bad. Here have these."" So he drops a 3/4 fully modded pistol some basic supplies and a few other things. ""That seem more like a fair trade?"" Considering I gave him enough stuff to make 4 5 pounds of C4 it isn't but it's not like I'm in any position to argue. ""Sorry for all the precautions but you can't tell who's genuinely nice or lying in this game."" Like people who give you things follow you home shoot at you when you go to leave and then rob",Rust

As I got into the game. I realised why I didn't like it in the first place. It's just crap a little hard and you're unable to choose what gender you want. Like sure. I like me some nips but I can't survive being naked and constantly getting killed over and over again by players who are O.P.

2017-02-01,0,0,2714,True,Recommended,So lets start this off.I got rust in very early stages. My friend Maximus otherwise known as PristineGame convinced me to get this game in I think 2013. At the start I wasn't very fond of the game (I was absolute ing trash). I never closed the doors behind me and I was overall . When the new version of Rust came out I didn't play much because Max's computer wasn't very good and it could not handle rust. In early 2016 My friend got a new computer and we starting playing rust all day everyday. To be fair the rust community is the toxiest community of all games. It's complete cancer. You've got groups of up to twenty people rolling around with full gear killing you every single time and then you've got the solo's who never succeed. If you're solo I'd recommend not buying this game because its honestly a team game. If you don't have friends you're not going to get very far with your experience. Overall I'd give this game a 10/10 it teaches you that YOU CANNOT TRUST ANYONE WITH ANYTHING because NOBODY IS FRIENDLY.

2016-07-06,0,0,98,True,Recommended,I think alot of the negative comments dont play the game to it's potentional. People are mad because they don't like the people they meet in rust. Rust is a Kill or be Killed game. Lose everything or die trying. A Sturdy base his hard to get and it's likely to be destroyed if you work slowly. Those who don't like the community... Don't play with them. Grab a few friends and fight amongst yourselves or surive. Personally I find playing against friends and everyone starting at the same time is much more fair and much more enjoyable.. And if you don't have money to buy this game or your friends don't You're probbably not old enough to play anyway. Bottom line. If you have a good group of friends play amongst eachother but only if you're willing to lose everything play worldwide. It's much more enjoyable to be killed by friends and try to get your stuff back then it is losing it permenatly in the multiplayer servers. PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!!!,Rust

2016-01-19,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,"Back in the day I actually ran/co owned a Rust server. Back then because there were no admin tools to detect cheaters I thought the easiest way to combat cheaters was to simply ""be"" a hidden cheater and walk around with a full inventory of loot with esp and god mode on and hide in a crevass somewhere where no one would even bother to visit.Sure enough as soon as I spawned and started walking to my position two individuals had started to follow me from a distance away. Changing direction did not help although I admit i was quite sneakily pretending to hit trees while watching their distances. Soon I went to my very very secluded location still keeping an eye on those individuals. They found me killed me took my loot. I respawned. They triangulated my position almost immediately and then killed me again this time laughing.Shortly after that I received a vac ban due to cheats detected on my system.I did of course contact support about this and tell them that I co owned a server AND had the receipt to prove it which was the reason behind the cheats.I was told that it is illegal to cheat and no exceptions would be made.I pretty much told myself that THAT was the last time I'd ever play an alpha or even buy an alpha through steam again (mainly PVP oriented dedicated server based games). The game was glitchy full of cheaters felt like a massive cash grab given that the reason for downloading cheats was actually for a noble cause. But not to matter how Steam wants to do business is their choice but that is BAD business.One Vac ban in over 6 8 years and with reason for an alpha game and you refuse to lift the ban or refund me money back then? Shame on you./Endrant.Potential for the game? Rating through gameplay from the Old Rust I'd say 7 out of 10.Steam running Alphas and not accepting that sometimes moderators of their own servers require 3rd party tools to administrate? 0/10",Rust

2016-02-23,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Overview Rust may seem just another average run of the mill multiplayer survival early access title you see pop up on Steam every now and then and for the most part you'd be right. However seeing the vast community that Rust has managed to put together and seeing it on sale I decided to give it a go and boy do I have a tale to tell! This game is both good great and horrible at the same time. Keep reading to understand why.Worth Noting I won't talk about really specific things as they are always subject to change. This will be a review of the overall experience you will get out of the game.The Pros Great Maps Each server has it's own procedural map (which you can see here) and it is pretty huge. Plenty of nice landscapes biomes and landmarks to explore. With different spreading of resources and rare goods spots.Powerful Crafting Crafting is intuitive takes time to do and offers many items to choose from and even more to risk your life gathering ingredients for. Brings the balance between a sandbox builder and shooter. Building your base is also a pleasant experience once you've gathered the resources.The Social Aspect If you don't have friends that play rust you're pretty much doomed if you can't join a clan or small group. Rust is ruthless with players jumping at each others' necks for survival. You will be hunted harassed and you are expected to do the same lest you risk being killed yourself. Teamwork and lack of trust in strangers are emphasized and crucially important here.Intense fights! When people get greedy they tend to rely on others to do the hard work for them. Enter raiding bases and defending your own. If you happen to be online when you are attacked raids are blood pumping scary but also tons of fun no matter on which side of the wall you are. Guns crossbows and explosives everywhere!Strategy Based Rust rewards brain over brawn. If you can make a good base design place your home somewhere strategic kill enemies from cover or even deceive them trap them etc. brings a whole world of rewards and will keep you alive for longer than flailing your assault rifle.Bi weekly Updates Even though this game has been in Alpha for 2 years now updates are rolling in about two times a week and it's nice to see a steady development flow. Still it may be unfinished for a long time but definitely playable nonetheless.Modded Servers Want to freebuild? Want to get all resources and just focus on killing? There are a lot of community hosted servers with mods just for that!The Cons Ruthless! Every one will try to kill you on sight no questions asked. Everyone will try to raid your base even though you just started. You will end up entering the game only to find everything you had stolen and your based turned to ruins. I myself with a group of 3 other friends just lost 50 hours of playtime each to an overnight raid which brings me to my next point Raiding is too easy! Once you get your hands on a few C4 and / or rockets raiding becomes too easy to perform and too hard to defend against. In order to have a well defended base you will need to sacrifice actual inside room if you want to actually be able to build it. Offline raiding (attacking once the players are offline) is also sadly available. You may have lookout towers and a lot of guns. But with no one to operate them you will lose 100%.Building Sucks! I said it's fun and it is but in order to combat abuse you are only allowed to remove structures you placed 10 minutes after you place them. If you notice a mistake or if you want to expand the building and say replace a wall with a door then tough luck buddy! You'll have to raid your own base. So start small think in advance stack resources and only build once you know what you want!Conclusion I recommend this game. It's fun and it's frustrating but it's fun because it is frustrating. Don't be afraid to lose and try to have fun! This game is great with friends and it has a very large community built around it!Early Access Disclaimer As with all Early Access titles I review I urge the reader to consider that this is an unfinished product and it can change for the best or for the worst during development. Unless you are happy about the current state of the game or want to support the developers then do not purchase this game. You run the risk of not liking it later / being abandoned and you will have only yourself to blame.,Rust

2016-08-18,0,0,288,True,Recommended,OK I originally had not recommended this game when the xp system was integrated but now that the component system is in the game feels a lot better and less spamming. I like it because you can get a big base together without even going into rad towns for loot you know all the blueprints so there is no need to visit rad towns other than to find gun parts. There are a few problems with the system as the clans can still camp rad towns with tower bases and patrol the perimeter but I like the challenge. Last week I was playing on a popular vanilla server and this large clan had both walls around the town and sniper towers. I was informed that there was a raid going on at the town so I went to see if I could snag any gear. In the middle of the raid a helicopter came and started to kill everyone and just blow up. I was able to get away with 5 bolt actions 2 aks and even some c4.The next day I log on to notice I was offline raided. The only problem with the component system is that once you lose your good gear thats it. you have nothing left really to live for because all your gear was taken and to get revenge you would need to join a clan or convince other people to help you. At least when the blueprint system was a thing when you were raided you could still craft guns and the like but now you need gun bodies. The gun bodies are so rare and hard to find that you will spend so much time running around looking for them and what if you die? You lose absolutely everything.I have thought and wondered for some time why they just can't go back to the blueprint system. This entire component system is a good idea but not polished. My solution would be to make gun parts easier to find or just not need the gun bodies at all just springs metal pipes and so forth.8/10 game right now.,Rust

Everyone eventually got a hold of a weapon and some armor some liked to play with the Bows and Arrows. I played house essentially while Dad (Bunthai) did all the construction. The kids were suicidial and sadistic they threw rocks at eachother shot eachother killed eachother.... I went to get food and water but then one of the kids changed the water box to the ""P I S S"" box. Then someone filled the bota with... Not water that's for sure... I took a sip and my character puked in game lost hp hunger etc. Eventually it got to the point where there was ""too many cooks"" and that was terrible yet fun. I had lost interest soon after because the kids put in some work and so did the Dad of course. The Tower hasn't been raided since that first day note it's been about 4 weeks since I've played.

I'm 21 I don't have much time to play games as much as I want to or did years ago. This game is so much fun but the fact that the entire game is run by people under the age of 18 is just annoying. It's near impossible to survive on your own in the game without running into another player who is clothed and has weapons.

Simple because no multiplayer pvp game is fun when you die to aimbots and other such things. Since that time there has been a good deal of improvement to prevent those things.

2016-11-30,0,0,83,True,Recommended,50 hours into this game and it feels like 50 minutes.I jumped on the 'Day z' hype train when it came out and first decided on 'Day z' over Rust. What a mistake.Rust has devs! IT HAS PEOPLE WORKING ON IT TO MAKE IT A BETTER GAME.Every week guess what? UPDATES the devs improve it as they should it's an early access game. The game looks wonderful there are multiple game modes (battle royale is a great one) and you can actually play without glitches certain other games promoted as early access feel as if they will never actually be released (dayz uhemm) whereas rust is growing and becoming a finished game as you play it.Cons Some of the community is young many 13 year olds running around. Also at a high level the community normally has no problem with simply killing you on sight. No XP anymore so if you die and lose your base you are essentially back at square one.I am not worried about these cons though as the team have already demonstrated they have their eye on it. For example the XP update where you carried XP after death. That didn't work and was removed recently but it still shows the team are listening and able to implement and try different things to help this game get into 'Beta'. Spoilers for anyone with DayZ it will unfortunately never be in beta as it's broken from the engine upwards. Spend your money on this instead I wish I had first time.Overall fun game would reccomend.,Rust

I think the C4 is the main reason there are bandits on servers.I find it really hard to find a friendly player so i prefer to play this game solo. I especially hate bandits who kills on sight I dont like the decay mechanic because if i go out on a vacation in another country then come back all of my stuff will be gone cause i didnt play the game in less than 12 hours.

2014-01-31,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,"This game had a bunch of potential and who knows maybe it still does. But the problem I have is that it would never connect to community servers before eventually not connecting to the dedicated ones either. The updates aren't as frequent as they need to be to fix many of the issues (and yes it is in alpha so most issues are forgivable). This is not a game for casual players.... or rather any player who has a life of any kind away from the keyboard. The staff at Facepunch are usually unresponsive on the forums and when they are they are rude and argumentive (""players don't get to decide how the game is meant to be played we do. And Rust isn't meant to be played in a way that punishers greivers."")I won't reinstall this gam until they allow you to play private games with just you and your friends so I don't have to worry about things like sleepers greivers crap connections and all of that.I cannot recommend the game in it's current state nor would I encourage you to support Facepunch.

However there is a major issue with the game right now. Currently my rig exceeds the minimum requirements and the game has a bug that legitimately makes it unplayable any bugfixes from the community have only lead to more problems freezing or inability to connecting to servers and the kicker is instead of the devs posting anything about fixing it I see them playing TF2. Considering refunding the purchase because this game has been out for quite a while now and if you look in the forums this isn't the first time people have had this issue. I know they've put some major investment into this game but I feel like they aren't taking this seriously when we're still having this issue almost two years down the line it's very disappointing and I feel as if this is STILL one big money grab despite the games popularity.,Rust

You cannot make your own server which is the begining of all the problems I have with this game. Wouldn't matter if there was a single decent server to join into but all of them have the same problem sparse animals few buildings and anything you build is likely to disappear. I gave this game a solid chance about a year ago when I first bought it. It was OK but I had trouble even surviving because there were so few animals. I just gave it a try again and it's even *worse* and I didn't think that could be possible. Finally found some animals and good loot built up a nice base only to have it disappear overnight. My bad I should have known that anything I make in another server isn't guaranteed. What's the point of building at all?This is a game where you run around hit trees with a rock and try desparately to find a boar or deer to kill (all of which drop ""wolf meat"" btw).

Yes this is a KOS game but thats what it was created for. if you want an Admin to baby you whe someone kills you go play ARK. The description od the game tells you to kill people for their meat so what were you expecting? This game does have a few glitches. every animal can run through rocks which can be frusrating but in no way does it ruin the game. You will have to look out for people running scripts that give the weapons they use little no no recoil. Besides that this is an amazing game if youre not a baby and want some good pvp.

2016-12-06,0,0,432,True,Recommended,Playing on unofficial servers is easier as there are less people out to get you. Playing on Official servers seems more rewarding but many players kill you just because they can. On unofficial I recommend you use the many mining machines and large furnaces already available (by other players) rather than build your own. Keep a small base but you'll probably be raided anyway (because they can...) not that you have anything worth taking. After you're sick join a private server.,Rust

2016-07-11,0,0,1017,True,Recommended,Okay so.. 800+ Hrs since early legacy days. I watched this game evolve. It is a fun game with great devs that are really putting the work in. On this basis I reccomend the game.But there are caveats. If you are going to buy it buy it with a couple of friends at least 3 5 of you. Solo players and small group have no chance of getting anywhere. Rust has currently way beyond anything in legacy degenerated into a clan game. He with the biggest team wins. Which isn't nessercarily a bad thing in such a sandbox game. But if you are one or two.. or three or four five players you will still get dicked by a clan period. Hours of your time in resource gathering gone to a clan that won't even profit that much from raiding you + With the difficulty it now takes to raid and with the new XP system clans just have an unrerasonable edge with no draw backs to balance the game. Not to mention the game is currently totally unoptomised so all the decent server wipe their maps weekly. So we're in a situation where the first two days of the week are stupidly busy and unplayable. Two or three days mid week are good healthy play. And then the last 2 or 3 days of the week it's a ghost town. It's not great.I really hope the devs intend to address these points. Eitherway espcially if you pick it up on sale with some friends you'll get your moneys worth. But bare in mind it can be rather frustrating.,Rust

2013-12-27,0,0,358,True,Recommended,"The game has promise. Aside from the connnection issues and the abusive players gameplay has the potential to grow into something explorative and entertaining at the same time. There has to be a system where newly spawned characters / players can have some leeway from being targeted by the already established players like a ""safe zone"". Mechanics wise of course there has to be changes like farming the right materials from the right places. But building up your own camp and expanding your aresenal to meet your daily needs is vastly immersive and you can lose hours trying to survive. Feasible for gameplay for solo or alliances just watch out for your back and lock your doors.EDIT DON'T BUY IT YET. If you decide you're going to buy don't play yet. The player base has taken on the culture of KOS (Kill On Sight). This means that any new player / spawn will die instantly since most of the current players are already established and will have firearms already. There are server wipes often but that doesn't change the fact that players will KOS and raid others on an hourly basis. If you want to try it out I suggest a NO PVP server at least. THIS GAME NEEDS FURTHER BALANCING.EDIT 2 Hey it's been 2 years since my last review. Buy it. It's good now. Turn off the censor for some realistic teabagging. Level up by hitting a tree with a rock.

2016-07-12,0,0,61,True,Recommended,07JUUN2016 Patch update TL DR the patch introduced an XP system. The difference now is if you enjoy being a loner occasionally you have to wait even longer to craft what you need to fend for yourself because now your restricted by Level and XP while people in OP gear still prey on you. Feels like a stab at people who enjoy the thrill of PVP play and dont have the time to dedicate to this XP system combined with servers adopting quick wipe turnarounds. HOWEVER... theres still modded servers to play on and theres plenty fun in that as well. Overall Yes the community is Toxic.... but what do you expect out of a multiplayer rogue like that starts you off as some rock chucker with nothing to his body but his swinging d**k?If your dont have thin skin and need something to buy during a sale id recommend it. Yes its dumb but its dumb fun. I can take it serious and try to craft while watching my a*ss from bears wolves and people who like to scream over their mics in the darkest of night as they run up on you.... or I can turn it around and be just as weird stalking people through the bush before I spear them and eat them alive.The game dosent really hold your hand and theres good players and bad players. You'd probably have more fun playing it in a group of your own friends because the game dose certainly seem to favor those with a pack mentality. Till then... Ill be be hiding my tallywacker in the bushline playing Tiny Tim softly through the mic as I wait for you to split from your group.,Rust

2016-12-09,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I can see the fun in this game but at the same time way to much I didn't like. I think I have been spoiled with ARK and just didn't give Rust a fair chance. It would probably be more fun with friends also. But I started solo on for the first 30 minutes on a normal server all I did was load in to be killed by a guy with a rock.. Like 5 times. I found a PVE server out of suggestion but it was just lame. I ran around for like 40 minutes and couldent find anything to hunt or kill. I personaly did not like this game over the other mintioned BUT I can see others getting enjoyment out of it. I wont play it again though.,Rust

2016-12-07,0,0,1492,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is not for casuals. In the sense that if you dont put in the time you wont really be able to compete. However should you find yourself having lots of free time on your hands its a great game. Its rough as a solo player and i highly recommend finding a group to play with although over time playing solo gets easier its still better to play in a group. Dont go into the game thinking people will help you though its common knowledge that everyone gets shot even if you are naked with just a rock simply because they dont know whether that's you just trying to look like a fresh spawn while running with lots of loot or not. Pros Decent graphicsDecent gunplayTons of fun in larger groupsGood crafting systemCons Solo players are always at a disadvantageNot suited for casualsNot suited for easily offended people,Rust

Game is missing any sort of direction beyond grinding to be the first with guns to raid others with guns. Now this is a lot of fun but gets old at almost 1000 hours. PVE options would be nice but that's not something they will implement. I'd like them to add more opportunities to interact with people such as a trading system or currency so people have options beyond kill on sight.

2016-12-27,0,0,178,True,Recommended,Rust is a fantastic game with some really intense moments. There are two things you need to know before playing the game one KOS means kill on sight this will happen to you a lot. The second most important thing about rust is to make friends. The game is so much better when you have an ally or two you can rely on. Other than this players are brutal cruel and savage. Feels a lot like the hunger games with guns. Pros Intense pvp combatShooting naked people Great gun design Good survival mechanics (food water cold comfort)Base buildingCons KOS is really popular right now Getting base raided while offline,Rust

2015-11-28,0,0,376,True,Not Recommended,"EDIT You can tell I was pretty butthurt from a day of getting destroyed in this game when I wrote this but regardless my points still stand.I am being 100% honest when I say I could only recommend this game to you if you want to role play as a fugitive in a free fire warzone. Rust was a fun although very unpolished game when it was initially ""released"". Then Facepunch decided to start adding more and more guns and explosives and less and less survival oriented items with every new update. This effectively changed Rust from a multiplayer apocalyptic survival game as it was initially advertised and hyped up to be into a high stakes free for all PvP focused first person shooter with survival elements.It doesn't help at all that the community for this game is the worst and most toxic I have ever seen for any peice of media ever. If you play on a regular server you can only hope to chop down one or two trees and maybe mine one rock before being shot in the face for no reason other than whoever shot you was bored. On the other hand if you play on a low population server and have no human opposition the game is easy and monotonous because its designed to be played with other people. Unless you are playing with a bunch of freinds or you wait for the server you are playing on to get wiped you will never be able to catch up to the other players. Even if you do you will most likely be killed at some point and wind up in the same situation again. I like permadeath in games when I die because I made a mistake or a wasn't skilled enough to handle the situation. I know I can just start over and do better next time. I don't like it when I lose days worth of loot because someone sniped me from a mile away for cutting down his favorite tree and I can't start over because he is still in the sniping spot with my stuff when I respawn.If not for the community (and micro transactions in an unfinished game) I might have recommended it. The gunplay and crafting/building mechanics are solid the graphics are good and overall it seems like it could have a lot of potential. However games are supposed to be fun and Rust in my opinion is just not.",Rust
2016-12-09,0,0,101,True,Not Recommended,"Good game with good idea and even more ideas coming over time. It's fun building upgrading and then having your own home. Then procceding to getting armed. I don't mind bugs and even after all that I have said I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's becoming pure garbage just because of it's community. I played countless mmorpg's or online shooting games since kid. I have never seen anything like that. League of legends and CSGO were games where I seen some things but Rust community is the winner.As new guy you can't make a step. Even if you have nothing in your inventory some guy will chase you across the map just to kill you. You can run unarmed and then group of fully geared people will shoot you and loot what ever you have. Base raiding is awful. They will get in take everything and before leaving block all the exits so you wouldn't be able to leave that place or enter it.For people starting in a server that was wiped one week ago is death sentence. Everyone is fully armed walking around and killing harmless players. They take and destroy everything you have or make then maybe even throw some insult your way. Everyone chases and shoots at you for no reason then give excuse ""It's rust"".At times It can be fun game and potential for it is big but then you get slaped in a face by some clan that will blow your one floor house and take that few wood you have.I have never seen more awful players in any other game. And I can't recommend it until community becomes far better or there is a system that protects players on a new server for atleast a day.",Rust

2016-12-09,0,0,355,True,Recommended,Terrible community nazis toxics racists. Fun with friends / clan. My tips Try not to take every death so seriously start to accept punishment as a part of the play this is a game for sadists and masochists. Watch a few beginner guides before you get started. Join a clan who will teach you asap. Trust no one. I like this game but I totally understand people not liking it I reccomend it to people who take a look and decide this is the kind of game they are interested in. Do expect incompleteness and glitchiness etc It has been like that for more than a year.,Rust
2016-12-09,0,0,166,True,Recommended,Awesome game even in its Alpha stages. It's true that the community is generally hostile and kill on sight style but that seems to be how the game was intended to be played it is after all a survival style game. If the hostile PvP enviornment is not your thing there are plenty of servers that offer different features including servers that are strictly PvE (Player vs Enviornment).The game has a bit of a learning curve but there are plenty of websites out there that really help you get to know the game and a quick Google search will answer any questions. It's a great game and i'm excited to see what the developers bring next but i already feel like i got my moneys worth plus much more.,Rust

Even when they first added the new biomes and such I was like ""okay no big deal just took my fps down a little but it looks pretty damn nice."" But the deeper I got into the newer version the less I liked it. It lost almost all the good qualities the original had. In the original I had no trouble getting 60 FPS in most cases on max settings. When they added the biomes I got usually 30s 50s which is fine in my opinion. But the latest rust is HORRIBLY optimized! I get 10 FPS on lowest settings and I have an 860M GPU. Hackers were a problem and being able to be robbed while you have commitments to do in real life doesn't help the equation. Overall this was a great game when it first came out but now I just can't find hardly anything of the original good stuff left. I do not recommend you buy this.",Rust

Not for the faint of heart or those looking for a casual game. It is outstanding for only being 10% finished if you don't like glitches don't buy it till it's finished but if you are stubborn enough to deal with glitches hackers and frustrating deaths by all means buy it!!! It is great keep up the good work.,Rust
2014-02-03,0,0,196,True,Recommended,Fantastic game if you like feeling on edge at all times you will only feel safe on this game once you have built a fortress/house and it is tall enough to put off potential raiders (though this can also attract them). Even then you will feel compelled to log back in to see if your fortress/house has holes blown in it and your loot has been stolen.This game really does encourage strength in numbers mentality whether you are being helped by an established player to set up your house or if you are the one mentoring a new player the constant threat of being ambushed or raided by other players adds atmosphere to this otherwise tranquil game setting.This game is only in alpha at the moment but with all of the updates it is likely to get this game will be huge (even more successful than it already is) and the community that will grow around it will make or break it.,Rust

2013-12-27,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,Do you recommend this game? Not currently. Which pains me to say this because my intention was to get 4 5 of my friends playing it with me. Writing this reveiw won't encourage them to play to say the least.The gameplay is very interesting and the game itself is very mysterious. There is no map and you have no compass. You basically need to familiarize yourself with the game world which can make grouping up fun.PvP isn't as bad as most people say but getting to the point where you can start having fun is a huge curve. Challenging gameplay to me is fun and weeds out people you don't want to play with. I spent too much time trying to find a animal to kill. They do need more of these available. This game has great potentiol but they are not focusing on some key aspects.My problem? The servers and the menu. This is the worst main menu and server setup that I have seen to date. Please invest time into this aspect of the game so that I can actually play the game. It is kind of annoying when you pay money for something you can't play. I did read the disclaimer that the game is still in alpha some things work and some things don't. I didn't expect that to mean that I wouldn't be able to play the game. Logged in today and my previous servers were not full and now I can't connect to any server in the whole game. My guess is it is the menu system being buggy.Official servers you were on prior are always full at peak hours. Not only that but the refresh server button has never worked for me. I did notice new servers pop up that had larger capacities so I got excited. It is just annoying having to restart the game to see if someone left a server you were previously on.With that being said if things I mentioned do not frustrate you then invest money in the alpha version of this game. It will be worth it once the kinks are worked out. Honestly I am dieing to learn how to play better but I always move onto another game after fussing with the stupid menu for 15 minues and not finding a server that I can join.,Rust

Unlike Castaway (which has a rather pleasant ending) this game does not. I've played 10.5 hours so far and my greatest achievement across 4 different servers is my collection of wood from hitting a tree with my rock. I managed to get a few pumpkins and wear one as a hat. Unfortunately other than a pumpkin on my head I never was able to make much more clothing than a pair of leather boots before a 7 year old shot me from a tower displaying a sign with the rough sketch of male genitalia on it.I'll probably try again.,Rust

2016-07-20,0,0,605,True,Recommended,When people ask me about Rust I'm never really sure where to start. Sure it's a survival shooter and base builder sim and a damn good one at that but it's so much more than that thanks to emergent gameplay and the variety of mods. This comes on top of the fact that Rust's development is so continuous and transparent (devblogs trello dev plans reddit interaction source control commits public on twitter and so much more) which is always great in early access games. Don't be fooled by that label either Rust is a fully playable and fairly polished experience with an immense community not some broken half built side project.For those of you who haven't actually seen the gameplay I recommend digging up some YouTube videos from the last month or so. The game changes so quickly that anything before then is likely to be out of date in terms of game mechanics particularly with the recent XP system.If you're not so big into video reviews I'll give you a short description of gameplay. You start naked (and I mean naked) with nothing more than a rock and a torch. You run around probably get chased by other nakeds with rocks and try not to die. The world is huge you have no map or compass no GPS and only landmarks and the geography to guide yourself by. You bash your rock against some trees to get wood. You see some lumps of stone you bash those to get stone. You pick up hemp plants for cloth mushrooms for food and if you're lucky you might find a pig that you can chase down and butcher for meat. You build a camp fire you cook the meat you eat it your food and water bars jump up a little. It's getting dark and someone with a bow sees your campfire... you're forced to make a hasty getaway down a hill and hide in a bush until the arrows stop flying past. Eventually you brave it out but it's now pitch black and you're forced with a dilemma light your torch to see your way around but risk being spotted and hunted down or fumble around in the dark and hope you don't wander off a cliff or into the mouth of a bear. You manage to find a small archway to hide under until daybreak. You've been bonking things with your rock for a bit and you've gained enough XP to level up! You can now spend some of that XP on unlocking better tools and some clothes. You make a hatchet some cloth pants and go back to farming some materials. You get enough to build a small base. You craft yourself some paper then a building plan and a hammer. You build a small two by two base with foundations then walls and a doorway and finally a roof. You craft a wooden door then a lock and place them. Ah secure. Down goes a sleeping bag as a respawn point in case the worst should happen. You craft and place a small wooden box to store some spare loot you don't want to get caught out with a pile of ore and stone on you if you get shot at! Now that's all done you can feel safe. Right?Footsteps and rustling outside. Then another set. It goes quiet then you hear some jumping then the sound of wooden structures being erected. Silence for a second followed by footsteps... from above? They're on the roof! Thunk. An arrow? Thunk! Another! Then more two three at a time. You're being raided. Not long before they break through your roof. You craft a wooden spear frantically watching the craft timer tick down seconds seeming like minutes. Finally it completes and you equip it. You're nervous. You crouch walk up to the door spear in hand in the throw position. You open the door and get blasted in the face by a pipe shotgun. The respawn screen appears. You click your bag to respawn but before you even make it back in game you've had a hatchet stuck through your head and your sleeping bag has been cut into pieces. Your loot is gone. Bastards even took the key and stole your front door.You respawn back at the beach. You carry on though you've still got your XP and level. You farm your way back up and this time when you build your base you add a second door as an airlock to make sure they only get the loot on your body if the front door is compromised when you die. You learn about tool cupboards and place one down to prevent people building near your base. You even manage to farm a load of stone and upgrade your base to prevent arrow raiding then get a furnace going to produce metal fragments and sulphur and get yourself a nice metal door and code lock (those keys are so annoying to manage!). You've got a crossbow a bow clothes a bit of armor and even a pipe shotgun with a few shells. Things are looking good. But wait... footsteps outside again. And what's that beeping sound? Before you know it an explosion rips a hole in your wall and you're blasting the interlopers with your pipe shotty and skewering them with arrows. But it is too much and you fall. Your bag is destroyed and your loot is being pilfered but this time you built a little 1x1 shack up the road with a bag and a small box of supplies. You leap back into the game arm up with a few stone spears and a bow and jump the raiders from behind. You get some kills in but the commotion has drawn the attention of a roving clan and you (along with the raiders) get mown down by AK 47 fire.You respawn back at the beach this time on the other side of the map. You're running through a small forest while farming and spot another player. They see you. Your instinct is to run but you have nothing to lose so you jump up and down repeatedly as part of the internationally understood friendly greeting. They crouch for a moment unsure of you but then return the gesture. You have a brief chat your voices broadcast locally to the surrounding area. A crossbow shot flies between you and you both scarper into a nearby maze of rocks. You quickly erect a small shack and both take shelter. The enemy appears to have lost you for now so you gingerly explore the surroundings for any sign of them. Nothing around. Your friend suggests teaming up to make a base. A wise move with twice the farming rate you could have a nice big base with honeycombed walls multiple floors lots of doors and double the active defense. Before long this dream is becoming a reality and you're both high enough level to take on passing aggressors and small raid parties. You decorate your house with paintings you build a tower with a sniper's nest and overhanging positions to shoot down from. Your base is fortified with metal and stone and you even save up enough sulphur and animal fat to make your own raiding supplies. Your friend brings another online so you're now a group of three. You decide to go out on a raid.You're on your way to the airfield when you spot a small two by two wooden base. Ordinarily you'd ignore it but as you sprint past you notice you're not building blocked. A foolish move! You here a couple of steps inside... oh someone's online. This could make for some fun. Your friends build a foundation and staircase up the side and you all hop onto the roof. One keeps watch of the door while the others fire arrows into the flimsy wooden surface. A moment later the door opens. The poor inhabitant doesn't stand a chance against the shotgun blast to his face. The loot inside is yours. You take a moment to reflect on how not so long ago that would've been you.,Rust

2014-02-03,0,0,279,True,Recommended,Great game and has a lot of potential. Right now it's almost not worth playing as the community is quite negative. Trolling insults etc seem to be common language in the global chat (which I wish didn't exist). Running (holding shift) in this game is extremely nauseating as you bob back and forth unrealistically. It was so bad I had to quit playing and I don't even get motion sickness in real life. Also for some reason you feel like a smurf as you are extremely close to the ground. The world seems bigger that way I guess? Blades of grass tower over you as you can't see. This game is in alpha still so all of this could change and hopefully does. The game could be incredible if they started applying a bit more common sense to their game.,Rust

2016-12-19,0,0,746,True,Recommended,"Do you want to fight people to death in a realistic survival setting?! Well hell do i got news for you!You can stab shoot eviscerate eat burn explode and slice your enemies like never before! (Yes eat!)This game is god damn beautiful and nothing is better than getting a spear jammed in your head and all your hard earned loot stolen while the sun sets. Actual review Words to know Zergs Players that rely on numbers and not skill or techniqueNow i've played this game a lot the past few weeks with my buddies and on my own so let me give you the verdict here If you're playing on your own let me tell you right now you are going to have the most motherf***ing stressful time playing this. Now this is due to a few reasons the first being that people in groups will abso f*cking lutely ruin your life (because i've had mine ruined) but put on your big boy panties because your going to have to team up with other solo players as well and this time you're going to be doing the 'life ruining'. I don't understand the hate towards the community of this game since here in asia we're all huggy and lovable but there are those big clans that dominate the servers like in any server of rust. So if you're a solo player should you buy rust? Depends if your going to roll over and cry the first and 20th time you get screwed over by zergs then no dont buy this game.Alright so you made it this far into the review give yourself a pat on the back you managed to grow a pair. So you and a couple of buddies want to buy rust go right ahead nothing is more satisfying than hearing your enemies screaming in pain as you take all their loot with your buddies. Seriously buy this game. Even if you and your friends dont take the game seriously i've had the most fun bashing my friends' faces in with a bloody rock as they impale me with a spear. You don't have to take this game seriously and throw away countless hours just to have someone break in your house and steal all your sh*t. You can even make a blasted guitar and run around the entire server singing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and you can get fun out of that. SO! SHOULD YOU GET THIS GAME? HELL YEAH YOU SHOULD! (only if you're willing to go through with all the crap mention above cheers!)",Rust
2016-12-19,0,0,3105,True,Recommended,Started with RUST 3 years ago. This game was a lot of fun to me back then. When it was ugly glitchy and with very few things weapons items and radtowns. Playing game for 3 years and watching it growing strong each week with updates fixes and new content is something very rare these days. It was lot of fun 3 years ago. And its even more fun today. Map keeps its standard with snowy and rough north forests in the middle section and dry desert in south and it is never the same map as it is changing after each reset. After all those updates and tweaks this game looks amazing feels amazing and it is source of endless entertainment. It is highly addictive and time consuming but I still highly recommend this game.,Rust

2014-04-01,0,0,1687,True,Recommended,LEGACY ALPHA REVIEW(2013)After playing this game for 5 hours If I had to describe this game in 1 word that word would be Amazing although this game is in its alpha stage I love the game itself knowing its in Alpha makes me more excited about the entire game itself my experince was amazing I started off knowing a little knowledge about the game from youtube and I ran into a kid who kept singing a song and stareing at my guy I asked him what he was doing he pulled out a rock then I knew I was going to be killed so I told him to leave me alone and he kept singing and hit me so I decided to have some fun with this so I decided to sing with him and we ended up having a bunch of people to sing with us evertime we ran up to them it was funny! this game beats Minecraft by far this game is truely one of a kind and amazing I must thank the developers for making this game and to keep up the good work this game is amazing and worth spending the money on it is time consuming and anything can happen.Pre Release Review (June 2016) After a long wait to being able to play this game since the lack of optimization it has been optimized better for low spec pc games since the previous version of rust the version that is currently stable cant run on my PC I am more then happy to say the pre release is great for low end PC's this game has came a long way since the legacy alpha and has been growing each and every week with amazing new features and new things added to the game I have hundreds of hours in this game and I enjoy every moment of this game this has got to be one of my favorite games.WHY GET THE GAME?The game has so many different branches to play this has legacy (for low low spec pc's) which is a old version of rust from 2013 which is still popular and very fun to play as well as a pre release version of the game which is still booming with great population and great servers if you enjoy survival games which you have to avoid getting killed from animals starving to death or getting to wet or cold you'll love this game all that packed into some PVP is amazing the weapons on this game are great the graphics are amazing and the community well.. lets just say don't trust the naked or ANYONE!!! one minute you'll feel like your ontop of the world next your base is being raided and your back to work great game and one of the best survival games ever release!,Rust

2016-12-19,0,0,1382,True,Recommended,I Have about 1000 hours logged in Rust. This game is absolutely fantastic. Now that blueprints are gone and the component system is in full swing (which is how i think the game should have been set up from the start) it is better than ever. People and moan about the community but lets face it you're gaming on the internet. No community is great. If you are turned off by frustration and easily scared off by having to actually put work into a game DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL HATE IT. Rust requires you to be able to shake off your failures and start over (sometimes from the very beginning) to persevere. It is possible to play solo but i strongly recommend that unless you are an experienced gamer with lots of time on your hands that you start with a friend(s). Read some guides on this game before you play it. I would also recommend starting on vanilla and migrating to modded servers once you figure the basics of the game out. If you think this will be like ARK where you just build a town and train dinosaurs and raid the one or two outliers think again. Rust will have you waking up in the middle of the night to check and see if that guy you shot earlier today is now climbing in your windows or c4ing your doors downAmazing game if you dont love it stop playing it and GTFO so we can get this sucker out of EA!,Rust

When you don't know what you are doing you may give up within the first five hours dud to having you crap base being raided or you generally suck at PvP and I gave up on Rust for half a year for that exact reason. WATCH VIDEOS ON RUST TO LEARN HOW TO DO THINGS. After you know what to do the game really picks up and it becomes outragously fun. Find a few friends and play with them to make it 100X better. 9/10 would recomend. And hell it's only 20$.Side note. Don't be afraid to lose your loot if you don't bring guns with you your chances of death are much higher and what's the point of guns if you don't use 'em ),Rust
2016-12-19,0,0,893,True,Recommended,&gt &gt THE REAL TRUTH &lt &lt THIS GAME INCLUDES PVP and i mean real pvp. BAD REVIEWS are flooding in but let me tell you you get what you give in Rustland. If you play 1 hour every couple days be ready to never log back into what you built it will be gone. NOT A BAD COMMUNITY just what you are playing. It is what it is and i want whatever it is even if you put a door between it and I. (BOOM) I see people mad they die alone and naked. fyi it doesnt show if you have a shotgun on you unless you pull it out so dont expect any friends at all they will kill you just in case. YOU MUST GROUP and if no one wants you as a new player or clan member you usually only gain entry into good clans from respect and we all know how to earn that &gt &gt PVP &lt &lt and generally friending through steam or VC to see if you are weird or a child children tend to wreck bases so expect 0 friends outside of real life on rust. IF YOU LIKE CHALLENGE AND HAVE STONE SKIN LIKE A TRUE MAN then this place is unforgiving as hell and will have you fighting many different ways to stay alive. ** if you are afraid of losing something in this game then i wouldnt play because you can lose everything often.

2016-01-23,0,0,1747,True,Not Recommended,This game used to be extremely fun. Sadly the community has turned to cancer and optimization is comeplete There was already enough content in the game. All they need to do is get rid of the component system and add back the BP system. That was what made rust fun. Not a garbage XP system where clans have slaves that farm for them all day. Not components that completly get wiped after a week or month and go back to square one. It simply isn't fun to go around and get components and then FARM for all the raw materials to get a semi auto pistol that everyone uses. Finding someone with a rifle is isanely rare. Unless they are up on thier roofs. Then EZ they kill you and get your Semi. Noice. Get your heads out of your asses devs. Don't listen to these 100 hour roleplayers with ideas for the game and take away from the community that has followed you for longest. Open your eyes and realize that the hardcore players will always be the majority you should care about. Don't lose kill roots if you don' want the tree to die.,Rust
2013-12-28,0,0,201,True,Recommended,Probably the best alpha I have ever played if you like Minecraft garry's mod and DayZ then this is all those games rolled into one. It is a post apocalypse style game when you start off butt naked in the wilderness where you basically have to survive the elements. Wild bears and wolves attack aswell as the odd deformed human (zombie) creatures. These arent the main threat though the main threats are from the other players in your world.,Rust
2013-12-28,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Loved the feel and the idea of the game in the little time I had to play it but I m unsure whether it's due to the low specs of my computer or the massive ping times but as an Australian it might be a good idea to try and get a server here if possible as its likely to bring in more players. But anyway I would absolutely recommend this game.,Rust
2013-12-28,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,You know what the best part about playing a game is? ACTUALLY GETTING TO PLAY IT.

When I do survive somehow I manage to get raw chicken meat out of beating a WOLF with a ROCK only to bleed out 10 seconds later with absolutely nothing I can do about it! The rest of the time I keep trying different servers never ever able to log in. I guess I'll just wait till they polish this turd since I done wasted my hard earned money. Until then I'll continue to play DayZ Standalone. That game is in Alpha and still makes this game look like complete and total crap. This is like Minecraft 3D minus the FUN. It sucks!,Rust

This is a really tough survival game and i don't mean from the environment. Survival from the elements is quite easy in the game. It is survival from the other players that make this game difficult. If you are alone in the game you will have to be hidden all the time if people see you they will almost always come kill you for your stuff or to simply eliminate you as a threat.

2013-12-28,0,0,96,True,Recommended,Let me preface this review that I only recommend this game if you are a very patient person. The recent server issue have been very frustrating. The inability to play the game I just spent $20 on is really infuriating. That being said the game itself is amazing as is and I can't wait to see further developed content. The graphics are awesome the gameplay is fun and the community is.... well it depends on the people. PVP gets very hard and annoying with a bunch of noob killers running around but if you find a good play group survival is fun and you can get revenge on those people.,Rust
2015-04-23,0,0,2376,True,Not Recommended,I think this is yet another bad idea in a long line of them. Your adding in before you even bother to fix issues from previous patches that have already caused problems. You have not fixed the signs bug yet. What moron thought that adding in rocket lauchers was good idea. Oh lets give the s that are already in the game more of a reason to be even more of a prick toward people i swear you idiots do not know what your doing. You ask for peoples advice on how to fix the game but you want actually listen and do what is needed instead you put in more in the game that just makes things worse. At this point i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone until it the game designers actually fix what is wrong instead of just releasing more useless crap. Lets not for get the guitar you put in i mean really wtf was the point of that.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,57,True,Not Recommended,Added April 23 2015No development in over a year. DO NOT BUY. Typical of many Steam games Devs put together a broken alpha/beta concept and never finish it.Great game concept in the very early works. Map is super large but not much used at this point. Server sizes are set to under 250 people. Most pings are about 100. PVP is total grief. Don't expect to last more than a couple of minutes in the game before being killed. I suggest starting out on a PVE server to learn the game and to explore before PVPing.Alpha stage is the only thing keeping this from breaking out to major sales. Servers reset often so crafting and building does not develop far. Beware that there are several issues with authentication and currently players some times are not able to log on to servers.I do not recommend purchase in the alpha unless you are willing to suffer the pains of alpha. I bought at alpha just so I can be in on the ground floor. I don't expect to carry much over to release as expected with alpha and beta release. Once this hits beta and main release this is a total buy.After over a week from writing the above comment I think I have changed my mind. They should not be selling this to customers yet. You can play for about 2 hours before servers bail out. You end up losing everything and starting over. Every 3 weeks servers reset and you start over anyways. When it is said and done just play minecraft.,Rust
2015-06-29,0,0,518,True,Recommended,"The game is great but.....HackersThere are so many hackers in the game flying around no clipping through houses shooting you with an AK stealing your things you spent hours to get and hours to upgrade defenses so no one can come in that easy and steal for someone to come in flying naked no clipped and shoot you and steal your things. The game is unplayable if there are hackers because if you make a base to stop people from coming in just for a hacker to get your stuff when you get off your base untouched but your stuff gone from the hackers whats the point in putting time in the game?There are barely any admins on the servers and they never monitor them people associated with hackers get an easy ride and materials for free at no risk because they arent the ones hacking so if the hacker ever DOES get banned they go out scott free.There is just no point in playing a game like this in its current state of hackers.I do not suggest this game rn waste of money because there is no point in playing.Its like buying a multiplayer fps shooter where every server you get into there are 2 or 3 people in god mode just killing everyone. What's the point in playing a game like that?That is all PUpdate 7/30/15 No clipping has been fixed there are still hacks in the game though like hackers being able to just go through your doors aimbot and some weird hack where a melee weapon can hit you from far away.Still no admins on the OFFICIAL FACEPUNCH servers but the game has gotten better with some of the patches they did to stop some hacks.Update 10/6/15Hacking for the most part is very minimal now I would give this game a good review now however I do have one complaint which is a system they implemented to make good guns that use ""High Quality Metal"" Or HQM. Anyways HQM is rare compared to the normal metal that you can get and the way they had it before is you can save up a bunch of normal metal to make guns or upgrade your walls to the max however with the HQM system a decent gun would make you have to save up a ton of it there isnt much to do or get with normal metal and this makes it actually impossible for solo players and almost impossible for small groups to make it anywhere because it is the grind of a century with HQM I much prefered it when there was a lot of flexablity on what you can spend your normal metal on whether you save a lot of it to make guns to upgrade your base or for other essentials the choice was always there now the choice is always save up 50 HQM to make an AK end of story. But asides from that I would say in technical terms the game is now playable and quite fun.",Rust

Some may play it and struggle as it can be very sole destorying as there are clans etc which will destory all your hard work and laugh in your face. I reccommend newbies find a low population server or a server with only solo/duo/trio players. Once u understand how not to get destroyed at every turn. it becomes once of the best games u will ever play VERY ADDICTIVE dont know if thats good or bad XD,Rust
2015-10-06,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Great game. Crafting system is intuitive. Progression is excellent. Only thing I wish it had was a single player option. Public servers are a pain because of the people. Worst part about this game is the community. If you build a base in a public server you better expect it to be looted and/or destroyed when you come back to the game.If you like pvp (and many do) then there are tons of massively popular pvp servers. But if you want to survive you better have a group of friends also playing. Or at the very least join a group already established on the server. Trying to go alone is guaranteed suicide.,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,226,True,Recommended,This is a very fun and amazing game that i would highly recemmend to anyone considering purchasing it. It brings out an aspect of survival that I rarely see in other games. The crafting system is very good and easy to use. The construction system is also very nice for what I have seen of it. But some nice additions that I personally think would be great are lakes and streams around the map maybe fishing added with that. I also believe that they should make it harder to craft guns as well. Find weapons in towns can sometimes happen and im ok with that but I can make myself a gun in the first couple ours of playing on a server. One thing that i would also like to see is varrying tools maybe farming and possibly different stages of tools. For example u would have to make a stone axe to be able to make a bronze one and a bronze one to make a iron one and so forth. And before anyone says anything i do understand that this game is only in alpha these are just ideas for the future of the game. But overall this is one of the best survival games i have ever played and it is deffinitely worth twenty dollars.,Rust

The game is currently in ALPHA it should probably be beta at this stage but ill let the devs make their own decisions.Sometimes there are random server wipe patches to fix hacks etc there are hackers and there always will be find a good server with good admins(props to my home server rusty flats) for less chance that it will affect your gameplay.I run solo in this game and have found it quite challenging the game itself but more so the large groups of terrible players that band together to get things otherwise un obtainable(by them). The social aspect is pretty large in this game and there is nothing like downing a group of 3 4 noobs and looting/scrapping them before they can return.... or being the victim of numberless gang 'encounters'. This is the kind of game that you can be on top of the world one minute and then bam out homeless the next.Love it keep up the good work devs and admins themeONE,Rust

You will meet some great and awful people on this game and you will go from being naked with a rock to firefights with assault rifles in the night with the helicopter over the top of you. This game is breathtaking at times and it is a freeflowing take on many of the survivalesque games out there. While the environment is deadly and the helicopter will destroy your base easily your biggest fear is not the bears or wolves but the other bandits out roaming your world.This game is not for the faint of heart ragers or friendly people.

2016-06-25,0,0,905,True,Recommended,"Okay after playing this game since early legacy 2014 I can safley say this game has come a LONG way however with a consistency of hackers it has gone down in number and intensity from being killed with a shotgun from roughly 5 km instantly to being shot in the eye from 200 meters with a semi automatic bolt action rifle once in awhile. Yet even these encounters with these hackers it is still fun when you get addicted to the adrenaline of surviving because just like every thing in the game they are mortal I have kiled a few hackers in my time and as annoying as it is to be shot from nowhere 2 seconds later it is still gratifying to know that you actually killed someone with a program that makes them good at the game. Pros First and foremost gives an amazing sense of adventure like the first time you played pokemon because of all the procedural maps The gunplay is decent asside from some issues I will get into later Base building while time consuming it is very very fun to try your hand in even if your base gets raided hard. Especially with programs like fortify to make this easier With some exceptions the community is decent. I have met many many friends over this game because of things like a common enemy even recently I teamed up with some random people both of us have been killed many times by the same person to take down a HUGE threat massive tower base TONS of clan members. Incredibly satisfying back in legacy I was able to put together 12 Timed Explosive Charges which take an immense amount resources to make just by working hard at it and still managed to raid the biggest base I had seen at the time. And last but not least the devs they listen to the community mostly on reddit Ive seen many posts that have gotten their ideas added to the game or got their issues resolved like the double click to craft system most recently.Cons The worst thing about this game. The community I know I said it was decent but god it can be horrible. Many people are salty and will do anything to kill you even if you have just spawned however I really shouldnt say anything because I do this lots of times myself however there are hackers as well which have probably gotten worse over the years I've played harder to kill easier to die to etc. Along with this community comes many. many. many rage quits I cant tell you how many times I have encountered a hacker and just alt+F4 oh god it can be really bad. Heres the exception with the gunplay. RNG the devs have fixed some of this but in the past there were times where you would hear the little tick hitmarker and it actually did no damage this has been fixed but the real RNG is when you are in a fight you both have metal facemasks and you hit him in the facemask with a gun and you can hear the ding of the bullet bouncing off and then you hear your own neck snap from the same gun same bullet same area but youre the one that died not him. Baisically there is a chance that the bullet will pierce the armor and there is a chance it wont and will do a reduced amount of damage. Me and my friend are often screaming in our rooms saying ""I HIT HIM IN THE FACE WITH A BOLTY WHY DIDNT HE DIE"" Oh god it can be worse than anything.Overall though I would say this game is easily a 8 out of 10 I tried to stop playing but the addiction to the adrenaline kept me going. In all honesty if you like survival FPS then I would deffinitely tell you to get it it can accomodate to many playstyles.",Rust

I have played it for a couple of hours and have experienced most aspects of this game some are good some are bad and then you meet the community. First id like to point out im a shift worker so i am awake at ridiculous and unusual times this enabled me to miss allot of the really bad griefing but unfortunatly not all of it. I have personnally constructed three buildings all which took allot of time to build/craft/collect resources only to relog and find that some one had just walked up and gone....mine now! This is infuriating and without a doubt what killed this game for me. this sounds petty but when your forced to restart everytime you log in the game goes from interesting fun mechanic to boring endless grind. I played wow endless grinding is a thing and i wont dispute it but endless grinding for no payoff whatsoever? its a difficult task. As for bugs well its aplha but this game really falls down in its control of the community which isn't helped by no end game content/purpose . I'm worried this was $20 wasted because I am struggling to see this game having a ""final product"" future the community trually is vile and will lose allot of casual gamers that a game like this usually thrives off but again i guess you cant blame them you get to a point and go what now? loads of guns + stupid amounts of ammo + nothing to do trolling",Rust

2015-06-18,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,It's a game based on your server community. I can see it being fun on a private server with friends or two defined factions. Small idiot kids killing new spawns for 200 wood is just . On most servers people assume you are not friendly so will kill on spot. Shows how ed up the world would be without reprecisions.,Rust

2015-06-18,0,0,204,True,Recommended,This game is great! Just abou the only problem about it is that you need a GOOD computer to really play it to the advanced but I am glad they added where you can changed the settings of the gameplay. Rust is a game focused on multiplayer survival survival of the fitest but once you get a furnace with a good and supporting home with a friend or two then you can skyrocket in success. The one big problem that I have about this game is that there isnt a singleplayer gamemode or something like that as I am a gamer who usually plays bymyself sometimes and would enjoy that in the future! Otherwise 10/10!,Rust

2015-03-01,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,It's a much better game than it was. A generated map was well needed. But it really shouldn't claim to support Linux not in this state at least. Getting from a static 5 fps at a decent setting can get it up to 10 at the lowest. Mouse problems have been fixed so that's alright.3/10 rather play nethack.,Rust
2015-03-01,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,This game has become trash. In their effort to make the game look better the producers have forgotten playability. To get items one must run into towns which are radiated and search through boxes for the valuables. The only real threat use to come from players however now you can barely step foot into the town without dying from radiation poisoning. The maps look good if you are standing still the blur effect that they added into the game in a recent patch makes it to where you cant see a single thing if you move your mouse. This game use to be my favorite game and it so quickly fell to the ground. This game is only good for looking at nude men laying on the ground oh wait thats facepunch studios main office.,Rust

2015-03-01,0,0,244,True,Recommended,You're bad at your jobs on Steam (I was told to do this by your game called Rust),Rust
2015-03-01,0,0,23,True,Recommended,This game has a lot of great moments in it's alpha stage. There's plenty to do and explore and it's sufficient enough to feed anyone's hunger for adventure. There are parts of the game that are unforgiving to new and veteran players (i.e. radiation poisoning predatorial wildlife and even other players). The main objective of the game is hunt and gather to stay alive so the excitement really stems from interaction with other players.. however the notion of 'kill on site' runs rampant on almost all servers (it's best to assume everyone is hostile). There's a good variety of weapons and consumables in the game. You'll find yourself running out of the good tools quickly so crafting is a key part of surviving. Protecting your loot is hard as all you can really do is lay down bear traps and surround your stash with walls (wooden stone or metal). It would be nice to see something that really bites back when an intruder knocks down a wall or attemps to unlock your doors. Visually Rust does a great job of capturing the imagination. Landscapes can range from deserts plains beaches and snowy mountains. There are only a handful of critters that roam the map so I would only assume that adding more wildlife is in the plans for future development. Wolf meat is the main source of protein in the game. In the future I would hope to see options to fish near lakes or farm within your base.I really can't wait for this game to ramp up with more features and players. It would be interesting to see tribes/groups develop and navigate standoffs with other groups. The feeling would be similar to TWD but minus the zombies.,Rust
2015-02-01,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Very fun however the multiplayer capabilitys need to be inproved a little. I tryed to play with a friend and it took hours to figure out where eachother is (sorry bad grammer) I suggest that you add that when your in a party with a friend you guys all spawn near eachother. I also suggest horses cars Lions and Elephants for curtain areas and easier to make sleeping bags so you dont have to spend hours hunting. Overall great game! Defidently recommend!,Rust
2015-02-24,0,0,244,True,Recommended,I would recomend this game to any of my fellow Steam users it has the old version for those of you who find it laggy on the new version which I wish that all games would do and it is an easy game to find servers who are frendly to you and you can start from the bottom with your friends. You will not regret it It has endless fun that you can stop by and leave quickly. Have fun and enjoy the adrenaline. The Wolf PackP.S. Add me on steam if you are new and want to play the new or old version.,Rust

Depending on the server you join each can have its own specific rules making find an idle playing envirnoment very easy. Once you spawn its a game where you have to kill animals to get food to survive deal with other players as you decide and see fit and then play it as you wish. You can gather up resources and make a huge home run around trying to help others by giving them supplies and items or being a bandit and killing whom you wish and looting them for their supplies. Its a game where you can basically play it anyway you want and is a blast to play with friends and group up.,Rust

The bugs and technical problems are not getting addressed these are the main problems players are having at the moment if they were to be fixed it would be a much more pleasent experience to play rust.The community is filled with immature adolescent kids who think its cool to call you every bad word in the book and insult you with every abusive phrase you can think off just for the sake of making themselfs feel good and look cool among there friends and the server. This is the majority of the people on rust servers. You can expect to get kos'd by everyone no one will make any effort to actually talk to you maturely or try to make friends with you.The developers never listen to the community garry is to busy mindlessly argueing with people on twitter rather then listening to the complaints and fixing what needs to be fixed Its my way or the high way approach. The developers are lazy and never test what they create They need to set aside a portion of the developers to bug check and fix the performance problems. It feels like we are the bug testers that have no impact on the decisions of the developers We ""The Playerbase"" got facepunch were they are now finacially They have no reason not to listen and fix the game.The survival aspect of the game is only existent because of players Anything outside of pvp is no challenge at all.",Rust

If you were to bring the old rust back not only would I be a happy gamer again but Rust would be the talk again. No one can say that this new rust is more fun brought better times with friends or anything in that genre because Rust Legacy was the game all your friends owned and you all had 1 000+ hours on.

Some enjoy the challange but every single vally and mountain has the same textures for trees and grass and ground so literally everything looks the same.People have half build crap shacks every 10 feet which leaves you trying to find loot spawns in places that do not have any.AIRDROPS! from an NPC cargo plane usually go to a specific person or persons who are on the spot when it lands. Even if you get all of your ducks in a row find shelter find food and clothing arm yourself and store gear you are usually killed randomly while you are offline. The game mechanics are pretty lousy.Compared to DAYZ if rust can get back on track MIGHT be able to give dayz a run for its money SOME DAY but that day is not today or anytime close to it.Over all My evalutation of the game is that for $30.00 it would literally be more fun to give each of your friends a dollar to have them kick you in the nuts.,Rust

2014-01-06,0,0,1122,True,Recommended,"Rust is an amazing game that offers a wide range of ways to enjoy it. If you have a ""me against the world"" mentality then you can play it that way. If you enjoy playing with others and being part of a team you can do that here. If you just simply want to be a villian and ruin other people's games then it's a possibility. There are no rules no force fed objectives only possibilities in this game and it's up to you to decide what's important where to start and what path you take.The idea of building yourself or your team to a status of being able to run the Rust world is interesting to say the least. You can gather tons of resources food weapons ammunition and tools all of which help you build your supremacy in the game. It's not just about obtaining those resources but it's also about keeping those resources safe against other players in the game. not only are there other players out there looking to take what you got you also have to navigate an unforgiving world full of zombies bears wolves and mother nature herself. If you like a challenge this game is for you and remember it's still only in alpha so I am expecting this game to grow into something iconic.",Rust

( If you decide to play it this is what you need to know Every official server is full of hackers and no admins to cotroll it. They're ""VAC"" secured but it doesent prevent OR ban anything. DO NOT PLAY ON THEM Most community servers have unfair admins and hackers depending on the activity of the admins. I recommend playing on theese however you might have to browse trough 10+ servers asking the players on it if the servers has fair admins and if they're actively banning any hackers.

2014-02-10,0,0,102,True,Recommended,This game is fun but of course at the price of the community being rather rude and mean. I've played for a while in a server that was small but it grew greatly. So i had it easy. Now i have gone to a new server of around 70 and let me say it. The community of people I was in are terrible everyone kills everyones paranoid. You will get raided and killed a lot on some servers. It's awful watching hours of work ruined. So take my advice pick a small server as it may grow and you will be prepared by then. And you can prove who is the better man/woman by being kind but of course people are not always so friendly. So just prepare for people trying to take your hours of work away. If your not turned away by that. By all means have fun ),Rust

2014-02-10,0,0,184,True,Recommended,Pretty sweet game I have to say. You get to build a nice little home that someone will at some point bust in shoot you in the face and then leave with some snide remarks. Oh and when your out for a nice stroll in the park someone will smash you in the face with a rock just to take your rock and put into their rock collection. Often you spend nights alone in the cold wondering how you become and why exactly your naked. Theres much to had in the world of Rust theres trees and ores that you get to beat to death with your nice shiny rock. Theres deer boars rabbits chickens wolves and bears that you get to smash their face with a rock. You even get moments when a plane flys overhead to drop out some stashes of desirable goodies but if you still have just your pet rock I wouldnt go for these goodies. There is also many towns filled with radiation mind you that you get to take your rock on adventures exploring. And when you find someone else in the wild world of Rust just scream at them provide some humor in the moment because most likely your about to die and your rock will be had. After all Rust is simple about how long you keep your rock and about how many rocks you collect throughout all your travels.,Rust
2014-02-10,0,0,139,True,Recommended,Fun game has a lot of ways to expand and build upon. Even though it is still in Alpha it beats some finished games. Still a lot of bugs and glitches so beware if you don't like that sort of thing. Once you get a hang of the game it is great. At the begining I was very impatient.

2015-03-10,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,I loved the idea of this game I had a blast playing it and enjoyed it until I realized the game was over. It's not going to be finished in over six months the only thing that has changed was that they added some roads simply for looks changes nothing. Facepunch isn't even focusing on it anymore they have several other projects that have taken precedence over this one. Fine I had fun with it was worth the 20 bucks but I gave them 20 dollars to work on rust ideally full time but even just a decent bit. So in summary I had fun playing it it showed great promise. if you don't mind owning a game that's not even almost done that's been pretty much abandoned by it's developer then go for it. For any normal person though I really can't promote it. If you and some friends get it together than maybe but even then. Hitting trees with a rock gets tiring. It entertained me for a minute I mean like I said I'm not I got it. But I don't plan on playing it ever again if you like building things there are better games for that and if you like killing things there are better games for that as well.

You can be killed fairly easily if you run head on without learning some stuff first but when you do you can kick It's not too hard or too easy.

2014-01-07,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,Game is in Early Alpha and as such it is glitchy laggy and sometimes downright awful to play. Most servers out there are full of Hackers that make it hard to do anything. The main goal of the game so far is to find the plans for a metal house then farm the materials to make it. If the crafting didnt take so long (there are servers that make it easier to craft) and you didnt need so many materials it might have been interesting. But alas once you have reached that point you get to the main problem there is not much to do yet. Except hunt down other people.

2016-01-02,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,"The Truth about Rust. It all started years ago approxamitley 2 years ago... The game was a hit. This was the best alpha I have ever played. There were zombies simple controls a decent community. An ammense amount of bugs and glitches. But overall playable. Minumal 12 year old's screaming. You start off as a naked man with a rock. Then you use that rock to carve wood and collect more rocks. This leads you to make a stone axe. You use the axe to collect even more resources. Then you start looking for animals to kill to get cloth so you can have a sleeping bag (Respawn point). You get the rescources and build up Simple fun and effective. There are people laughing minimal russians people dieing people raiding. Its all good like a 1970's cocaine party with Tony Montana and Pablo Escabar. NOW the updates hit you like a storm. You cant find any animals the devs put random spawns scattered throughout the lands (Bad idea) and then you starve to death. Now you start from scratch. This is about 49% true when starting. But then you think ""Huh maybe I should look for animals first"" OK. So you now respawn randomly and roam around until you find an unthreatning animal to kill. You get your cloth but WAIT you need more cloth and youre runinning low on food! What do you do? so you keep running around and obtaining all of these rescources just so you could make a sleeping bag while cooking meat on a fire. Which will hopefully lead you to a stable area to construct what would like to be called a ""home"". And this is a succesful method.... However while you were trying to stabalize a piece of territory for yourself the raideres move it. These people are the same ones that have had sex with yourmother (so they claim) and just got out of prision (self proclaimed again). These players are the ones that like to see blood for the sheer fact that it makes them happy. Hell they know youre poor but they want that rock that you spawned with. So what do you do? NOTHING you get They have guns which take hours and ridiclous amounts of rescources to create. They have armour and youre still naked. All you have is some tools to harvest and a sleepingbag. And so the begins. You're dead. and this method is true another 49% of the time...Know you might be asking ""Hey what is the other 1% of the time that is possible in Rust?""That myfriend is the 1% of people who get fed up and join an abandoned server to dispear from mankind.

I mean unless you have trusting friends to play with regularly this game is NOT for you. You will die repeatedly soon after you spawn and get nowhere in the game and the game lacks a sense of guidance. No starting map have to craft can be lost can't track your friends in game easy to get lost. There are some many aspects of the game that are simply left up in the air and undeveloped. The game teaches people to be complete D bags. Save your money and don't get frustrated.The GoodAwesome game.Minecraft on steroids.Logged 33 hours in 2 days because I liked it so much despite the giganti problems with this game. Hope it improves.HUGE MAP lots to see animals to hunt.MultiplayerThe BadSo many issues I can't go through all of them.No single player unless u play on an empty server )Bugs everywhere. Animals climb up cliffs when chased or run through giagantic rocks. Stupid AI.No playing instructions. Had no clue how to play initially or how to get better items.Most servers whipe progress every month.Walking is the only transportation system. No boats no pedal bikes or even something basic other than walking.Never enough rocks in the game to build out of stone it's a never ending grind.Players can use ladders to scale your home and raid you.The game engine is resource intensiveNot the smoothest visual experience Running game on AMD FX 8 core processor with 3.5ghz 4ghz turbo 8GB RAM at 1600mhz R9 270 2GB VRAM video card. Runs ok at medium settings which looks like a 90's game Can run game on Very high settings and it looks beautiful frame rate steady and did not seem too low BUT after a few minutes on highest setting the game gets screwed up on high settings. It drops from around 30fps to 1fps. Checked card temp during these issues and no overheating was occuring. My suggestion to DEVs is to check how much memorry is the game using is it being managed properly? Ram and Vram prob not managed well the video card can and should be handling this game on ultra without issues.The UglyPlayers in this game are complete a holes. Good luck trying to do well on an already populated server.Most punishing game for new players.Spawned me next to (derogatory swear word here) which killed me instantly. I've also gotten killed numerous times by advanced players while i was building.

2014-05-01,0,0,474,True,Recommended,I Wasn't sure about this game at first but when i started playing it and learning a bunch of cool things about the game. i started playing it everyday after school. and i just got hooked i mean it's like shooting up Heroin and start to get really addicting! but this game is fun and all the only thing i hate is non friendly players i mean i want to try to build a huge house but i can't do that with someone trying to kill me! but overall this game is very very fun!9.5/10,Rust
2015-02-02,0,0,260,True,Recommended,Alrighty I believe I can give a review on this game with complete unbias ness.I started playing this game in it's original form or Legacy now. Great game. Small map that once you figured it out you could rule the world. The road was a safe haven for all beginners wo figure out what was where. But now the game has evolved. This new version of Rust is different in a lot of ways. New building schemes different variety of how things work and a lot more on the long list of things that have changed. Is a new step in a different direction always perfect? HELL NO! There are glitches like people falling through stairs and deer that sense you and run off at the speed of light. It's new coding new ideas and a new outlook. The graphics even on the lowest of settings is beautiful and I've caught myself jsut sitting on a hillside wathcing the world change aorund me. Rust is not an ordinary game and it's taking a lot of time and effort to make it right. Whenever a patch messes up something I have personally witnessed the dev team workign hard to correct a mistake. (I can't tell you how many times i drowned in invisible water but that is fixed and was within a week) So is this game perfect? NO! But Rust is a hell of a lot of fun to play and learn and I for one have enjoyed watching this game grow. So with what I said take it all with a grain of salt because everyone's experience is different. Buy the game support the developers and see what this game can grow into or don't that is your call but play this game knowing it is constantly growing and changing for both the good and bad can't make everyone happy.,Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,104,True,Recommended,I must say unlike most early access games(which ill never buy again thanks to games like starbound and dayz. gotta love when devs take the kickstarter/early access dough and bail) this game has exceeded my expectations. The fact they took their early access/legacy alpha money and basically remade the game to ensure a quality product is unprecedented. Garry could have by all means taken the money claimed legacy was full release and ran instead i see constant meaningful updates and a bright future for a fun game. Rust has my applauds.,Rust

On my old computer my render quality was the minimum and i was at fastest but it really didnt make a difference.That is all until they make this game have a private server or make it single player i willl rarely ever play this game again.,Rust

2015-03-28,0,0,473,True,Recommended,I love the game...except for the extreme paranoia it causes while out gathering. If you hate being killed often and losing all you hard scavaged things....then this game isn't for you. I believe it is a true representation of how ugly the human race can be in this type of scenario. It is hard to trust anyone and it is a shoot first (rock to the head) and ask questions later type of game. A few things I would change if I had the power would be the C 4...I can't imagine that it would be something you are going to get your hands on readily or know how to make. Not to mention it sucks that someone can destroy your base so easily. I would like to be extremely rare to find the blue print and hard to find the ingredients. I think it would be better to have pipe bombs improvised explosive devices and molotov cocktails. I dig the air drops but I wish they were going to NPC military characters that are stationed in areas that sometimes go awry. Then you not only would you have to deal with other PCs your may have some NPCs to deal with. In the air drops you may find guns and ammo as well as explosives...but again they would be fairly rare.They need to bring back the ramps or improve the stairs. They take up way too much room when building a multi level base which is a must.I would recommend to give it a try. I find it quite addicting...and I am always anxious to see if I wake up in the same place I went to sleep or if it is start over anew time.,Rust
2015-03-28,0,0,102,True,Recommended,i woke up by the water. as i woke up i saw a tree. i bashed the tree with a rock to gather wood. near the tree was a naked man sleeping next to the water. i beat his wang with my rock until he died. i wnet along the shore and saw a house the house was open. also there was a naked man sleeping outside the house. i beat his wang until he died. went into his house used my wood to build a fire. burnt my wang.,Rust
2014-02-12,0,0,37,True,Recommended,Rust is a great recommendation to buy as an alpha because of how fun and stable it already is well before the final product.The game's still transitioning hugely week by week zombies disappeared altogether the other day! But it's surprisingly addictive being dropped into this world and left to fend for yourself by building shacks killing animals and upping your arsenal against other more aggressive players.It should be said though don't expect your progress to be permanent. With the right time and patience one player can thieve everything you own within a couple hours regardless of how well built your shack is. Add this to the server resets that happen every couple of weeks and you'll find yourself getting used to starting fresh more often than you might like.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,244,True,Recommended,Has a long way to go yet pretty entertaining nonetheless but incredibly frustrating when you cant find your hut or die with a full inventory. A craftable map and definitely a compass should be added I mean if you can eventually make assault rifles and kevlar armor you should definitely be able to make a compass.I am in two minds about the lack of crosshair on the one hand it can be irritating when you miss a deer with your bow since you cant pick up your arrows (how about recoverable arrows ? ) but on the other hand when you do hit something at long range without even really trying to aim it feels pretty damn good.There does seem to be a lot of KoS attitude from other players who will then be all helpful in chat which is quite irritating don't even join the official servers they are lag crazy and you'll struggle to find resources there are hundreds of unofficial servers to join where there may only be 1 or 2 people online good for learning the ropes.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,92,True,Not Recommended,This game would and COULD be great except for the fact that you have no chance for survival as a new player. Duping griefing and general a holio activity make doing anything fun in this game impossibleThere will always be trolls there will always be cheaters and FPS games are the spawn of all evil. This is the WORST $19.99 I have ever spent and if I could get a refund I would greatly like to pursue this. I've put 2 days of play time by myself and with a group of people. It's minecraft with guns. When you give punks that love minecraft guns... you get trolls that think they're gods gift to mom's basement. For those of you that enjoiy it hats off to you.

2015-02-04,0,0,239,True,Recommended,"This is a great game in the making. It's being constantly improved. I am very impressed after taking a long sebatical at the progress that's been made in the current version. This game will be epic by the time it's finished with a wealth of freedom and exploration. At heart however I feel it is more of an ongoing experiment that will never be ""completed"" in the traditional sense of the word. Like Garry's Mod it will continue to evolve and probably branch out into more user based content.If you're looking for a finished game Rust may not be for you. All your work and buildings and accomplishments will be wiped at some point if not often. If you want to enjoy a good game in progress of becoming a great one then you will enjoy it.

2014-02-13,0,0,833,True,Recommended,Even though Rust is still in early alpha stages with only a couple in game items it still provides plenty of entertainment that can only get better as more items and features are implemented and the map is expanded. Unlike other FPS games where you have scary or stressful moments and know you can relax right after Rust provides a constant level of terror for every sound you hear. There is no relaxing in this game. Even logging out gives no respite as your character simply goes to sleep at the last location you were standing. This means no avoiding a fight by simply closing the game. Your body will simply slump to the floor and be easy pickings for wildlife and other players. Yes other players... trust is a tricky thing in Rust. You never know the intentions of anyone else in the game. Resources are scarce and people will kill for them. That plane flying over dropping supplies? It's both a blessing and a curse. You know there are going to be rare items and food parcels in those drops. Unfortunately so does everyone else who saw it fly over.They might share the spoils with you and then suddenly they find a shotgun in the last crate. Suddenly they don't seem to feel like you deserve half the food. Human nature is a tricksie hobbitses welcome to Rust.,Rust
2014-02-13,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Apart from the current lack of content that I'll forgive due to early access tho Early Access is starting to look like almost as bad an idea as Kickstarter for games lately only here you get to see what you've done immediately this game has one problem I cannot forgive ignore or even remotely enjoy the game due to.People are bloody awful.I died in less than a minute the first dozen or so servers I tried then for the first three hours after that some dude would always kill me the minute I got food a tool and started on my home. Now I might be able to deal with the pain that is other people if they were just an added challenge but they aren't. People are voices. PEople are persistant. People are evil.And this game has produced some weird kind of evil at that. Day Z is downright friendly in comparison and CoD voice chat a cheerful conversation in the quad. That said that could (probably is) the very reason many people like this game so perhaps I might've recommended it instead but that would leave an even worse taste in my mouth than playing it.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,54,True,Recommended,I'd say wait a few months before buying it but totally recommend it as long as you have friends to play with who are up for a laugh and won't take it too seriously. Saying that there are lots of hackers who just want to ruin the game for everyone else is a massive understatement. I actually kind of wish the game was more expensive to discourage this because I know of a few people who have been banned &amp re bought the game multiple times just to cheat &amp people off.I'd say the devs gave fair warning and this is what I expected so I'm not mad about it. But if you can see yourself getting mad at that then do not buy this game right now. It will ruin your day if you take it too seriously. Absolutely brilliant for a laugh. Terrible for a serious survival game. If not for the cheaters it would be great in both categories.It gets regular updates and the gameplay is just getting better and better. I have no doubt that the cheating problem will be sorted eventually but probably not any time soon.,Rust

The next morning you manage to gather lots of resources and expand your little house. You find some blueprints and discover new items. After a while you have managed to gather guite a nice sum of stuff into your setlement and you feel guite proud of yourself. Next day you log into the game and it appears that you have been killed after setting to rest the last night into your house. You also notice that your sleeping bag is destroyed and you wake up from the beach again with a torch and your precious rock. You manage to find your house again only to notice that the front door has been built shut and all the yesterdays hard work has gone to waste. Welcome to Rust!,Rust

2017-03-13,0,0,559,True,Recommended,Rust is an incredible simulation of what humanity will behave like if law and order are null. Other humans are either your only hope or your biggest threats.It starts you with a rock and a torch in a huge map with up to 200 other people and various wildlife. You're meant to gather resources and survive. You craft what you need to survive and fend off attackers.People are smart and devious. Watch your backs and trust NO ONE.,Rust
2015-03-28,0,0,111,True,Recommended,I have enjoyed rust since legacy. The current build is shaping up nicely and will soon far outpace the legacy. The most interesting part of rust is the community. Often brutaly hostile and demeaning you have to find a server that fits your personality best. The whole game feels like a social experiment that GTA V wanted to be. You can do anything assuming you learn from your first 15 deaths and can memorize a world layout and know how to stay out of others way untill you find a strong player group or base. This game chalanges you to decide what is more important. Progression humanity or hard won power to decimate the weak. If you dont like getting killed are trolled easily eager to find friends or are looking for a slow paced dayz clone this is not the game for you.,Rust

But maintaining your power is the fun part. This game is a sort of perma death making it quite a challenge.I would appreciate a custom FPS limit though one that is user defined.

2016-01-11,0,0,1312,True,Recommended,Rust is probably one of the greatest games I've ever played. A while back I watched a video that described Rust as a social experiment which I totally agree with. On the vanilla servers as in the ones without mods/plugins you might find people spending hours gathering resouces to build their wet dream base with traps and towers to shoot out of. The building has stability to it so you can't really have floating buildings and you have to take into account things like pillars and such. Raiding is probably the most amazing thing about Rust. Even though nothing in the game is scripted or setup people form teams and organize their own raids with strategies and all these layers to their plan. In one of my experiences me and 3 of my friends were scoping out this base with an absolutely massive tower in the middle. Suddenly some people in the tower were shooting at us and since they had the higher ground we couldn't really fight back. Then we waited for them to go offline and we came back with tons of explosives and we blew out the base of their tower causing the whole thing to explode into thousands of bits of rubble. I remember sitting there laughing while being showered in the remains of their tower. It was epic.Here's an example of a large scale organized raid in rust https //www.youtube.com/watch?v jnsVXodDtqo&amp list PLM4vT_e7ufv eAjj459BsKEMRP50nEq1B&amp index 23,Rust

2014-05-10,0,0,346,True,Not Recommended,This game has so much potential that I can not give it a bad review. However unless you play on a small modded or private server you'll probably die and lose everything quite a bit. There is a bit going on now in developement so it should get better and have a lot more to do so hold on and wait if you haven't bought his yet. But I do think if you're interested now you should get this after the next big content patch.EDIT 1 Feb 09 2015Community regardless of server is utter crap. Played on at least 50 different servers across the globe and no matter what language ethnicity or age most people will kill you for no reason other than the fact you're on the screen. The game itself still holds potential but as it stands no one wants to evolve past legacy and stick to the idea you must kill other people. Frequent game changes causing server wipes makes it a much fairer game field but finding ways to make your own safe haven is getting harder and harder. I no longer can recommend this game unless you are aiming to kill and be killed all the time everywhere.,Rust

I saw the game on reddit and really wanted to play so I didn't even know you could get refunds thru steam so I put it in my mind as a game I would play in the future.

I came up with a phrase ""Such is the life of Rust"" basically this game is BRUTAL it gives you nothing and takes everything. Which is why I love it. There is something supremely satisfiying about killing ANYTHING in this game. Human or animal. Nothing is better than raiding some punk throwing all his crap on the ground disabling his tool cabinet then sealing him in his base to kill himself due to having no tools to dig himself out. ""Such is the life of Rust"" only the strong will survive mentally strong because this game is for the machoist player.

2016-01-19,0,0,422,True,Recommended,I've never played Legacy Rust so I wouldn't know if the game actually improved with the revamped version but perhaps that gives a more honest review of the game as it is right now.I've recently picked up Rust in the steam sales for a few bucks and been logging into the game from time to time. The game is still in the alpha / early access stage so it can still go both ways. As it stands right now it's definitely an enjoyable game if you like the survival genre at least. It might take a few goes to get into it and perhaps joining a proper server will play a part in the enjoyment aswell. Joining the 'wrong' server may result in getting fed up with the game really fast. Community and modded servers may use increased gathering rates better loot more loot redeemable kits (e.g. you get some starting equipment) which can result in alot of people being fairly heavy geared and having major bases built which as a newbie can be quite intimidating You'd hope to run into friendly people but in reality people playing these sorts of games survival games tend be not as friendly as you'd want them to be. Getting shot on sight and stripped from whatever loot you've struggled to collect or getting killed while trying to construct a fairly simple house for yourself with a bunch of materials you just spent an hour to collect. I suggest you find some friends to play with so you can gather build and gear faster aswell as having more of a chance to defend yourself against other players. It's every man for himself.Having found some friends to play with and a nice server to play on i've spent countless hours collecting loot to get by. I've built bases some of them lasted some of them got raided overnight. That's all part of the game don't get too attached to your stuff. I found myself playing deep into the night several times while I should be sleeping. The thought of my base getting raided haunted me. Just a little more wood to expand a part of my base. Just some more stone to fortify my base. Let me just smelt these ores real quick so I can make these sheet metal doors to keep intruders out. Before I knew it it was 6am already again. That's the first sign of addiction.Once you're 'done' building your base you are never really done to br honest the time to walk around and explore the map starts. Going on loot runs to collect weapons and other useful items and gear to defend against other players or be one of those unfriendly bandits running around the map with a hunting party making life difficult for people just as they did yours. Revenge is sweet! Until you die and lose all your gear. Rinse and repeat.Current state if the game is not too bad depending on how busy the server you play on is the longevity might vary. The game definitely needs some more fun stuff to do besides looting building and shooting people but that doesn't make it less thrilling or less exciting. I'm sure I'll log a few more hours in this game casually.,Rust

At this point people realize we bought an unfinished game and also that the earlier versions of everything was better except the new crafting system.2/10/15UPDATE I hate this game it is bad and this update broke the rock and when you try and pick something up it kicks you then when you rejoin the item you try and pick up disappears considering they took out the damaged cities/buildings and that there is one RAD town where you can only enter by having a full rad suit which you must FIND and it is a ing loot fest plus nothing works. and my reveiw is a 3/10 because their saying is YOU GIVE US MONEY!!!!!!!,Rust

2015-02-10,0,0,45,True,Recommended,i do recommend this game but this last update sucked first of all its cool that tools have uses now but they are worn off real quickly and also the rock shouldnt have the worn off cause if you loose it without getting any wood or stones you have to die simple as that and i feel its crap. Also C4 i broken dude now is useless building a house cause the durability of the house was nerfed and also if you feel like building in the water so no one can breake it now some dude throws a C4 and the whole house explodes.

2015-02-10,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,This is not a real survival game. Unless you mean survival by being thown into a arena brawl. The game allows no way for people to build actually thriving towns and trade with eachother. No way for communitys to develop and fight and trade and war. Its just kill naked people with rocks. Everyone will get bored with it eventually. No long term worth.,Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,93,True,Recommended,This is a great game and it is still in its Alpha stages so you can bet there will be so much more to the final product than what is there now. I played for 47 hours the first week I owned it and couldn't get enough of it. The survival aspects of the game are more thrilling when on servers with other players. You build your home to try to survive and those who are blood thirsty will hunt you and raid you in the night I recommned playing with a group of good friends as surviving the elements is easy surviving your fellow man is a chore. The dev's are very open about the game and there are server plugins of all kinds being developed by players good with code. This game can only go anywhere but up in my opinion.,Rust

2017-01-31,0,0,519,True,Recommended,"Great experience. Spawn in to be killed by fully geared players at least 200 times after thats over (which it never ends) you get to build a nice 1x1 base which is raided the instant you go offline. A few years later you have learnt too trust no one and just kill anyone that comes into view. Your base is now big enough and you have hoarded enough materials to finally make some decent weapons so you can defend yourself. Now here you are standing on the roof of your base waiting for the odd naked to come by while hoping they have gathered enough materials to make up for the 50 bullets you miss on them. After killing this completly naked player who was your former self you decide it's too risky to take your gun outside to retrieve that phat loot. So you strip naked and go out to retrieve the goods only to be welcomed by that nakeds slave masters *bang* you're dead yet again you wait in your base for them to pass. They've now passed but you have to get off for school in the morning you spend the night staring at the ceiling imagining what life would be like outside of your base running around shooting nakeds. You return the next afternoon welcoming the fresh smell of the beach breeze blowing between your legs. Back to the beginning you're fully geared now made some friends on the server and decide to roaming taking out everyone you see. You begin an intense battle with a few guys with bows next thing you know you've been shot in the back by one of your friends. You spend the rest of the day trying to run back to your body to pick up your gear your body is never recovered so you're back to the roof. After the next few days you spend shooting nakeds from your roof you log on to there being nothing in you're chests but the base is fully intact. You figure it out your ""friends"" you gave the base code earlier decided it's time to leave you in the dust with nothing but a emty shell of a base.ALT+F4Game libraryRustRight ClickDelete Local ContentTLDR Don't buy it if you're not commited and willing to waste a lot of time.",Rust

Of course we were raided two days later but that is beside the point.Find/Invite a friend and you'll be fine. I reccomend browsing the wiki before playing. As for the price it could be a bit lower but thats honestly the only problem I have with this game. 9/10EDIT 5/21/15Months later and things are still going strong.

Pretty sure this game is DOA. I actually have so few friends who ever want to touch the game with a 10 foot pole let alone anything else other than hide it in their steam library under labels like ""Don't Touch Worthless"" Right now the only reason I can tell that the game has such a high amount of postive feedback is because the developers are spoofing the numbers with new accounts.

2017-03-13,0,0,82,True,Not Recommended,Rust does so much so well that this review really should be a positive recommend and maybe for some who read this it will be.Graphics sound effects base building crafting mechanics mod support... nobody does it quit like Rust since unlike other sandbox style survival games Rust's gameply is designed at its root to be ultra PvP centric. Modding support adds even easier clan based play and highly configurable server settings allow for a large variety of game play flavors. Base building mechanics are very fair and are simple enough to grasp yet just complex enough to have many viable and adaptable ways to build. If you want a good idea on how well Rust does PvP try watching some KCMoTV vids on YouTube. IMHO Rust does PvP survival sandbox style gameplay better than any of the modded Arma2/3 variants and even ARK.However the sole reason for this negative review and what really breaks this game for me is the map size. Clearly the Rust developers have a very different opinion than my own regarding PvP map sizes but IMO a 3 4km 2 map is simply way too small for a game designed around constant PvP especially so on 100 200 player servers. Players need a little breathing room to get around each other's bases avoid roof campers and even manuever during a firefight without running into multiple other squads all KOSing anything that moves. This is near impossible when 24 hours after a server wipe there is a house/base/tower every 100 meters or so and even on servers that enable building decay there is almost never anywhere to build without being an arrow's range from another player's structure. Furthermore just like Arma3 Epcoh and ARK offline raiding is perhaps the largest annoyance in my experience the vast majority of Rust players often run around with no gear getting KOS'ed just to see who lives where and with whom just so they can target other player bases when other players are known to be offline.One real positive outcome that I received from playing this game is that a Rust streamer I was watching turned me on to the upcoming release of Battlegrounds think I just found my new love.

This game is constantly updating every week adding more content. I have played a lot of hours on this game and its because its such a good game. The pvp in game is really nice. You get to meet nice people in game or you just get shot at imediately. Thats rust. Gather resources build a base gear up go kill some people meet people ally with people goof off have fun. Thats rust. The only thing that still bugs me to this day is loading into the game. The game for me takes me about 1 min to load in the game then another 1 min to join a server but it is all worth it when you start to play rust as it is my favorite game to play on steam and it you dont enjoy this game i would be very suprized knowing how many fun times ive had with friends New friends that i just met or just playing by myself.

2016-01-12,0,0,3028,True,Recommended,"So I guess I will write a review on a game I keep coming back to Rust is my crack. With over 2k hours put into this game and playing from Legacy to the most current build I still can't stop. if you want about early access for 2 years but the Developers are constantly updating the community on where they are at and what what is new and being worked on. Whenever I explain Rust it usually goes like ""I'm a naked dude with a Rock and I go around and kill other naked dudes with Rocks..."" It's that and so much more I enjoy building bases and the pvp aspect but in it's essence it's a survival game where you start off naked with a rock and that's it. By gathering resources and doing some searching you can make basic tools building materials and weapons oh and don't forget clothes need to cover up your junk. You eventually learn better weapons and items build a base or hut join groups of other like minded individuals and go out and rek fools.The official servers are tough be warned. Make friends place a sleeping bag by a road or radtown and just go on blueprint runs till you learn enough to get established. Some must learns are hatchet pickaxe any gun except the eoka pistol still blows. Check out the modded servers for extra resources teleporting setting home insta crafting kits and more to make learning a little bit easier. And not as bad when you log in dead base raided and all your gone.",Rust

2014-10-28,0,0,177,True,Not Recommended,It's not a bad game. Besides bad optimalization and bugs it's really fun! But the thing that kills it for me is the ing community. Don't even think about playing this alone or with less than two friends. It's not worth your time or money. Every game alone or with just one friend looks like this 1. Spawn2. Die. 3. repeat x304. Eventually meet with your friend 5. Start building your base gathering resources and stuff 6. after few hours you build yourself nice and cozy little base with baasic defense 7. Punch yourself in the face after 4 screaming autist run to your base shoot you over nothing and blow it up for fun.8. Repeat x30I know this is multiplayer and it is meant to be played with friends but this is still t. Community is slowly killing this game with it's mass killing. It's supposed to be ing survival game. You should try to meet with more people to survive. Not goddamn Battle royal. The only thing you are surviving is bunch of autists with machine guns.So would I recommend this game? For groups of friends YES absolutelly. But people who just want to play alone should stay the away from this game (if you like being sane),Rust
2014-02-16,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Great game really puts a bullseye in the feeling of Survival of the Fittest. The social aspect is amazing with either fight or flight combat.

It's annoying to build a house log off log back in a few hours later and find that you were killed while you were away.Other then that and the players who kill fresh spawns and/or spend half an hour trying to knock your door down and kill your sleeping player the game is actually pretty great.,Rust

2017-03-24,0,0,122,True,Recommended,I can say with utmost confidence that this game is a must have if you have the specs to run it. If you don't have the specs get the specs so you can play this game. It comes under early access and it's for good reason but if you ask me the games in it's prime right now the community is so good at being bad there are friendly people but the game will condition you to be wary of even the friendliest nakedest people. Honestly Rust is beauty through simplicity you aim to survive in a beautiful world have fun building and raiding with your friends or go out solo to harden yourself as an individual. Even being raided is fun if you have the right mindset and just realise it happens if its not you its someone else. Easily the best game in my steam library and i think it would make an extraordinary addition to anybody elses.Rust is a playground where laughs happen whether that comes from naked men screaming down the mic whilst trying to take on the most establised clan on the server with rocks and spears or from finding that one flaw in somebodies base and easily getting to the loot room. Now that im done completely loving up the game the few points that may deter you. PVP is a big part of the game. Although you can try to ignore it the game is better once you accept that and learn to shoot. Not a problem for those who like PVP. You will get raided. You can spend hours getting the resources to build that gun that 'impenetrable' base just to log off and log on to a message saying you were shot in the head with a bolt action rifle aka they got in. Solution learn from your mistakes build better. These two put together make the game unrelenting often it will be time consuming to build your way up and it will all be over in a minute. This may not happen but its always a possibility if you're playing on a moderate sized server. The game can be demanding of your pc i cannot stress enough check the specs.Overall I have a lot of respect for the developers for pouring so much effort and staying so devoted to this game. Constant updates listening to the players and overall delivering us a bloody brilliant game. Could not recommend more.,Rust

In adition there seems to be no way to safely leave the game. every time I log off either hidden or in a well fortified base I am killed and my possesions stolen.

2015-04-19,0,0,149,True,Recommended,Rust looks crisp and beautiful and much as every other game it encounters problems.the beauty of the game is achieved by the fact that short on building things and chopping down trees and boulders there is not much else you affect with your actions. there are games that choose to let you excavate your own mines and so on and so forth. so when the game also starts choking my hardware resources goes unresponsive on loading which is long and loads huge chunks of data every time for every server for every rock well ouch.but thats something im willing to skip right over until this resource hogging kills the game and makes it go unresponsive stopping my gameplay in its tracks. then i close my game and decide it might not be time yet.do buy the game. its good and has giant things to promise. and it does look crisp and pretty and has huge sprawling worlds for you to explore and in which to become the ultimate survivor.but dont expect it to stay stable with you yet it seems to be incapable of that so far,Rust

Not worth paying for in the least.Maybe possibly the game will develop on these system and make something good. Currently it isn't here. If you want to shoot poor people play Counterstrike.

2017-01-01,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,TLDR Toxic Community very noob unfriendly and too hard to get set up before you get mauled by players with guns Not a fun game for me AT ALL... oh and no tutorials or server age indicators either. Uninstalling.I have tried and tried for the love of all things holy to give this a shot. Between repeatedly trying to start up only to get shot before I've even REMOTELY had a chance to explore everything build a base or even enjoy myself I can safely say this is one of the worst games I've ever played.Do you know how hard it is to like a game when you are getting killed either every 10 ing minutes or killed before you EVEN START on the server (and I literally am talking before you even connect)? It is irrefutably difficult.Then there is the community barely got any tips and most of the people I see 98% of them kill me on sight. I Have a bow they have guns I have guns they have snipers or worse. People who have 100's or 1000's of game hours will butcher you without a moments thought or notice all because they do it for fun.... at YOUR expense. It is extremely noob unfriendly on a level I thought only DayZ should (justifyingly) have. Then they talk about each other not shooting very well and all that crap.I quickly decided after the twelfth death from players to quit. It is in the interests of my sanity I say do NOT go for this if you want a nice friendly survival game. Instead pick up 7 days to die or DayZ. The former has flexibility to play peacefully or in PVP raids while the latter is a bit more forgiving towards difficulty.They dont even give you a tutorial of any level at all its basically your in RUST the most toxic place since League of Legends and you gotta fend for yourself. Normally I'd be all for this if it werent for the fact its just nigh impossible to see whether or not a server is well into its play time or if its just been wiped. You could go eyeballs deep into a server where everybody has bases all over the place like acme on a teenagers face and more guns than that weirdo in Hot Fuzz or you could literally be the first person on a wiped server. In short you can get killed by people with lots of guns and explosives... OR you can be killed by having more arrows or spears impaled in you than a pincushion.I wish I could get a refund.,Rust

No one can trust anyone because it's a game so no one cares about stealing or killing. You will find super toxic people and worse like huge clans that are built around killing stealing and being complete total cancer to everyone. But what your not seeing is it adds a level of difficulty no bot can do and that makes this game the best I've ever played. (however it's a shame I was VACed for no reason) building a fortress killing bandits raiding them and helping out nakeds. That's where it's at. So what you died it shows your plan had a flaw fix it in the next life.,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,521,True,Recommended,Rust is a Survival Game by the developers Facepunch Personally I love it. And heres why Pros Rust has an extremely large playerbase this means that you'll have no problem encountering other players. Sometimes you'll communicate and work togeather but to be honest Most the time you'll be found staring down the barrel of a gun. The maps are large this gives it a lot of variety for base locations and it is EXTREMELY important you choose a good location to build your base Try to build in resource rich areas and less populater areas. There is plenty of content in the game There is around 24 weapons (excluding throwables) in the game and a large selection of clothing items to choose from. The building Simply put I love the building system in this game. It's so simplistic but at the same time you have strategize and think about how enemy raiders will breach from and prepare for it. The Gameplay is fun and smoove I hardly ever run into any performance issues while playing and the developers are constantly at work improving the performance and game as a whole.The Cons The community is unfortually pretty bad Most people will KOS (Kill on sight) whenever they see someone. More times than not you'll also see people spurting out insults at eachother blindly. The Component's System (My opinion) Personnally I do not like the component's system at all. The XP system was better but still not the best I would say And I'm sure most of you would agree The blueprint system was the best by far.,Rust

2017-01-12,0,0,317,True,Recommended,Great game. Yes bugs are a thing but its Early Access so calm down. Updates and bug fixes are often AF main bugs like bears running through rocks is unity's fault for poor programming for random gen maps but Garry and his team are working on it and no animal will run into your base so dont worry about that.

2015-02-06,0,0,1481,True,Recommended,Still love RUST. At this staged its almost playable like the old legacy it s just 100 times more beautiful. But still an ALFA and if you don t know what an ALFA is stay away.Can t say the game at this state give you anything new you never seen before but it s still an ALFA so what you see is not sure what you get. But if you like a survival game where 98% of the rest are trying to get your stuff and love to show your building skills his is the game for you. The basis is almost at place and it can only get better and better from this.Is it 100% playable no its not but 90% is still grate for an ALFA game and you have and idea about what the BETA will bring. But don t buy it if you don t like changes. For me it s just one of those games I start up when see a great update at playrust.com and play for to many hours the next days. Just to enjoy the scent of survival crazy killing players and then feeling of explorations of the unknown where you newer knows what is revealing before your eyes.,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,199,True,Recommended,Certainly worth a play when discounted during a sale (not sure how I feel about full price).Key things to bear in mind * you'll feel better about the griefers when you consider them the human equivalent of the AI zombies in a zombie game. It's okay to be killed and robbed and actual players are far funnier about it.* don't walk in with the initial idea that it's going to be a building game. You'll invest a whole bunch of time in gathering resources and then just have them stolen. Your base will be broken into as soon as you log out.* make a sleeping bag and hide it somewhere so you can keep spawning at the same location and start to learn the surrounding area. You can also use sleeping bags to bring in other players to your location by donating it to them.* spend your first couple of plays collecting items from barrels and earning knowledge.* play with others go solo and you'll have a very hard time.* play with voice comms enabled it's fun to interact with the other dodgy survivalists.,Rust

2016-01-01,0,0,548,True,Not Recommended,Great experience until you get raided while you're either sleeping at school or work or out of town. For the casual gamer you get bored of it in less than 2 weeks and play it for another 2 weeks 6 months later. 50% of the community is toxic and antisocial.

2014-02-18,0,0,75,True,Recommended,I really do love this game I think everyone should give it a chance. It is in alpha yes that is true but even for a Alpha there is so much you can do such as building and crafting as well as cathering. Then you have the pvp part of it if you can find a good group or a server that has little bout of people to start off with then it can be a lot of fun. Yes there is a lot of KoS in this game Kill on sight but it can still be a lot of fun if you think ahead and know how to move fast. I would love to see some of my more of my friends play this so we can group up and take over a server so to speak hehe. This game has a lot of up coming updates that are going to be very nice.

2015-02-05,0,0,74,True,Recommended,this game is very fun. Although playing this is very frustrating due to server wipes you constantly have to restart everything over and over and over.

2017-03-26,0,0,158,True,Recommended,Rust where do I begin. Rust is great its losts of fun and takes great games you already know and puts them into one game. However there are just some things I cant quite get past. For example i have been a part of 3 clans and all of them have been disbanded by either someone who trolled or hacked. If your playing with someone in rust fighting will be inevitable. If you dont have someone to play with its a real pain to find someone i have spent about 2 hours searching for one clan or person to join up with. Overall the game is a lot of funf but if you don't have someone to play with then i dont reccomend it for you. If you were a kid who would get really salty when a creeper would kill you in minecraft on easy then I dont reccomend this game for you. AND IF YOU CAN GET ALL PAST THAT then i would reccomend this game for you this was my honest opinion love ya Rust &lt 3,Rust

2015-02-26,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Before I say anything else I need to say this Rust is not for the faint of heart. The game will be extremely difficult even more so if you have nobody else to play with. You will kill and you will be killed. Everything you have will be stolen and all your hard work will occasionally be lost. But if you can get past that...The game is INCREDIBLE.Never before in a game have I felt such fear and excitement. The graphics are incredibly beautiful the building system is phenomenal combat feels great and the game is actually difficult Whereas other games hold your hand this game lets you figure it all out. I find this a positive but others may find it a negative.,Rust

2016-01-02,0,0,51,True,Recommended,First let me say I got the game during the 2015 christmas sale. That being said I've played enough of Rust to try enjoy the game but also want to throw my computer threw the window because of it. The game in a crafting servival way is fun and can be a bit of a challenge if you dont know what you're doing. I luckly when first starting ran in to an admin of a server and was helped out a little. I'm not going to say I know how to do a lot in the game because I dont. I know how to build a base some guns and how to get food other then that I dont know how to make blueprints or anything else. The game has one issue which makes things even more challenging but also adds some fun to it and thats protecting what you build. Its not uncommon in game for someone to come along an attack your house. You have stuff they want stuff so they will do what they have to to take it. Its survival. I cant tell you how many times I've nearly throat punched a midget because some a hole decided he wanted terrorize me but it makes it fun if you have the tools and skills to make them go away. Unless you're like me and when they come you always have you pants down (i.e. gathering wood or rock) and they attack you from behind or when you have nothing. But its fun in all honesty people are annoying sometimes but I've made some friends playing the game I can honestly say you should play give it a try but be warned always always stay inside at night. Some animals will attack and some players might find it fun to play in the dark....where no one can see....and all you can hear are foot steps. Tip before you play use your rock to gather wood. Find bolders that give rock and metal use wood to make paper which makes blue prints which will can be used to build a house use the rocks to and wood to build tools (i.e. axe ). That will get you started on not dying right away. hopefully also play with friends or make friends along the way dont be shy.,Rust

2016-01-23,0,0,150,True,Recommended,I havent played this for a few months now but when i last played it I found it to be a pretty alright game. A little... lacking depending on what your looking for but good.I think the game could be improved if it had some sort of currency not necessarily cash somthing to fit the game rocks/stones bottle caps etc. Having a shop is rewarding if u like to be a team player and is fun but could be made better with currency. As I said i havent played in a while and my brother has told me of some recent changes that I think sound a bit rediculous concidering the genre of the game. When I played i found it highly enjoyable. I got a sence of community frendship and helpfulness but also a thrill and exciting game due to the nature and not being able to trust everyone u meet even though most i met were good. The game does have your standard trolls and douches though. I had partially built a building when I had to log off upon logging in the next day anything that I hadnt claimed as mine (restricting the ability to destroy it) was either claimed partially destroyed or gone completely. To sum it up Rust is a fun game with huge potential. The free run ability to build where you please is a nice touch allowing players to build their own towns and communities.Whilst rust could be made better with player input and small modifications this is a fun game to play whether you have all day or just a couple of hours. Im giving rust 8/10 Partially destroyed buildings.,Rust

What i got was crash after crash after crash. I looked online and it seems there are a bunch of people having this same problem since last year and no global solution has been found. Switch to Direct 9 Crash. Run from the local files folder Crash. Change the settings to the lowest Crash. Update your video card drivers Crash. Resinstall and Restart Crash. After about an hour of this i just threw my hands in the air and said no thanks i would like a refund please. I understand this game is in the early stages but crashing on loading seems a bit pre development and not something i care to pay money for. I am off to give Hurtworld a shot wish me luck.

2016-01-22,0,0,441,True,Recommended,Great game at first I was taken back by the graphics and frame rates but I figured out what settings make it more comfortable to play. This game has a steep learning curve dont trust anyone because in the end they may F*** you over. .... It has been great fun playing you learn to not have attachment to your things because next moment you might run into a bear trap someone will kill you and take all your stuff or you go around a corner and theres a huge bear waiting for you!First time in a long time a game made me rage quit and be super off at someone.I would love it if they just added some crappy or good textures for the cement for the monuments and stuff it would look much better maybe add a loading bar! Also optimise abit so people with slow pc's can play too!,Rust

2016-01-22,0,0,97,True,Recommended,So far enjoyable game for me. However would suggest trying to find a local server with less than 5 people on it if you actually want to get anywhere otherwise you will be killed. A lot. Game encourages paranoia in a survival setting and pits you against other players which is really only fun if you're not all chasing each other with rocks. A bit KOS at times but again find a small sever and build your kingdom of pointy sticks and corn.Pros Very open ended huge world spawning resources once you get in the swing of things you can pick it up quickly survival actually feels like survivalCons Paranoia sets in instantly KOS lots of crummy people playing (but what game doesn't have that) frame rate is a pain in the butt especially with a slower system loading takes forever still in early access and has been forever.Final rating 9/10 if you like survival games and find a way to be alone 5/10 if you get stuck on a packed server full of pinheads.,Rust
2014-08-20,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,The game it's self is fun but when you get raided over and over again by hackers it's starts to kill the fun. People flying threw the air stop to kill people then continue to fly threw the air WTF? The developers of this game seem to not even care what happens to it anymore. No updates no new features just the same cheating hackers that destroy the gameplay and make it hard to enjoy the game. I suggest buying this game until they fix the flaws wait till the game is finished hopefully it will get better.Now after all the updates the game runs terrible I can't even play now even though I used to be able to play just fine. The game is still severly lacking and the developers are still sitting on there DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! TERRIBLE GAME,Rust

2014-02-19,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,I bought this game hoping it was a survival game. But it turns out that all I did was go from beating to beatinig. I played for an hour and all anyone kept doing was killing me. There was no instructions on how to survive craft make weapons unlock doors or any of that. I found myself running everywhere especially away from anything that moved. Hoping I couild find a weapon or something to defend myself with. I found rocks charcoal and made wood. I did figure out how to make fire by smashing a tree with a rock it gives you wood which you can use at a campfire to make the fire. I ran into several animals which were mostly players who killed me of course. The one chicken that I did see I couldn't catch well enough to swing the stupid heavy rock to kill it. I even played on a server that said it was just PVE no killing and still everyone just kept killing me. I want my money back. The only thing I can say that is a positive comment on this game is that it did have some good graphics. I am very disappointed. What a waste.,Rust

2014-02-20,0,0,150,True,Recommended,It is almost obscene how fun this game is considering it's still in Alpha. It is very satisfying to play a survival game as someone who can actually survive as opposed to playing as my real life self who can barely survive being social at the mall. You start out naked and alone with only a rock and a torch for company and as you gather resources you can start crafting tools and clothes and eventually you've made yourself a gun and are kicking all kinds of You have to watch your back as other survivors should not be trusted though very annoying when you keep getting shot by someone better off than you it definitely adds to the survival aspect of the game.

2016-12-22,0,0,417,True,Recommended,Do you enjoy intense player vs player situations extensive base building and/or raiding twelve year olds? Then rust is the game for you! Rust has great survival and PvP aspects which is why I recommend it. Many people will not recommend Rust because of the toxic player base but what's more auxilirating than an intense PvP battle where you basically roll the dice on whether or not you die and loose your loot or your enemy dies where you gain loot? People get upset over things like getting raided but seriously? It's a part of the game so get over it. If you have lots of time on your hands to grind for materials to raid and take over the server then vanilla is for you. On the other hand however even if you just have an hour or two on your hands you can hop onto a modded server and get a fairly similar experience. Throughout my many hours and hours put into rust every wipe (where the whole server map and inventories are reset) delivers a brand new experience that can be altered and shaped by your own hands. I would give rust a 8.5/10 only because a toxic player base can be kind of rough sometimes without other friends to play with.,Rust

2016-04-02,0,0,129,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is Crack if you enjoy Survival/Sandbox games.If you have a friend to play with this is one of the best games you could possibly purchase.I honestly sit and play this for about 3 6 hours a sitting whether solo or with a partner due to the depth the game has.You always have something to do farming resources building crafting raiding defending hunting animals hunting other players looking for blueprints to make better weapons etc.This is by far the best game of it's genre that I've come across(Minus ARK SE just because dinosaurs lol) the devs constantly update and add new features as well as fix bugs with solid patches.If you're looking for a game where you literally start from the bottom this is it.The servers are abundant and most of the admins are cool people and allot of the players are willing to help you as long as you're willing to help yourself and not look solely for handouts.Solid game all the way around.Now for my first experience to give you a rough idea of what you're in for.SpawnFarmed some wood and stoneChased and killed a Stag with a stone hatchetMade some pants so my dong was flapping aroundCame across a baseBashed a sleeping guy's head in with a rockTook all his stuffMade better clothes and toolsChased and Killed a HorseCame across another baseHeld up at gunpoint by unfriendly playersShot Firing Squad style by 6 players,Rust

2016-04-02,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,Definately not worth it seriously look elsewhere there are better games to play than this piece of horrific trash.Spend hours grinding resources for quite literally no reason at all as on the way to your homestead you can and will be killed on sight. Alternatively if you are lucky to make the trip back to base with all your building supplies you will be killed because a group of 10 players decided your simple 2x2 brick shithouse was a threat to the massive looming castle 3 fields away.Starring stupid game mechanics like... Bears kill you in two hits and run soo fast you can never evade them Naked men and everywhere (seriously devs? just why?) Flopping to the floor when logged out (someone thought that was a good idea?) Starting with a rock yes you read it correctly a rock Nobody is friendly might as well remove side chat and voice chat Game is an early alpha (that's enough said in my eyes)This game is pathetic not to be enjoyed at all as you spend most of your time stressing someone is going to kill you and when they finally do you respawn run back to your body/base to discover your 6 hours of hard work is gone. This game will not reward you and it will not make you feel like you are building up something or working towards a goal everything will be taken away from you in mere moments and you genuinely will feel like you have wasted your life and you will be ing angry about it.,Rust

2014-02-21,0,0,120,True,Recommended,Although in Alpha this game shows depth and polish that other survival games may be currently lacking. The build and survive mentality is strangely coded into our DNA and this game taps into it.Gamer beware though you will die you will get greifed by players who just kill you for sport and you will eventually get raided and lose everything after spending a couple of days building.

Resouces win how you get them is up to you as the player. You can take them from other players or gather them yourself and haul them off to some small hide away tucked in the hills.While solo playing is not encuraged it is possible however forming a group its your best odds for survival. Other players will want your stuff you will want your stuff you will want their stuff.You will die....and you will die a lot. It wouldnt be a survival game if the focus wasnt to stay alive.,Rust

You can find friendly PVE servers if youre just interested in building. You can also find PVP servers and hunt people or raid their bases while TRYING to defend your own home and resources. Play with friends or make them because you definitly do not wanna play alone. Good luck and have fun! Try not to rage to hard when you get killed because it will happen a lot.,Rust

That being said the game is by far one of the best Survival MMOs I have ever played I have met so many interesting people and have band together with some of my best friends to rule servers and get rekt every other server. With weekly updates and one huge update every month or so the game usually never gets old even after 200+ hours of gameplay if you get bored of it put it down and pick back up in a month and see what new stuff they have added. The community may not be the best and may make it hard to start but TRUST me you will get there and you will make friends along the way to the top. Get ready to rule servers and be ruled by either friendly clans or total heads. """"STORY TIME""""I manged to start the game of first time back in legacy I had a little wood shack built and was being attacked by some random nakeds that had came by. I went to work on smelting some metal and made a pipe shotgun and some handmade shells.I opened the door manged to kill one and chased the other two down yelling ME ""Get the hell out of my land you filthy nudists"" getting the response NAKED ""I will come back in down your chimney you old "" I later figured out they had an M4 and they gunned me down broke into my house and stole my stuff I realized the games wasn't easy but soon after I had met my first partner in Rust and we very slowly but for sure made our way to the top.

2015-12-18,0,0,203,True,Recommended,"Rust is a great game for two reasons gameplay/mechanics devs I've played this game for a long time and I've watched it update along the way. At first the game was great I really enjoyed it. Then the updates started rolling in and eventually it just got so boring that I stopped playing it for a long time. I started up again however and it is great again. This is because the developers are constantly listening to the community on things that they like/don't like. They should be role models for Valve and other game companies on working with the community. The only thing to complain about is getting raided and how when you're offline someone can just take your base without ever putting up a fight. On most Minecraft factions (yes I know Minecraft is stupid and for kids) to raid someone's base you first have to kill them lots of times to get their rating down or something like that. Basically for someone to raid you you have to be online. And for a game like Rust this wouldn't make much since sense Rust is a lot more realistic than Minecraft. However Rust has a ""backup"" to when you get raided and go from 100 to 0 within an hour. This is the blueprint system. If you get killed raided and killed again you can always rely on your Blueprints. Overall it's a great game and I would reccommend it to anyone. It is especially fun if you have a group of friends with which you can make a huge base and rule the server.",Rust
2015-12-18,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,if your a solo or a duo player this game will R**E you ! you build a nice house go to sleep and on the next day there will be no house so the only way to survive is to be in a huge clan. And many servers suck in many ways. like UK/EU Rustoria server. they wipe maps when they whant and give you falce wipe days. they are DDosset ty to bad firewalls and make everyone lag. and are cheater friendly. so sure if you like to play just to get rock and wood for your clan and have 0 fun doing so ty to bad servers do get this game.,Rust

2015-12-23,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,This game started out with promise but with the time this thing has been in Alpha Gary Newman should have been able to make it into an Elder Scrolls game by now.Instead we have a game that has only received mostly cosmetic changes for the past year and Mr. Newman has acted like an insufferable petulant child whenever anyone tries to call him on it.This game and its thousands of clones are everything that is wrong with the Early Access model.

Personally I don't really think so. Why? Because to some people the replay value is awesome to others 15min of game play is all they need to realize they hate it. For a technical Early Access game I do think at least $15 is more appropriate and then $20 when the game is much more stable and where is it close to being ideal,Rust

Then break into my tiny little shack which had nothing but a sleeping bag and campfire in it and destroy it. When I finally had gotten some decent gear by decent I mean I got some pants and a hatchet 3 guys showed up to my little shack and beat the door down and did the same thing again.

2016-01-23,0,0,326,True,Not Recommended,So let me start of with ive played this game since legacy a lot has changed. First off its new engine and loads different crafting and building wise minus demolish since they ly took it out. To make a long story short what the happened to this game it used to be decently optimized and fun now its optimized and lame as hell. That being said player vs player shouldnt even be a thing with how poorly the game and servers run as game is choppy and rubber bands frequently. Building wtf happened to demo? ruins building without it. Animals are either or can bug out and fly strait at your face when pathing wont allow them to do anything else. Like garry really bro? Just keep new additions to building/crafting systems and put it back into legacy.

2017-02-16,0,0,952,True,Recommended,Hell is other people.Let me describe the gameplay first This game is a mix of a FPS and a crafting/building game and is strictly multiplayer (although some serves will be empty so they're as close to SP as you can get). This game is correctly labelled as a survival game but don't be fooled. Most survival games are about defeating monsters or conquering your environment. Not Rust. Rust is about surviving other players. You'll spawn with a rock and torch and you'll use your rock to gather resources to make better tools and eventually a small base if you can manage it.Making your first small base may take a while especially on a well populated server. I recommend trying the game with a friend on a low pop server to get a feel for what it takes to get even the simplest base set up it can be quite difficult on a good day and impossible on a bad day. There is a steep learning curve to this game but if you know someone who knows how to play it will make the experience a lot easier.Once you've got your base set up it's now about two things 1) Defend your base and all its loot2) Raid other players' bases and steal their loot3) Possibly make friends along the way There isn't really a proper end game in Rust and I'm not sure if there will ever be one. But raiding and killing other players can be a satisfying experience. This isn't COD where there is no consequences for losing a skirmish you could lose everything you've worked to achieve. That's what makes this game the most exciting game I've ever played.Servers usually wipe weekly which is more often than I wipe myself which seems fair given that most players come for the initial 'scramble' and after a few days the weaker players get weeded out from the server. It's a blessing and curse on the one hand you want servers to have wiped so that you can join and not instantly be at a disadvantage but you might also want your hard earned work to stick around longer than a week. Either way I highly recommend this game with all it's best and worst.,Rust

While it still took me great effort to get this running at 60FPS on my Dell PC I managed to do so quite well. Rust is a very complex survival game with many stats to keep in check but the environment isn't the threat of the game. The threat is other players as this game is made for PVP. While people will become frustrated with dying constantly as nakeds to the hands of armoured badasses with AKs and ammo to burn there is a saying that explains that quite well. ""This is rust."" You will get raided you will die and you will do so in unfair fights. But every death teaches you a new lesson. Some lessons are free and others you have to pay for.",Rust

2016-01-02,0,0,494,True,Recommended,I have had this game ever since mid 2014 and I have loved every second of it. It feels that the devs really care if we like the improvements or not and really waeigh in our say unlike almost every other game developer in the world. I have clocked in my share amount of hours into this game and couldn't be happier with the improvements that don't seem to ever stop flowing in. Im coming up on 300 hours as of January 2nd 2016 and I am proud to say Rust is my favorite game I've ever played and that's combating with big name titles like Call of Duty and Skyrim which still pushes on strong 5 years down the road. I always can come back to Rust after getting bored of any other game because there is always new features and unpredictable gameplay.

2016-01-02,0,0,1862,True,Recommended,Extremely frustrating game at first but it gets easier as you gain more experience playing it (it took me at least a month of heavy playing to get competent at it). I like the challenging survival aspect of the game. I dislike a server with too many hackers griefers and people who like to shoot fish in a barrel (but these issues tend to plague most Player vs Player online games). Playing people even when they are malicious is more fun than playing a computer. Gameplay strongly favors team play but solos can survive (if they lower their ambitions forget building a castle for instance). Game play seems ideal with 40 100 people on the server. The best part of the game is you can start and stop it at pretty much any time which works great for my hectic work schedule.,Rust

2015-07-26,0,0,627,True,Recommended,I bought this game just after they'd officially canned Legacy and I was not a happy bunny the new Rust was unplayable at that point and the old one had been cut dead.Since then watching new Rust evolve week by week has been a fascinating insight into game development. It already has a unique atmosphere enormous depth and has become just about the only game I have time for. I've gotten my money's worth many times over and it still has a very long way to go. I will actually be sad when the alpha ends. Thanks to this experience I now think open development is a far more rewarding model than just releasing a final product so please Facepunch whatever you do don't ever finish it! Just to update my review... Looking back on 2015 Rust was the only game I really played consistently. I've never gotten so caught up in a game before not just the game but everything surrounding it. I've played other games lots over the years but never felt quite so involved and quite so entertained. Best 15 I have ever spent on entertainment? Yes. I think it probably was. Looking forwards to more top quality escapism from Facepunch and the Rust community in 2016,Rust

2014-01-23,0,0,303,True,Recommended,It's rough around the edges but all diamonds start that way. Here is my tale I have a nice hidden base in a valley rich in resources. I had just gotten back from killing zomies and scavenging a radiation drenched town when I decided to see if I could map out my surroundings a little. Well the neighbors are trapped in a huge struggle with a guy in a face wrap wielding a P250. I snuck my way along the rocks around the edge of the house and tried to creep around the edge to see if I'd been followed and was consequently sprayed to death. I respawn in my base grab a bow and some arrows along with a hatchet and take off in a different direction. I'm stalking a buck brimming with raw chicken breasts when a hail of bullets showers down upon me and get me bleeding. I duck behind a rock bandage then take off. I stop short and dive into a cranny as the guy rips past me. I run the other way and head back to base. This huge pile of wood stopped me dead in my tracks as I furiously hammered away with my hatchet. Lo and behold hail of bullets is back! I load my bow up and shoot the guy in the arm before taking off around a corner. I duck behind the corner into another nook (seriously phenomenal collision detection) as the guy takes off past me. Hey hail of bullets meet arrow to the kneecap. Guy had killed almost all of my neighbors after a long day's work. I was rich. It starts off slow. Spawn in a field run around hitting trees and if you're lucky stones with your rock. You chase down a pig and smack it a couple times with your rock. Some naked guy with an M4 sprays you down. You spawn in a forest just as a huge plane roars over head showering big air drops attached to parachutes. One lands right in front of you! Except you're on the ground because some desperate lunatic shot you with a jury rigged pipe shotgun.You spawn in a field and start running. Night has come and you're very....cold...You're stomach lets out a loud growl and the sun sinks slyly over the last hill. The moon is gorgeous and rising. You bump into a rock. No that's a wolf. You spawn by a coast and heft your rock. You smash it against a dark stone that is standing awkwardly in a field. Somehow you get a few stones and gather some wood by banging said rock against trees. Now you make yourself a stone hatchet. That guy with the pipe shotgun got an MP5A4 from that air drop and tells you to crouch. *Sigh* you do it. He tells you directions and marches you up a steep rock face and has you jump along cliffs. You peer over and see various drop points all the way down to various stages of death. His friend opens a door and a bunch of other new players walk over to the cliff at shotgun point. They tell us to pay bullseye. The only platform that looks remotely survivable has a shelter on it. That's what we're aiming for. We jump. Most of us die. You survive with 2 others but sustain severe injuries. They throw you supplies. They throw you makeshift handcannons and some ammunition. You understand. You grab them and kill one of the others while they question it. The other guy is fumbling long enough for you to kill him too. The guy with the MP5 shoots you.You spawn in a forest near a zombie. You manage to kill it with your rock. He has a bolt action rifle on him that's loaded. A big plane roars overhead and to your luck drops a big package right near you. You run over and make it there as it lands. A shirtless guy holding a rock is laughing in the mic and going through it. He spawns in a field.,Rust

2016-07-03,0,0,490,True,Not Recommended,I know it is still in early access. So far most of the contents are impressive. However because it is still in early access I really do hope the developer can put game balance in it. Solo player or players with less than 5 people are basically unplayable in server ( Well basically those pvp clan( &gt 10 ppl) can crash your base in 10 mins). I know that Rust is all about survival but what is the point of suriving when the pvp clan dominate the whole servers' resources and new player either join the clan or be killed on sight. It's a game. And a game should have a rule that gurantte least equality for every players.,Rust

2015-05-31,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,This game is a reason why games should be finished before being put out on the market Rust crash's so many times it's makes it unplayable and less appealing to me as a player. Beta's should have a time frame not pay us money and we will finish Rust later I want the game developer to finish their game first not give me a beta and give updates as time goes on. This way of doing things just seems lazy to me and at least I won't ever get a finished product hell look at Dayz. I would rate a 2 out of 5 just because when it does work it's fine other then that I really don't think it's worth the money until the game really does get finished.,Rust

2015-12-26,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Had high hopes for this game. I was disappointed to say the least. Now I gotta admit that my system is not the best but it at least meets the minumum requirements. Doesn't even reach 20 fps on the lowest of the lowest graphics which look absolutely disgusting. I would have been fine with that if only I would get at least a decent framerate. GTA V runs fine on my system while this game doesn't even hit the 20 fps mark on what looks like 8 bit graphics?

2015-12-26,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"In my opinion it goes like this Rust is a great game and after seeing the amazing transition that it had from the browser state to this proves that the developers are capable of actualy finish this at some point unlike other ""survival"" titles of which we are aware will never get finished EVER!Altough my knowledge about how the game plays is limited (i couldn't get far enough into the game to have my own personal expecience sorry) i can only go with what i have seen on the internet specificly youtube which btw is the cause that made me buy the game thinking i can at least run it with 40 fps on low medium graphic.I WAS WRONG!This seems to be a common problem in this day and age Rust is not the only one suffering from the ""pretty unoptimized game"" in fact if i were to take any other title that calls itself ""survival"" Rust might be the best optimized game out there.I honestly do not belive that its looks are the ones that are pulling the game right now but the good mechanics that it has (with this im including gunplay building and crafting). All that said i cannot recommend this game for its poor performance (we shall not be talking about the how other people will treat you in game because im sure that is pointed out enough by others).Even if it is in alpha stage it does not look promising to me that the system specs will drop anytime soon or maybe at all in the (hopefully) finished product. This being a mostly shooter open world game i cannot accept sub 40 fps (usualy its 60 but hey its open world).There are a few other things i would like to mention 1) You could take your chances and buy the game now for cheap and hope that in the finished produc it will run smooth as butter and at the same time not have to pay for the obviously incread price for a finished product.2)In case you are wondering what kind of potato PC i have that i can't run this game at 40 fps minimum here are my specs (I know some people will still consider my cpu a potato but not everyone can afford to lick intel's disguisting prices...sorry it's a personal hate that i have twoards intel to word it that way)CPU AMD Phenom IIx4 965 Black Edition 3.4GH/zGPU Nvidia 970GTX Asus Strix Direct CU II OC Edition with 4GB Vram GDDR5 (All drivers for both motherboard and GPU are up to date)Ram 20 GB DDR3 1333 MHzHark Disk 1 TB HDD (i know its old but it does not affect fps)My review might not get updated since at the moment of writing this i have requested a refund because my friends are not able to play the game either and you should know that this game is no fun alone.",Rust

2015-12-26,0,0,1235,True,Recommended,I've had rust for a while now and i love the game. If you are a person that likes farming all day there are plenty or rocks and trees to build a castle. If you enjoy the pvp the rad towns are always full of people looking for a fight. I would definitely give the game a thumbs up. My only problems with the game are that it seems like it could be optimized a little better and the load in time is pretty significant. It is still a pretty good for the fact that it is early access.,Rust

2014-07-08,0,0,126,True,Not Recommended,Bought Rust on 7/5/2014. The game seems to be going in the right direction when it comes to survival games. However many of the servers have constant cheaters and hackers who can shoot through walls even though others can't. High Level players continually grief on the lower level players and steal the items before they can even get started. Lag is a major inconvience during firefights and hunting animals.

Your main goal is to survive from what is around no longer by zombies but animals and your biggest threat. In that case which is a hacker that cannot die and an fly around the game. Btw I play on a mac works great no promblems. But you cannot play official servers because they always have one guy flying around the map and yelling random words. In steam with these hackers they can change their name in rust but there real name on steam can be ""69696969"". I enjoyed the game but only playing on modded servers but even then you will have one guy that you know as a enemy from him hitting you with a rock and days will go on and you will have victory if you have your naked rock army go aganist that one guy. But imagine your at your throne with your friends. You go off and your vault room is gone everything! Even the large crate of rocks you collected from all the people you went aganist in kevlar! GONE! This is what happened to me in an official server and my advice is to buy this game in your own caution because apparently you cannot defend aganist the flying naked with shotguns that hit you from 1000 meters away. you Rust.",Rust

2014-06-24,0,0,106,True,Recommended,This game has a lot of potential (it's still in Alpha still developing into final product ) and so far I like it a lot. It started out as a DayZ clone (from what I've read I never played DayZ). As of right now it's your basic survival PvP game the only downside I've seen with the style is that you have to connect with a server to play no offline mode available. If you really wanted to play alone after Alpha stage there are rumors of being able to host your own server. Anyway that's not really part of the review is it? Because this game is highly based on learning skills and collecting items to raid others and collect even more items you'd think you're starting over a lot but this doesn't have to be the case. A nice aspect of the game is LEARNING how to craft everything you'll need and knowing is half the battle ) Once you know how to craft the best weapons and armor in the game you have a much easier time bouncing back from a raid.Playing with friends definitely helps make this a more memorable experience. It also helps to have a few friends around when your base is being raided.If you play on standard servers stealing someone's base and all their items is as easy as blowing off their doors and killing them while they sleep (once you enter the server you never leave you just fall asleep wherever you log off). You put up new doors with new locks and voila you're done. Knowing that they know where their own base is kind of puts you on edge though knowing they could come back with explosive charges to take back their base when you log off... All in all great game so far I can't wait to see what they do with it!,Rust

2014-06-24,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,A little bit glitchy a little bit boring. I had some fun but I ran into some abusive admins who refused to play the game and eventually banned us from their server after we told them that we would rather play the game than get spawn killed over and over again. There isn't quite enough there for the game to be worth twenty dollars at the moment. Guns are basically the way to win the game. If you have guns then there is nothing to be scared of. There are a few vicious animals that you have to fight to get certain materials but it all becomes so easy once you get guns. Really this game needs more work. Whether or not you buy it now is irrelevant. It will certainly become a good game once they release the finished product but there isn't enough there. At least not for me. Again the game is still in development. I say don't spoil the experience by playing it now. Wait just a little longer,Rust

2015-09-07,0,0,2169,True,Recommended,"Let me preface this by saying this game is incredibly fun and completely worth the $20 bucks it's going for at the moment. Rust is the most infuriatingly fun game there is right now.I'm not going to do a pros and cons for you like most would. I'm going to keep it short sweet and to the point.Simply put this is not a SURVIVAL game. This game is about 10% PVE and 90% PVP. Despite what the description says and what some players might say this game is not centered on survival. Hunger thirst and fatigue are just a small fraction of what you have to be concerned with while playing. You can play for hours and not think about your hunger and thirst once. This game is all about getting a base started keeping the furnaces burning crafting those weapons raiding other player's bases defending against other players trying to raid youFor what this game really is it is a ton of fun. Going solo is simply not sustainable. You will die and you will lose your base if you go it alone. If you are in a group this game is much more fun because then you have teammates who will have your back when the wolves come knocking.If you want a game where you are fighting against the elements and mother nature to survive then this game isn t for you. Try ""The Long Dark"" or something similar. (TLD is a really fun and addicting PVE survival game)If you want an open world shooter game that makes you earn your weapons. If you want to fight other players. If you like gun battles. If you like explosives and destruction. If you want a game that can offer you fast paced action and the occasional lull to catch your breath. Then this game is probably for you.",Rust

And its rewarding in some points. BUT in order to play this game and to like this game you can't play it alone. Its necessary to have friends. To have alliances. IF and i mean if somebody is raiding your home and your alone your 'ed. I mean seriously. Alone you can't do So take a helpful hint from me and make allays . Even from neighbours next to you. I usually take out my guitar naked and go sing to their walls. That helps a lot (Adele Hello. Nysc bye bye bye. etc)Development is going in rapid pace. Compared to dayz i think its going waay better. And their main goal is performance not content. What i personally love. On my rig fx6300270x8gb ramI can have ""beautiful"" performance on 60+fps I can even record stuff without worrying that it might ruin my fps. Games looks astounding.I absolutley recommend it.

To make matters worst you will NEVER get ahead on a PVP server. Those jerks with guns will always shoot the crap out of you for the fun of it.,Rust

2015-12-08,0,0,51,True,Recommended,"Rust is my first ""survival"" type game played. The way I can discribe it is a cross between MineCraft and a Shoot em up (Survival/Build/Shoot people dead game). If you have ever played and like MineCraft but would prefer real life graphics then you will LOVE Rust. Some people are nice and others aren't so if you get killed running around naked the first 10 or so times dont quit. Persistance is the name of the game just make sure to be nice and others may respond the same. Before you know it you will have a clan of people backing you and a huge amount of loot in your house.For a better view of Rust go to YouTube and Look up Rust Game play.",Rust

I think it's a mistake though and it should be labeled as ""broken"" rather than ""unfinished."" I wish I could get a refund but I bought it about a year ago before Arkham Knight changed Steam's refund policy. Don't get me wrong if the game is ever eventually finished it has lots of potential to be very fun but this review is about the game in its current state. It's still very buggy it crashes frequently and the time investment vs the rewards you get doesn't make it worth your time.

Expect to die expect to have stuff taken and above all else expect to think lower of human nature (with the exception of a few friendly naked men).My advice Make friends. Simple. (Who want's to travel the woods alone?)My only negative feedback for Rust would be jumping. It's improved over the year but still a bear to use at times. I hope they can get jumping to feel fluent and not wonky.A huge kudos to Garry and his team at Facepunch. I cannot commend those guys enough. They kick Look at any other teams transparency on the state of the game and what's ahead and compare it to these guys. They keep me informed tell me like it is and keep on making Rust a game to come back to. Cheers guys,Rust

2015-02-09,0,0,498,True,Recommended,The durability is so off it makes it impossible to play. You only spawn with a rock that breaks as soon as you get enough resources to make a stone hatchet. That is fine. But the stone hatchet dies before you can get enough resources to make a second one AND build anything. You cant make a pick axe because you cant get enough stone with a stone hatchet to make another stone hatchet and get enough stone for a furnace. So you are potentially just able to make a stone hatchet over and over and maybe get a tiny bit of wood. I love this game.. or did. This update made me not even want to play it anymore. It is much too unbalanced. Buildings didnt need to be more raidable. It was easy to raid already! Im choosing yes to recommend because there is no maybe,Rust
2014-06-17,0,0,1707,True,Not Recommended,After over a year of this game being out in alpha state I am very dissapointed in it. Initialy my friends and I were very excited about the game. It showed great potential and the devs were doing there best to improve it and make it better. Then all of a sudden that stopped and they told us they had to completely re write the game. Before the did that they were telling us about all the stuff they were going to fix and change and add into the game. Like they were going to add stone structures and traps that could be built into your homes and bear or animal type traps and weather and water on the solid ground etc... Turns out they completely changed there focus since they supposedly wrote the original game in completly horrible code. I get it these things happen. However they made over $30 million dollars in less than a year on a bad release of the game. I Think that with all that money they could have hired some additional devs to help get the re written version out. Now as of today they forced out a big patch to the game and supposedly the expiramental re written version is out there to try even though they dont recommend it yet. Well if you dont recommend it then why even allow us to try to access it that makes no sense. I did try to access it and it wont even load into a game environment it just constantly crashes. I did everything they said to do and nothing works at all the expiramental version is not accessable at all for me. In addition the old version is also un playable since the operators of the servers for the most part have not updated there servers and of course if they are running any mods at all then they will still be broke until they get the mods fixed or take the mods off. Oh and by the way my friends and I do not even like to play the vanilla version of rust there are just too many features that the game in regular mode is missing. I am sure this is not the opinion of other players in the community. However judging by the launcher where you go find the servers and looking and the number of moded over non moded I do believe the community prefers the game with certain mods. So the dev's should be looking at this and probably writting into the game some of these features that the players like. And possibly make it so when a server admin is setting up there server they can turn on and of some features as they desire. All of this without having to go out and find a 3rd party mod to make the game work better. A true awesome game is one where the majority of the features that the player base prefer are a normal part of the game and do not require and 3rd party addons to be implemented not even on the server side. So again the game has been out over a year and they already made over $30 million dollars and yet they dont even have a beta version yet instead they and a complely re written alpha state game that you cant even play at all. So I was a fan of the game and of Steam and Of the dev team like Gary Newman. However now i am no longer even remotly happy with them at all. If they dont get this up and running in a decent playable version soon and into a beta state not only will I not play this game anymore but I most likly will never purchase any game that this dev team has anything to do with. And I may even stop playing any game that Steam has anything to do with at all. I am extremely dissapointed with STEAM and This DEV team!,Rust

I respawned and died countless times trying to return to my now bare home it took a few hours to figure out the best course of action for gathering and where to build what areas to avoid and how best to defend myself and my property but once i'd figured it all out things started flowing raiders died quickly and i made a foothold as a nomad not to be trifled with ) I explained this to a friend of mine as Fallout online this is how a survival mmo SHOULD be and have found no issues with this game that would turn me off it.

2015-02-11,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,This is not worth 20 bucks so I tried to find a good deal on it.I found it sold somewere for 6 bucks bought it and let me tell you it is not worth 6 bucks either.It is impossible to learn the game if all you do is get shot and hit with a rock everytime you try to understand the mechanics.If I could understand the game then I would not give a when people started to kill me because at least I understood how to have a chance.Not recomended if you have not been here to learn in the past because they give you no chance to try to learn now.,Rust
2015-02-11,0,0,107,True,Recommended,The combat system is rubbish in he game so far no matter what server you go to it seems. That being stated its a great game that teaches you nothing but the most terrible sides of people. I love it! Lots of building and non stop pvp even when you log out! Worth the price. Please bare in mind its still in beta and you are just paying to play test it basically.,Rust
2015-01-24,0,0,1353,True,Recommended,"The game in it's current state is like an aging porn star the years of cocaine have killed it on the inside but enough time and energy has been poured into the visuals to make it appealing until you get into the game. When you do however get to it you realize that while they added raiding back they did it by removing a vast majority of your ability to defend against it. While I realize it's still going through tweaks I don't like the concept of one person being able to tear down the largest base with nothing more than patience and a plethora of tools.Pros A really good building system Cannibalism Pretty damn good graphics Explosives!!!! It's finally started to progress at a reasonable rate A lot of the things that would really help the game are small things like adding different types of meat which was cool in legacy because everything tastes like chicken and it's not like they don't have the models and such they just haven't changed the loot tablesCons The building system is buggy as hell Doors have a nasty habit of despawning randomly leaving your base open There's very little counterplay to raiding without very complex defenses most of which are useless on servers without teleports The maps feel empty like they could use more animal spawn points and more of the ""rad towns"" There's very little to do outside of gathering the blueprints and rebuilding your base after it gets raided Up until the most recent patch it's been going at a mind bogglingly slow pace",Rust

2015-04-05,0,0,138,True,Recommended,i recomend it as i have about 800 hours of playing the game on a differnt account and this is a fun game to kill time and play with freinds but the only bad things about the game is the fact that there is no water in land and the weather never changes im talking about the old version because i think that its much better and im sure im not the only one to think this but if they put in rain snow fog and other such things and water inland with rivers and lakes and if you could make makshift boats and other things the game would be alot better and more popular.,Rust

The one thing i like about this game is the fun running around and surviving. The bad thing is the players. Most players will walk up to you and try to kill you. Sometimes they have guns sometimes they have different tools. They will follow you and kill you for your stuff you will most likely be killed alot. The game is nice and I recommend it.,Rust

2017-06-18,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,I gave this a serious shot and still just can't find enough there to recommend it. Rust at its most rewarding is a decent survival game with ok base building. It only ever reaches this point rarely however and the rest of the game is grinding becoming cautiously hopeful and then having the work of a few hours of your life dashed away in a few infuriating seconds. I sadly missed the chance to refund the game having resolved to give it a fair shot and I honestly regret every cent I shoveled towards the game. I want to like it I really do it just isn't fun subjecting yourself to the same tortuous cycle of trying hard to get somewhere and getting destroyed. Plus as I'm sure a 100 other negative reviews have already mentioned the community is about as toxic as it gets. I regret the hours and the money I wasted on this piece of trash.,Rust

2016-11-14,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"This game has so much potential and I can't wait until it gets finished if ever. The community is a pretty interesting mix of 12 year old dumb trolls and down to earth players who will help you out. This game is all about finding the right server to play on. I had some annoying times when I walk up totally naked with nothing saying to a fully armed group ""don't shoot friendly"" and they just kill for no reason other than to do so. This will happen all of the time on random servers which is why finding the right server is key to having fun. The crafting system and variety of server options is a ton of fun. Some servers have you level up extremely fast or at a much slower pace whichever you prefer. It's definitely one of the better survival games I've played and would recommend to at least give it a try.",Rust

2014-06-09,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,The game starting out kind of addicting but was quickly ruined by all the hackers. I've played a lot of open world style games like this but have never seen so many hackers. Over the course of the 10 hours that I've played I've built 9 decent sized houses and attempted to stockpile a bunch of resources. 7 of those times a player has magically walked through the walls of my house killed me and stolen my then built a wall around my house so I couldn't gain access to it. The other 2 times my house was just simply gone when I logged back on. I'll probably still play just to attempt to get my moneys worth but for those that haven't bought it take your money somewhere else for the time being. There are plenty of other good games on steam to spend your money on.,Rust
2014-06-09,0,0,129,True,Recommended,The game is still in the early stages of its' development. Far from completion Rust is a PvP masterpiece which successfully replicates some aspects of dystopian survival. The game is only 20$ and will eventually evolve into a critically aclaimed gem. My advice purchase the game now while the price remains low. Buy now before the cost doubles or even triples..,Rust
2014-06-09,0,0,7,True,Recommended,besides that the game is very fun even more with friends but pvp is a little buggy with the net code and all every thing else is okay. i am not recomending the game in its current state as pvp will screw you over again and again also its realy hard to get into but once you do it is a great experience. pvp bad every thing else good not recomended if you like to pvp wait untill the next version for better net code,Rust

2014-06-09,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,This game in its current form embraces all that is bad about human nature. Better equipped players kill the lesser just to keep them from oneday being better equipped. If you expect no mercy the butthurt rage won't be unbearable when you get killed just as you start being decently equipped. At some point you become that which you hate about the game in order to survive.Likes I like the crafting starting on a basic level and building to quite sophisticated. Being able to build lockable structures rocks. I like raiding ruins for loot and meds. Radio activity adds to the thrill. Hates Game is butt ugly. Nothing is animated well. Animals are lulzy and the whole engine is dated. I don't like the concentration of spawn. It should drop you where you will have a chance to evolve without being murdered.I wouldn't recommend the game in it's current form. It's need tons of work.,Rust

2017-07-06,0,0,55,True,Not Recommended,My biggest issue with this game is the awful optimization. This game doesn't look great and plays like Long loading times lag spikes not to mention that playing on a lower graphic setting is essential. When I bought this game I could play it effortlessly on a 8gb ram computer on mid settings. Now I crash on the lowest settings because that's no longer enough. Yet the game still looks like a playstation one game. Lots of people complain about the community but there's nothing to do about that this game has an awful community so does every game like it.Fix the broken game before you start modifying with the game mechanics because the optimization here is inexcusable.,Rust

2014-11-20,0,0,1036,True,Recommended,Well I've played well over 800 hours of rust. Most likely will hit a thousand within the next month or two. By far my most played game. Definitely my favorite. Yet I could never write a review for it on my game review website. It changes so often so much to cover and to personal to talk about objectively. But here we go...In the beginning just a few years ago there was Legacy. This was my first experience with rust where I spent many hours running shooting raiding etc. I made lots of friends and even more enemies. However the game started to feel insanely repetitive dull and old. That was when facepunch announced that they would start working on a new version of rust. Completely remake the entire game. I was beyond excited and began playing as soon as it was available. Over that past couple years I've been playing (new) Rust with my friends and it's been some of the most memorable moments of my life. We've watched the game grow from just a few models in a white box to what is in my opinion the best survival game on the market. Full of features runs pretty well looks absolutely wonderful and is updated every week for as long as I can remember. There are thousands of servers 10s of thousands of players all of which are for this one early access survival game and it's for a reason. Its ing amazing.There is much more to do than build break kill and survive. It was just a few days ago that I built a town that had over 30 buildings and was completely walled in. Another time where I traveled with a band across the world performing for anyone we encountered. Setting up stores. or being complete s and just killing everyone we see. There's so many ways to play and even after 800 hours I have never been bored of it. If you are deciding between Rust or any other early access game I think you should go with this. Lots of fun to be had especially with friends or family. Avoid the community (reddit) and just enjoy the game and don't criticize every single aspect.,Rust

2016-06-27,0,0,821,True,Recommended,"First let me start by saying the Devs are doing a great job updating this game and fighting off the hackers. This game can be really difficult solo but with practice it becomes much easier. Having a team is the easiest way to play because you can literally take on anyone. With this being said the community has become very relient on ""clans"".Not clans of like 5 10 people but clans containing over 20 people on larger servers. They'll setup 24 hour rotation schedules between all of their members so that their base is always being watched. This seems very overkill for a video game but with over 500 hours on record who am I to judge haha As of right now I've paid 3 cents per hour played so kudos to that.",Rust

2014-12-20,0,0,421,True,Recommended,OK so here is what I think. The new graphics are great but the game still full of bugs the sounds are weird some times they crash and makes a annoying sound. The animals crash a lot like you are running trying to catch them and they stop then you start killing them and they reappear 100 meters ahead. I know the game is a alpha version yet so this things should be one of the things to improve. I'm not saying it's a bad game actually it is a awesome game but it still have a lot of bugs to correct. Good things? The new menu of building and hand made is very better then the last one the life hunger etc strips were in my opinion a great idea. The map is HUGE!! Keep the good work and the game will be one of the best games of survival. If you keep correcting bugs and keep improving the game it will be one of the few that will make front to the old MINECRAFT.,Rust

So there are all these rocks laying about. One would think you can just pick them up but oh no you can't. Even the larger ones I hit I got nothing! I ended up getting metal first! I completely bypassed the stone tools and wen't straight too getting metal tools. After I had my tools I'm determined to find stones.. So I go off on the hunt for rock! Know how long it took? 2 hours.. And 11 minutes.. 2 hours and 11 minutes!! That's flipping crazy to me. Just to find ONE rock I could actually hit and get resources from..

2014-02-21,0,0,97,True,Not Recommended,I've been playing Rust for a while and it was a f*rust*rating experience. A survival multiplayer game in Alpha status has one main issue to solve if there are no innovations/updates the game gets boring which means every player has seen every part of the game so they start killing people on sight. Rust reached this status in January. Since then it is no more fun to play. There were only a few updates too.Right now they are doing a relaunch. I would not set too much hope in it (after all Garry Newman is still CEO of this company D ) but still it is a big chance.

Legacy is the best rust except there are hackers everywhere now. They need to bring the new rust crafting system into legacy and just work on legacy. The new rust is horrible because its laggy your cant remove grass there are a huge number of bugs and I am also angry at the fact that they had such a great game and threw it away. I will continue to play legacy until the new rust becomes bug free and less horrible which i am presuming to be a very long time.,Rust
2015-01-02,0,0,233,True,Recommended,Played Rust during the Legacy version was great fun. But after playing with the latest Experimental version I fell in love with the new crafting and inventory mechanics. Textures have been completely overhauled and look absolutely stunning. Though it does chug my PC to the point of almost overheating but by pressing F2 while in game one can set the graphics on the fly as you play.,Rust
2015-01-02,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"I knew what I was getting into with the Rust Alpha. I've played other Alphas before like Evolve and DayZ so I knew that Rust would be broken. I did my homework before I bought the game. I looked up reviews videos watched live streames etc. What I SAW was a fun survival game that would be like a less serious DayZ. So I bought it. I played it. I don't know if I saw early gameplay footage or a different game entirely but when I connected to a server for the first time I saw black ground. ""oh must be a glitch"" I thought to myself so I kept roaming on. I encountered a pack of bears and thought that I should fight them because I needed the food. I walked up to one of them and attacked Click Click Click Click the bear fell over dead. I turn around expecting to see the other two bears attack me but they were just looking at me. I walked straight up to one of them and it didn't even have any sort of movement animations. It just stood there as I beat it to death with a rock. Same with the third bear. As soon as I skinned the bears for their Wolf Skulls and Raw Human Meat (Yes that is exactly what I recieved from looting the bears) I ventured on to the woods. I took a look at my Health Bar Half HP Half Hunger Half Thirst. I was ok and didn't need to eat. Suddenly my character just fell over dead. How did I die? I didn't see anyone I didn't hear a gun or a bow my health was fine so what killed me? I spawned with nothing except a rock and a torch and met up with some random dude who when I confronted him immediatly shot me to death. At this point I am a little angry but I know its an alpha and I should expect hostile players so I respawn. This time I kill more animals (Which once again equipped me with more wolf skulls and Raw Human Meat) Craft a Bow and multiple arrows and I am ready to survive. Oh wait did I say survive well what I ment was immediatly dying of NOTHING as soon as I equipped the bow. At that point I said (and I quote) "" it this I'm done"". TL DL version I spent $20 on this game hoping to have an experiance like I have heard of and seen in videos and what I got was basically an entirley different game. Sorry Facepunch but if you are going to make an entirley new game make sure you know HOW to make new games since your only other game is Garry's Mod.",Rust

2015-01-02,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,I cannot believe I spent more than 2 hour's pay on this feces. It is totally unplayable! Your first experience in Rust is the death screen. You respawn and wake up and pray to God no one has spawned near you in the past 5 minutes nor will in the next 5 because if anyone is near you they will kill you even though you havent got anything worth stealing. If you manage to miraculously survive long enough to find resources you'll be ambushed and killed while gathering. And finally if the stars planets and microcosms are all aligned perfectly and you manage to find an animal before a player finds you you are defenseless against animals too! For the life of me I cannot imagine why it's called rust...nothing lasts long enough to corrode or oxidize.,Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,101,True,Recommended,"Have been playing this game for around a week now. Despite the fact that it is an Alpha it seems to be well optimized no glitches so far (even though I'm running it on an average laptop). Also the gameplay idea is great allthough quite tough once in a while especially at beginning (obtaining decent weapons building a camp etc. is quite hard) + most of the other players are hostile. Like for example the other eve played together with my bro were on a looting trip to one of the points of interest. So were looting the boxes minding our own business when suddenly three guys show up and start shooting. We owned two of them and tracked down the third. He looked like just started cloth armor hatchet nothing special and eventually seemed quite scared. So we let him go and even gave him some flares and meat. Didn't loot his dead friends too. We went back to the factory to finish our looting however these guys respawned and took us by surprise. I was very surprised that it took only one ""arrow in the knee"" to put me down for good despite I had full Kevlar armor. So it means we'll spend again 2 days of playing to craft our weapons and ammo back. Anyways going on we will shoot on sight guess it's the only way to stay alive.In summary the game is good and I totally recomend it if you like survival/zombie games + at alpha stage it is a bargain (18.99 EUR) however I'm afraid that people are already turning this to another deathmatch &amp quot quot ...",Rust

2017-07-04,0,0,935,True,Recommended,This game is not a game that will deliver a fun experience at every moment. This is a game that will often be frustrating and sometimes repetetive to play. But when you get into a real fight or into a raid your heart will pump harder than ever before. There is no other game that can deliver it better. When you win that fight and secure loot there is no other game that can deliver that good feeling. The game can be played in many ways and all should be tried by you because the are so different. Rust is fixing more and more of its issues but many still remain tho. It is walking in the right direction very fast. Pick up the game now because its on its way to full release.The community could be better but on the other hand theres a lot of good guys out in the rust world aswell just like in real life theres a lot of greedy bastardsEveryone should try solo playing. its the ultimate rust experience and delivers the most dangerous hardest experience and gives the the biggest adrenaline kicks in my opinion.But also try playing in a group here teamwork comes into play which is both fun and challenging10/10 best spent money in my life,Rust

2014-07-14,0,0,130,True,Recommended,O rust where to start fun and adictive but there are flaws as there is with every game. For one you build a base if you make it this far and you start to gather and you have stuff gatherd then you get raided when your on or off line. so your but you try again and again and again but the same thing happens. Every surver you join. Friends are key to this game a group or as many people as you can get. but be carful to whom you trust.,Rust

2014-07-14,0,0,18,True,Recommended,This game is very good and is very fun to play however it is very demanding as far as RAM and harddrive usage. I have 4 gig on my computer the minimum and it is very very laggy and almost impossible to play. There are also lots of glitches but I hope to see them go away as the game develoeps. When it comes out of Alpha I expect it to get better. Overall I enjoy this game and look foward to seeing the finished product.

2014-07-20,0,0,931,True,Recommended,Amazing game. Definitely not for peaceful people that want to farm in peace in Rust you are not safe since your first minute ingame and early you've got to play as low profile as possible to not get targeted by house raiders or simple killers.After you worked for your first resources you'll have to build a small base possibly hidden somewhere deep in mountains to keep everything safe from raiders and start from there to farm resources / kill people to get yourself the best equips in the game and a big safe house.Anything could happen in Rust you could lose all your stuff farmed in hours with just 1 shoot in the head but you might also find a C4 explosive on the first naked guy running around. The endless possibilities of this game is what amazes me in eac server you don't build the same house and in the same place everything changes and keeps the fun.,Rust

2014-07-20,0,0,140,True,Not Recommended,Game is great nice gameplay good graphics good servers. Unfortunately the game runs about as good as the handrock you start with in the game. Since day one I've been getting game freezes. Every 2 seconds the game completely freezes sometimes freezing for 10 seconds and sometimes a whole 10 minutes it's feels like I'm watching a slideshow instead of playing a game. I tried playing for a while and bearing with it hoping it would smooth itself out thinking that maybe it was just loading the map but no same constant freezing. And no it isn't my PC I've got a high end gaming computer which can run battlefield 4 at ultra settings at 60 fps. And I'm not the only person dealing with this there's forums full of people with the exact same problem. I've checked every possible solution to get it to work half decently from running it on rock bottom settings to updating my drivers to even disabling my sound devices no difference for me or the dozens of players out there with the same issue. I've paid a full retail price of 20 $ for a game that is still in alpha and runs like garbage and I've not gotten my money's worth in fact I feel like this isn't even worth a fraction of what I've paid for it it's been 2 weeks and no fix for it. I've been talking with game support trying to see if they know what the problem is but they don't seem to have an answer either. I DO NOT recommend this game for anyone till the developers fix this game. A full 20 $ down the toilet good job Garry you really f***ed this s*** up haven't you.P.S. All the gameplay time I have in this game is just from me trying to get it to work.,Rust

Sure the XP system is debatable. But it is in development. What really ruins this game are the cheaters (and yes I refuse to call them hackers).

There are Flying people (so they just fly into your base no matter how many walls there are around your base) Aimbotters (insta headshot) ESD WallhacksAnd sadely this is not only the case on the official servers (sure it is much worse there) but the cheating is spreading like the plague and since some months it has reached the community servers as well.

I then found a server with a low population but very friendly people who helped me understand what was going on what did what and all that sort of thing. This simple matter made everything much more enjoyable.Give this game some time and I think you will see the possibilty for fun that this game has to offer.

2016-06-14,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,Your first day in rust 1. Spawn on an island with massive buildings all around2. Start doing the basics3. Get shot/attacked almost immediately EVERY TIME YOU SPAWN IN4. Either die on the spot or run until you starve to death5. Repeat processSeriously this game would be great if not for the extremely toxic community that kills fresh spawns and makes the game almost impossible to progress. I would reccommend playing on an extremely small official server because it seems like all people want to do is find new spawns and taunt/kill them. If you're looking for a smooth introduction to a survival game do not buy this game. That being said I've only played 1 hour but it was possibly the worst 1 hour gaming experience of my life. I may try this game again once I start playing with a team but for now this game is not for me.,Rust
2014-09-02,0,0,58,True,Not Recommended,First and foremost the development team on this game has stopped working on gameplay as far as I know. There were rumors going around that the studio had disbanded which I only learned after visiting their website but the changes so far have been strictly dedicated to mundane things such as the appearance of the grass (which had to be turned off via a console command due to my system running like molasses due to it) and the textures/models of trees and animals. Rust has remained unchanged during the past year of my alpha testing (for $19.99 US) in places where it counts up to and including a general direction overall experience GUI guild or alliance affiliation etc. etc. up to and including that every piece of meat harvested from an animal (bears pigs wolves) is labeled 'chicken breast'. After a year nobody had bothered to change the label or even give a second glance to that kind of infrastructure.This game is an alpha build and they are apparently okay with that indefinitely.,Rust

2016-05-23,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,A meat grinder killfest. So much potential but sadly the majority of the playerbase actively seems to enjoy making players change to another server.There is little to no direction in the game. No common goal or enemy. No threat other than each other. Survival is easy in Rust until you see another player. Usually being killed also entails a list of chat based insults or weird voice based ones that leave you worried about how the kid on the other side of the mic will turn out as a functioning adult.Until a fledged out endgame or real survival threats are added as a reason to band together and not simply reward constant griefing and killing with an adrenaline high this game is to be played as a deathmatch you need to work for.Not worth it. Overwatch ot something is better. At least you both have guns then.,Rust

You wont really learn about the deep systems and start to take on large clan activities until maybe 500 hours into the game. Clans have a strict recruitment requirment of a high number of in game hours for members. This could likely be skipped if you were a very good PVPer. At this point I have not become frustrated with the game but it could use some serious optimization as it doesnt run amazing well on my very good rig.

2014-01-09,0,0,161,True,Not Recommended,"This is a ""POV review"" just a basic recap of why I think this game is not worth it anymore.I got Rust 3 years ago and when I first played the game it was quite fun especially with the rage at that time being survival fps games. The game pinned you vs the environment wildlife and ofcourse other players. It wasnt the prettiest or most well optimised game heck I can even remember when glitching through walls and doors was the BEST way to raid. I miss the zombies they really added something to the game that I miss now sure they were ly strong and some were so damn annoyingly fast but I loved huddling up with 10 other guys in a fort we built and constantly having to protect it from other players and having competitions sniping zombies. Then they got rid of the zambies and updated everything the ui graphics map's all that jazz the game ran way worse I felt for a long time and then through the weekly updates the last year and a half to two years actually started to look like it could be fun. I would hop in and out of the game at various stages in development and honestly I just never felt like the game was as fun as it was when it first came onto the scene. It looked better every time I came back to it and had more content but sortof lost it's soul and with that it's playerbase also. The comradery and the team effort seamed to fade everyone just popping into the game now and then to see whats up make some new gizmo and then get bored and leave. I dont know if it is because the game is broken at it's core (the concept) or if the development of the game is simply not ambitious enough but it feels like this game has been in early access for 3 years and will be until the day it fizzles out and dies. I have good memories in this game I was very hyped for it's release sadly now it feels like a empty shell trying to cash in on slight increments of improvement",Rust
2014-03-04,0,0,1883,True,Recommended,"So much has changed since I originally reviewed Rust and yet its all still there on Legacy Mode. Rust had a full reboot and is just now starting to come back together. I still recommend this game 1 year and 500 hours in game later. There are patches every week (heck every hour if you are playing on dev mode). There are Devblogs every week on their website. There is a fantastic fellow named Bugs over at Rustafied.com who runs a server and website and basically dedicates himself to analyzing testing and telling the community about whats going on in rust on a hourly/daily basis from a fan's perspective not a dev's. Though the devs have been giving him more peeks behind the scenes lately (which he totally has earned). Anyway Rust is still a WIP but its a fun one to be part of and one with a bright future.Edit I rereviewed this because they added a button in game that says ""Tell us we're bad at our jobs on Steam"" which sent me straight here xD I love it.",Rust

2014-04-17,0,0,137,True,Not Recommended,"As of this moment I do not recommend you to buy this game. The main reason is because how the developers are treating the development phase of this game. Apparently they sphagetti coded this game and now they are stuck in it trying to rewrite every line. But they are so slow that they are posting updates about such simple things so simple that they should have done it since the start as every large scale program should.But when you ask for serious content and updates fanboys will say ""THIS IS APLHA THEN DONT BUY!!!"". Well my friends Rust has sold more than 1 million copies. I am sure that 20 million dollars are very sweet how about adding more members to the team? 19 million dollars not enough for you? Apparently not.It is even funny that Garry is asking players to create and add objects to the game so that they they don't have to bother with that. And then Garry cries about the fact that item designs in the game seem like out of different people's hands. That is what is gonna happen if you use icons from google searches. Maybe spare a few thousands dollars and hire another designer? You must really need that 20 million $ man.About the gameplay. Get ready to see tons of hackers on official servers ruining your game. Fanboys will say ""Go play on moderated servers!!!!!"" These guys cannot even manage their official servers with moderators. The game needs more optimising to run smoother and more options to build yet the last few months didn't change much.

2017-07-02,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,"Rust was one of the worst experiences I have had with a videogame ever. And I'll tell you why.First off the game isnt even that bad but the slow pace beginning for new people makes it extremely difficult to build a base and defend against people who have been playing longer than you.The shoot and loot aspect of the game also isnt bad but the ""meet new friends"" bla bla bla is completely false since the game is so tedious to get loot be prepared to be killed on site oh and thats not it be prepared to be insulted and blatantly sweared at to whoever downs you since you at that time cant do anything but to wait for that person to kill you.If you usually play solo you wont get very far at all you'll have a bow and maybe some mid to high tier loot but the big clans will definitely have high tier weapons and armour which makes it completely unfair to new and solo players.Also Rust has been in Early access since 2013! If you dont know what that means its pretty much like this A small company has sponsored or paid youtubers too make a video or series on said game it gains traction and persuades people like you to buy the game. which doesnt really seem like a bad idea but since the company is getting money from an unfinished product it's not like they are going to improve their game. its like this imagine getting an A on a school assignment you never finished didnt even do the first page it's not like you would complain or even complete the assignment itss a whole waste of time because you have already gotten your grade!So that is pretty much rust a horrible community an unfair game for solo/duo and people who are new to the game and a greedy money hungry company that feeds off of oblivious people to get their money to buy an unfinished flawed gaming experience one of the worst games I have ever played and wont ever be playing it again.",Rust

2017-07-03,0,0,371,True,Recommended,Rust... This game is simultaneously one of the best games I've ever played and one of the most egregious examples of the villainy I've ever experienced. The community is both hostile and welcoming. The creators both receptive and stubborn. It's friggin fantastic!Rust is a post apocalyptic game where survivors pillage for resources. Occasionally you'll find a friend and roam the landscape together working to rebuild civility to a marred world doing the work of the enlightened. Then two seconds later you'll get rolled over by a clan with a superiority complex. Meanwhile a solo player has been farming for days has managed to twig raid into the clan's main loot room and blow up the whole works. It's chaos and order dancing as one in the fires of a beautiful hell. So if you want to murder nakeds for no reason of a 300+ server this is the game for you. If you want to grind alone on a dead server with no mods to be seen this is the game for you. It is a social experiment gone array Stanford Prison to epic proportions. Glorious and tragic.,Rust
2017-07-02,0,0,169,True,Recommended,I'd define this game as the reason why console players should sell their consoles build a pc and buy rust.Best early access game so far great devs with weekly updates containing awesome new content.So far it is my favorite game on steam. It's truly a game where you write your own story you make both friends and enemies as you go along. I met one of my greater friends on rust. Let me explain I was raiding with another friend she got stuck in room and had to log off. So while we were off the owner of the base decided to build her in as a prisoner. So he stripped her naked and made a prison cell. So I decided to go get some explosives I crafted a ton of beancan grenades for a simple solution. I blew myself into a ladder hatch and jumped down ( As stupid as I was ). Surprise surprise I had gotten stuck as well... There were about three doors left from rescuing my friend so I made an attempt to get through with my remaining beancan grenades. I did not succeed. And of course I had brought my most precious gear and an ak. So I was in no mood of killing myself. The dude that owned the base was kind of a mascot for our time on the server. His name was something along the lines of SharkSlayer or something. So we called him Sharkie Boy and we had secretly been stealing from him. ( I stood outside talking to him while the other one ran into his base and stole some loot as he always left his doors wide open when he went out ). Haha reminds me he even gave me loot after we had stolen from him... Poor guy I truly felt bad but it was hilarous of how lost he was. He had no clue. So he had trapped my friend and I was stuck three rooms away with a hole in the ceiling. I remember thinking F*ck. I'll never get this damn loot out... But to my surprise I heard footsteps outside his base and I knew it wasn't Sharkie because he had been off for a while ( Checked server list as well ). So I listened heard the person running around the base inspecting the missing stone walls. He called out Uhm hello? I'm kind of new to this game can someone help me out? . I took the chance and answered Hey uh can you come inside? I'm stuck and need help to get out. If you just follow the walls *explained how he had to parkour to get up* then you can come in and help me up. I'll shoot you in the head so you don't need to be trapped too. I'll place you a sleeping bed in my house that you can later spawn in. We can be buddies? Alright? I just need to get my stuff out. And to my surprise this convinced him and be boosted me up. I looked him in the eyes and said Are you ready? I'll pull the trigger and then I will see you in a while buddy . He nodded and I pulled the trigger. My other friend was still stuck inside and she starved to death. So she came back to our base as well. This new dude spawned in my base and I taught him everything he had to know about the game. I moved my base and let him construct the new one. And now we are great friends he has surpassed me in hours and is a great Rust player. And also he introduced me to a clan so I have made new friends there. So Rust is really shines when it comes to the social aspect. Making stories talking to people... Killing people... Stealing from sharks... 10/10 I would buy again,Rust

2017-06-23,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game has great progression and a variety of utility options. There are many design strategies for buildings you can think of or find online. I really enjoyed learning about the mechanics and materials and playing with a massive amount of people that can vary from friendly to kill on sight. Each play session is different because you'll always have different encounters whether it's accidentally stepping on territory owned by a clan running out of supplies and dying by nature or unexpectedly running into a bear.The downside of this game for me was when I finally learned pretty much everything and I realized something there is virtually no way to fully protect your gear and home from other players. There is always a way for people to find a way to either destroy or infiltrate your base. Whether its C4 or even rocket launchers any wall any door can be broken. So you can never really rest assured that your gear is safe. That reason alone makes this game a whole lot harder later. You have to be prepared to lose everything at any point and the only exception to that is if you join a large group/clan.Solo/duo gameplay is fun but only if you don't care about sustainabililty. Server hosts understand that this is a thing so most servers are wiped clean every week or two. Basically this game isn't about long term progression. If that's what you want this isn't for you. Honestly I think this game would be more interesting if it did something like survival of the fittest starting with a set amount of players and if you die you're kicked off the server until the next cycle. That way the game fully embraces its short term playstyle. Instead you're given this false sense of security with elaborate building possibilities and extensive upgrading which is essentially all pointless if someone passes by your house with a few C4 explosives on hand which unfortunately is common.All this being said this game is fun. Is it worth checking out? Yes. Is it a game you can sink endless hours into? Yes. Do I recommend it? ..Yes.Just don't get the wrong idea. You won't live long. You're never safe. Don't get attached to your accomplishments. Cause odds are you'll log back in tomorrow and you'll be either raided or dead.,Rust

The game has a lot to offer and is fun to play.2. The game has emmersive gameplay and you can play it for hours at a time and not get bored.3. There is a decent variety of weapons to choose from.4. Building is simple and easy.5. The game is fairly cheap.Cons 1. Gameplay can get repetitive and boring.2. Content is old and the game hasn't been updated since March 14th. (4 months and 16 days)3. Once you are geared the game become pointless.4. Getting into someones base by glitching in is extremely easy.5. Too many hackers NOT being banned I'm tired of being killed by flying players with M4A1's..That's basically all I can really think of but I really think this game has potential and it's future reboot will have a lot to offer.,Rust

2014-06-19,0,0,250,True,Recommended,"If you ever liked minecraft get this game if you like any type of survival get this game even if you like shooters get this game. It does a great job in keeping your interest by giving many different types of entertainment it switches from its adrenaline pumped high action pvp or its raiding features to its calmer side of the building crafting hunting and gathering. Either way definitely one of my favorite games.After looking thorough some of the negative comments I found a common thread which went a little like this ""you wake up and you die the devs do not listen to you admin's abuse power and there are tons of hackers"" I can tell you after following the development of this game for about seven months its been slow Why? Well because the devs actually care about the game after noticing that the current version of rust (Legacy) was not going to work due to its various bugs/other problems they had to basically start over making a completely new game which is now called the experimental version which is not only tons better than the old rust it also has tons and tons of new awesome features to be explored by the player however it is a bit clunky meaning it's not very playable buuuut it will be in the very near future. Going back to the issues pointed out by various other players KOS is not a game specific problem (surprisingly enough) it's because in any survival game that involves pvp will ALWAYS hold on let me repeat that ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have a section of scum bags that will kill a fresh spawn for lol's/the lucky chance to get some extra resources meaning this is an inevitable thing about these games. This is the same for the hacking problem whether you're playing unturned stomping ground or rust you will come along some utter who have aim bots speed hacks and life hacks this is inevitable in not just a survival game but in any game.Now the admin's i can tell you that i have come across some really bad admin people that will spawn in about 100 crates in their house clamming its ""testing out a plugin"" or will kick a player because he was bothering him. However i have made many awesome interesting and fun as friends who will give you some EPIC life experiences.overall this is the best game on steam currently it made my efforts of turning into a PC Gamer all the more worth it. Yes there are some bad things like you will probably die ALOT you will get raided ALOT and you will regret having trusted that fresh spawn you found on the side of the road you will make alliances that triumph and conquer your friendship will be tested you will build civilizations and watch them fall but its all worth it for that amazing feeling you get once you kill someone in Kevlar once you raided some one base and once you make great and fantastic friends that will get you in a shack surrounded by gunfire.This game is not a game it's a life experience you want a reason to buy the game ITS FUN yes there are hard times yes this game will test you but it will reward you with one of the weirdest funniest and craziest experiences of your whole gaming career.",Rust

It crashed and lagged costantly. but I only wasted a few hours in it so I returned it.The trailers and pictures describing the game are wrong. The whole time you are fighting to even move five feet from where you started. Spawn killers and high level players kill every naked newbie they see. If they had made a single player to go along with the multiplayer i would have kept it. I finally got somewhere once and had a friend along with me some other guy that had spawned near me. We had found an empty shack in the middle of nowhere and this group of highlevel jackasses comes along and takes the two naked guys out(Us) and takes the thirty mins of work in a min. It goes to show you that people will step on you and suck you dry if you are weaker then them or if you are just a decent guy who has a kind enough heart to help someone out.

However you always improve patch by patch and I like that.The game himself is full of nice innovations and fun times are more and more usual I would like that you guys adapt at the maximum as you can the playability for lower performances systems I know that you know some people can't have a good experience because of their FPS I personnaly think it's the issue that's killing your game actually.I used to play with my linux OS and my experience on it was totally empty because the game didn't even lauch so for this game for a big part I changed my OS to get a Win7 one. I want you to improve again and again I have great hope for your softwares,Rust

2016-06-29,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,ok first up. If you are planning to buy the game don't. There are exeptions if you are a real fan of putting in work as much as you can just to lose all your progress in a moth or so and/if you have 20 friends to play with. The raiding and survival are real bait on buying this game but it's been in alpha for 2 years and probably will stay there for a while. So to wrap it up dont buy it before its gone from alpha (especially for 20 bucks) the gameplay is broken you have to do all the chores like making resources and building a house iv'e played 56h in 5 days and its not been very fun i can teel you,Rust

2016-06-30,0,0,661,True,Recommended,This game is absolutley brutal and it will make you lose faith in humanity and give you unholy amounts of pain but that is why I love the game it requires constant attention to be playable and it is nowhere near casual. The community is completley toxic but i love it getting killed will happen a lot when learning how to play the game and learning takes a long long time but it is so rewarding the quicker you can accept that everyone is going to kill you in this game no matter what the better your experience. Playing rust is a drug you feed off the adrenaline rushes it gives you and that is what makes you keep coming back no matter how many times you get knocked down by everyone you just keep playing for the rush you get so dont buy this game if you cant dedicate your life to it because you have to and dont be surprised when you hate the first 50+ hours of this game but if you make it past this point you will absolutley love the game. 10/10 would read more reviews about toxic community again,Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,64,True,Not Recommended,"Waste of money!I got this game on steam quite some time ago now. And it has received little to no updating at all. What is now being refered to as ""Rust Legacy"" ran okay and was fun to play. Minus the HUGE amount of hacking that constantly happened in every server ever. But that version is being phased out and has been for over a year and half now. The ""new"" version is TERRIBLE. The new levels are really bad. And the tiny amounts of navigation you may have been able to manage in the original rust is now completely impossible. Meeting up with a friend in this game is not posssible. Landmarks are useless. And there is STILL hackers. Plus the game runs like crap now too. My laptop used to be able to play Rust at max settings with out issue. Now it cant play it on the lowest settings. Sure I have a desktop that handles the new Rust with out issues but my laptop can play S.T.A.L.K.E.R COP. at near max settings with out lag it should be able to play something as devoid of content as the new Rust. They have been promising updates for about two years now but the game has gone nowhere. They managed to get a lot of copies to sell they got the money then stopped paying attention to the game. I can not in its current form reccomend this game to anyone. They need to learn2code. Thanks for reading.",Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,203,True,Not Recommended,Even though I like this game I'm giving it a thumbs down for the developers. Every time there's an update what people usually expect are new things ADDED to the game and fixes to whatever wasn't working right. However these people end up messing something up something that wasn't broken before the update.I think they're justing working on this game in a very clumsy and non professional way. It has a lot of potential but it's like the developers are 15 year olds or just really reaally lazy and don't bother checking the game when they change things. It's extremely frustrating.,Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,54,True,Recommended,I love the new updates to rust and the game works great for the most part. A little of what I've found to bother me is when my inventory is full and I click to pick something up the game decides to just delete the item from existence instead of just informing me I am full and can't carry the item. Also I would like a way to cancel a crafting job just in case I misclick (which happens a lot). Besides that I've found nothing else that really bothers me about the game now.,Rust

2014-02-17,0,0,136,True,Recommended,First of all ! Rust is still in Alpha ( Early Access ) Status what some People still won t to understand !What Ever. Rust makes a Ton of Fun. It doesn t matter if you play on a PVP or PVE Server. Play with Friends make s that one even more fun ! You start nacked with en Stone an Torch an some Medikits ! You re first Goal is simply to Survive the first Day s by hunting Animals for Food Clothes and an Sleepingbag. Harvest Wood for an Shelter and Campfire ! Grab some Resources for Tools and the first Gun or Bow to hunting. But it s not that easy as you may think. If some Red Animals or Wolves get after you there is a pretty good chance to get ed up ) but once you have some Resources you would be fine. This Game has rly nice Potential to be an great Game if the Community keeps the good work on let the Publisher know their great Ideas for the Future. Some Poeple are expect that Games like this comes out pretty done. But it s not the Case. Games like rust survive s on the Feedback of the Community and be Patient. Updates comes pretty much all 5 7 Days. The Last one s where not so spectacular. More like Bug Cheat Server Client and Gameplay fixes. I don t play it every Day since it comes out. But sometimes it grabs me for 2 3 Hours and i don t realize it ). Still have a lot of Fun and wait for the future Content. So. If you have en long Breath and you like this Kind of Games that 20 Bugs are Worth for it. But you have to think that this Game has still a long Way to go.,Rust

Don't think that anybody is your friend have no remorse and raid the outta people before they raid you don't rely on wooden structures or baracades skilled players will demolish your Sh*t like it is nothing. Don't worry about wooded structures. Find and collect blueprints troughout the map from crates and barrels and build you a furnace fast so you can get better materials. You waste so much time and resources building wooded structures that are easily demolished. seriously I built what I thought was a secure place came back a few minutes later and everything was demolished like a bulldozer came trough. lmao,Rust

2016-07-28,0,0,65,True,Recommended,I got the game after the xp update so I'm not too sure how it was before so I'll say my point of view as a new comer. Rust is a difficult game where at first you'll be dying a lot from tons of other players and animals which kill you almost instantly. Once I did get some momentum with guns and armor I learned to not trust anyone. This game will take up a lot of your time. Hell I just reached level 15 and it took me probably a dozen hours and there's over 30! I would recommend to people who want a large adventure with there friends or to people that have a lot of time on there hands.,Rust

You can do so much from building a base crafting gear and weapons. Only complaint is that as of now it is very difficult to raid other people near impossible if they have a base made of stone Though I do expect this to change in the near future.

I'll never trust another naked man offering me meat again. EDIT 6/10 The game is a slow downword spiral for Garrys awful ideas. You know the company has gone downhill when people literally make fun of you from playing on the Official (Facepunch backed) Servers. Garry constantly puts his slug juice on what used to be the best game ive played. The only reason that it still has players is because the concept itself is unlike any other game. Its a shame that one horrible developer can constantly mess things up.EDIT They are now adding some RPG Elements to the game. This means some players will have increased health from getting experience. I really wish i was joking... This is what the next 6 months of developtment will focus on. Notice how its not the actual fighting..EDIT 7/25/2016 They literally made it so you have to run around and farm for 20+ hours before you can craft ammo to use stuff. I don't know if its a joke at this point.,Rust
2015-06-29,0,0,427,True,Recommended,This is Rust Where headshots make a sweet little crunch No base is safe from a couple anti noob engineers. And if you hear a beeping sound you're about to be evicted. Rust is an open world survival shooting building crafting and raiding game that is updated weekly and made by Facepunch.Before I get you little tribal savages assembled for a war party and send you to your guarenteed deaths. I want you to ask yourself one question. How angry have you been at a video game? If the answer is pretty then multiply that number by 5 carry the 10 and you're still no where near the rage Rust induces. Something about losing your home farm and life activates a special part of the lizard brain that most games can't touch.Spawning Immediatly spawning on the coast like a ship wreaked sailor with a rock and a torch the map you are most likely on is a precedually generated map unique from every server similar to minecraft. Although the map is unique there are preloaded points of intrest i.e ( The dome Radiation Towns Water Treatment Plant and soon the Rocket Factory) They are all connected by roads. The map itslef has biomes too. Early game Rust is the most brutal becuase you are the most vurnrable to players animals and the enviroment since you are un armed and homeless. For the majority of your early game (Day 1 4) you WILL be out gunned. You have the best chance of survival scavenging scraps of bases you find. Once you build a base this will be your head quarters you will hoard materials for your big stable base. You will struggle to find food and clothing but being in the right biome will help you tremendously. Dont head for the snow withot clothes becasue you will freeze.Raiding Now with your epic base and tons of recourses what do you do? You Raid other people of course. SInce raiding is considered an offensive approuch to Rust be sure to have the materials to supply explosives and gear neccisary for raiding. Solo Raiding in Rust is very difficult it is recommended that you bring some friends along. The defender has built their base to go against raiders the have sniper towers that never see action until your poor soul happens to come to raid. They have hours upon hours of work and you will take that away within minutes. If you're raiding solo raid the defender while they are offline this will put the odds more in your favor. This is the safest raid to do solo. Most players think of raiding as an investment hoping to get more resources out then you put in. Online raiding can be one of the most envirgorating experiences the game as to offer. When you get your friends togther to raid a base while the owners try to kill you when you have c4 and all your guns on you is an experience like no other game has to offer. Some of the most epic moments in Rust is when the Raid you are conducting is being talked about throught the whole server nakeds come to watch or take scraps looters run towards the comotion everyoone holds their breath to see which side will win.Rust will be a challenging but rewarding experience enjoy your adult Minecraft,Rust

2017-06-30,0,0,1063,True,Recommended,Watch alot of youtube videos about this game and thought that I had just as much enjoyment watching the game as playing it. Never planned on buying it until I got it on Impulse one day. This is the perfect game imo. Life as it should be. There is no law there are no codes there is no loyalty. From the moment you spawn there is never a moment where you are not at risk of something. For the first 8 10 hours i played I was completely lost and achieved absolutely nothing during this time. But once you get the swing of things the game just gets better and better. End game being fighting a helicopter for the best loot in game. Not much for the casual gammer but there are plenty of servers that will make it playable even if you are just by yourself and dont have alot of time to play games. Everyone says the community is bad and sometimes they are right and you'll come across a group of neanderthals who have just learned how to stand up straight. But as stated before if you want to do something(other than cheating) you can do whatever you want to whoever you want. No greater feeling than completely destroying a toxic groups base and taking their loot from hours of work from the past week. Most servers reset weekly so you have to start from scratch every week which could be a negative. But there are servers that do every 2 weeks or every month. Top 5 game of all time.Alot of negative review are about the twig and ladder build in building blocked. There are plenty of servers who have mods to disable this feature.,Rust

And big groups who just can't even die because they get into fights of 5 versus 2.If you don't fit into that category Rust can still be fun but you should probably play it solo because the community is .It might also be a good idea to just wait some time until the game is better.,Rust

2014-03-03,0,0,808,True,Not Recommended,"Update Would not recommend.This game has a very strong foundation and potential to being possibly one of the best games but It's really not worth the time and money.CommunityI'll be honest apart from all of the toxic communities I've seen this one takes the cake. On any server prepare for sexual harassment religious hate homophobic suggestions/slurs obscured sexist remarks and mental abuse.Also if you join an Official server prepare for abusive Staff members spawning stuff for themselves/friends and banning people for ""hacking"" ""glitching"" etc and half of it isn't justified.The forums are just pure The forum Staff members will ban people for any reason and most of it isn't justified at all. Garry and his minion Staff members have abused people on the forums for asking or suggesting anything that may be ""stupid"" which is unprofessional overall. I can keep going but I think the hint has been taken.GameplayRust used to have meaning when it was in Legacy. But now it's becoming more of an FPS fest. A lot of the changes they've made are so game breaking it's not even funny. Legacy was balanced really. You didn't have to worry about the sky raining a hell storm of rockets.Example Rocket launchers various ammo types turrets.Procedural maps are awesome I must admit. Though they're not mastered by all means. Some of the generated maps are buggy and just poorly generated. Rust is also very grindy. If you don't have a group of people to play with then prepare to get raided the second you throw up a base. That is unless you play on a low population server or on a friends server.",Rust

2016-01-02,0,0,2469,True,Recommended,What is Rust?Rust is a game of hardship trust community and heartbreak. Over the course of a year the game has changed from being completely about killing everyone who came near to working towards creating communities that band together to wage battle and besiege the enemy. Each time I shut down Rust I am constantly thinking about rushing right back to the game just for a few more hours. It all started with legacy Rust just a month or two from it's early access release. That was a subpar game by my standards the community was volatile on almost every server and no one was willing to help new players. It was plagued by easy to obtain raid gear and overpowered endgame weapons. I put in roughly 60 hours despite this (just to demonstrate the addictiveness). When it got old due to the previously explained shortcomings I left the game for half a year casually reading the update blog and becoming hyped at the amount of work they put in and propose to put in. The amount of time I put in after the forced updates is ridiculous 60+ hours in two weeks. Cramming in play time whenever possible sometimes all night just to finish building an unraidable base. *Sigh*Of course without any people to compete against this game would be no fun as it would turn into a base building game...which it is not. The PvP aspect of this game is still a bit tricky as you sometimes try to be humane while some people will work with you only to be holding a thompson to your head when you finish a good run. It is situations such as this that make the game fun i.e. the risk of losing everything on your person with the potential to have a nemesis to raid in the near future. Teaming up against enemies to raid is fun to say the least and that hint of danger is always lurking nearby keeping you on edge. In points Pros +Longevity+Progression is well paced (as there is no true progression system)+Community+Learning curve+Combat+Raiding+Building system+Constant danger+FunCons Community (depending on the server you can always ask assuming players are online on the server) No tutorial yet Quick progression to guns Raiding (Tool Cabinets can be frustrating) Time sink Mining wood Some optimization issues,Rust

2016-08-12,0,0,786,True,Recommended,First don't listen to all the angry recent reviews. People are salty because of the XP system or because a youtuber has dev powers. Not going to go in depth on that if you want to find more about that go to reddit. Pro's Beautiful game Great mechanics Intense pvp A one of a kind game Base building that allows you to be very creative Active devs that update the game weekly Devs communicate with the communityCons The one thing that bothers many players are zerg clans. Zerg clans are basically clans with very high amounts of players that dominate the server. Thats why a lot of older players stop playing Rust used to be mainly about playing solo. There are a quite a few bugs. To play Rust on max settings with good fps you need a very good pc.I would advise anyone to not play on official servers theres little to no competetive edge and they are filled with people speaking their own language which in my opinion does not leave you with a good experience. Instead I would advise you to play on Rustopia for a vanilla server and for modded servers EU Best Rustoria or Blueberry. There are plenty other good options though!,Rust
2014-05-15,0,0,5188,True,Recommended,it a good game but clan simulator and when you get some good loot its like that feeling you get when you are the last one alive in csgo.,Rust
2015-12-31,0,0,926,True,Recommended,So let me start off by saying that this game is extremely punishing therefore I wouldn't play this game if you are a salty person as you lose all of your stuff like dayz however you can respawn in a bed if you have put one down but you'll be lucky if it's not been destroyed by a 12 year old troll. This game is based around player interaction so you are bound to find another player within the first minute of playing if you are on a high pop server. I find this aspect of the game fun as you can have some pretty funny role play. Base building is fun but only lasts around a day as your Base will almost definitely get raided by that point unless highly upgraded. Finally the combat is not bad however you do not have a cross hair and you kind of need to guess where the arrow will hit. Gun play is decent however at the start you can only make basic weapons and will need to get blueprints for more complex weapons such as the ak 47 youre more likely to loot these guns off dead bodies.,Rust
2016-03-08,0,0,277,True,Recommended,This game is still in development constantly updating and coming with new features such as custom skins for guns items and other miscellaneous items. It is a survival game in which can be played with friends or solo. Has a wide variety of servers to choose from (Official Community Modded or create your own server). Early in development meaning the game has space to fix any existing problems ranging from graphics glitches to the user interface. In game mic chat with others without having to use an external program. XP system soon to come as an in game update. XP can be earned by farming recources to unlock certain blueprints in addition to individual skills.Video further on explaining this system https //www.youtube.com/watch?v J_Cv0pyf_4sAs of 8/12/16 With the xp system integrated into the game the game got more interesting and time based.However the cons are that this ruins the realism in Rust.,Rust

2014-11-20,0,0,22,True,Recommended,Sometimes a guy just needs to let loose and engage in a naked fight with another man using only a rock. It brings us back to our most primal instincts and without reason we continue to exist in the wild world. I definitely prefer the Legacy version over the experimental version having put many hours into each one. The experimental version is more of a building game. It's slower you don't see people as much but the building and crafting is a bit better in some ways. The Legacy version feels more like a game. It's more fun. You run into people...people raid others...you'll see many naked people sprinting around and sometimes they'll run away and avoid you. Others will sprint head on at you and try to take you on. Get a weapon. You're going to need it.,Rust

2014-05-12,0,0,691,True,Recommended,Rust is basically like the Doomsayer from Hearthstone literally just Doomed us all. Basically you are a rock. You your rock and your rock friends will die many times because your rocks are not good enough. People wil find guns and you will die multiple times. However once you are done dying and you accept the fact that running around naked on a .nudity True server with your rock and your naked brethern then you will understand that this game is Life.

2014-11-07,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game in any way shape or form. This game is nothing more than a GANKFEST. You enter the game naked with just a rock and from that second on you are hunted by members of the player community. There are large populations of players who kill anything and everyone on site. In the 3 hours I played RUST I was unable to accomplish anything because before I could aquired anything I could use to craft better gear or equipment another player would come from behind and kill me. Until the player community improves they create non PvP servers or they create safe areas for new players this game will never appeal to a broader audience.,Rust
2014-11-07,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Shows some immense ambitions and has devs constantly updating it just be ready for dissapointment if they trash a build you enjoy and decide to work from scratch or if the game isn't significantly playable sometimes. Regardless there's always something new EVERY week in rust whether it's a bug fix to an issue you had or additions for models and weapons. Considering they rebuilt the majority of rust (and then some) with less than a year from scratch it puts other early access devs to shame. Highly recommended if you're interested in the investment. But it currently lacks any real incentive to buy if you're interested in an actual game.,Rust
2017-05-09,0,0,202,True,Recommended,This game really doesn't feel fun sometimes.It's hard.It's got a wide open map and so many items that the meta is shifting constantly if you can even say that the amount of stuff to do in Rust has a meta at all.I'd say depending upon whom you play with it's harder than Dark Souls QWOP and a lot of other games that are considered challenging. Rust is a fun experience in that it's exciting the loot feels good to get and the people can be really interesting. At the same time Rust is not fun because of players that take themselves too seriously are critical of new players and because the game doesn't hold your hand almost to a fault. There's a lot of learning you have to do the hard way by making mistakes but I think that if people were a little less hostile the game would feel a little too easy. Overall Rust is a game that makes you look deep into your soul and often what you see you may not like.,Rust

So its always starting at the beach with a rock.

2017-04-30,0,0,1104,True,Not Recommended,Developers have lost their way for a while now.Players can make a AK47 but can't ride a horse or make a bike!It is not a survival game it is a PVP game. Survival has very little to do with it its a KOS steal all you can game developed around/for clans.So if thats your thing you'll love it! But if you looking for a survival game look elsewhere.Players Unknown have taken the space that RUST seems to be aiming for but have fallen well short of now they sit in limbo slowly loosing players to games like ARK or Players Unknown.Been in Early Access for years now with no REAL progress on the survival aspect. Not knowing what direction they want to go in seems to be their biggest issue. Blue Prints....then Levelling....then components.....now monuments that have no purpose and an AI Bradley to patrol. ??? Survival ???Hope the developers can figure out what it is they are trying to create from my seat it does'nt look like they do.,Rust

2014-05-18,0,0,63,True,Recommended,This games is awesome. It combines the cool survival feel with some action. However there are some thingsa that need to be fixed for it to be perfect. This is not so much playing but optimization I have a Directx11 GPU and yet im still getting about 30 fps and it isnt continous. I have tried all of those grass.on flase optimizations and it does not make a big difference. The GUI needs to be improved because it is very hard to navigate around servers etc. The server files should be public so that we can host servers. Or at least make a feature where we can play with friends.Overall the game is brilliant and i would recommend it to anyone. Keep up the good work garry and Facepunch,Rust

Graphics are beautiful some may disagree but I think they are perfect especially for a MMO. This game brings all the main survial characteristics to life. Crafting hunting scavaging killing death loss time know how brains wide variety of animals and players as well as resources. Put all these things together and we have pure survival at its finest.

Everytime you first start you're going to go and find resources and once you atleast have a stone hatchet or something you're sure to be shot in the head or something by a random player or get beat to death by some player starting out. You're going to have an awful time starting out if it's your first time playing the things I recommend you do as soon as you first start is go to an empty server and figure out how to play the game by looking up guides. Once you get the game and everything go to a server that's decently populated I say ""decently"" because from what I've learned the resources are limited and rare and a lot of players always go for those resources.Also you're going to rage a lot.

Its for people who really like grinding out long hours at a time and can deal with constant struggles ranging from wild the elements such as cold or hot to other players trying grief/raid you. Dont get discourge on your first few tries to build or set up any type to base. Imo it takes bout 25 50 hours just to get it down to a decent design and get used to the game play.

Build a massive base over the course of a week by yourself or erect it over night with some friends or get killed while building in the open and lose 3 24 hours of farming. Build the prettiest house of your dreams or make a giant square made entirely of annoying doors. Get killed by a wolf while farming then get killed by that same wolf trying to get your stuff back. Find a mysterious guitar man with his manhood slapping his thighs as his metronome. Get killed by an 8 yearold whos older brother let him use his account and is roaming with an AK then get insulted by said child. Create a lasting bond with a tall dark chocolate as you both bear out the cold together. Pin yourself in a corner of a base and scream at a clan for an hour because they cant find you.

2015-10-17,0,0,361,True,Recommended,Rust is a multiplayer survival game that i have played since its first version know as legacy. BE WARNED. The requirements even when met are more solely for the purpose of getting more people to buy it so dont count on the requirements steam wants. This game requires a pretty beefy computer i have a very powerful pc (specs below) and i run it at maxed out settings 60 fps average but not everyone has my build. But if you can play it the scenery is beautiful much improved over old rust. Although much of the gameplay has changed new guns and and overall new playing style. Anyone who can play this game i recommend it very much especially since its not so exspensive compared to many other not as fun games.PC SPECS intel core i7 6700k512 gb Samsung 850 evo Pro SSD1tb WD BLACK HDDGIGABYTE G1 GAMING 7 Z170 MOTHERBOARDEVGA SC (Super clocked) ACX 2.0 GTX 980 TIFRACTAL DESIGN DEFINE R5 CASEH100i GTX LIQUID CPU COOLERHope this helped D,Rust
2017-05-03,0,0,298,True,Recommended,I used to be REALLY bad into this game. I played it almost nonstop for 2 months on my first server which was vanilla and a nice pop for duo. That was in the early rust days during the xp system. Now that everything is craftable from square 1 the game is ruined for solo/duo. If you dont have a clan of well over 4 5 men all cycling in shifts watching base your loot is gone. Even with the servers that have raid prot for a week before allowing raiding it just gives the clans more time to scout and have enough resources to wipe a 5 story honeycombed armored wall base or 2. All in all the game itself is very enjoyable. The AI corrections have made pve a lot more fluid and realistic and the consistent updates are another thing i like. (keep it up facepunch!). The gunplay is a little odd at first and takes some getting used to but as you adjust your gameplay will obviously become more consistent. Another thing about this game is that the community is TOXIC. So toxic in fact that it is the reason why i quit playing the game. I'd bet my bottom dollar that over 75% of the community will kos bambis/nakeds. All said and done its a recommend IF you have a big group of friends or a clan that is looking for a fun open world survival pvp.,Rust

2016-07-11,0,0,747,True,Recommended,I've really only played vanilla versions of both legacy and the new version but there is so much that has been added to this game. I find myself playing Rust again when I suck at CSGO and have tons of fun building up and raiding my neighbors. The game won't be much fun to someone who isn't willing to work towards the exciting parts of the game because it could take a lot of time alone collecting and hunting to compete with groups on servers.,Rust
2016-07-11,0,0,101,True,Recommended,I bought this game when it was in legacy mode the moment in time where he game looked like it was made in the early 2000s. But now the game looks absolutely amazing and I really enjoy playing it. Pros good graphics (to some extent) challenging but fun survival aspects interesting areas called monuments to explore and gather lootBefore I talk about cons I need to explain the game community in this way instead of a single sentence. You HAVE NO CHANCE of surviving in high player lobbies on your own you may try but you will eventually be killed by a group of people. Your best chance is to team up with friends you can trust this really makes surviving a lot more fun and easy. Most of the community except for a handful of players are toxic and will most likely kill you on sight. You will be lucky if you find a person who will not attack you like me )Cons sometimes annoying AI death (self explanitory) the problem of not finding food almost instantly after you spawn the good old occasional player restart for no god damn reason.In my opinion playing on community servers where there are only like 2 or 3 other people playing is a good start where you can learn the aspects of the game before stepping into the big facepunch official servers. I highly reccomend this game.,Rust

2014-01-27,0,0,18,True,Recommended,This game is pretty fun although it can be a bit frustrating at times due to other players being blood thristy savages. In concept it is pretty similar to Minecraft you have to gather wood stone cloth you name it. You craft tools and resources with whatever you can find.So you start off at a seemingly random location on an island naked dazed and confused you hold your only material possession close to your chest. This item being a rock. Using this rock you will bash trees stones animals and even the skulls of your fellow survivors to rise to the top of the foodchain in the small vacinity of the wasteland you spawned in. Next some asshat with an M4 will come along and blow your brains out.So you start off at a seemingly random location on the island only to find everything you worked for has now vanished and up for grabs to the next fresh spawn to take for the keeping (until said asshat comes along and kills him too). Now you at least grasp the feeling for the game a bit better. You pick a direction and begin walking through the wasteland once again and oh hey what's that another player? After several blows of blunt trauma to your body dealt by a rock you spawn once again.Rinse and repeat until you finally are able to build a stable base hopefully out of sight from other players who will come and beat down your door with rocks in the middle of the night smother your campfire and murder you in cold blood to get their hold on the chicken breast you managed to get from the deer you chased for 15 minutes.All together it's a fun game. Very frustrating but fun for the survival aspect. I would imagine it would be more fun if you were playing with friends for the sake of safety in numbers. The game however is in alpha. So do keep that in mind if you decide to purchase this game.,Rust

2014-01-27,0,0,74,True,Recommended,"The game is early access so not much can be said in terms of complete experience as it is not final product. I really do enjoy this game it brings a unique experience to hunting/gathering and social interaction. I do believe this game would benefit from some form of law system. I know that that is a vague statement but having groups of people randomly killing you with guns while all you have is a rock to defend yourself is quite annoying to say the least. I can recall spending hours building with a small group of people only to be raided and completly wiped out by a larger group just for resources. I understand that is part of what makes the game interesting and fun but to be left with absolutly nothing after building for hours and hours peacfully is annoying to say the least. Some progression post death would be well receieved and possible repercussions for the people who kill indiscrimantly would balance this game. I think having a cops/robbers atmosphere would be beneficial. Knowing if someone is a ""criminal"" would help you make better decsions on who to interact with and who to avoid. It would also add greatly to the dynamic of raiders and lawman and help people form groups whose core intent are similar. People with raider status should be able to be killed without repercussions and lawmen who are kills by raiders would also have the same outcome. Neutral players who are killed would negativly effect the killer for either faction. I think those changes would make this game a much better experience.",Rust

2015-12-30,0,0,152,True,Recommended,Nothing is as good as waking up on a beach and watching some naked men chasing each other with a custom painted rock......ah what a time to be alive Putting the header aside this game is pretty good if you want some survival element added to a FPS shooter and some weekly updates which basically ruins all the work you do in a particular server (weekly wipes along with the major updates). They basically remove eveything and reset the servers. Still then this game is pretty fun to live the life of a caveman as if you went in the past but took some modern stuff with you which ended up getting scattered all over the map and you gotta basically steal and scavenge them. Simply putting it here goes a table Awkward Nudity Check Caveman Rock Check Toxic Players Check Makeshift Weapons Check Weapons Check Helicopters Check(no.you.can't.ride.em) C4s Check Turrets Check Vehicles Check Caves(ofcoursecaves) Check Supernatural Animals Check DayZinTrueFPS Double Check AND das it 3 well still i love this game. It has got that addictive thing to it but sadly without any friends.....this game is pure garbage (technically).

2015-12-30,0,0,25,True,Recommended,"While my this specific account would say otherwise I've been playing this game for almost 2 years now on and off. Heres how I've felt about it Rust started off as a real basic survival game with zombies and stiff &amp ugly animations. I understood that it was a super early access at this point and I still had fun for what it was. Every time I keep checking back after several months away the game looks even more beautiful and complex than the last time I played it. Its cheap and you'll probably have a lot of fun once you start to strive off the land. You also get to look at a game thats attempted to be a different from other survival games. They aren't quite there yet but more and more its getting there. The only knock though is that once you start to really make it in the game it sort of gets boring and loses its replay value. You're fully stocked on materials got all the weapons have a dope house tons of food &amp water. Its cool to get to this point but once you're there the game loses its fun after awhile. Even after server wipes or getting your house blown up into while you're offline you're basically just set to start the process all over again which is where I stop playing for awhile. It's a lot of grinding to get to that point (which they've said they want to fix). I'm curious to see how they step away from this problem of basically getting super rich in the game and just running out of to do afterwards.TL DR I enjoy myself everytime I fire up this game again. It's also fun to see where this game goes during its development. It's just once after 2 years I keep running into the problem getting super ""rich"" and not having anything to do afterwards.",Rust

2015-09-25,0,0,212,True,Recommended,RustSo far the most enjoyable PvP Survival situations have cropped up for me in this game. Worked on by Garry's team (Of Facepunch Studios (Garry's Mod)) and they got Goose (Counter Strike) on the payroll it is turning out to be a ing crazy ride from rough alpha release being super popular but they ran into a checkmate scenario with how servers handle player structures as well as many other issues and had to rebuild the game from the ground up using Unity Engine. So far they are the top Unity game as far as scope and engine fix requests so Unity is parading them around as a poster child even though they still never released their full scope and I have no ing idea when the full game is going into launch as they just keep adding/changing If you got friends then give it a shot and you will have some crazy happen to you but if you are a solo player then skip this as you will just get shot on sight anyways. Survival games are not about making friends its about doing with the friends you already got.,Rust

2014-12-06,0,0,64,True,Recommended,"Rust has some great controls and some really pretty graphics but otherwise it's utter poop. There's not really a goal. In lieu of that you spend your time fighting for your life with nothing more than a rock and getting beaten to death by other naked cavemen with rocks before you have the chance to even figure out what the game is about really. When you find anything you'll likely be killed for it. Also when you exit the game your character stays in the game world falls asleep and is then vulnerable to being beaten by rocks wielded by naked cavemen once again. Even if you are but a mere naked caveman with a rock everyone with a gun and clothing insists that you have something that they want somehow and they senselessly murder you. When you respawn and manage to make it out of the mosh pit of naked caveman again you will only be shot again if the derpy bloody bears and wolves don't get you first.In all seriousness Rust has some really great potential but it has fallen into the same bad habits as every other purely multiplayer survival games have like Day Z for example... but Rust is probably even more aimless than that really. There's no goal other than to pillage and murder and you can't really explore anything else in the game even on your own because there's no option to make your own server even if you just want to play with your friends. There's just... there's no point here. I'm sorry that I bought it and I'm sorry for anyone else that bought it too. Oh well. Just another one to add to the trash bin.EDITED 9/22/2015 Despite my scathing review written previously I've since played Rust a lot more in hopes that it had changed for the better I'm delighted to say that it has since that first review. While any sort of ""goals"" that one might have in Rust are still a little vague new mechanics are giving players a bit more room to explore the crafting and blueprint/research systems (where the game really shines in my opinion) to develop their arsenal of survival ensuring gadgets. At the moment survival is beyond easy on PvE gamemodes and... well hit or miss still (as it certainly will always be) on PvP modes. If you're able to fill your hunger and thirst meters you won't have to worry about eating or drinking a thing for several weeks thereafter if even then. While this is still a tad unbelievable they are adding new life to the world to give players a bit more to watch out for as well as something of a common enemy to keep us PvE advocates entertained and on our toes. The attack chopper has been the greatest addition to that end giving players a chance to team up against the most akin thing to a boss battle that Rust has yet seen.As someone who isn't too keen on PvP (as one could probably guess given the first review above) I'm pleased to say that Rust has done a bit of work to ensure that someone of my playstyle can still find their place in the game without being senselessly beaten with rocks time and time again. With time here's hoping that the devs add even more challenge for us PvE aficionados. The most impressive thing with Rust so far though however has been it's ability to make me not hate it anymore since I first played. Much like Dark Souls I believe that Rust is a bit of an acquired taste. Turning that thumbs down to a thumbs up now Certainly didn't see this coming.",Rust

2014-08-30,0,0,58,True,Recommended,one of the best games ever made ! EDITRust's only goal is to survive and its always challenging.You begin with nothing but a rock a torch and a couple of bandages right in the middle of the jungle alone with no protection from the wild predators nearby whatsoever and from there own you have to plan on your way of survival by collecting the essential of living such as wood to make shelter ore to make tools leather from animals to make clothing and finally food to eat and survive upon. First I will talk about this game's will made graphics.In this game you'll have a chance to look at the most outstanding graphics such as the realistic trees mountains lakes and occeans.you'll also encounter all kinds of scary wild life you won't be able to compare them to real life animals because they both have exactly the same texture. Second I'll talk about to whom this game is actually suitable.This game is very well suitable for large groups of friends since it requires a lot of communication and cooperation to help in collecting all the valuable resources and defending it at the same time. Last but not least the changes that I would suggest to the developers to enhance the game performance would be the following I would like to add an option to respawn near to my dead body so my hard earned plunderings could be recovered.Adding new power sources such as the ability to process electricity through tools to generate power instead of using charcoal.Adding the ability to breed and train animals for example training a guard dog to watch over your house and belongings while your gone or away. In conclusion I really enjoyed every aspect of this game and laughed about its in game logic because of many reasons however the main reason was my first three days (in game of course) in Rust during my first day I've encountred a naked guy with a rock next thing is the guy hit me chase me and eventually beaten to death. I' ve spent my second day building a base just to have it raided by midnight. Finally my third day was spent on hunting (my favorite part) during my third day I saw a deer and decided to hunt her down however it took around 10 minutes just to catch up to it and eventually killing it and to my surprise I've found chicken breast instead of deer meat!.,Rust

2013-12-21,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"The concept of the game is really great. Survival defence in an interactive world. Gather resouerces make stuff etc. That's a hell of a great concept. The only problem is that the so called ""community"" consist entirely of antosocial adolescents. There is aboluely no community whatsoever. Play game spend hours gathering resources have it all wiped out in 5 minutes. That's pretty much what to expect. So no. Good concept poorly executed...and played by mostly s.

2015-09-10,0,0,206,True,Recommended,I do recommend this game but I just wanted to give my own recent experience.While playing on a low population server I made the wise choice of starting a shop seeing as I was better off than others who were playing on the same server. In my five days on the server i saw some dramatic changes the server as a whole became friendly and began helping one another out they didnt raid each other they hunted gathered and scavenged together. Eventually my shop became too small for the amount or merchandise I had and the amount of customers I got so I had to build a new shop others on the server decided to follow me on my move to a new shop and decided to build a town around it they even nominated me as mayor.My shop was mainly an experiment into human nature to see if when given the opportunity people band together and create a functioning society the answer was yes even in a video game people will band together but it wasn't all sunshine and lollipops on the server we had some people go rogue on the society. They would break into peoples houses while they were away steal their things and maybe their home some would go so far as to frame others for their deeds. Eventually I left because of the degradation my society was facing my dream had become a nightmare all in the space of five days and all because a handfull of people.My time on that server was rather dramatic in its entirity but through the bad times there were many people who made the game worth playing. Thank you for your time.,Rust

2014-12-26,0,0,152,True,Recommended,Changed my review was negitive but rust is getting better and better the hackers need to be stopped but after that its a good game.,Rust
2015-09-10,0,0,499,True,Recommended,First off many reviews of this game are negative. Why? Because people expect that everyone they meet online will be friendly. Well I'm here to tell you all that that doesn't even happen in the real world. Why should it here? This is a survival game pure and simple. What do people do in survival situations? Some will help each other but a large percentage will just screw others over. That is an unfortunate fact of life. Raiding occurs when it occurs. The raiding party doesn't care whether you're online or off. If there are resources in your base/home/whatever they will want to take them.Secondly the game is buggy/glitchy/etc. Things don't function properly as of yet. Animals running through walls and rocks is one of the big things that comes to mind. There are other issues too. HOWEVER THIS GAME IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. Even beta releases can be bad in their own right at times. Just remember ALPHA comes before BETA. It should be expected that there are a crap ton of issues. Get over it. It says early access for a reason and tells you that before you click the Add to Cart button in Steam.Think of it this way For what it is it works (and pretty damned good too). Also if someone kills you your buddies raids and destroys your base etc. Just sneak up on them sometime when they least expect it. Payback's a ! PAnother thing of note is that the maps for each server can be very different from one another (randomly generated maps). Definitely something that keeps the game from becoming stale.,Rust
2013-12-22,0,0,621,True,Recommended,For a game thats still in Alpha i think its awesome! Got to hunt animals for food or you starve fall off a cliff or get biten by a wolf you bleed and need to use a bandage.Want to make a shelter? go gather some wood and start building.Guns? go mine some Ore smelt it in the furnace and turn it into metal dont forget to make some bullets.Huge map to run about and get lost in for the first while in game.Also there is a decent day and night cycle When its night its pitch black.Can work with or against other players build Huge forts or attack others that have been built.Only problem i have with it is that everyone just kills on sight Even if you are a fresh spawn with just your basic rock and a torch.,Rust
2013-12-22,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Coming from DayZ I expected quite a bit. Givien it is in early alpha the game is still WAY overpriced. Getting started is extremely hard. Hunger goes down fast and zombies and animals do a REDICULOUS amount of damage. I couldn't find any hatchets and scrap so I could'nt get food. When you get the M4 carbine the game gets VERY easy. If you like a HARD game it may be a good buy but if you want a more relaxed zombie survival/building game look elsewhere.TLDR Game is extremely hard to play in the beggining too easy when you get guns/food. If you have time/a big group or like a chalenge it may be worth it.,Rust

2017-07-05,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Loving Rust so far. It's not an easy game to play especially if you're not used to survival games. Expect to die A LOT! I didn't even make it 3 minutes the very first time I played it. Today I survived 3 hours. The music the scenery/biomes and the game play make it a very intense experience. Forest deserts mountains are all there to be explored and at times it feels like you're the only person on the server until you unexpectedly come across another survivor scavenging resources like stone wood and metals just like you are. Decisions need to be made make 'em fast because that other dude's just made up his mind to kill you! Resources are often difficult to find large animals will kill you you can't remember where you stashed those parcels no one is to betrusted most people you meet will most likely kill you night comes quicker than you realised and now it's too late ... It's like minecraft for grownups. I love it. Keep it up Devs.,Rust

2017-07-05,0,0,30,True,Recommended,This substance is formed when the element Fe (iron) oxidizes. A substance called dihydrogen monoxide (also known as hydrogen monoxide) can be used as a catalyst in this reaction. It speeds up the process by a significant amount and is actually present in most scenarios. The verb rusting is also used to describe the corrosion of iron alloys. Oxidation in such materials can be prevented or slowed by using a passivation layer. For example stainless steel has a layer of chromium oxide which is less affected by oxygen.This game is also pretty fun.

2017-03-15,0,0,392,True,Recommended,It's fine. The game in vanilla is hard and only for the tough the community may be toxic may be salty but who cares. In a hard game the community will be hard too. There a quite a few modded servers which is nice. But the only reason why this game isn't dead is because of the updates. New updates every month keep this game rolling. But after playing 300+ hours you notice that it gets reallllly stale and boring. All you do is build a base make some guns get some bombs go raiding the server wipes repeat. That's why when i play this game i feel like i am using sand paper instead of toilet paper to wipe my Then again if it kept me entertained for 300+ hours it's worth a thumbs up.P.S.

I've been playing since browser Over 3000 hours across two accounts this game was the game that made me buy my own steam account and it brings me endless fun. Wether in a large group or in a small group I can find fun either way something about the feeling of being on the edge of losing everything you have worked hard for but pulling yourself together and winning the fight in the end. Wether farming or killing there's always something to look forward to wether it's raiding that pesky clan that's been on you since wipe day or its filling up that large box full of guns from that pesky clan. Always looking forward to that wipe day is a great feeling.,Rust

Through the griefing and grumbling they pulled Rust out of the mud and cleaned it up. When it first came out it left a lot to be desired. Sure deer still drop chicken meat but thats just a part of the reality now. The crafting is more varied and it's more fun to build. The PVP community is no longer the toxic waste dump it used to be which is nice. Combat is no longer horribly broken although bears and wolves are still the silent lightning fast nightmares as they've always been.

2017-07-06,0,0,993,True,Recommended,Overall this is a very fun game as long as you can behave like an adult. I say this because you truly have to just suck it up and roll with the punches in this game the learning curve is brutal and 99.9% of the time other players will just kill you on sight rather than help a noob. However once you learn the ropes and get a good handle on where how and what you must do early on to be successful and moreover get over the concept that you will likely lose all that stuff you worked so hard for it becomes rather addictive and entertaining to say the least. Developers keep the community updated and more importantly update the game regularly so you'll know your money was well spent! However my chief complaint is that between Steam and Rust you have a very limited window to purchase skins for the gear in the game. Seriously why the hell can you not purchase anything and everything that has ever been created from the store thus far? It's completely ridiculous.,Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,228,True,Recommended,For a game in Alpha I would say Rust is more polished than some AAA games at retail. I already love this game and the potential should be amazing I cannot wait until this picks up like Minecraft and to see the amazing mod community once it gets started. If anyone played Minecraft Wurm Online DayZ or Xsyon and just wished for a fresh take on it this is it.,Rust
2014-01-31,0,0,101,True,Recommended,Rust is a really fun game where you have to survive.To survive you need to have 1. A way to get food2. Weapons3. Lots of materials4. A place to stayI find Rust a lot of fun and ive seen no bugs so far which is good for a early access game.I reccomened this game but I would only get it if you meet the required specs because if you have lag its really difficult to kill animals to get food there is loads of lag reducing tips on youtube you could try to play the game with no lag thats what I did and I can now enjoy the game properly10/10 the BEST survival game out there ive played.,Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,37,True,Recommended,I would like to recommend this to everyone but there's one huge strike against this game. I know it's in alpha so I'll keep gameplay and graphic gripes to a minimum. Over all I've had fun with this game even though I've played so little. It's the Minecraft clone I've been looking for the building construction is fun and you can get some awesome looking buildings going the gathering is very straight forward and the crafting takes some getting used to.Now this is where the gripes begin to come into play. The graphics aren't all they could be and again Alpha so I'll let that one slide. The community isn't the most welcoming running into bandits very often killing me because I have a rock. And the biggest gripe I have and this is a big one if you're new to the game like me. There's no dedicated server resets so if you join a dedicated server you'll be hit with small wooden shacks taking up every inch of land so it's hard to navigate and find resource drops.All in all an okay game it can be fun once you get yourself situated but if you're very new it can be a little overwhelming.,Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,This game runs like absolute From a gameplay aspect this game seems amazing. However even for a game in its alpha stage this game's engine runes like complete I have a core i7 16gb ram and nvidia geforce GTX 675 and I still can barely manage to get like 10 fps? What kind of horse is that??? Im not running anything significant in the background I scan weekly for viruses I have the latest drivers. Yet somehow this game doesnt run? Graphics dont matter in a game. But being able to ing play it does. And im not the only one having an issue most of my friends with the game have an issue as well. And I dont think it has anything to do with having AMD or Nvidia cuz we all have nvidia. The only one that actually has no issue running the game has a titan so that should be expected. This really needs some optimization and I would apreciate my money back since I cant even play it. I have resinstalled and done everything at this point.,Rust

2016-08-08,0,0,512,True,Recommended,I've played many survival type games. Everything from the free and open style of DayZ to extravagant style of Ark but Rust is in a class all in itself. Rust is simply put Griefer heaven. A based is owned by the adjacent tool cabinet meaning that if you gain access to the tool cabinet you can capture the base. And one must always remember that nothing is unraidable if you've got enough explosives. Join rounds early after a wipe and level efficiently and you can own the server. Alpha tribe was a term I often heard in Ark in Rust the term is replaced with the s . The social aspect is low as everyone think you are baiting when trying to talk in global chat and people will either run or kill on sight. Be warned There is no PvE and anyone playing Casual will get rekt. Great game for when you've got lots of free time! I prefer servers with weekly wipes for more of the early stages gameplay ) I almost quit early because of the slow gameplay and lack of moderators on official servers but the sollution was easy Private servers all the way!

2014-12-12,0,0,152,True,Not Recommended,"I bought this game because I belived in its potential. I disregarded many bad reviews talking about the frustrations with bugs or the community as a whole. Its EARLY ACCESS and as such I expected bugs. The ""bad community"" is actually what I like about the game. You go into it and TRUST NO ONE. The one big reason I am not recommending it at this point is the apparent lack of effort or ADD the developers are taking here. It is true that the (often delayed)updates often fail to address problems or create new ones. Often we here about ""Ideas or Big Plans"" for the future when simple small problems are untouched. And when I read about other games in development by these same people it just goes to show that they have no true desire to make this game any better but simply drag people on and suck away money. Only buy this game if you enjoy frustration in your life.SHAME ON YOU GERRY",Rust

2016-03-16,0,0,1487,True,Not Recommended,"Switching my positive review to a negative review due to recent changes.Node/Compent gathering is now a super tedious shore and absolutely impossible on high pop servers.There isn't enough basic resources for a fresh spawn to even get a stone tool together let alone a base.According to the head develper this will make the game ""less grindy"".In reality it made it more grindy by forcing players with out any gear or means to get any gear to fight over very low spawning tone nodes.Basically hearing Helkus speak you can tell he has no ing clue what he's doing and this game tilts always in favor of his buddies who run big servers and are admins with huge groups. Only their feedback matters this even according to Helkus himself.Who will flame the community in the Devblogs telling them to shut up and accept the changes.Basically Rust is only popular because it's the only PVP/Online Survival game that isn't total dog If any other dev out here and reading it. There's a huge market for Base building/FPS game at least I know I'm looking for one.Rust just sucks it's too grindy it's too difficult to get set up on a high pop server. Low pop servers are a ing BORE. No interaction/No PvP.Modding is ridiculas and tends to break the game so much.Basically Rust keeps getting worse with every ill concieved idea and patch FP puts out. They lie and maniuplate the community to keep their player numbers up with out intention of fixing long running bugs or do anything about the cheating. They continue to make changes that make the game super unfriendly to those new causal or small/solo groups. Do not buy.",Rust

Experience treason in all of it s possible forms or just get eaten by a bear because why not. Take time to build a huge base and find precious resources so someone else can blow it up to pieces in minutes and just steal everything. Have no friends to play with ? No problem !

2016-08-04,0,0,1964,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game. You start with a rock and a torch. Where you came from what you did before is unknown but now you stand on a beach on an island. You obviously weren't an engineer in your past life. you have little knowledge of how to build much more than a fireplace. Your goal? Is it to hunt down other similiarly stranded people and take everything they have? No. is it to run to the nearest civilization because there are blueprints in trashcans that will teach you how to build rocket launchers? no. Your first priority is food and shelter. Cause you know this is a survival game. Off in the distance you see a bear but it hasnt seen you. Probably a good idea to avoid it. Ah. some mushrooms on the ground. Not a steak dinner but it is calories and energy. Because you know...this is a survival game. 30 minutes later You chipped away at a free trees with your rock. You knocked off some stone shards from a rocky outcropping. After some trial and error ( levelling to level 3) you manage to craft a makeshift stone axe and pickaxe. Gathering is much easier now. You have also slaughtered a pig. As night falls following your first day on this remote island you do not have an automatic rifle. you do not have a towering stone structure to hide in. You do not have a dozen c4. Neither does any of the other people you've come across. No. you have a 2x2 log cabin. A bow that after some practice you've become proficient with you have a campfire and some bacon. All in all not bad for a few hours of work. Knock knock knock. someone is at the door to your log cabin. You are at a crossroads. Do you greet the stranger? He is after all your fellow human trapped in the same situation as you. What if he lacks the basic survival skills you have? What if he is still chasing chickens with a rock and about to starve? Or.. is he out there with a buddy one with a bow and one with a salvaged sword he found in an old gun crate? Risk/reward. Realizing you have little to gain by greeting the stranger and everything to lose. You decide to ignore the knock.After some time day 2 dawns. Goals for today? A makeshift furnace smelting down some of those metal fragments you found and securing that wooden door by replacing it with (an armored door? nope.. you've been on this island for 24 hours) a sheet metal door. No one is going to burn THAT down. Rust is a game that is survival at its core. Whereas in the past the game was entirely focused on pvp it has shifted into a true survival game and I think that's fantastic.,Rust
2016-08-04,0,0,1315,True,Recommended,9/10 this game is incredible.Rust is one of the most enjoyable and dynamic survival games available right now and it shows as soon as you enter the game. Going from a naked spawn with a rock to an armored badass with an AK takes time patience a lot of effort and a lot of skill. Keeping your stuff after you've acquired it is an even further challenge. All of this makes rust a fast paced adrenaline fueled race to the top of the item chain with much much more to do in between. Just watch out for the bears.,Rust

2016-08-04,0,0,379,True,Recommended,Rust is the most fun and addictive survival FPS I've ever played it could definitely use some more content and optimization but it's core mechanics are incredibly well made and thought out though some things still need polish for sure like the brand new XP system which is still being worked on almost weekly with updates.I think adding the linear XP system is a huge improvement from the old BP system where anyone who happens to be lucky can be at endgame within a few hours but now everyone has to play for days to get close to it even on modded servers. One thing I'd like to see is some kind of catchup mechanic so that new players on a server that hasn't wiped for weeks aren't constantly behind everyone else and get killed/raided every day with almost no way to defend themselves but I know FP are working on this problem.Anyhow between BP and XP systems I've racked up hundreds of hours in a few months and that's more fun gameplay than I've gotten from most full priced games I've played.Solid 8/10 just needs more content/PVE options and a bit less grinding on XP.,Rust

2017-02-26,0,0,691,True,Recommended,"Rust is like the bastard child of Darksouls and Minecraft. Its an open word survival crafting game in early access. Which for some is an instant turn off understandably. Well I was naive and got interested and started following it. Needless to say all in I have sunk close to 1300 hours in this game with 600 being on this account. My PC couldn t handle it not to long ago so I had to play on my friends when I hung out with him. I played pretty evenly legacy(an old and now dead form of this game) and ""new rust"" as we know it now. The reason this game is difficult isn t the AI or the environment its the player base. Its a game that rewards being harsh as much as it does being kind in fact I would say more so. Being kind is a good way to get and early death or two. It has it's charm though. I love being kind when able. Its something relatively rare as most people have had it beaten into them with various things from rocks to hatchets Kill on Sight. Overall I do recommend this game if you can stand some toxicity from its player base and the salt to follow death. The devs push out updates almost every week on Thursdays and fix any bugs discovered asap if game breaking. It s one of the few games to hold my interest for so long. I have burned myself out on it several times. I always end up coming back ready for more.Just a tip I recommend a low pop community server to start. Preferably with someone to teach you if able or a friend to learn together. Otherwise jump into a high pop and learn trial by fire style... Good luck!",Rust

I bought this game when it came out in 2013 but didnt play much until early this year. It Changes all the time for good and more recently for the worst with the xp system which almost caused me to quit all together. I recently moved to modded rust which is all i can stand anymore but I still love the aspect of this game. I play 120 ish hours a week and I love the pvp and building aspect. I will give it an upvote but I want the blueprint system back. How much longer until its out of early access? Like common is 3 years not long enough?,Rust

2016-09-19,0,0,86,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game very much still in Alpha but from my perspective worth all the money.

2016-09-09,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Just going to keep it shortish and list the pros and cons of this game.ProsThe game play is good really enjoyed the base building and resource gathering. The mechanic for constructing a house or base it easy to use and very satisfying.Night time isn t as long as the day. It s a good thought as early on you re stumped in the dark so not waiting that long for sunrise keeps the game moving. You don t loose levels when you die. Unlike other games when you re dead you re dead Rust lets you keep all the items you ve unlocked. You just have to build them again and if you find your body (so long as that bear that killed you has wandered off) you can pick up your old items. Make sure you build a sleeping bag and place it in your house counts as a spawn point.ConsI understand why but not being able to edit parts of your house you ve placed is a real pain. Put a window in the wrong place? Reconsider a new addition to the pad? You re going to have to spend a lot of time and break a lot of tools to pull that wall down for your extension. Locking yourself out the house we ve all done it but normally a neighbour has a spare key not so much in Rust... Early on you rely on keys to your front door it stops other players stealing your items but if you loose that key (if you die for example) you re going to have to make a lot of axes to break your front door down. Later on you unlock a number keypad instead which solves this issue or if you insist on keys make a spare and hide it in a stash box in a place hidden but one you ll remember.Waking up. When loading into a server you get a little message press any key to wake up . This is as about responsive as a dead dog and it can take minutes of keyboard bashing to wake your guy up.Unable to pick who you are. The game assigns you a character based on your steam ID. It s not much of an issue as the game is 1st person so you don t see yourself that often. However not having any choice in what you look like is defiantly not a selling point of this game. Building decay. Again I know why but I think they need to lenghten the time it takes for buildings to decay. It's meant to free up servers but if you dont play every single day your building will start falling apart. I believe stone structures last 18 hours before they start loosing HP wood less than that and metal slightly longer. If you were to leave it a week between playing you would have lost everything even without taking the hostile players into account. Dont build anything worth keeping i guess unless you're playing every day. It's worth noting opening doors stops decay and resets the buildings timer. Maybe place an unlocked door outside so other players might acciedentally reset your timer while your not playing. The community is awful! The first few nights playing this game was peaceful. I played on a noob server and ended up building quite an impressive house/castle. However on the fifth night some players joined who just wanted to troll people. All evening was spent walking out the front door to be shot. House was burnt down and stuff stolen. They didn t let up either constantly harassing you even when all you had was empty pockets desperately trying to rebuild. Overall this game would be a fantastic single player but if you don t like call of duty kids rent a server with friends.Because of this I couldn't recommend it even when the game it's self is great. Other players are really the custodians of fun for this game and they don t allow it often enough.EDIT After playing on a frienldy server who kicks trolls it has become a game i would recommend despite the above. Moral of the story play with friends.,Rust

2016-11-01,0,0,76,True,Recommended,A pretty decent game first game I've picked up on PC in a long time. WARNING! random people arent all that friendly however in saying that it does depend on what server you join and how populated it is. First thing gather resources and build a half decent base away from other buildings. But expect it to be broken into the next time you come online its an MMO this stuff happens! Can be a laugh and interesting but if you want to keep your base and solo everyting worth looking at the 'Lone Wolf' type servers. Happy Gaming!,Rust

2014-02-03,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,Right now during the alfa the game is missing alot of components which could make this game great. The game has potential but right now the game ends after max 30hours played sure you can raid others houses/towns all night long but in the end it gets boring. I'm looking forward to see some improvments and updates in the game and I would probably start play it some more. I do not recommend the game during the alfa stage as it is really really basic right now if you feel like contributing to the development by buying the game go ahead but if you want some nice game experince I would wait for it to go live or atleast beta.,Rust
2014-02-03,0,0,58,True,Recommended,Very frustrating to start with if you are playing with people as you have to find them. A bit slow to when you are gathering resources. But once you've found your mates and have a half decent place to live the whole game opens up and is very entertaining.

I like purchasing and downloading the new skins to stand out in RUST.When it comes to gameplay if your new don't rage quit. I promise there are cool/good people on RUST. Not everyone you run into is a raging tool who KOS's on sight. Most are but not everyone is. I presonally prefer the modded servers as I don't have a huge amount of time to invest into vanilla servers with 20 wood per hit. lol that's just painfully slow.All together though I love this game and am currently addicted.

2015-07-17,0,0,214,True,Not Recommended,Don't buy it. It's an early access hacker bait game made and updated by Garry Newman and he s everything up. The only reason this game isn't a complete trainwreck is there are others alongside Garry working on the game. Only reason I play it from time to time is it has it's moments of fun and I'm determined to get my money's worth out of it. I bought it when it first came out when early access was a new thing. Anyone who knows me knows I am against early access as a whole and that is largely due to Rust and Garry Newman. I'm stuck with the game now and there's nothing I can do about that other than warn people that it's not a great investment and to spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. In short. Tons of hackers early access for ALMOST 2 YEARS and has Garry Newman at the helm. RUN AWAY!,Rust

Even the people you help are just as likely to kill you without a moments notice when they get desperate or they simply get what they desire.The fear you get from hiding out in your little shack in the middle of the night hearing footsteps which could as much be a boar or deer as a person is immense and makes you genuinly concerned for your characters life...even if all you posess in the world is your naked self and a rock!A game which to me really makes surviving a challenge and no matter how much you die (which unless you are a hermit is a lot!) and after you have moaned the loss of the first gun you found in the game you always get straight back into playing8/10 atm due to its early alpha stage.

2016-11-10,0,0,4069,True,Recommended,1 MILLION TIMES YES PLAY THIS GAME.I have been playing and following tis game for years. Something about a world of endless possibilities and interactions to do anything. The developers listen and love the community. Good suggestions posted on reddit are added to the game. Facepunch really cares about the game.Gameplay this game features starting naked on a beach and slowly or quickly (depending on luck and skill) gearing up to AK47s and Bolt action rifles. Build any base that is interesting to you. Be aware however that people will try to steal all of your hard earned loot by craftyness (boosting or sneaking in) or muscle (c4 and rockets). I have over 2 000 hours played (not a single hour idled) and I look foward every week to playing with my friends. Be advised this game is best played with a group of friends. You will die a lot at the beginning and lose everything but as soon as you get lucky and clutch a fight or 1v2 1v4 etc you will be hooked like I still am.,Rust

2016-11-10,0,0,892,True,Not Recommended,The component system is ABSOLUTELY it s awful you guys ripped the XP system from the game for reasons that it allowed clans and large groups to dismantle small groups or solo players guns are absolutely uncraftable for the common player or people who can t spend hours upon hours on the game Rad towns are dominated and owned by HUGE clans and with the addition of semi pistol and semi rifle bodies smaller players can not even make guns in order to attempt to defend them selves from these tyrannical huge clans. Further more the blueprint system and the XP system were fairer and more equal to players and you guys have really ed up with this component system it s impossible for small groups or solo players to even build bases with armoured doors that can defend from a raid because gears are rarer then a virgin birth Guns are almost nearly impossible to be made by anyone as a small group and solo players literally have bows because you can t get a crossbow because no gears so you re just left with a bow against a group of 20 with AKs M249 s and bolt action rifles because they dominate and build near all the rad towns please fix this or revert to an older system or the player base will significantly reduce.,Rust

2016-11-10,0,0,862,True,Recommended,Amazing Game! If you u do not know Rust is a survival game in which you can craft pvp gather recources and much more. I loved the building and meeting new people and deciding whether or not to trust them. I also loved being in a big clan with me and my friends and sharing recources together. This is a great game and i would reccomend it. One more thing though is that this games frame rate can be really bad at times if you dont have a god computer ( I put all the settings on low and it helps a lot ).,Rust

Now poor performance on lowest settings on a medium end PC (literally unplayable on a laptop with entry level dedicated GPU).Also PvP only no real PvE at the moment.

2016-11-11,0,0,187,True,Recommended,ITs a great survival game but there are certain mechanics that trolls exploit. For example you cannot remove built items in your base even if your the one that put them there you have to destroy them which can take up to a few hours. trolls can get into your base and build things that stop you from using your base as normal. a simple demolish button or remove wall or whatevr would be simple enough to combat this. as of yet there is no way to rearrange your base if you make a mistake without having to break it all down by hand.,Rust

2016-10-19,0,0,3434,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game. It is difficult to survive and this is as it should be. Not many games can kick you in the guts like Rust. For example on wipe day you can start out with nothing survive numerous encounters with other nakeds hell bent on killing you and taking your torch/rock spend hours creeping around hunting gathering and crafting until you finally get that precious starter base down and then just as you put that door lock on and start to craft some big boy weapons...the raiders come knocking blow down your door loot your corpse and burn your bed. Back to square one in 5 minutes. The trick is to build smart plan ahead team up if you can and prepare for the worst because it is probably just around the corner. Perhaps you could clan up and try your hand at zerging across the countyside! You will win plenty of fights by virtue of pure numbers until you encounter players with actual skill. Or hide your base in the snowiest corner of the map stack those walls and hope nobody finds you. The real survival in this game is surviving against or with other players.,Rust

It's EA so they update it many times a month but I think it shows the handwork of makers. If you have friends who like to survive in the best Minecraft's texture pack you will ever find hell yea buy the game and spend few years to it like I did... Or then you just enjoy about the small enjoyable things of life! go out see some old or new friends and seek the hidden path of keeping yourself in a good physical education... But if you really would like to spend ya youth years to this game sure go ahead. It has some really sick graphics and the way that you just go roam and kill everyone... awesome!

2014-01-02,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,I have a mac book pro. So lets start there. The game is still in its alpha stages like most of the reviews have stated. So you cant expect the full package right from the beginning.These are the issues i have faced.The game is not mac compatiable. At first i could not get onto any of the servers. I followed the instructions they gave to run the game on its lowest spec. This still did not run properly. I had to connect to the same server several times before i could get in. Once in the game had not rendered anything. I couldnt see trees or any of the map.To try fix this i loaded VM ware to create a virtual machine on my mac loaded with windows 7. Once i had completed this i managed to load the game had loading went a lot smoother. I managed to get into a server of my choice though it was very slow. There was a lot of lag and was very annoying to play.The gameplay I must say i was very impressed with the idea behing the game. It is like a glorified version of minecraft. Though it does simulate the state of survival very well. People have complained about the crafting methods but they forget that the game is challenging as is and there is a lot happening. The fact that the crafting is kept simple allows for you to focus more on the goals you are trying to achieve.I enjoyed playing it as fustrating as it was with the lag the possibilities of growth are endless. Though a lot of people on the survers are there to troll and kill you as you spawn. I must laugh at this because it makes the game challenging. Gives you a sense of survival.My overall look at this is that if you are running a windows machice you will have a smoother time with the game. This game is the start of something great. Once the game is complete it will be a game that will take the market by storm. But for now there is still a lot to work out.,Rust

But my main request is that there be a SOLO OFFLINE MODE. If they had that it would be amazing. I don't like having to play with other people (who always want to kill me) and having to rely on their server's strength.,Rust

2017-01-24,0,0,29,True,Recommended,This game can be fun. But if you get mad easily never plays this. EVER. Also I wish people were nicer in the game but everyone seems to be an but that's not exactly the games fault. In the time I've played the game I've had my ups and downs if I could give Rust a neutral rating I would but stream doesn't have that. Also this is basically only fun with friends unless you're really good at it.,Rust

2014-02-06,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,Rust has a good concept and okay delivery. The worst thing that makes this game unplayable in my eyes is day one. Before you give me a bunch of flak hear me out. Gathering actual building resources is easy! stone wood and ore thats easy. It is the lack of wildlife that you ccan actually fight against on day one that concerns me. With me big rock i can kill pigs easy chickens as well. When it comes to deer you have to glitch them against the wall and dont even think about trying to fight a bear or wolf day one. Day one is extremely frustrating and it makes it hard to get invested in the game when your guy starts with half food life(which drains rapidly) and no rations. Overall this problem could be fixed GIVE ME SOME STARTING RATIONS! Let me get a feel for this game before you let my guy starve day one. Put some more animals that 150 people can actually find and hunt.,Rust

2017-01-26,0,0,62,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This is my review for the Game Rust. I love the game. The graphics are pretty good and the Sound is epic. Its a survival/build/pvp game wich i am a huge fan of. The different elements are connected very good and that makes the game fun to play. The game is at points scary too. When its night and your in a base hearing footsteps outside is terrifying. The only downside of this game is the constant wipes and that there is no single player. for the rest its awesesome. I got this game as a Christmas gift from a friend and i can Recommend this game very highly.,Rust
2017-01-26,0,0,171,True,Not Recommended,i have never tried offical servers but why slave? modded servers wipe every month or two.

2017-01-22,0,0,2457,True,Recommended,I have 2400 hours of rust.The good Regular updates Not many game crashes Can be fun in the early phasesThe bad Performance is Still in alpha state (3+ years now) Updates often break things. Regularly. Basicly every week. Not really a survival game (no focus on clothing food. Its more a grind to AK rifle who grinds the most/fastest) Bad community you will not get much help and frustrate if you start solo Basicly only playable in clans/teams. New game mechanics enforced this even more (HQM cost) Performance is already bad and now the developers added new skins. They will probably make the performance even worse. Do the developers cash out Rust and move on to another game? We will see ....Recent updates made raiding harder and force you to get a Quarry for HQM. Very hard for solo players.Why do I play it? Because my friends play it ) But we slowly stop. It was fun 1 year ago. Now its getting something between frustrating (updates that break stuff / bad performance) and boring (raiding and roaming changed).,Rust

2014-02-07,0,0,15,True,Recommended,While the gameplay is absolutely addicting and a lot of fun (almost 5 hours vanished the first time I played)There is one mechanic I cannot stand.Your house degrades in time so you have to maintain it. I had plans that would have me gone for a couple of days so I repaired all my walls everything was perfectI come back TWO ING DAYS LATER and my house decayed and I lost everything (I play on a small server with no C4 so it wasn't raided)I ing love this game but I don't want to be FORCED to play it all the time.I still highly recommend this game but be warned if you take a break you will start from scratch all over again.,Rust
2014-02-07,0,0,42,True,Recommended,bunch of naked dudes running around bashing eachother with rocks if you can gear up and get out of that stage its pretty fun 7/10,Rust
2014-02-07,0,0,150,True,Recommended,Execellent game even for alpha stage. The potential is astounding. It will only become more refined and polished over time as Garry's Mod did.For those who complain about being killed as soon as you join a server the game is about survival. If you join a server get as far away from any radiated towns or roads you possibly can until you learn how kill craft and eventually build basic weapons so you can get in on the DM action as well. If that's your thing. OR find a server that has politics for PvP and PvE. Plenty of servers with people who do not just want to run amok killilng everyone.Like I said there is so much you can do. The potential is astounding.,Rust

2014-02-07,0,0,95,True,Recommended,Great start to it! I liked zombies better than the red animals but i can appreciate that it's about doing something different. I think we need more gameplay as it seems all there is to do for now is build a house and then raid others. A lot of people complain about everyone killing on sight rather than helping out other people but really once you have your home there's no real advantage to having another person around and killing other people seems to be the best challenge.A couple suggestions i have are possibly making the map bigger and then adding some form of faster travel such as cars or boats. Also i notice all these rocky foothills and mountains and cant help but think putting a cave or something like that would be cool even if theres nothing inside. Another thing would be make the terrain generally harder to travel rivers canyons cliffs things that could require people to build bridges and ladders and such maybe even work with other people to success.I look forward to seeing this become great.,Rust

2016-09-28,0,0,890,True,Not Recommended,On first experience I was suprised by this game. I truly am not a first person shooter...not fast of reaction and just too kind to open fire most the time. In most games this gets me to walk away right away. But then...building. Gathering. Coming up with constant improved defensive designs...it gave me something to do while the world played shootyface around me.I truly wanted to love this game. I truly did. I entered right as the new xp system came out. All I ever heard were complaints of it taking too long to grind. To me...I loved it. No one was barred from getting anything...with time and patience any player could get everything eventually. This gave an odd sense of community to the game...the guy who perhaps wasn't a crack shot but loved the grind and build process became a valuable commodity to the community. They could trade for supplies in exchange for the guns they managed to get to early. Heck I had a huge high external stone wall trade program in exchange for fuel for my extractors every time I played.It added a wonderful element that will not be repeated once XP is yet again removed. The concept of making it harder due to heavier radiation and random parts...I get it. PVP will once more be king trade will exist only amongst those who cannot find the right parts. But no longer will the casual stand a chance. They say starting everyone on the south will make it 'less likely' for griefing...I say it's going to be logging in to Normandy most people will build close to where they start to get an early safehaven which is going to turn the starting beach in to a garrisoned gun bearing mess.If you're like me and were hoping to find a pvp enabled alternative to a grind and build game...look elsewhere or rather keep reading the patch notes. Maybe they'll change again in another 2 months. They have immense potential but they need to finally put their collective feet down and choose a path for their game. You'll lose some people yes but you'll lose even more if you change your game to the core every 2 months.,Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,1270,True,Recommended,This game was fun initially however they took the zombies away the servers are generally wiped every seven days or so so you lose everything you build up the weapons controls are very jenky and primitive making the game borderline unplayable the severs are filled with trolls. OUtside of helping me kill time in the dead of winter and the few cool friends i made this is an an utter waste of time so far considering there are alot of hackers too. I reccomend wating for the game to develop more getting a real hobby or just outright passing period.Also its not controller supported and takes a very long time to learn to play......In the end the ends cant possibly ever justify the means....... 2/2016 Flash forward...After three years of sticking with this game and it being the most played game in my inventory i feel as though I may have been a little harsh on the game....There have been soo many new developments all the way around im very impressed. This doesnt even remotely resemble early rust. The developers really hit a home run so far with this one nice work! I still wish the zombies were here and there are still trolls but so goes the life of the internet gamer. Anyway i appologize this game SLAYS!

2016-02-10,0,0,417,True,Recommended,A more adult friendly yet incomplete Minecraft.Has lots of potential but PVE aspects (ex NPCs) decorations and other tweaks need to be made to make the worlds it creates more alive. I would like to see a settlement system akin to the rudimentary one in Fallout 4 albeit expanded upon. The game also needs tweaks to prevent toxic griefing behavior and promote more cooperation instead.Still a ways to go since it's in Alpha but it has the potential to be a great game upon release.,Rust
2015-07-21,0,0,234,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is amazing... if you find a good server that is. I recommend starting out on one of the smaller servers in the game like one with 10 20 people in it. If you don't do this you will be instantly slaughtered right as you spawn in the world. This game is extremly unforgiving and your loot will get stolen all of the time. Solo play in the game is basically impossible you need a group to do anything useful in the bigger servers. Don't get attached to any of your bases/loot either most servers wipe every 1 2 weeks. But if you do everything I've told you you'll have a great time in rust! Raids are amazing to take part in and even blueprint hunting can be fun if you do it with friends. It is totally worth the $20 just because of the amazing experiences you will have while playing!I r8 8/8 m8 don't h8 just get the game!,Rust

2017-02-12,0,0,44,True,Recommended,its fun. If you actually care about surviving and doing well then play in a group. If you dont care if you get raided be by your self. Or play battle royal,Rust
2017-02-14,0,0,70,True,Recommended,Played 14+ hours a day on this game for about a weekI've never been more repulsed by myself before...Totally worth it. Whether it's forcing our enemies to strip down and eat raw human flesh or yelling at each other to go and collect resources to build our house Rust was a fantastic game to enjoy with friends.Jokes aside you may not have to spend 14 hours a day on the game but it's definitely something you have to keep coming back to. If you and a couple mates are on a school break it's the perfect game to enjoy. If you've got a busy schedule however you probably won't see much use in playing it. Don't get me wrong it's not a chore to play but if you expect to still be alive next time you log in... You best log in often.Ultimately one of the best games I've ever played could use a little more optimization and by no means is it finished nut if you're looking for a great survival game?

2015-10-01,0,0,237,True,Recommended,A visceral primal experience that is the fear of other players permeates this game. Leaving your base to gather is often fruitless due to resources not respawning fast enough and is especially noticable on high pop servers. If you manage to make it out there for a few hours farming and have an inventory full of loot the journey back to your base and the fear of being run up on by another player is intense. This player behavior is encouraged by the fact that the resources are somewhat scarce and it is actually more lucrative to just kill someone and take their stuff it is somewhat balanced because even as a fully geared player with an AK 47 and body armor you can be taken out by a Naked Born Player with a simple bow and a couple well placed headshots. Once you get over the fact that the ruthless player behavior is actually part of the game it opens up and becomes more fun. And you begin to treat the other players as nameless faceless NPC's just shoot anyone that is not part of your group on sight. Before they do it to you. The game is best played with a small group or even a duo solo can be harsh and unforgiving but also very satisfying if you get a kill and manage to get some guns or gear. This is my second foray into this genre the first one being Ark Survival Evolved I liked Ark but i find myself coming back to Rust more there is a wipe that happens every major update bi weekly which always keeps things fresh and the action flowing. On Ark the big clans farm and tame all day and theres not much pvp because getting raided is brutal on Ark since it could take weeks to recover unlike Rust.Rust is a great game its gameplay style brings out a particular type of player that you may or may not want to deal with. There are no female models in game and everyone starts out as a naked man. There is a somewhat juvenile tone to the playerbase and many clan bases have signs with crudely drawn genitalia and obsceneties. It is a boys club but there are more and more girls playing if you choose your server carefully. I like this game. YOU SHOULD BUY IT!,Rust
2015-10-01,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,If u like getting R.S.I then take up knitting or something similar as this game is a waste of time take two hours to get enough resources to craft an item and somebody slaughters you and then you start from scratch again. I also was slaughtered by a bear as i lit my campfire it had potential but with no single player mode planned and people running around with rifles and you got a rock to defend yourself you will just be doing the same boring grind over and over. Single player mode with a save function and i might be interested otherwise ill carry on knitting a scarf or jumper.,Rust
2015-10-01,0,0,30,True,Recommended,It's a fun experience when you're on a server that wipes itself on a set schedule. Crazy game lots of stupid can happen. I once met a man who was completely naked travelling with nothing but his guitar. I danced with him for a bit but I was overwhelmed by my hunger so I beat him to death with a rock and ate him. Once I satiated my hunger I proceeded to carry on his legacy travelling the land playing the guitar butt naked. I ran to some guy's base and he captured me and made me his guitar wielding sex slave. Pretty good experience overall. Kinda like real life.,Rust

2015-10-02,0,0,2043,True,Recommended,Takes some getting used to but overall a fun game. Dont expect anything you own or build to last forever because clans will raid anything no matter the cost.

2014-02-10,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,"I do love survival game but this one is not ready yet.Ok this one is Alfa version. Would I try the final version? Maybe why not? I hope for changes. The devs need to fix some lag issues (desync) and make better UI. They need to fix some cooking bugs and create more environmental hazard. Make a better craft system and more ""life"" in the game I mean there're no fishing no trapping no disease no planting no farming no swimming... The game is more PVP focused than a survival sandbox. The players animations is very poor and the confront is not fair against newbee. If you're unlucky you gonna die a lot unless you wanna play in the official non pvp server. The sound is good music not too much. Graphis are fair and the commands are known with the WASD control jump space bar etc. However I felt some punishment for runing to much (fatigue ea). Rust has potential to be one of the best survival games for PC... not this way. I hope Facepunch walks the right way making a real survival game rich of crafting challenging and less PVP focused. For now Rust doesnt have my recommendation.",Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,189,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is fantastic ignoring the multiplayer aspect. Currently you have to pay another game host company to set up your own server there is no pve and alot of hackers flood the servers. You can ban a player and have them come right back on. Steam will not do anything about the hackers and neither will your game host company. There is no way to make your server private. Wherever you go even when the discription says friendly you will find s that will shoot you when your just starting out. They will even go as far as breaking into your small wooden home. Admins become friends with others and give them special help that give them an unfair advantage. The advertisement about being permanently banned for cheating is false you will not be banned for cheating and can do whatever you want. As it stands in terms of alpha development the game engine environment content and game play in terms of hunting cooking building are fantastic. Just dont expect to learn how to play the game without some jerk off giving you a bad time. And if you create your own server on some hosting provider you cannot ban hackers you will be ddos'ed and people will not listen to your rules. Don't waste your money yet wait for final release.,Rust

2017-02-03,0,0,15,True,Recommended,It's enjoyable but I only recommend it if you plan on playing with friends as it becomes repetitive. Other players will almost always kill you or raid you even if you have just spawned so you will need to quickly build defenses and constantly maintain them if you plan on actually progressing.,Rust

2017-05-12,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Where do I start... well I've been murdered about twenty times now three of those times were by wolves. Regardless! This game is absolutely astounding in my opinion. It runs fairly well on my system with very little drops in framerate which is nothing short of a miracle in my case.Rust is basically exactly what I've been looking for as far as mechanics go (crafting multiplayer survival etc) so I have nothing bad to say about it besides one... not so little thing. The general community is not so great as you will consistently get killed as soon as you spawn on the beach. My reccomendation would be to avoid the larger population servers and stick to the small community servers.I'll have to update this when I put some time in but so far I'd give it a 9/10.,Rust

They answered me incredibly unkindly so now I'm even thinking of refunding the game. My prio one for these kinds of games with this multiplayer interaction is that the community should be kind enough to atleast meet other people with respect. I do not care about the gameplay where you get killed on sight like in Dayz and other similar games. I'm used to those kinds of ""players"". But I'm speaking of ""people"" here I can't believe why people can be so mean for no reason. Yes I know it's the ""internet"" but I have never met people like this in a game.Even if this seems like I'm going fully emotional on this it's not my point to make it looks like it!

Get lucky and ambitious and build a nice base 7. Get raided by an inappropriately named clan while your offline 8. Get friends9. Become a group of 12 year olds and raid some guys small base while he is offline with axes and spears 10. Use the resources to build a mega base11. Change your clan tag to something offensive 12. Raid some lonely sucker who got lucky and built a base13. Bask in 4 hours of glory14. Get raided by a kid named kinywinkie (or by someone with a name like that)15. Cry16. Research rust tactics and become hardcore at it17. Ignore real life not that weren't already18. Spawn in19. Get killed by an 8 year old with an M249 while he calls you gay20.

2016-02-17,0,0,39,True,Recommended,You may look at Rust and think its just a basic survival multiplayer game. For the most part you would be right. But boy you are missing out if you haven't played Rust.I am going to section this out to try make things easier.IN DEPTH REVIEWMECHANICSRUST being made in Unity definately feels like a Unity made game. Graphics are great controlls are easy and familiar gravity is perfect etc.GAMEPLAYAlthough there is no storyline you definately make your own story as you play. Playing RUST alone is no easy task and I get bet you any money you will not enjoy soloing RUST. Your best bet is to either play it with friends or try and join a Team or Clan. This makes for some fun social interaction and a lot of ease on the mind when worrying if you will survive over night.The game is pretty simple. Survive. It has a lot of characteristics of Minecraft. Cut wood from trees mine stone from stone nodes and build a house to survive. Though you are not trying to survive from creepers instead you are trying to not get murdered mugged and humiliated by other players areound the world. They will use C4 to blow up your house. They will use a bone knife made from your friends bones to stab you while you sleep. They will take your pants so you have to run around with your little johnson flapping around. But when the tables turn you can do the same back!OVERALLMy overall review of RUST is that it is a great game. You get angry happy upset and excited all at the same time. You experience fear and joy in one action. Its wierdly satisfying. I would recommend this game to ANYONE who does not get too angry at a game.I find this game to be extremely glitch low which is a great plusRemember. Your base WILL get Raided no matter how good it is. So build it well and make sure you have a backup plan. Learn from each experience and build better and better every time!If you do decide to buy RUST make sure you watch tutorials. You will need to know what things are and what people are talking about and how things work. Please do this for yourself.9/10 Great game! Doesn't need to change! Maybe needs to add furniture and decoration ideas for bases.,Rust

An example could be just getting out of the sewers stacked with a lot of good items(which you worked hard for) just to get shot and get your items taken moments afterwards. This is something which happened to me and it is very annoying.However that is just part of the of the game and it is what makes it what it is.Overall great game!,Rust

The people who play with really do effect your experience of the gameplay being that there is no singleplayer mode.

2017-04-09,0,0,189,True,Recommended,I got somewhat 200 hours in this game and i just decided to write a review for it.Game has a lot of potential some of it hidden. Rust is better played in a group of 3 to 5 on a medium or big server with constant rivals at your doors and glitches on your back. It's been in early access for quite some time now but unlike other games this one actually has updates (weekly). Devs aren't afraid to change gameplay mechanics to see how it plays out in the end this is Early Access after all. So how's the game up close?Gameplay is simple in its basics. Just survive. Kill build (optionally tho you can even survive without a base) farm (a lot especially if you're alone) and do whatever you want. Currenly as of beginning of 2017 there is no end game content or any specific objective to do. Most people tend to raid once they have reached a certain level of development some just build the biggest and baddest base around and stay in it occasionally killing someone from their roof and most of the players are engaged in pvp content whether they want it or not. No one is protected from having his аss handed to him just because he made a wrong turn in the forest and walked up on a gang of 3 ruskies with ak's and full armor. This is why the game is best played in group that way you can have an actual objective in game to have fun together instead of just building a base or raiding someone.Graphics optimisation all of that are changing constantly and for some the game would be unplayable but that's only if you have a very old pc. Currenly i'd have about 40 fps on high on r9 270x and i5. But since it's early access and unity together means that there are a lot of bugs and nothing can save you if you suddenly freeze during a firefight. Happens occasionally.Sound eh it's alright. Music eh turned it off.Social interactions knock a door press V and scream SUKA SUDA IDI NAHOOY get rekt.Potential a lot if devs keep on updating as they are game will (probably... hopefully) leave ea with a lot of content and ready to conquer steam charts.,Rust

2015-09-13,0,0,82,True,Recommended,Rust (Раст) это детище Facepunch Studios. Основной идеей игры является выживание. Как DayZ Minecraft или Сталкер события в RUST будут происходить в крайне враждебной среде в которой вам предстоит выживать или может процветать.Я буду жить!Основная цель игры состоит в том чтобы начиная только с камнем в руках выбить себе место под солнцем. Для вам потребуется собирать разнообразные ресурсы. Например дрова можно добывать с деревьев или вязанок дров породы и руду можно добыть с больших валунов. Затем можно попробовать создать себе более совершенные орудия труда например из древесины и камня у вас получится топор что позволит собирать материалы гораздо быстрее.Вам потребуется еда. Вы можете охотиться на разнообразных животных представленных в игре. Медведи волки могут представлять большую опасность для начинающих игроков. А кабаны куры кролики и олени будут просто убегать от вас. После того как вы убьёте животное с его трупа можно будет собрать такие ресурсы как мясо и кожу. Далее вы можете сделать костер из дров и приготовить мясо на огне. В итоге вы получите хорошую еду и больше шансов на выживание.,Rust

2016-11-25,0,0,83,True,Recommended,In a games landscape littered with survival games that pit you against zombies and no life sociopath players Rust stands apart as a game that really showcases how good a multiplayer survival game can be.No zombies in this one the environment fauna and other players are your only enemies. However regular server wipes ensure that no player or group becomes so entrenched that they dominate a server in perpetuity. Also unlike other survival games having weapons to defend yourself comes down to having the materials to craft them (though in the past you also needed their blueprint) meaning that all players stand some chance against even the most advanced players on their server. An active dev team means that this game is constantly updating deepening and improving. The game I bought a year ago is much different than the game that exists today. Rust is without a doubt the best survival game I have played to date. The only other that comes close is Don't Starve. And while Don't Starve's setting and ethos is unique and attractive the intensity of clawing out your survival on Rust is unmatched. I cannot recommend Rust highly enough.,Rust

Rust has alot of potential to be a great survival game. Sadly it isn't noob friendly the official servers are completely full of clans running around killing every newbie and you will get camped as little as 5 mintues into the game. The admins on alot of servers abuse their powers way too much they give their friends the best gear and weapons and get involved in other people playing. There is no survival just mass death. Being in Early access still I reccomend people to wait a bit see if the game improves I would love a system where there are consiquences for admins who abuse their powers.,Rust

2016-02-05,0,0,43,True,Recommended,This game has many issues. I have uninstalled this game several times over and still can not connect to a server.the game server I did manage to connect to lasted all of 3 seconds and before the game world loaded i was dead.I also had to dig thru several google examples to get this game to even load up just to get no server connections. I have tried every server i see the game seems to try and load then kicks me back to the server connect window.I am now on my 5th reInstall and will look more into google examples to get this game to work.EDIT In order for me to get this game to run I have to open up my STEAM folder and run the steam.exe file as Administrator then I could click the RUST Play button and she loads up.I'm using Win 10 w/ current updates as of todays date.It's a pain inthe but i works and the game is playable now.. Rate 6/10 for compatablitly issuegame play is good has a few features that could be enhanced targeting resources and dead animals. Would like to see a more simpler solution to remove walls or places items rather than having tohunt down C4 and blow up your hard work. I reccomend you start small learn the basics of building and then go for the ultimate base.I also would suggest you burry a key outside your newly constructed hut and add a box inside to house a spare key.. I was killed and forgot to do this you will not break down your walls with the default rock trust me and good luck finding your hut/house/fort if you have to respawn in a new place. as of now i have 3 hidden huts ( to hold items) and a house that i cant get into lol... After a few hours i created a large fortress and applied lots of hidden features to prevent future lock outs.Animals in game do not agro/attack you when you get near unless you attack/shoot them 1st.All in all this game has a lot of potential fun to kill people and animals. I look forward to future updates..,Rust

2015-04-29,0,0,284,True,Recommended,Most people have no idea how to play this game. yea you can craft and get all the little materials you need to build your phallic base. and you get to spend all that time searching for all the blue prints and trying to find those elusive sniper rifle plans. but this game isn't about amassing hordes of weapons and kevlar and trying to keep someone else from inevitably stealing it. this game is about politics manipulation and the power of the almighty word. some of the best times i've ever had gaming was while playing this game with a friend i met ingame. you would be suprised on all the things you can convince others is happening. Example my friend and i never killed anyone short of the times we caught ppl in our base. one time we went to our rivals camp just over the ridge and griefed his metal base super bad. you see C4 is expensive and normally we would only take it from airdrops we had a false alliance with our rival (we were constantly doing things to his base and blaming it on other ppl on the server he never knew it was us) we would go and back him up and usually with his c4 we would share on what we would get from the bases. only a few times did we have to fight when raiding. the best raid came from when we griefed his base. all we had was enough c4 to blow up the first wall. but in that room he had put all of his c4 so he could grab it quick. anyways in the end we got this guy to basically break into his own base for us and give us large amounts of weapons and armour for helping him.10/10,Rust

2015-12-26,0,0,184,True,Recommended,Rust is a very fun and enjoyable game that can make your day if you really enjoy playing it. Sure its community can be sour at times but if you find the right server it can be very surprising on what may happen. For example I play on a server that is much better than the rest of the servers I have played on by far (but that is my own opinion.) if any are interested its called Irradiated and you can find it on the modded section of the server list.tl dr Rust is a fun game get it don't give up until you find the right server for you. Come play on Irradiated if you'd like to.,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,37,True,Recommended,note this is for the alpha version of rust.Rust is a survival game that happens to have zombies in it. It's player versus environment in the best way with a side of player versus player. It's focused on multiplayer interactions. Depending on where you find yourself these interactions may involve trade or running like hell from the maniac with a shotgun. Build explore fortify. Good luck you're going to need it.,Rust
2014-01-14,0,0,196,True,Recommended,A unique twist on builder survival it plays smooth while maintaining a great ambience. This game to sum it up is the product of Dayz and Minecraft having a baby. You create the world and structures and choose the path you want for yourself. Bandit or Hero? Break into peoples houses while there asleep and kill them taking there house and resources. Create defences and alliances with neighbors to maintain a friendly community. Great game still very alpha so dont expect anything ground breaking. It will only get better. 8/10,Rust
2014-01-14,0,0,130,True,Recommended,Amazing game. The game is very in depth while keeping it very simple for users to be able to understand how to craft gather resources and play. Graphics are great gameplay is great and the community is amazingly nice. If you play this game like its DayZ you will get ed in the lol probably with more guys too. Its very easy for new players to get aquainted with everyone and to play with a friendly enviorment.While the game still has a ways to go with bugs. Like not spawning with all the items you had when you logged off logging back in glitched and then dying or not spawning with anything at all.... This game has amazing potential and will keep you entertained for hours.,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,160,True,Recommended,As of this moment I'd give this game a 7/10 but remember it's still in the alpha stage. That being said it has a LOT of potential. Once they add features like full character customization more options for building structures more weapons and tools and take zombies out (they kind of take away from the experience with other real players) this game will easily be an 8.5 or 9/10 in my books.The freedom in this game is almost unmatched. If you want to be on your own and build a house you can do that. If you want to seek out other players work together and build a town you can do that. If you want to raid another players base for supplies and weapons you can do that to. Also the survival aspects make it interesting. If you cant find food you will starve. If you don't have clothing or fire you will freeze. If you don't have weapons you can't defend yourself from zombies and other players. The ability to not only run around freely on an island to find weapons meet other players and explore in general but also the ability to gather resources to build whatever you want wherever you want is why this game can be great.All that being said I will go into the negative aspects of the game. First the zombies. Now zombies aren't only a negative. They can give some cool loot but all in all they become borderline annoying and they take away from the experience with other players whether that is working with them or against them. Secondly all of the bandits. Bandits are players who are just there to kill you and loot your corpse. Now I don't have a problem with there being some bandits actually I enjoy pvp but I have a problem with the amount of bandits there are. I would say 9/10 players are bandits and will try to kill you on sight (even if your just passing by gathering resources etc). It is very rare to come accross a friendly player and it is to the point where I would recommend to all new players to avoid other players at all costs at least until you have some sort of base.Overall this is a solid game that will only get better and I would defenitly recommend trying it.,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,59,True,Recommended,"So Im playing on the official Tokyo server. Amazing dynamics here. The Japanese seem to be playing in large teams. They work with incredible organization and division of duties. Some players only hunt while others are building elaborate bases with gates barracades. spike walls lookout towers for other friends to settle within their compound. Meanwhile a large number of South Korean players log onto the Japanese servers and have become outcast barbarians. Usually living in the fringe regions of the map they organize raids against the Japanese with some spamming ""Republic of Korea"" propaganda chat logs until banned. The English speaking minority myself included are barely surviving sustaining ourselves on scraps of food usually scavaged from abandoned player built shacks. We have virtually no resources or strategic power.... and are at constant risk of succumbing to starvation wildlife zombies or the Koreans. Last night a Korean befriended my teammate and I and later blew my teammate's head off with a handcannon and robbed our little camp blind LOL !! I escaped with my life but later died of starvation and cold. Great game. 9/10.",Rust
2014-01-14,0,0,199,True,Not Recommended,This game is pretty terrible the community of players is pretty bad the hacks are WAY out of control. Even if it is in its pre alpha it appears the dev team has little idea of what they want it to be. This being said if they tune it up nicely and figure out where the game is supposed to be going its grafically acceptable while being a terrible FPS. save your money for now and possibly forever.,Rust

2016-12-06,0,0,450,True,Recommended,I'm kinda of Yes and No when it comes to this game.Community Overall the community is complete I found myself being killed countless times by large clans fully geared despite the fact that I was a naked. There are a lot of talkers and trolls. Almost every player is KOS. It's quite ridiculous however that's just the way it is. However I've met some pretty cool guys who've helped me out. On multiple occasions I've been raided and a 3rd party came in and saved me. Sometimes you just get lucky. (Beware The people that say the Community overall is great or only a little cancerous they're the problem. Just a heads up.)Servers/Gameplay Most populated servers are packed with large clans (20+ People) that insist on going around and killing nakeds who are just starting out. Got far enough alone where you have a small stone/wood base built? Forget it you're little shack will be raided within a few hours. Just got into a fresh wiped server where everyone else is starting out too? Again you won't last long alone. People already have their clans decided. Being in a clan makes work go by much faster and they'll be ahead of you no matter what. Clans can be set up with everything they need plus more within hours from there it's just and giggles for them. A clan just invited you to join them? Odds are they're gonna use you for slave work or just don't want to potentially die and want that easy kill. Playing alone isn't a very good idea if unless you're really good at laying low or really good at shooting a bow otherwise I recommend playing with some friends. If you don't have any than make some fast or get good. The game itself is pretty good tho the mechanics are easy and building isn't complex as you might think. However certain parts of the game can be pretty glitchy such as animals headshots and sometimes rendering. (Note I have experience with everything I've talked about here.)So if you have a pretty decent sized group of friends the will to grind and can aim than this game is for you. If you don't have friends you're lazy and you can't aim then probably not. Work on that stuff lol.,Rust

2017-04-27,0,0,451,True,Recommended,To be honest I'm okay if this game stays in early access forever. It's a really well developed game and it's definitely a lot of fun. Glitches and stuff happen but the devs are usually food at patching minor ones in the weekly update and they've fixed a lot of the MAJOR ones that existed before (ex animals going through rocks etc.). A lot of this game does depend on the server that you choose so if you're having a bad experience try a couple of different servers before giving up on the game.,Rust

I can't wait to see how it evolves with time.*Update*The latest update to the game has taken all need for skill in raiding away. Tool cupboards used to be super helpful in raid defense (as they should be a 1k wood each) yet now people can build up the side of your base regardless. What does this mean? Being intelligent or strategic when building bases means nothing. Unless you have 6+ hours to build your base in one go you will be raided by someone with no skill and lose hours of work the minutes you log. This had ruined the game for me. I build strategically and very strong but it doesn't matter at all anymore. This update favors clans which were already strong and now you will not be able to survive as a single player (especially if you are new). Until the developers fix this problem I wouldn't even recommend trying. You'll just get destroyed.,Rust

If you get on a high pop server right off the bat you are probably going to have a bad time unless you have some friends with you. I started out on a low population server to get in the swing of things and learn the ropes. The Wiki page they have is VERY helpful.

2016-01-19,0,0,1438,True,Recommended,READ THIS CARREFULLY if you're aiming to buy a SURVIVAL game. Cause one thing is causing me troubles with this game. Rust is not really a survival game... I mean it's still a game where you have to take care of hunger cold and some others basics. But as I said it's a very small detail in the game. If you're reading the official introduction of the game...If you're looking at the official trailer... Well it's not really what the game is about actually.Rust is slowly aiming to a core PvP game way more than a survival game where you have to struggle to live... Except from other players. Just take a look at the animal part and the variety of gathers... So I thought you guyz should consider it if you're planning to buy it for the survival (PVE) part. If we're talking about the PvP part... Its juste incredibly awesome and catchy. Buy this game if you want to realize the dream of your childhood hiring a team of mercenaries or building a peace village to show the world that Rust is not only about brutality anything is theorically possible. It'll always be depending on players according to the open persistant world. But keep in mind that killing people and taking their stuff still is the CORE purpose of the game. Better knowing it !( Excuse my english not my common langage. ),Rust

2016-01-11,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,"There are quite a few reasons of why this game has made me lose my s*** quite a few times which I'll explain right now as cons and pros. Cons first as I think they outweigh the pros. Lastly I'll give a little conclusion as a summary of everything.Cons Bad servers. There's a lot of lag in official servers. That said yesterday after raiding and getting some materials I got killed came back to the body and boom server crashes for I don't know how long making me lose everything I'd earned (Not everything got stolen). Takes a lot to load this game making me wonder why since it's nothing bombastic. I load every single game fairly quickly (Hold your horses with ""I BET YOUR PC IS TERRIBLE"". My PC is not bad at all) but this one takes around 3 4 minutes to load and enter a server (counting on open slots in the servers I play). This game accentuates the attitude some people may have Have you just joined the game and have 300 wood? Let's shoot you in the face for the lulz!! If you get frustrated by those things definitely skip this title.These are the major cons I see for the game.Pros The crafting and building are cool. Nothing new but functional. The game is truly survival You have to find blueprints (or make them) in order to make your fortress and yourself better overall. Also you may not have a bed yet but your house could be almost built and someone could kill you and f**k it up. And a long etcetera. The raiding in this game although sometimes stressful (banging a wooden door a million times to destroy it because you lack better means) is really funny if you play with friends.These are the pros that make the game shine.In conclusion what have we learned today kids? It doesn't matter how cool your game is and how much fun you COULD have with your friends because if the servers are utter crap and it lags like hell the whole time your experience will be pretty much ruined.Even though the game is in alpha state make sure you sell a product that is PLAYABLE.Have a nice day.",Rust

2014-11-06,0,0,313,True,Not Recommended,*** updated JANUARY 2016 ***I still cannot recommend this game. It is at its core a cluster of trolls trolling each other and squeakers with nothing better to do than grief and yell insults about each others moms through in game voip.___ BIGGEST PROBLEMS ___ An absolute free for all with NO protections against griefing. Trolls will destroy your base kill you and take everything you've gathered and there is nothing you can do about it. Absolutely requires you to group up with others to survive which isn't bad in and of itself until you realize that you can't play if your friends aren't online. And you must absolutely trust your teammates otherwise they can easily backstab you and make off with hours of your hard work. Offline raiding is a constant threat and you must log on SEVERAL TIMES A DAY to ensure your base is guarded. It takes (depending on the attackers) 5 minutes to 3 hours to break into a base. And so you can never rest. If you are AFK for a few days expect to start over from zero. Because that is exactly where you will be. 12 year olds ruin the game. No filtering them out they are everywhere. I don't want to have anything to do with the pre pubescent but that is the bulk of this player base.,Rust

2017-01-16,0,0,668,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I have over a 100 hours in now therefore I think its fair game to post a review. Personally I love the game but be ready to be sucked in for hours upon hours of play untill you absolutely get sick of it then take 4 days off and and you miss it again. I think the balance of the game is well developed although I will say it is a little difficult to start off when you first join a server that has 300 people on it. The developers do a decent job updating the game from time to time but I would really love to see the game be finished. It is really easy to find friends in game to play with but more difficult to find ones you trust. The game is a completely unique concept. There are servers for noobies and servers for hardcore players. DEVELOPERS KEEP THE UPDATES COMING! Im honestly excited to see where the game will go. I forgot to mention the game has a solid stealth mechanism and its fun to camp half a mile outisde your enemies base with a sniper rifle and see what theyre up to while your buddy is sneaking up with a shotgun. If youre one of those people who just cant seem to find a game they like I reccomend giving this a shot its got a little bit of everything in it.,Rust

2016-07-31,0,0,1584,True,Recommended,Rust is one of my favorite survival games throughout the years of having this game it hasn t gotten old and it keeps bringing me back rust isn t like any other survival games with exhilarating gunfights and raids. But the game is nowhere from perfect. Even though the devs are constantly updating it they have done some questionable changes to the game. This game can be frustrating from clans to just loosing loot but for $20 it s a great game.,Rust
2017-01-16,0,0,98,True,Recommended,0/10 Could not drink the bleach.But in reality this game is great. Play solo or with friends cower in fear of people outside your base.

2016-02-05,0,0,42,True,Recommended,"2char stole this review from me its actually mine XDTL DR Its an open world (mostly static world + loot spawns and buildings) deathmatch game in the middle of no where with crafting and survival elements. Getting lost in the extremely empty parts of the map is not fun.Getting killed after trying to be friends with talking strangers isn't either.rust levels of fun (minecraft levels of fun destructable terrain + guns + ragdolls + actual survival elements central spawn location + getting lost forever knowing where you are instantaneous crafting + camp fires + bears + wolves minecraft mobs + everything dropping chicken) / (the time you spend playing the game * the amount of times you get killed)If you play it you should play with friends (or with hacks which is how you really enjoy rust just ask anybody who kills me).I got lost a few times. I build a shelter and then I died. I died a few more times and then I disconnected. Maybe I should ""git gud"" and ""lern to play"". I could play with friends and share resources with a clan. Killing bambis because thats what you do in multiplayer games (its funny).Why can't people join factions and have protected faction areas like in minecraft? I want to be able to set an arbitrary home somewhere and go hide there when I'm scared. Maybe I should play minecraft or something.At least in minecraft you could run 50 000 blocks out in some random direction dig to bedrock build a farm eat carrots for life and not have to worry about your base RANDOMLY GETTING DESTROYED BECAUSE THE SERVER JUST FELT LIKE IT. Apparently if you don't play for a while ur base gets raided by itself and rip goes ur stuff.That kind of feeling you get in minecraft that your base is safe and you can mess around in there is gone completely. Everything feels like a deathmatch with huts. When I say ""huts"" I really mean massive sky scrapers made out of giant logs. Which will also evaporate if you stop using them.I kinda like it. You never feel safe until you are. Then you arn't because the hacker connected and hes yolo hopping into ur base liek a bird on a trampoline.Its a game that isn't going anywhere. The devs will work on it until they are satisfied. Thats what I believe after seeing how the game has changed over time. The game changes more than most early access titles. I look forward to seeing the community grow and I'm curious for the future of the game.",Rust

2016-01-13,0,0,599,True,Recommended,If you are reading this and have already played Rust chances are you already know that this is one of those hit and miss games where you may find yourself really enjoying it or you may hate yourself for investing all the time that you've put into it only to have a server wiped or to log in the next day to find you have been killed. If you have not played Rust and are new to the game do not play alone. If you actually leave your computer screen and have friends from the outside world then good news! You can actually play the game for a lengthly period of time without having to restart 2 3 days! However if you are a hermit and have trust issues then this is not the game for you. What I recommend is finding a dead server and learning the basics of the game and getting familure to it. Once you've accumulated these skills it'll be easier to actually play the game. The next step is finding people to trust. (Once again I strongly suggest close friends if you have none work on your social skills and make some friends.),Rust

I had most of my play time in the legacy version which when played with pals was great despite the frustration of hackers. The new version seems to be shaping up very well. The question now ""Is it too late ?"" I have recently returned to rust and to be honest I have enjoyed my time in it. I picked a low population server to start for practice and reeducate myself and I am still learning. With the help of some extremely helpful admins that even upgraded the base and kitted me out with tools and weapons I am now ready to start the exploring.Where will this game be in a few years ? I honestly dont know. But for now the population seems to be on the increase again due to the help of certain Twitch streamers (I wont drop names)At this current price this game is a bargain and definitely worth a buy.

2017-06-08,0,0,687,True,Recommended,Phenominal game. Still in Alpha but has a dedicated following. This game is not really for casual players as it takes a lot of time and patience to get anywhere in it. Not to mention that it is almost exclusively PvP so you are bound to get killed and looted several times before you get the hang of it. Depending on the server the entire map will wipe every week or month and forces everyone to start on a level playing field again. If you are looking for a game to spend hours on and really immerse yourself in this is a good choice.,Rust

2017-06-08,0,0,803,True,Recommended,not bad,Rust
2017-03-09,0,0,627,True,Recommended,Some tips for those whom it may consider. IMHO.To clear some common misconceptions this game is mainly about PvP people who have good awareness reaction time and teamplay skills (+voice comms!) will succeed people who wanna play The Sims Post Apo or Fallout Online may get disappointed greatly. Well you can have your PvE experience and explore the basics of the game in a very low populated PvE server but I can promise that it will get boring soon enough.It is also beneficial if you have a group or 2 or more like 5 or so both for strength in numbers and gathering resources faster and in larger amounts especially in vanilla. And if youre willing to think outside the box while building your base (or outside the square to be more literal in this case) youre also doing it right classic fundamentals of architecture as we know it aren't going to work in this game.Accept the inevitable ASAP you will get constantly shot at your things will get looted your base raided and robbed clean sometimes even taken over! If you dont like the idea of that this game isnt for you. Oh yes and stating the obvious your agressiveness will be rewarded best defence is good offence! Get yourself aquinted how weapons ammo and armor work (I'd suggest a practice in Combat Tag server for that) and you save yourself lot of trouble.Community isnt always the best. When I thought WoW or World of Tanks had rubbish community... But its understandable when hard earned stuff gets looted away bases raided while your'e offline and people get killed on sight even if they are naked. Accept it. Don't get mad get even. Git gut. Or don't buy the game.,Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,72,True,Recommended,I did not really know what to expect when I bought Rust but I knew that my friend bought it earlier and decided to join him. I joined the server he was on with about 110 people on it ''Wow!'' I thought. I bet I will make lots of new companions. How naive I was. As I spawned I looked down on the rock in my hands and then looked around me. Mostly trees what did I expect? But suddenly I saw movement to my left and turned all my attention in that direction. Three naked men came charging towards me their hands tightly gripped around their crude rocks. I had no idea what to do. Run? Try to talk? I nervously pressed the 'V' key and stammered into my Mic ''U um friendly'' Just as I uttered those words a wave of laughter washed over me from the three naked men and as they were upon me they shouted what I can only describe as guttural russian. I tried to run but in mere seconds they had bashed my entire being with their savage hands and rocks. I was no more. I spawned again. Now with my shacking hand fumbling around on my mouse as I looked around. No naked men this time. I found a road and decided to follow it. I kept walking for about three minutes when I saw someone come towards me. A man with a black mask. My heart started to race and I could feel the sweat run down my back. I decided this time to just stand there and as he came close enough I said ''Hi'' In the blink of an eye he took out a shotgun and screamed '' ing russians i hate you'' and then shoot on the spot. I rate this game 10 out of 10 for an interesting look into the cruel nature of humanity.,Rust

2014-02-17,0,0,243,True,Recommended,"A great game that is by far the best alpha I have ever partaken in. The state at which this game is presently at is far beyond many titles that have been released and its still in alpha which astounds me each and every time I think about it. While the game is incredibly solid at the state that it is at it still has great potential and I plan to be there through each and every change. One problem that many players seem to run into is the fact that alot of players tend to be jerks (putting it nicely). A large amount of players especially at more populated servers tend to kill on sight (kos) no matter whether you just bought the game and only have a rock as your one and only weapon or you have M4's Bolt Actions and full Kevlar armor (the most protective armor towards everything but radiation). This in the long run turns into a snowball effect because once you have gotten killed many times without being able to build your own house or even mine your first deer (and yes I do mean ""mine"") you in turn change into the same person you hated and I don't blame you for it one bit. So easily tricked by that innocent looking naked guy running up with only a rock asking for some food when BAM right once you open your inventory a shotgun is pulled out in your face and next thing you know he not only has your food that your generous heart was willing to give but now he has your 10 stacks of wood stack of metal and stack of sulfur that you had spent the last hour gathering leading you to the point of swaring on your life ""I WILL NEVER TRUST ANOTHER SOUL"" so that next thing you know an innocent player comes up with only a rock and now your the one sniping him with a bolt action or running behind him with a pickaxe into his back (which is actually VERY effective). While I may have gotten carried away with the hypothetical scenario with the snowball effect you get the point if you are prone the motion sickness and/or expecting a baby I mean prone to getting enraged and/or rage quitting play in a group. Even if you are not prone to being easily enraged get a group. Even if this group is simply a matter of you and your one friend that counts as a group and is at the utmost importance in Rust. In the end to be successful at Rust you have to make friends even if you dont live under the same roof you need somebody you can trust and rely on when things get tough.",Rust

2014-02-18,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,I wouldn't recomend this game in current (non single player) state. The sad fact of this DayZ clone (it is and i will explain) is that it's not that fun. First your base will be raided. This is a key machanic of the game but it also breaks the game. the well kitted out players will raid the one's starting off making it impossible for beginers to progress. Second their is nothing to do with friends. Their seems to be no real impliment of a CO OP objective. No tough animals you couldn't take down with a bow (starter weapon) no impliment of a level genterated base you could raid with friends that you couldn't by yourself (agian with a bow) and really nothing different to do than other games. Lastly it is very unoriginal. From the Zombies (DAYZ WARZ and so many others) to the ONLY MAP (Also see DAYZ WarZ and others.) it seem to just take from otheir games and doesn't take advantage of the great machanic (that if properly implimented) that would make this game above all others incuding DAYZ. Between the constant in fighting constant rebuilding and constant arguing not only did I not have fun I couldn't. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT CONDITION AND WOULD GLADLY TAKE A REFUND IF OFFERED BY THE DEVELOPERS.,Rust

Its quite difficult when on your own so i'd find some friends if i were you ),Rust
2017-05-05,0,0,338,True,Recommended,As a dev game you'll see the occasional change. Some will be a blessing and some will require you to change the way you play the game. Large servers can be toxic and salty. If you want to avoid it put in the time to locate servers that suit your needs there's plenty out there.,Rust
2017-05-21,0,0,122,True,Recommended,Do not play solo you will have a pretty bad time. I wrote this last night after getting my first decent gun then being killed 2 minutes later. Rust makes me extra salty but I keep coming back. It is pretty excellent. Playing alone is still rough though.,Rust
2017-05-22,0,0,865,True,Recommended,RUST!!! It's a great survival game. Dosent take long to get used to what goes on. Kill or be Killed.I have played this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying the content. Just as you get used to something facepunch gives us a new toy or throws a curve ball into the mix to spice things up again.Keep up the good work guys you doing g good!!!!,Rust
2017-05-23,0,0,812,True,Not Recommended,Been playing this since legacy dealt with so many ups and downs update wise but holy is it broken now. Might as well remove half of the objects in the game as they are now useless. What solo player or small group is really going to grind resources for high external walls whether they are wood or stone just so someone with a bit of wood that's fresh spawned in can just hop over it.For what i paid i will definietly say i got my moneys worth so i am not salty about that part at all just a little sad to see where rust has ended up. I do like your companies name though it fits in well with what you've done to yourself and this game.If they fix it and remove the twigs in TC even keep the ladders i would recommend it. If they do nothing don't waste your money and time as it will likely just bring you hours of frustration and restarting your base.,Rust

2016-08-12,0,0,1534,True,Recommended,Rust is an intense game of survival. You are dropped into an open world sand box in a never ending pvp enviroment. You harvest resources and build house's fortresses or compounds. You craft clothing and armor guns and explosives. You can explore the world under a constant threat of dealth to risk coming back with amazing rewards and gear. If all thats not enough for you then go and take whatever you like from others in heart pounding pvp fights.This game is still in development. I personally am not a fan of the development team primarily because they have been known to lower themselves to the same level of Rusts toxic community. That said any hardcore pvp survival game is going to bring out strong emotions reguardless if they are good or bad.The game is very addicting and can become your life if you let it. I have been playing this game for years now and I very much have a love/hate relationship with it. I can not dispute that it is an amazing game and if there was a video game hall of fame Rust would be in it. (even tho its not finished at the time of writing this)I am sure Rust will be and already is the flagship of its genre.I would not recommend this game to a softcore gamer or anyone that is easily discouraged.You can spend 80 hours progressing in this game and loose it all in the blink of an eye. Its a dog eat dog world and Im sure you can imagine the type of rage this can bring out in the loosing party. That said once you get the taste of victory you will keep coming back for more. This game plays on a persons ego. When your ego is hurt you will rage and when your ego is fed you will become addicted. Should you buy this game? Absolutley. Join us in this murder simulator... remember trust no one.,Rust

I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique adventure. Keep in mind that this game is only 10% done as it is in its alpha stage. That being said I would consider it being less buggy and more playable than most full games. Hopefully through the regular updates Rust will become an even greater game than it currently is.

2015-12-12,0,0,1282,True,Recommended,Ok first listen this may be long Rust is a hardcore survival game that takes time getting used too you need to learn from experience the ones I don't recommend it to is people who rage quit as the saying goes it's Rust your gonna lose your stuff you work hard for but if you work harder you can defend the stuff you worked hard for the people as rage quiters I mean as soon as they get something cool and die they give up and hit the power button those are the most famous reviewers I very highly recommended this to new survival game players and old for new players to learn from there mistakes like trying to kill a heavily armed man with a rock and he embarrassing kills you with an Ebola pistol to sum it up this game takes time once you adjust you'll get addicted it will be great fun and you'll finally be apart of a great community and not the ones who beg and whine and cry because they don't get loot handed to them it's not Call of Duty you want a gun start getting resources or as the community calls it or farming or apex farming meaning killing others for the things you need you need time and knowledge and just maybe you'll be like me and many others being heavily armed but not with a ebola pistol an M249 I've put in over 1000 hours in and for me It's worth the 20$,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,67,True,Recommended,This game doesn't really bring much new to the sand box genre. What it does well is what other games don't. The game makes grinding fun. The UI is better than most. And it's updated frequently and the dev maintians constant communication with the games vison. I've sunk countless hours into just chopping down trees and crushing rocks all in the purisui of surviving until the next day. Inevetiably a bear glitches into our fort but what the hell. The rest of the game is fun. It's really all about finding the right server for you. There's not really a goal for this game like most sandobox type games. It's all about having friend with your buddies and trying not to get killed by others. As most people seem to have an insatiable appetite for murder.,Rust

2016-12-30,0,0,194,True,Recommended,First review ever here.I really began playing this game in October 2016 and i'm writing this in late December. I love and hate this game. I still recommend it.Many reviews here mentionned the community. Yes the community is a pain. Mainly because like others have said of the killing on sight and the constant raiding on and offline.KoS in itself isn't a problem a lot of people enjoy it and it's their right.I don't.It's not the way I want to play Rust. The problem comes when you realize that if you want to play solo or in a clan on a high pop server it's almost mandatory for you to take the KoS approach. Raiding may be a bit different in that regard and that aspect is kind of at the base of the game.This is where I am right now I want to play with the risk involved which is real and thrilling in trying to build something on a high pop server because obviously there is people there. But you keep having to start again and again especially if you don't KoS.Then you get tired of that and you go to a lower pop server and it's good for a time because you can build something but nobody cares yourself included and you then wonder what to do. So you go back to that high pop server and the cycle keeps going.I would really love that the devs if it's in their intentions implement a system that permits KoS and raiding as a way of playing but also encourages something deeper that would make building a community or any other type of playing a more common practice. Rust could be much more than a stronghold defense 'til the next wipe and a murder to the top kind of a game. I don't know if it will become more than that or if the community itself could provoke the change. As of now tough it is enjoyable for what it is but deeply frustrating at the same time. Being that way I had my fun with it but it'll lose a player like me sooner than later.,Rust
2016-12-30,0,0,1281,True,Recommended,I have been with The rust devs ever since they were in legacy and the game has just been progressing ever since. It's one of the best games I have ever played. Easily one of the best open world survival games out there. Would buy it at any price. Highly recommend. Amazing developers that actaully listen to the community and add some much more stuff to the game that I never thought would ever be added.,Rust

2016-12-30,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,"The concept of a ""true"" survival game is hinted at but never achieved. I have spent the 14 hours playing this game TRYING to build and grow talk to people and just enjoy the game.I have never been able to do anything beyond build a simple structure. I have never seen anything beyond that besides the one time I stumbled upon a dead guy with an assault rifle. Everyone shoots on sight which makes sense if you're killing potential rivals or threats but that rule of engagement applies to people that just spawned too. Unless you know people on your server of choice or you luck out and no one kills you while you get the remaining resources that weren't stockpiled you WILL have a bad time.$20 for a ""survival"" game that at its core is so ing simple is ridiculous. I would rather play the Stranded mod for Garry's Mod. It's that bad and the game is simple enough to make that comparison.I will never recommend this game. It's a game with a barrier to entry even after paying. There is no incentive for buying this game because you will struggle to just PLAY the game and if you survive past that you'll enjoy the very limited crafting/build options.I want a ing refund. Please do not support this game with another purchase.",Rust

2016-12-31,0,0,141,True,Recommended,I bought this game a few years ago and I was not disappointed then or now. The game is sort of demanding if you want good quality and smooth frame rates in game. I play this on an Asus Laptop with a graphics card and to have it completely smooth I have to look at sh** graphics all the time. If you put that to the side the game is absolutely fantastic it is even better with friends. You will find yourself locked into the game for months just don't kill yourself after each time you get raided.,Rust
2016-12-31,0,0,548,True,Recommended,Game has some issues but it's still fun. Groups obviously have a big advantage so it makes you have to find friends to survive. Is it perfect? No. Is it great? It depends on what you make of it. I have played this game a ton and I must say i've gotten my money out of it. There's alot that still needs to be impimented. The animal A.I. is still bad (I know it's not their fault completely). The AK is still super OP to anything else. Seems like big groups get them in no time too. It's a hard game. It will make you mad. It will make you rage quit every one in awhile. But the level of difficulty brought on not just by the game but the other players leave you wanting to come back for more. Makes you wanna thrive and win. Make a new base that is harder to raid. Overall I've played enought that it was worth the money.,Rust

I have another account which i play alot of games on but this game is the one that held my atention the longest multiplayer wise even if its only multi. But this game has incredible potental and a bright future. Since we have seen how successful GarysMod was were shure too see this game become a steam number one.

Keep in mind that Rust might not run as well as you would want it too. If you are expecting to play this game on 1080p with 60fps you will need a pretty good dedicated gaming machine.

2014-05-26,0,0,302,True,Recommended,Highly addicting and Garry's work is really shown when you play the game. The optimization may be terrible but the amount of creativity and items is phenomenal. One update/item could screw up optimization so I see why they might not want to focus on optimization due to their games quick growth. In items and concepts.I really love how difficult and different the weapon play is compared to other franchises all FPSs but not survival like Battllefield and Call of Duty.

2016-03-15,0,0,933,True,Recommended,if you dont like a fast paced survival shoot and loot game tha rust isnt for you. first of all i se everyone complaining in reviews saying it sucks so much african ebola but the thing is rust is hardcore there is no softcore button you get throwed into a island and you have to try and survive build a base while killing gother people or make friends with them or join a clan so everything is easier for you. im going to say this right here if your intending to play solo it not going to workout for you especially on vanilla servers those bigger clans will feast on you everyday but in modded severs they make things easier for the early and mid game but those other big clans will to so before buying rust think about it look up videos which there isnt alot of and se what the game is about and if its right for you and also you need a preety good mid range computer to run rust at a good pace but dont expect to max it out adn what makes me love rust more tah neverything the developers are active and adding new content every week adn there are doing an amazing job with keeping up to date with the community rust is an honest game i would like to proudly have more than a 1000 hours on. 10/10 not IGN oh and the rust community is awesome just sometimes when you kill them hope to se you guys in the rust world,Rust

2016-03-14,0,0,124,True,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game for one reason and before you judge read the entire review. I was VAC banned because of Rust back when it was in Pre Alpha. I did not cheat but rather back then the game was **EXTREMELY** buggy. Anyone who remembers rust that far will agree. I'm talking when there were zombies.. Anyway back to the point. I now have a permenant VAC ban on my profile because their anti cheat thought I was cheating. I never cheated in fact the game kicked users out if they stood in between doors when they swung shut at the time. Lots of players were given false bans for the same reason. After displaying all this evidence proving my innocence Facepunch still to this day has not responded.I would not spend $1.00 on this game.

2016-03-14,0,0,57,True,Recommended,Pros Fun game with friends Large and easy to use crafting system Beautiful graphics (if you can run them) and well modeled objects Everyone's is tiny Procedural and unique maps Cons Grindy as hell Community as toxic as League of Legends Bears you like Leonardo DiCaprio Not graphically friendly Overall Rust is an extremely fun game with friends. It also makes the game a lot faster if you can get a group together. If you play alone it can feel like a grind. The maps are always different which is cool. If you like crafting and all that this game works well because not everything is craftable immediately though you have to find all of your new recipies through looting and searching which is more fun than you'd think. My biggest complaint of the game is that it's not very good for low end computers. My friend had to downgrade his renderer and play on minimal with a decent laptop. If you have a quite low end laptop this may not be for you I have a 970 and run on beautiful though and that runs like a charm.,Rust

2014-02-24,0,0,11,True,Recommended,I loved the game it was fantastic the gameplay is good.It goes from chopping down trees with a rock to running away from wolves.Sure it can be frustrating to get raided and lose all your stuff but it is a good game just to go around and see what you can find.I like the game a lot and I recommend playing it.It has a good damage engine and it has a lot of stuff to just go around and explore.The only thing I dont like about rust is the lack of maps.If it had more maps and a bit less lag it would be a game I would play for hours.So I think you should play rust because I seriously recommend it.,Rust
2014-02-24,0,0,499,True,Recommended,I bought this game Friday morning around 8am. By the time I went to sleep before work at 2am on Monday morning I had just under 26 hours poured into this game. You know that crack feeling people always talk about regarding MMOs? If you're a fan of FPSes and Minecraft this is the formula that will do that for you. The beginning is rough don't get me wrong. But after you die a few times and you finally get a base tucked away far from the crowds things start getting thrilling. This is the most fun I've had in a game in a long time. I can't recommend this game enough. And the thing is STILL IN ALPHA! BUY IT NOW!,Rust

2016-01-19,0,0,616,True,Recommended,"I have played rust for some decent time by now. I judge i can point out the details i most consider relevant about the game. IF you are p ondering wether to buy this game and made your research in gameplay streams and stuff you might have some doubts yet. I had these so i am also evaluating the game over these aspects.AMMOUNT OF PLAYERS I played in 3 ways either alone or in a clan or with a friend in a double team.I can say that each of them has their own fun into it.Most of the solo plays were somewhat successful. Even though not resource rich and a raider you can live decently at solo building as long as you are skilled with hiding and find a very good spot. This demands patience and building far from hotzones but hey that's how you do it.Solo playing is mostly farming and carefully examining it. If you play aggressivelly you want to be the trapper and kill people outside rather than raid someone.As a Clan i can tell you that farming is quick and fast and you will almost always hold giant buildings. Lots of loot weaponing and stuff. And raiding too. Not only doing it but suffering it a lot from other clans. With 6 8 you can have a big enough base so that whoever wants to raid you lose more than they earn making a stronghold worth building Safety is uncommon but a bit of it is assured with big clans and a well designed base. You want the flattest area too for radial expansion.And as a team you will have the middle tier between those. You will mostly be more exposed but more defendable with resources enough to build tall and weaponing enough to eventually even raid something.MORALITY I have been strictly moral so far. I have carefully picked people i would ""befriend"" (Being the weakest) and never been batrayed so far. I have never betrayed either. Don't stick around in just random people running and often you can have a depth of honor into it. Joining forces with random people specially other solo can be done.I have also never betrayed anyone weaker though i have been attempted to. I have aided many even donated blueprints to some people and i do not regret it at all. Being honorable in this game (And raiding only ""Guilty"" people) is possible and tho harder i enjoy it most.PVP Rust is a PvP based game. You will always want to have at least 2 weapons a main one and a secondary (Usually a bow). Mastering them might be somewhat hard. I am particularlly bad at most weapons tho i have learned how to decently whoot with bows and thompsons along this time. This is probably me being unskilled tho. No crosshairs and physics can trick a guy who mostly play CS GO as shooters.UPDATES The team weekly updates the game with new content in some ocasions biweekly. New content not only include new items but graphical upgrade tweaks in engine building changes balancing etc. They are active and this forces some servers to wipe down everything.I personally hope it always remain like that for 3 reasons Because it forbids huge clans to literally take over a whole world because it allows you to start over new worlds (Which is one of the most fun parts) AND because this makes you know that anything is temporary so you dont rage over being fully raided since everything is temporary.IN OVERRAL a summing up review here you can enjoy this game. In whichever way. Even if you want to be the nice solo guy it's hard but you can.It's an excelent game.No naked guy jokes.This game is excelency in sandbox and shooting and social interaction.9.9/10(minus 0.1 points for slightly worse interface on macs) (It's the least developed part tho will be solved afterwards)",Rust

And how rich player are getting richer poor getting poorer....Pluses varied gameplay great fun with friends or friendly players some situations can be really funCons sometimes you will ragequit how many a**holes and hackers are there... ( There is not much you can do at the moment except getting guns and shooting people or building a giant tower... no transport just walking walking and more walking some areas of the map should provide different things that somewhere else so it would encourage players to travel and explore rather than just to stick to the center near the main city.,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,133,True,Recommended,This game is simply minecraft and dayz mixed together.

2016-08-26,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I have heard great things about this game but sadly my expectations were not met. This could possibly be the dullest game I have ever played. The xp system and the overpowered players that you IMMEADIATELY start out against make this game a grind. If games require you to grind for hours just to learn the mechanics(I found no tutorial in game) then the experience has no real memory or enjoyment.

I admit grinding blueprints by making a house next to a landmark and waiting for the barrels and everything to respawn was kind of boring but its better than just chopping down trees and then after a awhile realising ooohh i can make C4 now!Also i would like the mention clans in this game they need to be nerfed becuase a team of 4 5 people all with guns is unstoppable. its fun for them but for the solo players of the game its not and they end up quitting then putting bad reviews on the game like ""too hard"" or ""clans too op"" and then becuase all the solo players quit the clans get bored becuase they have nobody to kill so they quit untill the game runs out of players and its just a memory.DEVS YOU NEED TO NERF CLANS AND BUFF SOLO PLAYERS SO WE HAVE A CHANCE!!",Rust

2015-12-24,0,0,1165,True,Recommended,Update number 3 So I have once again been playing the game. My biggest gripe with the game before was that there were soooo many hackers. I haven't seen a definitive hacker in probably 5 months now so I am changing my review back to recommend.The devs have done an excellent job of trying to counter hacking. Not only that but more and more server admins are actively hunting hackers because they realize people won't stay on their servers if there are known hackers.Weekly updates keep the game fresh. Will the game ever go into release? Of course not. But no reason to honestly. As far as stuff to do in this game there is no other comparison. The game has an extremely steep learning curve so it isn't for the faint of heart. But it is very fun now that hacking is at least bearable. So for now thumbs up.Update after 100+ hours of play I am now changing my review to no recommendation. My friends and I just had our base hacked after 30+ man hours of farming and work. I'm recommending to all my friends that they get a refund. Do not buy this game until they fix the hacker problem. People spawn in with 500+ c4 people speed hacking people jump hacking. I can't recommend a game that requires this much time investment to lose it to some kid with a program. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.(* You can ignore all the t below. It is all trumped by hacking children.*)Posting this now that I have the same amount of time played on Rust as I do on DayZ (7 hours).I compare the two because they are similar in their survival aspects although totally different in many regards.Pros for Rust 1) Unlike DayZ the devs have made what appear to be constant improvements. I have friends that have played both at start up and where as DayZ was better 2 years ago than it is now Rust is not. Rust devs continue to add new content and make improvements.2) Lots of stuff to do. For me there was no progression in DayZ. You spawn you find stuff you shoot people and die. With Rust there is base building blueprint gathering resources there is always something you should be doing.3) Stability. Compared to DayZ Rust is a triple A game. I have only had a few moments where my lag spiked. I haven't fallen through any floors (yet). I haven't dropped 2 feet from a set of stairs and broken my legs (DayZ). Cons 1) Sometimes the animals bug out.Pretty fun game. Do not waste your money on DayZ like I did when you can play this game which is cheaper and 1000% better.,Rust

2016-08-03,0,0,758,True,Recommended,Awesome game! The first thing i have to say is you spend a pretty decent amount of time learning the game. The second thing is is if you play on an active server (active meaning multiple people playing often) then you have to have alot of time to play or you won't be able to succeed. But this is a great game if you have the time. I also recomend bringing a friend or two. The more friends you have the easier it is to get somewhere on a populated/Active server.

2014-01-25,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,"Its in Alpha. So this is just a ""For now"" review as of 25 January 2014. Rust is exactly the same as what DayZ plans to be but comes from a different initial development focus (world modification vs equipment variety). Both will be like minecraft but gritty. In Rust you punch trees with a rock to collect wood punch rocks with a rock to get... rocks and punch animals to get chicken and cloth (irrespective of animal species). Now all of this seems like a mechanical foundation that will prove successful (just like Minecraft) except the variety and complexity of different types of material and building options just arent there yet. Give it time so that you have to manage all the different types of meat and raw building materials and it will probably be more fun. Plus hopefully give some variety to the utter sameness of the huts and area. (Build a hut add a door walk 200 meters spin in a circle for 30 seconds and I dare you to find your hut again amongst all the exact clones)The server wide chat mechanic is very strange in the environment leading to a lot of ""Player884 is a haxor cheat"" and ""Aww Player820 why did you kill me?"" stuff. This really breaks the immersion since part of the survival excitement is not knowing why people do what they do unless you actually communicate (before shooting or getting shot). It also removes the feeling of isolation that I would expect (although the map is so small the feeling may never really exist). The location based voice chat works well. I would love to see the server wide chat filtered on location so my comments are only visible to people who would be able to hear me speak over voice. Not that I dont like knowing that ""Player724 is KOS"" since I wont be able to see his name tag until after he is close enough to shoot me. KOS is apparently shorthand for Kill On Sight meaning either they will shoot you or everyone thinks you should shoot them. I do appreciate the minecraft style hyper day night cycle that takes 10 15 minutes per. Unlike minecraft the world is not made up of resources. Instead resources (boulders log piles and animals) spawn randomly. Morning is the prime time to collect since people cant see to gather during the dark cycle. But of course it is harder to see the zombie or bear and avoid a confrontation. If day was actually 8 hours you would only find resources once a day and leave a lot of people naked wielding stones. All of your progress (if you have any) is tied to the server you play on. But as far as I have seen servers show up for a day then wink out to be replaced by other servers. So for all my time playing I have rarely benefitted from my previous play sessions. But I am pretty efficient at getting the basics accomplished now. Again this is most likely an affect of early access status and I would expect it to settle down on a feature complete release.I think this game is a good one to watch over the next year or so. It has gobs of potential if it can continue to expand it's already working set of functionality.*** UPDATE Same Day ***After you die you can still hear the audio of anyone near you when you died. I found this incredibly frustrating. Not only is it a poor simulation (dead people don't hear) but this person whom I could hear (but I could not communicate with) absolutely loathed me. He was convinced I had done some horrible things to him and he took the time to exult in his achievement. This 10 second exchange was absolutely chilling for me. I don't mind so much getting killed senselessly but the mean hearted personally targeted feeling of it stuck with me.",Rust
2014-01-25,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Great game like a mature version version of MineCraft with killing involved.Main issues are the lag I'm experiencing on some servers as well as the amount of computational power required to play the game smoothly.,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,61,True,Not Recommended,Its a good game but almost everywere you have people that dont care and shoot you on sight and a lot of servers are bad for lag or the ones that arn't have admins that either troll you or have hackers or hacking admins that kill you before you can start or you get raided and lose everything and have to start over so I wouldn't play this game untill they add something usefull that can balance this game.,Rust
2016-04-25,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,If you buy this game thinking you will jump in learn the game and craft some things and progress........WRONG!!!!If you live longer then 30 mins you are doing awesome. Player interaction see another player RUN!!!Player see you Your dead. Even if you do get a mini base built it won't last as others will blow it up.I understand for the most part its PVP. But their are limits to everything. Much like other PVP style games of this genre. they burn out and don't encourage new players to join as progression is very limited. 2/10 Why so low game performance is bad if in a server with lots of bases or players. Also other player behaviour.,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,77,True,Not Recommended,I tried out this game based on the many positive reviews. Now I understand that most of the people giving this game positive reviews must be trolls because this game is a griefer's paradise. It consists of said individuals/clans spending all their time seeking out new players to murder. Mind you not because they need the loot but because there is literally nothing else to do in this game once you have established yourself except grief people. The non PVP servers are so broken with numerous ways to grief/kill people it is absurd. You can be killed while you are logged out. You can be trapped in a box while you are harvesting resources. Your entire house can be destroyed by c4 with no way to prevent it. The PVP servers are worse like the cournocopia in hunger games guys with shotguns and rifles running around looking for new players to kill. The fact that the developers considered this game worth $20 in the present state is rediculous.,Rust

2014-02-27,0,0,168,True,Recommended,Just buy this game right now. stop reading this review and buy the game.guess it would help to tell you why you should buy the game.as you can see I have 138.7 hours in this game witch I admit is a little creazy for playtime into any game.However if you asked me if the game was worth 138.7 hours of my life I would tell you some storys. I would tell you about the time some guy locked me in a room with steal doors with no way out. I would tell you about the time I had to fend off six full kevlar raiders with just one gun while my friend snuck up with a bolt action. alowing us to take them all out with just a little luck and alot of last second decisions. I would tell you about the time I had an odd feeling that I should take a shotgun for an item raid on a town my friend and I were about to do. only for that feeling to save us both when some guy killed my friend then started to loot him. allowing me to take him out by jumping out from around a corner shotgun in hand. or the time when I was being attacked by a guy in full kev while I had nothing but a shotgun. only for me to run behind some rocks and wait for him to get close alwaying me to jump over his head and land a perfect one shot kill to the head.but I will warn you. if you hate to tell storys about the epic loot you find do NOT buy this game.if you hate beating people who are better armed than you with skill and forsight do NOT buy this game and most of If you don't like to have fun either alone or with friends do NOT buy this game.,Rust

If you are prepared and ready to not cry everytime you have to start over cause you were too trusting or just wasn't good enough to defend you basse then this game can have hours put into it. I just started trying to play the game a bit more seriously over the past few weeks and I have to say that it's probably one of the most emotional games I've played in a sense that everything you do matters and it can be lost very easily but there is never a chance you won't get it back. Go into the game with the mindset that you will be killed thousands of times over again and unlike Harambe you won't come back.,Rust

2017-05-28,0,0,481,True,Recommended,First thing I want to say is your going to meet a lot of $$holes but as they say thats Rust.The game has gone through many many changes in the time that I've been playing and as it currently stands its a pretty good FPS game....... I mean co op resource gathering and building game where you get shot at by people who just want your stuff more than you do. Its not murder when they want it more than you do right?Playing solo I would highly suggest a low pop server you will find it easier to build and learn the ways of the game. I usually play with a few friends. I also frequent a battlefeild server with resource gathering bonus which can be fun for a change up plus you start with all the nice tools such as an AK 47.Hackers I've found to be infrequent but I have come across them from time to time. Don't lose your cool over it they come and go. I'm a terrible shot anyway so its a spray and pray game for me most of the time. Get it play it join the fun and build your base smart.,Rust

Im huge fan of mmo games so rust was perfect for me cause there was no level grinding before you are in the game now grinding levels is all you do there is wipes usualy either every second week or once a month and thats the problem if you ain't one of the types that sit by pc 10 hours a day then by the time you get decent level in game your stats and map gets wiped and guess what you grind againGRIIIIIIINDsorry but at this point game has gone boring there is updates every week which is nice but unless they do something with xp system this game is not worth itMAKE RUST GREAT AGAIN!!!,Rust

2016-09-27,0,0,169,True,Recommended,I absolutely love this game. I don't mind the XP system at all and I can see why they implemented it. If your wanting to gain a lot of XP simply run around and pick up tree trunks and stone off the ground. The only negative side of Rust is 99% of all players kill on sight no questions. I think this is a big problem for new comers trying to learn the game. It makes it very difficult to get settled when someone sneaks up behind you and shoots you in the head while your still running around naked. I heard in earlier versions nakeds were running up to fully geared players and pulling out a weapon and killing them basically griefing other players and that cause the issue today. Regardless this is a great game and is well worth the money!,Rust

Community in the game does not exist unless you have ppl you know and you will be ignored on chat on official servers...the reason is that you can ruin someone elses game rather easy by just changing a lock code or putting up a door and simple lock/ boobitraping.There are still some exploits left in the game that allow players to build next to your building even though you have a cabinet...dunno whats that about if its just a bug or a cheat but it kinda ruins the relative safe zone you could have had.I hit no i would not recommend solely because if your playing alone you will get frustrated rather fast and it will ruin the game for you and this game deserves to be played.hopefully they will tweak the mechanics and level out the playing field for clans vs sg players... untill then i will not play the game.,Rust

The recommended specs you should have is a bit too much. The reason im saying his is that many people doesnt have that and many people want to play it in a ok graphic settings.

2016-09-10,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This is a pretty good game its hard to run it on a laptop though but still it is a good game just a few things can you make it where it is less laggy for people on the PC? and can you make it where if you dehydrate or starve that it instantly kills you? because I went on a empty server and I dehydrated &amp had to listen to the screams the pain no one there to help but thats not the reason the real reason is that it doesn't make since that you still have energy to be on the floor screaming,Rust
2016-09-10,0,0,395,True,Recommended,Rust. It is in early access. So anything I say may be changed next thursday. So this won't be a pros vs cons. Rust is an early access survival FPS. There is no single player unless you like playing on empty servers. The game is constantly changing. The devs are amazing they listen to the communityfor the most part. There are bugs and yea. You WILL die. But hey thats Rust for ya. It is a grind. And sometimes it won't pay off. So as the game is changing many things are being added changed removed ect. So if you want to play a Hardcore better looking multiplayer only Minecraft WITH GUNS! Then this is a game fo you!,Rust

2016-12-07,0,0,45,True,Recommended,I've played for a few hours and from what I've seen it's pretty enjoyable. It definately satisifies those enjoying a good crafting game. Don't let the immediate ganking make you turn away. It's apart of the game and helps fuel the survival mentality. Looking forward to future development. My only negative comment originates from the community on the few servers I've experienced. Again nothing with the game itself just the population. It's been a while since I've been in a public gaming environment. I see racial slurs deragatory comments and failed attempts to be funny/shocking because they know how to type 'n****r' in chat still lives on strong. Yes welcome back to the Internet I understand. I will defend the right for freedom of speech as long as you defend the right to leave those servers and say 'F you' to those people.,Rust
2016-12-07,0,0,269,True,Recommended,I have had this game ever since it was released because I know it has great potential. The game itself is great aside for the huge problem in optimization (if you have a low end PC gl playing this game). There is so much that you could do in this game if it wasn't for one of the worst communities of all time. If you have no friends going into this game good luck making them because it may take you 5 hours to find one. And after you find that friend they will probably backstab you and take your base. Luckily for me I have a lot of friends who play this game so I have someone to base with at all times. This game highly rewards you for having friends before you click connect to a server so that you will not die 100 times in your first 10 minutes of gameplay. If you plan on buying this game make sure you have friends to play with or you will most likely not enjoy it. There are a million possibilities that you could do in this game if you didn't get killed the moment you spawned in. The game itself is a 8/10 but if you factor in the community I would rate this game a 4/10 for the simple fact it is nearly impossible to have fun unless you have friends outside of the game. That being said good luck if you choose to buy Rust.,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,75,True,Recommended,"Rust is a game with a great foundation. It feels like a mix of DayZ (with much respect) and any FPS with more emphasis on player vs player vs zombie mentality. The part about this game that I enjoy is the ability to live overnight... by constructing smart and hidden basecamps you can store craft and sleep inside of a structure almost saving your progress. However all is not as it seems as you log out your bodly lifelessly falls asleep on the ground no matter where you are. If you are killed during this time you will have a choice to respawn at your camp (if you created one including a sleeping bag which is a respawn point) or at a random location. Good idea is to sleep inside a structure with a metal door with no lights on and be hidden or be raided and killed.Now this is all occuring in a map full of radiation filled towns also filled with zombies. Wildlife from pigs to large bears and crafting nodes which contain the base material for most all items in the game. Its very fun to play however it has its headaches as this is still an early version of the game. To be fair I will talk about them as well. There is no in game map no in game compass in game travel and location services is up to you. Google ""Rust game map"" for a generic map that you may be able to get your bearings with. There is no way to tell the name of a player that is outside of about 10 feet which in this game means you probably already died. While working together can happen and is very rewarding its very disturbing to not know who the guy next to you is or who that guy walking towards your fort is... Lastly is there needs to be some attention paid to the detail of the item management. No simple clicks or ""take all"" for any action each must be performed as a drag and drop as well as item creation bugs that occur when you have a full inventory.TL DRRust is fun. Its open PVP with Zombies and the ability to create guns and metal forts / towers. Its still early in its life but it has a great foundation and is honestly very fun to play at this stage. There are some issues with it but most should be expected at this stage as well. Worth my money would buy again. I can't wait to see where this goes!",Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,138,True,Not Recommended,"Game is garbage in it's current state and here is why.I build a shack it has a sleeping back a nice campfire and a storage crate. Inside my storage crate I have about 100 wood 7 cooked chicken breasts and even some cloth. I don't yet have any weapon apart from my rock but at least I have a nice starting point to build upon. So I quit the game for the night.The next day I log back in the game doesn't respawn me at my shack even though it probably should because of said sleeping back (respawn point). So I proceed to start whacking a tree thinking I had lost my nick little shack and gather some wood. I hear the distinct sound of my skull being cracked by a rock yet I keep farming the tree for wood. I die and a message on screen confirms that I was indeed being bludgeoned to death.Nice surprise I respawn at my shack I recognise the layout. I see my campfire my sleeping back and my storage crate. I open the crate and...it's empty. I check chat and people tell me I have been raided yet my shack is fully intact. So.... I go to exit the door and am greeted with ""The door is locked"".Some nice noclip wallhacker has stolen my humble abode and also left with all my hard earned starting materials. And now I am stuck inside unless I use a console command to suicide.And that is why I recommend you DON'T BUY THIS GAME in it's current state.

If there ever was a bigger piece of garbage this would be on top. While the gameplay seems very striking and the visuals (now updated) might seem gorgeous it lacks in community and gameplay. There is no room for expansion if you are just coming into this game. You are completely surrounded by # !holes who ruin this game for any new beginners. If you purchase this game no one is your friend. No one will help you and no one will provide you with supplies.

2014-01-29,0,0,57,True,Recommended,"It's night....footsteps outside.... ""who's there?"".... an axe hits your door. Paranoia sets in as the door will slowly but surely be busted before the sunrise. A rock is your ownly hope. This is the basic newb experience (for those able to establish shelter). Being an ALPHA state the game doesn't do well to explain many things right out the gate. So expect no tutorial at all. There's no explaination to food to what the rocks look like or to obtaining wood. This is stuff that newbs have to constantly ask in chat for assistance with. Some of the basic spawn points are broken in a sort of way. The ""broken"" ones would be those that set a player right in a RAD zone or right next to zombie/mutant areas. The other spawns in the middle of open fields roads and so forth aren't so bad.The game itself is not the game but the psychological thriller experienced by the players. Sociopaths run rampent with the ability to torment as many as they please. People try to band together distrust everyone try to befriend the unfriendly and so much more. It's crazy the kind of mind games that this game sets up throughout it's play time.In a most notable negative for the game right now there must be mention of how many guns there are and how easily they are obtained. After a short period of time it becomes just another standard FPS game instead of a true survivor game. Bows become almost useless to the rifle and P250. Crafting an axe is good only for gathering because it will be a 1 in a million chance of actually killing someone with half a brain and isn't away from keyboard.Overall the game is fun with friends but becomes a frustration without anyone to play with.

2014-03-08,0,0,511,True,Recommended,This game is still in alpha but I have put 300 hours in to the game. I gorram love it! I love everything about the game from gathering to crafting to raiding and lastly... killing people. Recomendations that are probably already in the works New Animals. Wolf and bears in two different colors is just now starting to get old. What about dogs snakes or crocadlies (sp)? For the non killer animals they could add racoons maybe a tree monkey cats or horses. Crafting... it needs a new UI but that is coming. Repairing Fine idea and since it is a survival game on a island im down with it however the current state it is in sucks balls. Lowers the rate for which an item decays. Then when you fix it let us fix it back to full health other wise you just toss the old out like we do now. Open up the map. The map is huge and when a server starting to fill up you need the space. C4 Make it a little harder to make or more expensive. I know way too many people with large chests full of them. I mean while have 10. lolThis may sound like i am nitpicking but i am just hope for new features as we head to beta. I love this game. Best use of $20 I have spent all year.

2014-03-08,0,0,197,True,Recommended,That game is great however there area a lot of basic things that need to be added.A way to find your way back to your house or bed/sleeping bag like a marker or something pointing to the direction. So you don't end up losing your house when you died and respawned far from it and having no idea how to get back to it.Perhaps also having a map. Blank at first and then fills up as you explore but only showing where your stuff is and not other people's. Else people constantly raiding you would make you lose interest in playing the game.,Rust

2016-08-28,0,0,804,True,Recommended,I've played Rust for a little over 2 years now and I'm loving it. Although I must say that the recent changes to early game weapons are making it harder for solo and casual players to survive against the onslought of clans. I'm hoping this will be rectified in the future.Some minor details that have been bothering me and that I think are easily corrected. Take for example the reload animations even though you've only shot one round with the bolt or pump action shotgun you have to cycle through the entire reload animation (inputting all bullets instead of just one).Overall I salute Facepunch for their freequent updates and great support of this early access game. This is the only early access game I keep going back to and finding it has changed a lot since my last visit. Great job guys keep it up!,Rust

Anyway the game is fun its a great sandbox you will never know what is going to happen when you start playing.In this kind of games is really important for you to feel immersed in the game and this game does it really good. Graphics are really good but as i said before it has a lot of FPS problems you really need a good PC. Sound is good its not the best outthere but its really good.

2014-01-30,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of potential but you should wait until the game is out of Alpha. This game cannot run on my Mac book pro but I assume that it runs better on a PC as of now. However I jumped the gun and bought this game the minute it came out. I wish I could say more about the game itself but it refuses to run on my Mac. I simply cannot get into any game. Sometime I will get four minutes of game play before the game crashes because I came into contact with another player. It is not a connection problem either. Do yourself a favor and wait it out.,Rust
2014-01-30,0,0,537,True,Recommended,Rust is like if Minecraft and Day Z had a baby but all of those babies were naked dudes with rocks. You take your rock to harvest rocks to make metal. You use metal to make guns ammo amour better tools and eventually after you've explored enough an impenetrable metal fortress.Once that happens you utilize your equipment to prevent everybody else from doing the same. Forming groups is the best way to not only stay alive but to find the gear rapidly enough so that you can survive raids from other bands of players who are doing the same on the 100 to 200 player servers.Rust is currently incomplete so there is no plot at all it is just survival in a harsh environment with your fellow man. That can be a mixed bag and due to the game being unfinished there are hackers abound.If you are willing to work through the perils of hackers and your fellow man Rust can be a fairly rewarding experience. The biggest problem with Rust is that the game is unfinished and the current price seems fairly steep to pay for a game that still has a long way to go. So in short Rust is a really good time waster but for those who do not have the patience to deal with others it may be a waste of time until the game is finished.,Rust

2014-03-08,0,0,591,True,Recommended,Game is online play only no single player. When you jump in the game as a new character (character saves on each server you play on) you have a rock a torch and a first aid kit to stop bleeding. Use the rock to hit a couple trees and boulders with found in random fields then craft yourself a Stone Hatchet which will increase the speed you can acquire resources by about 5x. Then get more wood and stone as you find them to make a bow then kill some animals to get food.If you're still alive by this point it would be good to make a tiny wooden shed somewhere out of sight because just about everyone who plays this game uses hacks to increase their speed jump height and autoaim. People kill you from across the map with sniper rifles while you have nothing for them to gain just because. Because this game is full of griefers.If you happened to make a wooden shed and a sleeping bag so you can respawn there and a wooden storage box to hold your extra things in for when you inevitably die hope that no one finds your shed because anyone can break your door down and steal your things. Also hope no one finds your body laying (sleeping) on the ground while you're not in the game because they can kill you then too and take all your things.While this game is very fun it's also very frustrating as well. It is in alpha state so keep that in mind however here's a list of a few things off the top of my head that absolutely need to be added/fixed/changed to make this a better playing experience (1) In game map. Currently there is no map and the game world is so large you can wander around for days getting killed hundreds of times and losing all your things repeatedly and never find your shed you once built ever again.*There are maps for this game however since you must alt tab out to a browser to use them they obviously dont show your location and are extremely difficult to even find where you are on them.(2) Better anti cheat system. This game is plagued by hackers and cheaters people who play the game just to grief other people it almost makes it unplayable.(3) Wolves chase you nearly indefinitely in this game and until you have a bow and arrow you're unable to kill them.(4) The resource requirements to build a home are too expensive making it impossible to make anything much more than just a shed when you get killed by cheaters every 15 minutes as soon as you start to get a decent amount of resources acquired.(5) Your body laying sleeping on the ground is a cool idea but it conflicts strongly with how easy it is for people to break into your home and take all of your things.Overall I would recommend this game but just keep the above mentioned things in mind. It's fun it has great potential but it is extremely frustrating at times.,Rust

Start out on a beach running around not sure if you're safe where you're at whether you're going to starve or die to another player or even get eaten by a bear.

2016-12-27,0,0,1941,True,Recommended,I think rust is a fantastic game but there's many downfalls of it such as the constant kos. I know rust is a PVP game but why do guys with guns kill guys without a stash? But I must admit the game seems to be going in the right direction. if you hate losing stuff you've worked hard for this isn't the game for you. My advice for new players to rust is too spend most of your first 100 hours on rust on battlefield servers and also low population vanilla servers. Try to watch YouTube videos for noobs and learn the basics of rust I Also would say try to find a buddy this game is really difficult on your own as groups and teams will gang up on you. Another good tip I have for you is too always read the devblogs because they usually have little things in that could help you ! If you need any other tips don't hesitate to add me on steam.,Rust

2016-09-01,0,0,1399,True,Recommended,"Rust. What an experience! I am late to the fray. August 2016 was the first time I landed naked on that bleak desolate beach with only a rock to defend myself. Over a period of 2 weeks I have been eaten by wolves and bears made the noob mistake to die with a stupid map on my body marking my home base with a big red X not thinking my murderer would discover it and come and kill me again and then assassinate me once more with a powerful weapon and a few well equiped clan mates yet again. My mistake. It happened right here in my sparse home right after I respawned naked in my presumingly safe and cozy sleeping bag. They burnt down my wooden door insulted me in voice chat (""Hello my friend"") as I feebly tried to repair my wooden door against the flamethrower incenerating the door and my inevitable doom followed shortly. To add insult to injury I heard them munch down on that apple I found in a barrel as I lie dying (I was saving it for my weekend feast...) But and its a big BUT. Human resilience is what this game is really about. Oh and I did get his name. Yes I did. He revealed himself in his obnoxious voice chat spewing. Gloating over my demise (a mere noob)... The moment is etched in my mind. Revenge shall be mine. My next base will be much more resilient. Planned to perfection in all its detail. As a solo player I will hide my main stash inside its walls decoy rooms. A raiding party shall leave it in ruins without discovering its true secrets. In silence I will wait for the right moment. Track him down. It's the same server and people are creatures of habit afterall... Same player. That bastard. I know his name. Now to find his whereabouts. Revenge will be mine. Toxic community? NOT AT ALL. This is Rust. Ashes to ashes dust to RUST. I will no I SHALL find him. I will crush his skull and savor the moment. The hunted shall become the hunter. *I cannot believe I haven't tried this game before now! What a gem! An unequivocal 2 thumbs up from me. If you like survival games and you're even slightly competitive... This should be on your list. Get it NOW! Not now NOW! The best survivalist FPS out there.",Rust

2016-09-01,0,0,680,True,Recommended,The new experience element of Rust has flattened the playing field a little. I find the 2 week map wipe with an additional 2 weeks for do wipe the most fun. It encourages you to play with friends or team up with strangers to build bigger and better bases,Rust
2017-03-31,0,0,134,True,Recommended,Its a great game you get stuff you build a house you raid people and then someone raids you. I mostly play on modded servers where you can get items faster but get raided faster to. If you have friends that likes similiar games you can buy this game together and team up. Its much easier to play together and ofcourse funnier. If you want to get a teammate you will proably find a lot of annoying and bad people but there is some nice people. Overall its a fun game that consumes alot of time. 9/10 Anime points,Rust
2015-11-05,0,0,815,True,Not Recommended,Let me start off by saying i have played rust forever! This game has come along way in some spots good others you wish they left alone and with the recent componet system im very upset with the game i can't even place a door down before i run around looking for a rad town that has a recycler in it. This game has really hit home for me many laughs and anger has been through the hours that i have played friendships created and strengthend by this game. I have always loved rust but at the end of the day it isnt the same as it use to be. Many say this game is still survival but reminds me more of a shooter then a survival game. It has taken a toll on the way i feel towards it as its a looting type game much rather then a gather/survival game. I WOULD NOT purchase this game in its current state as it is failing to follow what the tags say. Rust is a good game but not the way it use to be.,Rust

2016-07-02,0,0,235,True,Not Recommended,This game has one major problem that not only me but everybody I play with all experince. The game runs smoothly (once you've applied optimal settings) right until you get into combat. As soon as you fight any other player the game trips up completely resulting in horrifically clumsy battles where the winner turns out to just be the luckiest the one who strikes when the game manages to not implode and both when I win or lose a fight I never feel satisfied. A loss feels unfair since it was hardly your fault and a victory feels empty and undeserved because you ended up just flailing your spear about until it finally catches opponent stood still for two seconds while the game contemplates why Gary thought not letting people create their own characters was a good idea.This'll probably be fixed though so like Gary advises I'll just stop playing until there's improvements.,Rust

2017-02-16,0,0,122,True,Not Recommended,TL DR &gt Very bad optimized don't buy if you don't have at least 16GB of RAM and a SSD or else it will take 5 minutes to load a server then crash each 10 minutes due to out of memory. And if you buy expect to be raided everyday unless you play 24/7.Pros Good gathering/crafting/building system Variety of weapons (melee ranged traps) Maps are generated randomlyCons ABSURDLY bad optimization. Says minimum system req is 8GB RAM but at 8GB with only Rust+Steam running the game frequently crashes due to out of memory even with everything in ultra low quality. If you don't have at least 16GB of RAM don't even think of buying this game. Also loading the game takes at least 2 minutes and joining a server another 5 minutes. Add a SSD to the shopping list along the RAM. You're on your own. Someone will raid your base while you sleep steal everything destroy your house kill you and you'll respawn miles away having to restart all over again. Even heavily fortifying your base won't stop this because there will be always someone with plenty of explosives to blow up every single wall in your base. Bad randomization spawns. Sometimes you'll find lot of crates/stones/animals but in most of the cases you'll wander half an hour without finding a single necessary resource. Weak PvE. Only enemies you have are bears and wolves. Food/Water aren't a matter at all because in a single animal/resource cache you have enough food to last a few days.,Rust

2017-04-12,0,0,706,True,Recommended,In my opinion Rust is a reall good game the people that put negative comments and hate on this game only solo and never get into the real gameplay of rust Rust is about teamwork and trust if you dont have either of the two rust isn't the game for you so go play minecraft or something. Rust is mostly composed of trial and error when you dont succeed the first time then try again dont just throw a temper tantrum and cry like a lil B***h get your A** right back up in there and try again till you win. If you do play this game i recomend having Discord Skype or Team Speak becuase if you do get into teaming your prob going to need a better way of communication then jsut steam chat. If i were you i would recomend getting this game and if you dont like it you can always return it Jsut give it a chance. R.I.P. Rust Player Have Fun D.,Rust

2017-04-12,0,0,278,True,Recommended,I would recommend it slightly more than not. Just because it is an amazingly fun game. The base building was fun but its been nerfed is so many negative ways its just okay now since raiding is easier. The servers wipe wayyyy to soon. It takes about 1 2 days on a server to build a good base but 1 2 weeks based on server before a wipe. On vanilla servers it takes way to get started so suggest modded ones. Vanilla lasts about 4 weeks but it takes about 5 7 days to build a good base.If you find the right modded lobby and the start after a wipe and have a few friends play at peek times during a very active server. There can be some very amazing times. This game has made some of the best memories to date I played on a video game. This is 1 of maybe 20 game titles I ever played that I can say that about.,Rust

2017-01-29,0,0,628,True,Recommended,"Rust what to say about it... It's an interesting game to say the least. in all honestly we've only scratched the surface of Rust. Why you ask? Cause it's still being refined molded and shaped into the best game it can possibly be. And hopefully at the end of it all I will still enjoy it as I do now HELL I hope I will enjoy it even more so! However even with that there are a few things that I'd like to point out which could be better.Positive 1 Rust is ever changing ever evolving. There is always something new to discover.2 The Developers listen to the players and include some player ideas into the game fix the bugs we find pretty quick and are usually really good at surprising us with newer and better things to discover and create(Ways to kill each other and survive!)3 This game unlike so many out there gives you the ability to make and host your own server for free! As long as you have a powerful computer/server rack and are willing to keep it online 24/7 of course.4 With all the different ways you can mod Rust it's amazing to see what people can build and how fast they can build what they do! I love playing on modded servers when I just want to chill and play less seriously or play solo and have a fighting chance cause it's been a while and I need to get up to speed and quick.Negitive 1 The Developers need to focus more on optimizing game preformance instead of adding so many more iteams and sounds to the game. I know they did a little bit of optimization but the game has been getting a bit laggy and it's taking a bit longer to load into any server now. I have a very powerful gaming computer that I hand built with custom parts Hell I even upgraded it just so I could play RUST better. But with all of the updates I am now starting to have problems with RUST again! Come on Devs get your act together!2 You don't need much to get started in this game. Except luck and to stumble across someone that's not paying attention to their surrondings. or a complete noob. It does not take long before you can start raiding and destroying someone's base who has been working on it for weeks. Especially on a modded server. Why is this a negitive you ask? well that means someone who is a griefer can hop onto the server kill a couple of people and grab their stuff then raid you in a hour or two while your offline all in a few hours. And all your hard work over the last 2 3 weeks is gone in less then 1 day.3 This game can bring the worst of the worst crowds and bring out the beast in all of us. You will learn fast that some people and servers just don't give a fling F about you and what others are doing to you. Granted some servers are ""Noob"" friendly and if your are new player I would recommend you to one of those servers. If someone is being ""Toxic"" I'd report them to an admin and leave well enough alone. If the admin(s) could care less just log off of that server and join another one. It's not worth the effort of trying to find an admin who cares enough and don't give them the satisfaction of staying and becoming their prey. Quit while you can and be the bigger person. While you're at it report them to FacePunch. At that point that server should not be up if they encourage Cyber Bulling. I've run into that problem before and it's not a pretty site.",Rust

2016-11-08,0,0,163,True,Not Recommended,You will die a lot to bears biting the air in front of you. Animals have no clip so they can walk through rocks. This is after years and years of development. You can't sneak up on animals by crouching like in every other game ever. You will put many hours into a server only to be unable to find it again the next time you launch.The community isn't great but that's due to the nature of the game. It can take a long time to make the cool but a quiet bear/ a 12 year old with a bone club and better ping can take hours of work away in a second. You need to be stupidly cautious. Every seasoned player is a wounded animal they're likely to kill you on sight because it's how they've learned to survive. They've been betrayed. Trusting your fellow players is taking a huge risk and they know that.The game looks good. I wish the developers would take steps to show that they value my time instead of working the aesthetics over again. I've built two bases this week on two different servers and have been unable to return to either of them. 7 hours of my time. Gone through no fault of my own. This has been a problem for years. Every patch breaks the entire game. Every server needs to be restarted with the latest update before you can even see them. And when they've been restarted they'll probably be wiped so it's possible that nothing you did will still be there if they reappear. Also the server list loads incredibly slowly if it loads at all. You can stare at an empty screen forever without seeing anything.This game is really upsetting. It's truly fun to play every once in a while but I'm punished as soon as you try to play the same server two days in a row. I feel like I'm accomplishing something when I grind up to better equipment and weapons through hours of smelting and crafting. But those hours are not valued by these developers and it shows. Maybe in ten years I'll be able to do something as simple as rejoining a server. Maybe in twenty the animals will path around the rocks so hunting won't break my immersion. Maybe in fifty the game will be out of alpha. We can hope but it looks pretty grim for now.,Rust
2016-11-08,0,0,130,True,Not Recommended,It takes quite a while to start with other people and when you feel like you have just gotten enough stuff to start a base you get jumped by 5 people with guns. The only way this could be played with even challenge is to wait for a server to get wiped and join it the minute after. Not to mention when someone kills you they make sure they talk you until you want to punch a hole through your wall.,Rust
2016-11-08,0,0,181,True,Not Recommended,Fist of let me say this is NOT a bad game its just that some people like myself do not want to put hours upon hours of playing just to see all your work gone the next day. have had many great times in this game but I cannot keep putting so many hours into this game it just seems like a cycle of build a base get resources go to sleep then wake up the next day to see that your base has been raided and hours of resource gathering is gone I don't want to keep continuing wasting hours if not DAYS playing this game I don't have that kind of time to play anymore. It's a good game and I will always love it but I don't want to keep losing sleep over a video game.,Rust

2016-07-23,0,0,989,True,Recommended,NEW REVIEW Rust devs are hands down the best developers I've ever seen. They listen to community(reddit) now and as a result they've launched a component system now. I've never seen a company that cares about their players so I'm changing my review to positive. Of course they wouldn't have learned their lesson if we hadn't sabotaged the review like this. But now they've learnt their lesson and I doubt they'll undervalue their player base ever again. OLD REVIEW I used to love this game. The developers work hard for sure but they don't listen to the community. Sure they do make user suggested changes from time to time but for huge ultimate changes they say it's their(developers) game not the players. They make it in the way that only they want even if the whole community is unhappy.There's so much that could make this game better but they just don't listen.XP update seems to be the last nail that needed to secure the coffin.,Rust

2016-11-12,0,0,818,True,Recommended,Rust is a brilliant sandbox game which is never going to stop being developed. That's the core of why I am still playing this game. After you have bought the game that is the only payment you will ever make to Rust unless you want skins etc. The developers comes with patches and updates regulary and major updates every thursdag. As this day I have been through legacy blueprints XP and the current component system and I do really like how the whole gaming experience is changing.Peace out,Rust

I'm hopeful that they can fix what XP ruined and I'm looking forward to a more controlled and balanced way to play this amazing game.

2016-09-28,0,0,578,True,Recommended,Before we get into all the pros and cons about rust. The dev team working on this game is hands down the best. They do more than all triple A titles when it comes to comunication with the crazed nakeds we all once were. Cons Large ClansAnimal UI isnt amazing the animals can still run through rocks and other objects.Gave me trust issuesPros The game looks overall amazingDevs dedicated beyond beliefUpdates are very frequient Over all This game could sell for 40$.The amount of time and dedication the devs have for rust is just mind blowing. Ive had this game since launch and have not left the game yet. Ive put thousands of hours ofline on this game.,Rust
2016-09-28,0,0,5,True,Recommended,To be honest most of my experience with this game has been wandering naked through the forest hitting things with other hard things (a lot) being approached by the weirdest people ever and being killed repeatedly by people who have been playing on the server longer than I had. It's a pretty fun game still glitchy in Alpha but brutal in concept. It's a frustrating play as a solo player a lot of mindless chopping only to get killed by someone who can tear through your primitive building with advanced tools or being repeatedly killed in ways you are hopeless to defend against at first. I imagine this would be perfect as co op game but bring your own friends because most of the current residents are either wackos or mindlessly homicidal.,Rust

2016-04-23,0,0,972,True,Recommended,Game is still sorta fun but it has become a shooter more than survival the community is the most cancerous i've ever seen. It's about 8 in 10 people will kill you on sight even when you're fresh spawn. Modded servers are fun though,Rust
2016-11-11,0,0,90,True,Recommended,good game could be better easy hunting lots of glitches time consuming addictive good investment if bought in alpha stage for $20 no missions wide diversity in servers endless multiplayer fun best game for teams and groups solo play not recomended .,Rust
2017-04-02,0,0,54,True,Recommended,Constant updates are great devs are working on fixing hacking problems so I hear. I do wish that guns and heavy gear was more difficult to get and it stayed a caveman fighting style longer but whatever. Definitely worth a shot for the price though it's definitely a game that can you off if you aren't good at losing gracefully.,Rust
2016-11-11,0,0,174,True,Recommended,While this is a fairly decent game there are still HUGE issues...... you'll still have fun nonthelessthe most glaring issue to me at the minute is animals can run through rocks and water making escape almost impossible if you have a bear or wolves chasing you downother than that its a fairly fun game could use a bit more optimisation but other than that hours of funvery similar to ark without the dinosaurs,Rust
2016-11-11,0,0,655,True,Recommended,Really amazing game in the aspects of uncertainty and almost anything can happen. Will leave you and your friends at the edge of your seats while trying to not only build and PVP amd survive in general.,Rust

2016-09-30,0,0,1373,True,Recommended,Rust is the best game when it comes to Hanging out with friends. Wants to play open world game. Want to kill someone. Want to craft items. Want to build a big base (or small).There is way more other things you can do but these was just some few examples. This game is not meant for people that can get really easily butthurt because the main reason people play this game is to someone off. (Especially me)Pros and Cons of Rust Pros Devs still working on the game. You can if you are lucky get noticed by the devs if there is anything you want to speak out to get something changed in the game. Pure nude fighting on beach. Crafting is fantastic. Leveling Cons Fighting mechanics a little bit ed... Devs could maybe stop making new weapons and focus on the weapons that dont work 100% right. Salty people Weird people Ultra people Everyone in Rust has a dark hidden secret that can end up in disaster if you let them be your friend and live with you.And yeah... Thats it i guess... That is my opinion of the game.If i would rate the game of how early the game is. Then i would rate it ( ) 8.98/10.00 ( ),Rust

2016-11-17,0,0,107,True,Recommended,my first experience with Rust was pretty rough. I mean before I had a clan and was just starting off as a solo player I had to pretty much do everything on my own. I had to harvest wood and stone on my own build my own 1x1 base craft my own materials. What made it specifically difficult was the fact that everytime I would spawn and try to harvest wood and stone the noise I made as I banged away at a tree or a huge rock just attracted other players who would then crossbow me in the back of the head no questions asked. So those 15 30 minutes or so of farming materials literally goes to waste.So one day I'm farming for stone right and then out of nowhere this dude crossbows me and I drop to the floor. I wasn't completely dead just on the ground screaming in pain so I talk to the guy who shot me. I was like Dude why did you do that can't you see I'm just naked and all I got is this rock? Why would you just kill me out of nowhere? So the guy goes like my bad man. He then proceeds to heal me. So I'm back up to my feet with like 10 health. The guy gives me a couple of candy bars and a can of beans. I'm back up to decent health. Then me and this guy start to talk apparently he's just a solo player too.We spend some time farming together then we go and build our own little 3x3 base. Built a box to keep our materials and items in. Built some sleeping bags so we could spawn inside the base and then built a code lock to keep the door secured so that only me and him could go inside. After that it got pretty late and we both had to go to sleep.Next morning I wake up logon to Rust and spawn.......my sleeping bag is in a totally new area that I don't know and the base we had spent 5 hours making the other night was nowhere to be seen. Don't even know what happened. My guess is this guy who I thought was my new friend just used me to help him make a base. All the items we worked so hard in procuring and crafting and harvesting he takes for himself. Turns out he never really wanted to share.If we ever go into a post apocalypse in real life Rust has taught me valuable lessons in survival. Trust no one.,Rust

2016-11-17,0,0,219,True,Recommended,I like the concept I of the game but I found it very frustrating when playing on a public server. When you start with nothing you are an easy kill so expect to die a lot. Seems that some people just think its fun to kill you even though you have nothing. When you finally get setup chances are you will be raided and have everything stolen / destroyed unless you join a large clan. If you can get a group of friends together and play on a private server it s much more fun.,Rust

2016-09-28,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Can be a harsh game to understand and play you will get frustrated dying is easy whether it be a bear wolf or other players. However this new version of rust looks good and is great fun playing with others and building your own base. Probably the best survival game.,Rust
2016-09-29,0,0,1111,True,Recommended,On the outside Rust seems to be a multiplayer survival game in early access. On the inside it's a hardcore competitve environment where tough love is the only kind of love you'll find. You learn everything the hard way did you put your wall the wrong way? Well then you'll be raided and you can start back over. When you've done a mistake once in Rust you'll never do it again. If you're a cry baby stay away this game will only be your torment.If you ever get fair enough into Rust you'll start realising the community is actually very strong. People love this game and they really care about it. But the developers are the real MVPs here. They work day in and day out to slowly make the best survival game in history. This game has been in early access for so long it's mutiated times and times again and only come out stronger on the other side. New updates every week slow but steady progress towards perfection is what makes this game the hidden gem of steam.At last I must warn. This game is not optimized and even though I rock a GTX 1080 I still find my FPS down to 20 at times. But be sure to note this game is always playable and never truly broken. It's always on it's way.,Rust

2014-02-04,0,0,151,True,Recommended,I had high expectations for Garry Newman when Rust came out and I've got to say it certainly has plenty of potential. From the moment you start it has a definite minecraft feel. However there is a sense of uneasiness in the air...almost like other players are watching your every move waiting to strike...There are freindly servers out there for those of the faint of heart. Other than that the game offers no forgiveness. You don't want to mess around so get your rock and hit some trees with me because I plan to be with this game as it evolves every step of the way! This is a game worth your money and even though it is heavily in beta it is still a joy to play.,Rust

2016-10-06,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Well The grind in this game is very steep but with little reward. The goal of simply surviving is ambiguous and bound to get boring there defintely needs to be more content. I would'nt write it off but if you have noone to play it with don't then it really sucks. For the content it's not worth 19.99 or even 11.00 but it's in beta.,Rust

Their always keeping it interesting for both the new players and hardcore players.The game varies depending on the comunity of the server connected to you will get either really nice folkes or people who want you dead just for breathing in their general direction. This makes it especially fun when you take out someone who hates you. If you enjoy open world PVP games then this is definatly one to get even better with friends to help you conquer the world.,Rust

2014-02-04,0,0,415,True,Recommended,ORIGINAL REVIEW 2014Have you ever wanted to beat bears pigs humans cliffs grass shrubbery and zombies with a large rock? Well now you can! Gone are the days of your enemies hiding safely in their homes! NOW watch and amaze as you can sneak into their houses while they are away steal all their junk and make it impossible to navigate back into their own domain!In all seriousness this game is good BUT unfinished. Understand what early access means before you buy it but this game will be totally rocking by the end.UPDATED REVIEW 2017This game has come a LONG way. Heavily optimized since release a bevy of new features and many new items (some simply for decoration)! As of the most recent update the best weapons in your inventory or hotbar are featured on your characters hip or back so no more having someone pull an AK out of his to kill you.Overall the game is right on track and enjoyable to play.,Rust

2016-09-26,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,4/10 Difficult time consuming to build somthing that won't be detroyed and Servers are ruled by clans.Servers are ruled by clans so you would have to play until your house was strong enough for people not to get into. i play for 2 hours straight building a house and upgrading it then i go afk two 20 min. and my house was gone i was dead and my bedroll was destoryed. the game runs choppy probably do to my processer being trash and when i try to play the game i usally end up dying of starvation.if you want the game then get it but if you don't like it then stop playing and ask for a refund. Steam's refund policy is complete garbage so if you play over 2 hours of a game then you can't get a refund. so you would have to make a decision quick on if you like the game or not.i requested a refund but i played 3 hours of the game so i couldn't get a refund so i tried to play the game but time after time i kept dying.enough rambling back to the main focus the game is difficult to play and you find yourself dying again and again but the survival part of it is really good. I give a 4/10 it's difficult long process to have a house that won't be destroyed in 20 min. and food is barren. the game captured the survival aspect really good and made me think that i should stay away and run before it gets me.,Rust

2016-12-20,0,0,2226,True,Recommended,By far my favorite game started playing it when I was 12 and have played it ever since. It is a great game to play with your friends or even make we ones. I have met some great people on rust even though the community might be cancer some people are really cool and nice people some of which I talk to ever day. But the game itself is very very fun if you get killed or raided it truly is the worst feeling ever but in a day you can turn that around. It does need some fixes and still it is in alpha but the game is great and is improving fast. I suggest you buy this game because it can change your life like it did for mine!,Rust

2014-08-09,0,0,1279,True,Not Recommended,Hopping mad that I spent more than 99 cents on this game. Joined a pve server figured my items and such were safe. No such luck. If you die in the game you lose the tons of resources required to even begin to build something that will keep the looters out. I can see a pvp server being tougher and players looting your body but when it is Facepunch Studios that loot it that is just plain wrong. I guess the company name should have been the first clue. Won't endorse this game in any way shape or form. Infuriated I wasted my money!,Rust

I tried it with a bunch of friends and its quite fun but if you dare solo everyone and I mean everyone will shoot you on sight with no questions asked. Sure the game is about survival but other players make it impossible to play it alone on pvp servers.. unless you're some descendant of Bear Grylls.On the other hand if played on timed PvE servers it can be loads of fun and with more content coming soon I can only recommend this.,Rust

The nights are so scary that you can't see anything and I sometimes hide somewhere under the rocks and pray that I don't die by the morning. The crafting in game is also realistic. You have to find some parts and also have resources to craft things that are not possible by hand. If you are worried about cheaters in the game no worries. The game uses EasyAntiCheat (and also VAC) which works fairly well in my opinion and they get banned not very long after they enter a server. The game is also updated every single week with new things to play with which won't get you bored at all.However there are also some things that should be kept in mind. IF you are going to play the long run (if you are planning on playing in a server for a long time) you should play with a group of players that you can trust. You won't survive out there for even one day if you are playing by yourself.To sum up I think that Rust is a must for the people who likes to play with their friends and/or into survival games.,Rust

I have reached 15 000 ping on this game. I live in a rural area where you don't get good internet options and it's very hard to play games like this and my computer runs this game perfectly by itself. I can play other Multiplayer games like CS GO with 100 ping but this game is unplayable. I have gotten a few hours lucky with 100 ping on this game but that's it. All I am asking is a singleplayer option which is the only reason I do not like this game. I am still recommeding it because not everyone has bad internet like me. Thankyou and goodbye.,Rust

2017-04-01,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I did NOT enjoy Rust. I might change my review but I didn't enjoy it overall. I loaded up the game and joined a server. It took me 15+ minutes to finally load in. And then it was immediately dark. I had no time to do anything. I lit up my torch and it ran out in 2 minutes. I wandered around in the dark and found a tree. I got my rock out and started to hit it and then out of no where a bear comes up and then kills me. Which then sends me back into another 15+ minute loading screen. I gave it another shot and then after the loading screen I finally got in and then I couldn't wake up. I tried and tried and pressed all the buttons on my keyboard and then it just crashed. You might think that it was just my computer but my computer can handle the game. It's not the best but it isn't bad. It takes forever to load in and then you die instantly to a player or animal.It was not worth $20 rather worth $10.Edit I gave Rust one more chance because I saw a lot of potential and I finally got past all of the deaths and was able to play the game. It turns out that it was actually really cool and fun to play. When you are solo it makes it really challenging because you have no one on your back and you have to scavenge for food by yourself. And food scavenging is really difficult which makes it hard and realistic. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and it was fun.P.S. Try and find a server with 0 players. Makes it better and you die less.,Rust

2014-03-07,0,0,152,True,Recommended,I know this game is still in alfa for now but in my opinion its worth buying alredy.It's a quite realistic game it will probably get a bit more realistic in the future but it is a challenge.Ther's a lot of people with guns that want some easy loot so look out for them but if u make the first few nights u should be able to handle the game easierly.Its also a very nice experience if ya have some friends to play with as I said its a challange even to find your friends but when u find them the game gets very exiting.I'm playing with two friends as for now so its 3 of us and its much easier than going solo.It's also a unique multiplayer experience.I realy reccomend this game because its worth giving it a try.But remember.... when you die don't give up never make it a bigger challange!,Rust

2014-03-29,0,0,107,True,Recommended,This game is awesome! I love gattering ressources building stuff and looting villages and other places with my friends. Hunting is really cool. I'm playing on a server where pretty much everyone is friendly and we're not a lot of people which makes it more interesting in my opinion. I can progress whitout losing everything over and over again. I recommend this game since it's still in alpha and it's already amazingly addictive. I made a lot of new friends playing in this server and it's really hard to stop. Anyway if you like crafting houses weapons and a lot of stuff researching for goods and looting everything you can find in a giant map making friends (choose the server you feel the most comfortable in I'm not a big fan of getting raided and killed over and over again) well this game is for you! I can't wait to see how it will look in the future! I've seen in videos what it looked like at the beginning and it looks so good now! And I repeat myself but it's still in Alpha! For only 20$ (for now at least) it's a must. There's no zombies anymore it's wildlife against you. Some of them got irradiated and those can drop you some really interesting loot. Anyway I feel like I'll never get bored. This game is fantastic!,Rust

2017-09-09,0,0,355,True,Recommended,I spawned I was surrounded by 2 dudes wearing road signs for armor I was shot with a bow until I was bleeding out. They revived me so I ran away. This was obviously what they wanted as arrows then started to fly by my head. I was being used for target practice. I did not survive... Even so I like my server I understand these people. If its dark they just kill you because they don't know what yer packin during the day though I had a different guy visit my house and give me a buuuuuunch of stuff. It's hard to be mad or call someone a coward for killing a naked when that naked could pull a pipe shotty out from under his nutsack and one hit you. So my advice to new players is don't be a salty just be ready to die at any moment. Oh and... THEY ADDED SMALL STASHES!!!! You can now BURY items in the ground and come back to them later to dig them up! I've always been a fan of The Tuna Bandits (if you miss legacy Rust go watch their YT series) and how they lived out of hidden boxes among the rocks rather than build a base that's a target for raiders. Now that I can just bury my cool stuff out and about I'm using a hybrid system where I have a base for crafting that I just leave the door open for when I log off. I'm told the whipe for the server is on is every first Friday of the month so right now I'm mostly just learning the changes that have been made between now and Legacy. The dev's have been very active to say the least. There was a point when they switched from Legacy map to procedural maps when the maps felt really empty and boring but the locations and the loot are back and as such so is my interest. It's good to see Rust have the soul of Legacy again. I can't wait for this game to make it to console. If you want my opinion this game is better than Ark (cheaper too) for a lot of reasons but I'll list 2.Frist Rust has ing incredible sunrises and sunsets just check out the screenshot I took. Second Ark has baby dinos that you MUST lose sleep for if playing on official servers and you want a good imprint. Losing sleep makes me a very unpleasant person... and I cannot recommend a steady gaming experience of LOSING SLEEP to anyone.,Rust

2016-11-21,0,0,3928,True,Recommended,The new update for this game is incredible makes the world look really well detailed and almost real.If you love crafting and building/survival games then this is a must have game! I first tried playing this in its Beta state and it was good but not great had potential but nothing to shout about.A few years have passed and its since its release this game has just got better and better the devs really know how to keep you playing.The whole idea of getting gears and springs for things like hatchs metal doors and sniper rifles is really good too. They started with blueprints and you had to research and gain blueprints for more items but it was more gamble on what you got.The new way of having to find the parts is more realistic and can be harder to get all the high end items early on but not impossible.The world is very detailed and even the grass has been altered so it doesnt take as much computer resources as it used to.Its a highly addictive game with a lot of depth and a lot of things to do.I would recommend this game to anyone into survival post apocalyptic games.,Rust

I have to say the most fun I ever had on it was during the days of the blueprint system. The component system is much less exciting and brings down the entire game by eliminating the old satisfaction of finding and researching blueprints. Although Rust is still an alright game I find it difficult to play in its current state because it isn't as fun as it was.,Rust

2016-11-19,0,0,571,True,Not Recommended,Do not buy unless you have a group of people to play with. As you first start out you'll run around naked and no gear trying to scavaging until you can build a small hut if you're lucky enough but normally you'll be killed on sight by random people without you being a direct threat. When you manage to build a base more than likely the next day you login it'll be broken into and raided by larger groups of people. the other thing is the serves always wipe bi weekly which means everything you've scavanged and the base you build is no longer there you have to completely start over every 14 days of playing. If you do buy just play for fun and only scavenge what you need no more and no less because like i said you can stay up 8 hours straigh and harvest supplies like a mad man and the next time you log on you'll see a message saying *You've been killed by JohnnyLongD12234 and when you respawn back into your home everything will be gone.

2017-04-15,0,0,1356,True,Recommended,At first this so called survival game based on the trailer gave me the impression the goal was to survive a post apocalyptic world by means as an individual together with others in this virtual world. Playing the official servers however I found out it was more the apocalyptic itself and for some reason the other players enjoyed the killing and raiding other players instead. I didn t survive 10 seconds as the newbie!However beside the many very unfriendly worlds you encounter on the official servers fortunately there are also many and I may say thousands of individual and community servers where you can play the game as you would see fit. So no matter if you like to play Mortal combat or Robinson Crusoe this game platform offers it all. Logically I would advise you to start in one of these friendly servers to get familiar with the game and all its features so you might stand a chance in the official servers later if this is your desire or you can just enjoy the great diversity of worlds all the other servers have to offer.The virtual world you are released in is well designed has beautiful high resolution and detail although the previous release also had a lot of bugs. Then again it is still being developed.Just recently this month April 2017 the developers have absolutely outdone themselves and made great improvements to it. Another great feature of Rust is that you are able to play it in windowed mode and are also capable of changing the resolution settings depending on your network speed.All together A great game absolute beautiful worlds and graphics and lots of diversity for different play styles.,Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,388,True,Recommended,Very addictive game o From 1st spawn to server wipes and having to restart all over again (yes there will be server wipes as its only in alpha and major updates do happen)But from experiance I much prefer to gather up as much as I can then start over cause it gets a bit dull when you have more stuff than you know what to do with PIt's really a game to play with friends cause trust on rust is a bit sketchy PBuilding bases and hoping you have done enough to make it harder to raid and then raiding other people only to be filled with excitment from the amount of stuff you can loot from them or being in someones base when they happen to log in (might scare you at first but its what makes raiding in this game fun).This is definatly a must play game solo for harder experiance and with friends for a more chilled experiance DI do warn you though this game is addictive &gt .&gt,Rust
2014-03-30,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I would recommend this if you are willing to wait for updates. The multiplayer servers need upgrading and general lagginess is a problem. the fact that you can't find your friends easily on a server really is a downside but all in all it is a very fun game.,Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,45,True,Recommended,"Solid game that shows an enormous amount of potential. That said the game is in serious need of some rebalancing. Guns and explosives are far too common and it's much too easy to blow up bases. I play Rust alone meaning I don't have a large support network of players contributing to a common bas. Still with patience I've managed to build a comfortable fort several times during over the course of several hours. Each of these modest bases has consistently been destroyed and fully looted within 24 hours. Now I realize that this game is about survival so I expect some degree of entropy but at present the destructive forces far outweigh the constructive forces making for a game that really only has mechanisms in place to reward the griefers and trolls. If a normal player cannot expect to drop in and out without starting from scratch each and every login then only griefers will remain and even those players will find that the supply of ""fresh meat"" is dwindling quickly.I'll revisit this game in a few months and I do hope the design can provide more opportunities and flexibility for the ""creators"" to compete with the ""destroyers.""",Rust

2015-11-05,0,0,2320,True,Not Recommended,This game is very on the fence for a lot of reasons. Personally I love it. However if you are new to Rust or are a lone player finding friends can be very difficult and not fun. Once you find a good group of friends or you learn how to adapt and survive without the need of others the game can be amazingly fun.Edit The direction this game has gone is no longer productive nor good for the environment or community it is trying to create. I strongly do not recommend buying this game until they actually balance it or make it playable.If you do not already know at least 3 other people who play this game do not bother trying to begin. You will get constantly destroyed and walked over.,Rust

2014-08-21,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Ever since I was a wee laddie I ve wanted to experience the feel of starting over in life. Rust has offered me the perfect opportunity to know what it s like to have most of humanity wiped out from a nuclear holocaust. I learned the essentials of survival from this game such as beating wolves with rocks in order to obtain raw chicken for sustenance.When I first awoke in the world of Rust I was confronted by a pantsless man who screamed at me repeatedly saying Give me your rock ya dang commie. It seemed apparent to me that the radiation had gotten to this mans brain so instead of trying to bring sense to him I bashed him multiple times in the skull until he had fallen to the almighty rock. I began to search his body finding only a burned out torch and a health kit along with his most essential rock. Not understanding my purpose in life I began to wander quickly experiencing the first phases of starvation. I lifted my most precious rock at the sight of my first beast a pompous wild boar. I chased after the boar bloodying his skull with my valuable rock until at last he had fallen to my might. I soon found out that I could not harvest the savory meat off of his body until I had the proper tools. As such I smashed trees and bigger rocks with my beloved until I had the resources to acquire a stone hatchet which I used to harvest the raw chicken breast from the boar s rotting body.I continued my journey to understand life s wonders wandering onto an abandoned road. I followed the path down until I found a town where my ears began ringing with the sounds of radiation eating away at my brain. I also noted that some of the wildlife in the area had taken a liking to the radiation becoming zombified and bloodied. As I battered their soft and fleshy bodies with my hatchet I noticed that they seemed to have backpacks falling from their bodies as they died. I picked up a bolt action rifle and some ammo from a zombie bear that I wrecked with my trusty hatchet.With bolt action rifle in hand I climbed to the tallest mountain I could find taking the treacherous 2 minutes climb to the top. I stood on my perch marveling and the land and looking for victims. I loaded up my rifle and began sniping down at the unworthy citizens of Rust taking them out one by one until I was finally out of ammunition and had to leave my safe haven. I ran down the mountain and was quickly lost. With only my trusty rock in hand my power hungry self looked for victims. I finally found a pantsless man standing on the shore and staring out to sea. I heard one quiet sentence as he bashed my head in with his precious. Give me your rock ya dang commie. 10/10 would beat people with rocks again.,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,1146,True,Recommended,It's a beautiful and somewhat unique game thats accompanied by a brutal world with a steep learning curve. As someone who has played the game from release I'm still learning new things. This game is still pretty deep in early access but has plenty of features like basebuilding and exploring to keep ya busy. It's incredibly PvP focused and has a lot of features that you will miss out on by playing solo. That being said BRING A FRIEND. Look up a few youtube videos and learn the basics before hopping in and I guarantee that any survival lovers will have a blast.,Rust

2016-07-17,0,0,880,True,Not Recommended,Don't play this game solo.. srrly don't... You will be frustrated and angry on the community... many of the players just want to kill you for fun even if you are naked and don't have any stuff. You won't find a nice place to build your base because many places are occupied by left over buildings or people with towers that shoot you from it. Futher you have to put so much work into making a base but in just a few seconds all that work is wasted by a group of raiders. If you like to people their stuff up and you can't grief on Minecraft anymore... then this is the game for you. I wish I spend my hours and money somewhere else...,Rust

2014-02-11,0,0,390,True,Recommended,I can't stop playing this game it's the first Early Access game that I find very fun and addicting.It gets frustrating because of different things like bandits/raiders predator animals etc... and once you get killed and/or raided you have to start over which can get annoying but still fun to play with friends too.Since it's in alpha there's a lot they need to work on and once you get all the weapons and stuff it gets pretty dull but pretty good for a alpha I already have many hours invested in it and I can't wait to see where it goes.,Rust

2014-02-11,0,0,115,True,Recommended,I was skeptical at first with all the new survival games that have come out within the last year. I waited around a month before i checked out the comments. Many too amusing and chaoticly funny to make sense of. But i said to heck with it and pressed buy. When i started off it didn't make sense. Got mad quit after 3 hours or so. But something called me back. Got on again and did some research turns out the game has more features than i thought. Explored some more got used to the map and air drops. Which by the way i still have not been fortunate enough to walk away from any alive. And it turns out that this game once given a chance and a little work is VERY addicting. 58 hours in 5 days i believe. Building a huge fortress takes a LOT of time and resources. But once its done you feel SO accomplished and very safe. Although there are numerous players that shoot on sight. It makes for caution and intense adrenaline fueled fear that around any corner or rock. Could be the guy that takes your progress for himself. Hands down best $20.oo i've ever spent on steam.,Rust

The fact that i've spent almost 3 of the the past 5 days immersed in it's world tells anyone how addictive and rewarding this game is. In the world of Rust you can't trust anybody! Where resources as basic and simple as wood and stone become valued commodities you will feel emotions such as ""fear"" and ""loss"" when your perfect shack is destroyed and everythign you have is taken. This game has an enormous capacity to make the player genuinely feel threatened scared frusterated and humbled. Please make a note that this game takes time to master and you will be frusterated that the guy with everything takes your life for the little raw chicken you possess but it's moments like these you learn valuable lessons in survival.Trust nobody Keep everything safe gather all you and if you find yourself in harms way..RUN!!Play Rust people..

2016-12-28,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"This game is everything you could want in a real apocalyptic survival game. First and foremost it is in beta any complaints about lag glitches and the like are just silly because that's the whole point of a game going through alpha/beta otherwise it would just be called released. Second and what should be more important gameplay. The concept is basic but great you wake up with nothing (realistically no stat pants couldn't hurt haha) and every piece of resource you need you have to gather. One issue on some servers is that resources aren't spawning quickly enough or at all from what I hear but that's because the game is in alpha... aside from spawning rates resource execution is great maybe in the future they will reskin some rocks to look like discarded metal for realism but as far as gameplay goes it's all the same. In a real survival situation you wouldn't find piles of a variety of resources naturally just some wood and minerals. Animals are scarce in some areas and that's completely realistic too unless you're on a farm if there was real life apocalypse you would not see bears and boars walking around main paths constantly. The sleeping bag is a great feature. You can save a spawn point and use a metal door to hopefully keep your things safe. This allows you to actually form alliances and make friends but doesn't add a ""haven/neutral"" point in the game which makes it so much more exciting. Lastly community discussion. Yes the people are mean and vicious and perhaps they are kids (I like how that's become an insult these days it's a videogame for Christ's sake!). This is what makes this game great. Who expects there to be tons of people out there willing to help others and extend trust and a welcoming hand to total strangers in an apocalypse? Most people you run into will be desperate and selfish some well run the other direction because they are scared lots will become bullies because they can and a few will begin to band together in these beginning stages of hard times. This is what I've come across so far playing the game and this is what makes it pee your pants scary...what I assume you were looking for when you bought this game. For anyone who wants a nice community with easy to gather resources and mobs that hit you for 3% of your health play minecraft. For those who played for 30 mins or an hour and got tired of crap server lag and crashes and glitchy gameplay just keep in mind it's in alpha and will get better.

2016-12-28,0,0,145,True,Recommended,"Rust is a survival game with hunger water and health to look out for. You will be born naked in this world and youll need to survive. I would recommend to join a low populated server to start out so you dont always get killed by experience players and/or other nudes. My first reaction to the game was ""par"". I didnt know what to think of it because i kept dying. After a while of learning however the Rust experience just got better and better. The graphics are excellent I rarely run into bugs and if you do get a bug it doesnt actually ruin your immersive experience because the positives of the game are way up there. You'll need to survive against animals starvation and many more obstacles. The crafting aspect of Rust is excellent as well. It's well thought of and the menus are very user friendly. The base designing is best I've seen so far. The work and imagination you can put in a base is beyond what you expect. The map size is sufficient though a bigger map is always better. (This isn't a complaint the map(s) are big but I could always do with bigger). The game shines when you're playing with friends so I would recommend teaming up. The exploration aspect is very fun and rewarding and this goes same with looting. It's always fun to find a piece youve been trying to scavenge for 1h lol. For 20$ this game is amazing and I would really recommend jumping on this one as the devs are always updating. This game doesnt seem like a dead end like many others. I would rate it 8/10",Rust

2017-07-06,0,0,699,True,Recommended,So my previous review on this was me when i had about 50 hours reading it back i realise how stupid i was when i used to play this game. I say I was raided by 6 chinese dudes with rockets on a 2x3 base rip 3 days in 2 minutes do not buy! Ok.. 3 DAYS on a 2x3. i probably deserved to get raided i was constantly taking out guns that ive never used before and losing them and complaining bringing out a flamethrower before finding a base. I lived right next to the road that leads up to launch site and next to 2 bases. What was i expecting to happen? Overall this is a really good game you just need to look past getting raided and just learn that its a part of the game. Dont like the new blueprint system but figuring its alpha it will probably change soon... Hopefully.. Atleast i can still play servers like Terminus. Battle royale and CombatTag,Rust

2014-02-14,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Review in Alpha So far this game does a lot of things right the map and diversity of models/sounds is a bit low but it does not impede this game in any way. It feels fresh and it's nice to build a hut and figure out the game with a few friends along with the fact that the combat while not perfect is still shaping up to be something. The scavenging is a bit better than DayZ's current as loot respawns in raidable areas with normal frequency. The models and graphics options are barren at the moment but there's still very clearly a nice game that if played with friends or enemies can be very fun. So far as of time of writing this game probably earns a solid 7/10.,Rust
2014-02-14,0,0,67,True,Recommended,As long as this game stay relatively the same I'll keep playing.Perfect level of difficulty.Time pays solo or not.Gameplay and interfaces easy to pick up.New players should find an empty server to avoid pvp while learning.10/10 (would bang),Rust
2017-01-16,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,After roughly 20 hours of building one base ( 4h) and basically dying the rest of the time I cannot recommend this game at all. Servers with more than 10 players and which are NOT dedicated PvE Servers (which takes out a great deal of the game since PvP is quite important) are toxic in &gt 60% of cases and there are most likely people with high end weapons hunting nakeds (fresh spawns) for fun. Their fun of course I just got shot 3 times by the same lame guy.If you plan to play a survival game alone don't buy this one.If you have a group try it but it will take some time to get things rolling and you will most likely die over and over again before you can even find each other and even longer to not get rekt by some right after.,Rust

2016-12-26,0,0,445,True,Recommended,So this is my review for rust... I have been an avid player of Rust off and on for the past year or so and i gotta say it's one of my favorite games I've ever gotten into and I mean it. For me this game has transformed so much over the years that it comes neck and neck with the Fallout series for me at least. Development wise this game is well a game changer. At first Facepunch couldn't really decide on what was happening in the game like it was chaos and almost impossible to play because of server crashes zombie glitches and instant killing radiation (keep in mind that this was the Rust about 2 years ago). BUT. The changes Facepunch makes with Rust are for the better and the game truly gets better with every update. (Especially when they got rid of the ranking system). Another thing to add is that in Rust and the community of Rust assume everyone is a brutal warmongering There are friends to be made but you're better off with your own friend group or even solo for that matter. I've played Successfully in both forms but it is no secret that your chances of dominating a server increases when you have a friend group. The PvP in this game gets really and i mean REALLY intense. I cannot tell you how many times i've been in a fire fight when i'm out gathering resources sometimes you win and leave with more loot. But most of the time when you're farming out there people sneak up on you and then it's like open season for bandits. But like I said when you're with a group of people you dominate. Don't really know what else to say but if you're not fully convinced watch a video on it or sleep on it it's only $20 so I would just get it.Some tips If you suck at PvP join a modded server and practice Don't get used to modded servers Rust will consume your life (especially when you as a player are doing in terms of commodity) THE MORE YOU PLAY RUST THE MORE YOU TURN INTO A COLD BLOODED Trust no one KOS or hide,Rust

2016-12-26,0,0,256,True,Recommended,Spawned inRan aroundBroke a barrelFound AK with ammoSaw another playerHe ran awayI went on my wayGot hungryCouldnt find foodDied to starvationFelt like a child of the Congo got a gun before i got foodI really enjoy this game especially recently that i got back into it. Rust is a hardcore survival game where you might spend hours grinding to make C4 to raid a large clan you might also enjoy building bases (If you do I recommend buying FORTIFY as well its 99 cents) you might enjoy the PVP aspect of the game or maybe youre a friendly player who gets along with everyone. This game allows you to play in so many different ways and its a must have if you enjoy these types of games. While i was reading the reviews I saw a lot of people were complaining a lot about the Kill on Sight mentality a lot of the players tend to have they are not lying you will die (a LOT) and lose gear all the time then again in hardcore survival games you shouldnt be getting attached to your gear. This happens because you never know what a naked player could have up his bum and he might just be the one with an AK and explosive bullets coming to take your home. The people here are so unpredictable you cannot risk losing your stuff. Just run away and avoid them until you can fight back.I would advise against playing on vanilla servers grinding for 2 3 hours to build a base and then getting shot and losing 50k stone is truly a feeling i would not wish upon my worst enemy to solve this problem play with a group or simply join a modded server with a higher looting rate (4 6x tends to be the sweet spot).I personally prefer modded servers over groups (but why not both) its a lot of fun playing with a group and being able to raid people and feeling competent against the larger groups while also cutting down grinding time to about 20 30 minutes for a decent base.This game is truly a masterpiece and i hope the devs continue to add features,Rust

PIcked it up yesterday and I am not at all sad about losing my $20.BUG Every once in a while I'll try to join a server and it'll start to load and I'll get put back at the main menu.Gameplay is amazing. Graphics look great and the game matches. The only thing this game really needs is singleplayer as almost everyone on here is either a little kid or just a blatant ing idiot and you get KOS'd. Example I was using my rock to gather some wood and some guy came up and killed me with his rock. I asked what his problem was. He said he was 7 and he just got this game so he wanted to have fun then got off when I killed him and he dropped the only 2 things he had a rock and a torch both of which you spawn with mind you.9.5/10 Needs singleplayer.,Rust

2014-03-08,0,0,191,True,Not Recommended,"Alpha Status Indefinite. This is one of those games that feels like it's never going to come out of alpha. That's both good and bad. It's good because the devs will really get to test what is liked and not liked for the final product. It's bad because it's been in alpha for at least two years with no end in sight. The ""it's still in alpha"" excuse has been beat to death and you'll hear it quite often about the games many gamebreaking bugs.Optimization issues. Servers with more than 1 or 2 people on them per week have to reset often due to poor optimization. The games bog down and get laggy when structures go up. This means you'll lose everything you have every few days. This may or not be your style. I don't have the time to play 24 hours a day so any sense of achievement I get from building anything is usually destroyed by wipes the next time I log in.Game Score 2/10Judging as if it were a finished game. Many bugs and poor code. Game has a great premise but the gameplay just isn't there yet.Alpha Game Score 4/10This game will be better than average in 2020 when it hits beta. Unfortunately by the time it hits beta someone else will probably have made an entire new game that takes everything this one does and makes it better. My Advice Wait until someone else makes a better version and buy that stay away from this game unless the parts I don't like actually appeal to you. It's good to waste a day or two here and there but there's no point planning to play long term.",Rust

I started playing when legacy was still new players looked like soldier there was no building cupboards and doors could be placed anywhere aka outside of door frames. Had a blast on legacy and then new rust came out leaving legacy to be abandoned. At first I hated new rust due to the attachment I had with legacy however soon enough it grew onto me and I fell in love with it. Although it will never replace the memories I made on legacy it is one of the funnest games you will ever play. It is constantly updated hackers are barely ever met online (basically never) the community can be both toxic and the funniest and kindest people you have ever met and the amazing that will happen to you will never be forgotten.

2017-01-06,0,0,90,True,Not Recommended,I rate this game 0/10. This game does not even deserve being called a 'game' but I have to for review purposes. This 'game' is basically a place where the worst of people gather around to kill each other naked steal other people's stuff hate on everyone team up on others for the same thing build bases that will be destroyed 5 minutes afterwards by another group of people who for some reason hate you. This game REQUIRES you to stay online 24/7. Oh you have to go to dinner? Base raided. Oh you have to do a bathroom break? Bear clips and kills you. Oh you left 1 wall unupgraded before leaving? Base raided and taken over by a new owner who laughs at you for the next week about how easy it was to get it. People are horrible in this game. Every single one follows the mighty KOS rule. The game itself is actually pretty good. Base building mechanics on point resources balanced only tiny little reason that gives this game a total and fatal zero its community. Do not buy this game no matter what you do it will be a great regret a week later and you lost $20. I made the mistake of not listening other negative reviews like you might right now but now I promise you that if you buy this game and if you are not a psycho just freed from a prison you will hate this game.

I highly recommend this game to anyone!6/12/14 review I don't play it anymore due to this game is only fun with friends. It is very similar to DayZ and other games that has short fame. still 10/10 but you get tired of it and the ratings go down more and more so soon or later it is 0/10 and you don't want to play anymore.1/6/17 review I came back to this game quite pleased. They made some huge improvements to the game since the last time I played it around two years ago. I still would say you need to play this with friends and luckly I have some friends that came around to this game and they were willing to play a game with me. I still would recommend this game to anyone that likes survival / PVP / teambased games. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's addictive but it's close. It stil has a lot of room to improve and I think that this game can even get more kinds of gamers in on the action of this more than interesting game.,Rust
2017-01-06,0,0,72,True,Not Recommended,"As I write this I just want to make clear that I still do enjoy this game and the negative review that follow's is only because I don't feel I was delivered the game that I though I had purchased. I really wanted to like this game and ignore the ""This game and it's community are toxic"" review's but they're true. Unfortunately (at least from what I've seen) most people treat this as a strictly pvp game whereas most would see it as a survival game. However the developer's have made survival almost too easy ingame therefore player's get bored and turn to killing anything that moves CONSTANTLY. I may only have 30 hours in this game but I came from DayZ in hopes of finding a healthier community but in my opinion this community is by far (wish could underline that) more toxic than that of DayZ.If you do choose to buy this game be extremely careful who you trust and even who you ask for help. I've been backstabbed more time's here than in any previous game I've experienced. Also I would advise starting on a pve server so you can figure out the game before throwing yourself into the madness that is Rust. Don't count on anyone unless you either know them personally or they have proven themselves trustworthy. On a positive note the graphics in this game are cool and well done as well as the crafting and building systems. The game can be fun if you find the right situations though in most instance's I've found no hope in further joy from the game such as starting a trading post or having clan wars because personally I haven't been alive long enough to make it that far. One last thing most of the server's (after being wiped) die after an average 3 day's of nightmarish mindless heartless killing. So even if you do make it past then the game become's monotonous and boring.I would not recommend this to someone who is a ""Helping Hand"" or ""Hero"" type player you're heart will be stomped by this community and there's no place for you amonst MOST of these player's. Consider it COD with basebuilding.",Rust
2017-01-06,0,0,237,True,Not Recommended,k so first impression picked up the game again after a few years because a of a winter sale an went what the hell why not it was fun before should still be.........wrong. literal spawn camping with bear traps and spikes surrounded by walls in the designated spawn zones. if you get lucky with a random spawn you will be killed on sight. you want to know why because no one in this game wants to make friends. its killed or be killed. lastly if you are really lucky to get a house and everything going YOU WILL most likly be killed by a HACKER on get this OFFICAL SERVERS and this isnt a new problem this has been around since the oringinal part of the alpha almost 5 years ago. THIS GAME INST WORTH THE TIME UNLESS YOUR A STREAMER OR A YOUTUBER WHO CAN MAKE FRIENDS .5/10,Rust

I think the guy is right i class a game as 1 or $1 per hour going on my Arcade up bringing and if a game i buy goes over this then i have more then my value for money. i think thats more then fair to the devs but i will hate a game and dev for leaving a game to rot with bugs and half finished content.

2014-12-06,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,I really wanted to like this game. However after several months of installing and uninstalling I realized it was impossible. The game comes down to horrible servers with naked people killing you with rocks to get your rock. Progressing farther than a shack requires lots of effort and the next time you get back on the game someone somehow killed you in the safety of your house. Lots of promises were made by the developers and so far none have been kept. Trying to release another version did not help. In fact its even glitchier than the first showing that no real progress has been or will ever be made.,Rust

In my opinion it is better than Dayz in the way that it takes many hours for you to get the best gear/weapons. All in all very fun game get it.EditI love rust i really do but i havent had any fun on it since it came out around this time last year and yes i know the experimental branch is a thing but it has not recived a real update that actually added new gamelpay mechanics or goals in months...right now it is dead for people like me.

2014-12-08,0,0,75,True,Recommended,This game is great! however do to the anarchy of the game play it can also be the most frustrating so don't get too surprised if you spend hours building a base just to get killed and start over.

2016-12-30,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I was really hyped for this game when I got it. I watched multiple youtube videos about clans raids defending against raids etc. I was pumped. I tried the game out for myself and I was really surprised. Everyone I came across had a shoot on sight mentality. I would spawn in collect some wood and get shot by someone hunting 'nakeds' down. The longest I survived without being killed was five minutes. I tried multiple servers and this was the result every single time.

2017-01-08,0,0,123,True,Not Recommended,This game is a good exaple of surrival the game includes a lot of posibilities that you can play with to entretain and and fun.However the problem is the gameplay.1.Game is very unbalanced for solo players and people who start from 0 why? because you will have to face problems like everyone has weapons and you dont or simply because clans gangbang you.2.The game is 0% optimized for AMD No matter what you have you will have random fps drops for no reason. I have a PC with following specs CPU AMD FX 8350 4.8 GHZGPU AMD RADEON R9 290X WINFORCESSD 240GBRAM 8GBI run mostly games in high epic settings with +50 fps but this game has made me mad because its not optimized and you wount be able to play it as you get fps drops when you are facing other players and they kill you.,Rust

Not even a Vault suit or a Steve skin. Completely addicting as you will want to constantly be making sure you didn't get raided but it will happen. When you die and lose all your stuff or someone breaks in and takes everything you'll hate it but that's okay because it starts over every week or month depending on your server. Ultimately a great game with a few bugs.,Rust

2014-02-16,0,0,77,True,Recommended,I was first introduced to this game via Steam but being the kind of guy who wants to know more about a game before sinking valuable resources into it I ventured forth to find out more. After scrounging through Youtube I found the Vidyacraft streamers Sroxah Gun Caramon Sp1ky etc. I watched a few of their videos and from what I saw the game looked... gorgeous. Not because of the graphics crafting player killing or massive contructs made by players but because of the potential I saw in this game to be something great! There is so much freedom in the world of Rust that it is overwhelming. In the measly amount of time that I have played (32 hours thus far) I've made a few friends built a part in a community all our own made trades in the dead of night ran for my life from wolves bears and players seen abandoned homes crumble and new ones being built hidden in terror from the sound of gunfire had my heart pounding while chasing an air drop not sure if other players were on their way to kill for the valuables inside been raided met bandits who kill for enjoyment and that's just the beginning of the tale because every day in Rust is different. If this is just the alpha then I cannot wait to see what's in store when it is finally finished.,Rust
2014-02-16,0,0,172,True,Recommended,Got this about a month ago I have played over a hundred hours on one of the official servers. I'm going to start with saying if you don't enjoy this game give yourself more of a chance to immerse yourself in the player filled ruthless unforgiving world of rust. People say they dislike it because there is no single player people say that they don't like it because they get killed all the time. These were both my opinin when I started out took me about 2 weeks to actually play the thing properly but when I did..Oh boy I came back with a spark.I made friends made enemies. Died a lot lost a lot of things raided a lot of people. Killed Killed and killed... But all in the name to survive Rust really is a dog eat dog game that looks and plays wonderfully. I haven't been on this and thought to myself what a waste of time i've enjoyed nearly every second of the game. The fact you are naked cavemen just adds to the hilarity just check out my screenshots.. and when you have a few friends together it is without a doubt the best gaming experience I have ever had. Anyone that says they don't like the game are in denial convince them otherwise or they can miss out.The updates to this game are frequent almost every week at this point and facepunch are doing a nice job at adding new content and experimental content to sculpt the game into exactly what we want it. People have compared this to day z is it anyhting like day z? Not in the slightest crafting mutant animals scavenging bases raiding alliances your own story community rivals survival. Ludicrous Brutal Thought provoking and most of all great fun. Don't hesitate join the community you won't regret it... Unless you are very stubborn,Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,1767,True,Recommended,"Rust is an early access first person survival game. Now this game can make you go crazy but also be very intense and funny. Its and early access so dont expect everything to work properly but i still think this is a good game worth all the money Why you may ask? Well first of all its multiplayer you can join an official server or a modded server with custom made plugins or community server. the official servers are legit no plugins just pure gameplay the modded servers usually have modded gather rate which means that you get more resources from woodcutting mining skinning etc. Now the gameplay. well you have alot of fun with this game like you can go raid if you have c4 or rockets for the rocket launcher you can go hunt wild animals such as Boars Deers Bears Wolves and chickens. The rust world is rough the bears and wolves will hunt you if you get too close and also players might hunt you down. There is also alot of building options such as Foundations and walls and other cool things when you've built your little house or large mansion depending on what you like you might need to get loot. So how do we get loot exactly well there is 2 options (obviously there is more but these are some simple ones) There are towns called ""radtowns"" these towns contain loot chests and barrels. the loot chest usually doesn't have anything too good neither do the barrels but i usually go for barrels when i try and getting loot there is not only radtowns there is also a sphere tank sattelite dish military tunnel a water treatment park and a nuclear plant. now you can go to any of these note there will be radiation so be careful. now the radiation might not be the main danger it mostly is othet players they could be friendly and leave you alone or you might team up or they'll just kill you on sight.

2014-02-17,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Hard to give full opinion as it is only Alpha but from what I have played so far I think it has great potential and I have really enjoyed it.,Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,137,True,Recommended,This game is In alpha and my opinions of the game will change over time but this is my opinion at the moment. This game is extremely fun and makes your heart pump It does have it's bug's but you get over it. Rust is best played with friends and can get a little boring when you are playing on your own. There are many different types of servers (TDM survival economy) which ensures you will have many many hours of fun (even more when more updates come out). It doesnt come without its flaws There are quite a few hackers but aslong as you find a good community server which has lots and non abusive moderators. The bugs are minor and you will get used to them after a few hours in the game (Or atleast i did) I 100% recommend this game for its quite cheap price.,Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game with loads of potential. There are regular updates and plenty of helpful gamers in most of the worlds. I have a few issues with this game though.... I start playing in a new world gather loads of materials make a nice base and start researching better equipment then all of a sudden the server gets wiped and your left with nothing. Assuming you get onto a server which doesnt wipe or reset and you manage to make a decent base you can guarentee someone will pop along in the middle of the night and steal all your stuff. If the server isnt wiped and someone doesnt rob you of all your stuff you need to make sure you come onto the game every couple of games because otherwise any structures youve build will fall to bits and again youll be left with nothing. Really fun game but not designed with infrequent users in mind.,Rust

2014-04-25,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,The game NEEDS a single player mode. Why because i dont always have to go on once a day so all my stuff stays also it would be a good way to learn how to play the game. Another good thing that singler player could do is get people away from greifers KOSers etc. Also what would it hurt to add a single player mode and for people who dont like the idea of single player just dont play it.

Hold that light over here for me bro!""Im scared so I do as I'm told. He proceeds to pull out a giant rock from his butt crack and smash the other man's cranium.The other man does the same and they run around smacking each other with the rocks until the non black man dies.""Dayyyuuum son he dead! HE DEAD!!!!"" screamed the survivor.I stand here in awe when I hear a deep grunt from behind.I slowly turn around and see a giant red bear barreling towards me and the black man. We run but that isnt enough.The bear smacks me Im bleeding everywhere. I drop unconcious to the floor. The last thing I see before my vision blacks out is a naked man running from a giant red bear with a rock in his hand. He looks at me while running away and shouts.""DAAYYYUUUMM SON THEY GOT HIM HES GONE! *SOBBING* AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" I respawn and shed a tear for the sassy black dude.10/10 would get bear'd again",Rust

2016-12-05,0,0,431,True,Recommended,Long time gamer here with very harsh critiques. That said this is one of the GREATEST games I've ever played and it's not even finished. People say the community is terrible I love the real nature it brings out in people. Everyone is a savage at heart their loss is your gain. Fighting with sticks and rocks for precious resources hours spent defending what you've spent so long to gather from outsiders and crushing defeat when you realise you've lost days of gathering resources and playtime to some group of preteens who found and exploited a weakness in your base. I've spent a ridiculous number of hours on this game learning to survive solo against impossble odds and if you're not WEAK you will too. In summary this is a game for people who like a challenge and feel accomplishment when killing gun wielding noobs with spears and bows.,Rust

2014-02-18,0,0,249,True,Not Recommended,I will make this short for us. The game is very fun and interesting the fact that it is a survival game makes it even better. However there is one BIG problem that is bugging everyone. There are still so many hackers. I used to play on a community server but quit after getting raid by hackers so me and my friends join an official server called us central 5 and seriously we about to quit this game I would want to refund if possible! We joined an officially server thinking hackers will be strictly punished but we were wrong its even worse! Seriously how does a server related game can be hacked so easily?! are you guys even working on stopping this?! i really hope there will be answer soon before everyone quit this game.,Rust

2014-02-18,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Amazing survival game concept and at such an early stage of development it has a really promising future.with encouraged teamplay and an open world to just hermit solo if need be built with a stable and strong skeleton this beast is going to bare much meat.a stout beast of unimaginable horror which at times claws at the frail wood pallets in which your character must survive.is there really a beast? or am i lost in metaphor and game induced intoxication?play and find out,Rust
2014-02-18,0,0,1,True,Recommended,"""A worthwhile investment"". I can only see this game getting better over time. The gameplay is pretty solid for an early access title. Within the first 2 hours of gameplay I have encountered mixed emotions from friendship and comradery to Deception and turmoil. This game has a large community backing with plenty of help available from the get go. I would highly recommend using a headset with a mic for this title. I have found that teamwork is key if you want to survive. The gameplay is familiar to other crafting based games. The unique thing about this game is the experiences you encounter along the way. This game has no story or narrative you make your own adventures. The only limitation is your imagination. If you are willing to put the time in and learn the ins and outs this game can be very rewarding. Highly recommend. )",Rust
2014-02-19,0,0,6,True,Recommended,I first started playing this game a few months ago. To my discovery i experienced a hell lot more than Bear Gryills can offer in the wild.

2017-07-10,0,0,5,True,Recommended,While most people seem to enjoy the fighting part of RUST it's the almost zen like calmness of building a base out of nothing that attracts me. The beauty of the game lies within its world exploration and figuring out how to build things to keep on surviving,Rust

2015-11-16,0,0,1150,True,Not Recommended,"I realized that I have 849 hours into the game and have to recommend it. I may hate the on going hacking issues despise how the developers choose to enhance horse animations rather than fix bugs and don't need another color of t shirt but hey I've put in the hours and have enjoyed the pain.This is one of the best survival games I've played. If you don't want to deal with murderous children setup your own dedicated server and have a blast or just try to find one with a low population and hope for the best.UPDATE I have to change my recommendation. I thought when I posted my review that surely the game would be moving into production by now. Nope it's still early access and is still being treated as such. Any hope for long term achievements on any given server are dashed by updates that require map wipes.Beyond that most servers seem to be controlled by wandering gangs of hoodlums. When I first posted I noted that you would have to deal with murderous children but this is going beyond that cutting into playability. It's more difficult now to simply join a server and make your claim you'll most likely be hunted down and slaughtered.If you move to a lower population server chances are the admin is a lonely soul that's going to want to build things with you. This wasn't the case prior but I think the community became disenchanted when they had to replace or work on their mods after every update which are too frequent. I was operating my own but I suffered the same.Unfortunately I just can't play this game anymore. There's no long term play value. Facepunch turned out not to be the horse to bet on which is a bit ironic considering how much time their development team put into horse animations.FURTHER UPDATE I've now found it to be a gas to run around in game playing music I enjoy but others don't seem to. ""Even the nights..."" Ooomph. Murdered. Respawn. ""are better..."" Arrrg. Murdered. Respawn. ""when I'm with you.""While I still don't recommend buying the game I did feel a need to justify my recent play time. So Please be aware that all recent play time consists solely of shenanigans and no serious enjoyment was to be had. Thank you.EVEN FURTHER UPDATE The music thing got old really fast. After running around got tiring I took to building 1x1 houses for myself so that people couldn't kill me. That was fun but alas I grew tired of that too. I lucked up though and was asked to be a DJ for a bar. This was a tad more interesting as having been a DJ I did really enjoy playing music for folks. But of course that lost interest as well.I think I'll continue to pop in to the bar to play tunes until the next wipe but that's it for me... again.",Rust

This game makes me want to fill a pillow case with oranges and beat people with it.This game makes me feel things I have never felt before.This game made me invent new words to call people. I would rather run naked through a long shallow hallway of razor blades thumb tacks and legos in the dark whilst being covered in isopropyl alocohol and lemon juice just to get clothes lined by barbed wire than play this damned game again,Rust
2014-11-16,0,0,168,True,Not Recommended,The new version is going to the dev is focusing on eating animations instead of the motionless ai and bunch of bugs in the game and the limited resources makes the game pointless since the server will just reset since you cant do anything anymore the original version of rust was fun but now id rather buy orion prelude 20 it would be more worth it then this tick,Rust

2014-11-15,0,0,82,True,Recommended,It's a great zombie shooter game. The game places you in the middle of an zombie outbreak and you have to survive by finding weapons and scavenging for the scarce ammunition which you will use against the zombies or other players to defend yourself. Could do with some more content as in maps and weapons but overall a fun game to play with friends. I would recommend this as a great zombie coop shooter.,Rust
2014-11-17,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,I can't recommend this game right now. I hope it will someday become what it is advertised as. Right now it is full of hackers who can take your stuff very monotonous game play that involves hitting things over and over to tear them down or build them up and on online community of mental 4 year olds. Some of the servers are constantly being bombarded by DDOS attacks and playing on them is like being the star of a badly done chop motion video.Will keep checking back with the game and update this review if it changes. As of November 2014 I would say steer clear.,Rust

All to be destroyed if you are not constantly watching you base or equpied with weapons or have a group of people to play with. On my own I survived a week and woke up one day...naked on a beach..with a rock and a torch. So if you have nothing better to do with your life other than to build survive and have you s#*% destroyed this game is for you.,Rust

How can parents let their children become like this. 3/10. The community ing sucks big time. People constantly asking to be slaves people will only let them join to be a slave if they are black lol.

2014-11-28,0,0,121,True,Recommended,"This is my review as of 11/28/2014 PLEASE do take this into account. Legacy Legacy is an excellent game through it's horrible graphics and really bad mechanics it allowed you to feel.... well fear. It's an excellent survival game the ambient music really helps set the mood too.Experimental/Complete GAME The game was COMPLETELY overhauled only a few things made it past the overhaul I'm not sure how I feel about it.... as of right now it's fun but there's no real ""objective"" no ""purpose"" to guide me through the game as the first time I played through it so I'm not sure how I feel when playing it. I think it lacks the suspense the feeling of dread and fear it gave you at ALL times and that feeling of ""I'm done"" when you saw someone else. Overall I think this game definetely is worth looking at but I'm not sure how I would rate it right now I will update my review once the game is fully out of it's EA mode.",Rust

2014-11-26,0,0,82,True,Not Recommended,game stability spotty at best failed log ins are either being dumped back to server list or 20 seconds in game and dumped to server listing. difficult to get started the food resource is so sparce you either die from starvation zombies bears wolves or other players.few suggestions once a spear is created makes sense you should be able to gather fish from water areas shrubs and other low lying fauna should yeild some forms of edibles. that should allow a general start for players.campfire might allow us to respawn at that point rather than a random location you spend time building a base camp only to die and never find it again.I like the concept but the begining nuts and bolts should have been addressed first otherwise it's unplayable.,Rust

2016-12-11,0,0,635,True,Recommended,Many people will say the community is toxic and they are right. the majority of the people who play the game play to kill and that is what you should expect from this game. if you are going to get this game because its a survival game don't. this game is pvp first and survival second.if you are just starting and want to learn the game play on a small server. you will get the chance to understand how the game works. i also recomend that you play on a high pop server as well so you can see how challenging the early game can be when you are always being attacked.over all it's a fun experience. if you have trouble getting started or even just trouble at all get some friends to help it makes the game much more fun.,Rust

2014-05-05,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,This game is fun to gather supplies and buiding things. And it's very fun when you have friends and build up a community and a strong castle. But when you play alone you have to beware of yourself cause something else might wanna kill you whether you have just spawned and naked. You'll never be able to build anything good alone. And don't find in game friends cause you don't know what they've done while you sleep.Don't buy this game in full price! And also try to convince your friends to play with.,Rust

2016-01-27,0,0,48,True,Recommended,I had lots of trouble with the game crashing everytime I started it. I spent well over 4 hours trying to fix this problem and eventually got lucky and fixed it. I tried about 5 methods. Finally I played with my freinds and the server was a bit laggy and it was 3am so we got off. Here i am the next day with the same not loading up problem and cant fix it. Ive tried 1) updating drivers 2) read many forums 3) tried to run rust as an Admin and in directX 9 4) played around wiht my graphics settings on my Computer ( also tried to run compatability troubleshooting ) and 5) I changed settings in my computer. All of these had people that these changes worked for them. One worked for me but none have worked this time. I have validated steam files and still not a thing. My set up is a Core i 7 4790K Devils Canyon GTX 980ti Windows 10 64 bit Asrock Z97M Pro 4 Motherboard all tucked away in an R5 case from Fractal. If you have any solutions please contact me.

2014-02-23,0,0,269,True,Not Recommended,ALPHA REVIEW This game is alright but there are so many faults that make it real bad. Hackers functioning programming and so on. I played enough to say so even though its alpha. I rec people not buy this and wait for the finished copy. Check out an offical review then but if problems are still the same don't waste your time. (ALPHA REVIEW ONLY!) P.S expect rebuilding not to the fact of raids but constant wipes and updates so just wait til its finished (this only goes out to people who hate starting over when its good for the game to update) I almost forgot just make sure to pick the right SERVER. Admins can also be a huge issue. I dont mind the admin playing the game raiding or just doing his thing but sometimes they tend to exploit their powers. Just make sure if u do play to PICK THE RIGHT SERVER,Rust
2015-01-16,0,0,433,True,Not Recommended,Rust legacy was an unfinsihed but still very fun game. At this point rust has become something beautiful and a game i want to play! But the last patch took away a very important thing from the game you can't lock your doors from the start. So you have to spend unknown time destroying barrels to find locks and they does not drop easy. Give us back locks ffs! That's the only fraking thing i want from the developers at this point.So until that is fixed i can't recomand it you'll lose all your stuff.,Rust
2015-01-16,0,0,101,True,Recommended,Seriously awesome game. Even in the Alpha state it runs pretty well except on Friday (seems to be patch day). The concept is really amazing. My friend and I can't get enough. Well worth the $20 for early access.,Rust

Minecraft has nothing on Rust the map being huge and stunningly beautiful the physics of this game still surprise me. My play time may say otherwise but this game is a game where you could play for hours and not get bored from finding blueprints in order to advance your crafting skills or just raging over getting killed by a zombie wolf this game is for you.Pros Lot's of things to do from scavenging killing crafting and building a fort with friends!BEAUTIFUL map!Your never short of recourses. The loot respawns very often.Thousands of servers worldwide! Many new friends waiting for you to arrive!CONS No singleplayer.Map hard to navigate.Some servers contain hackers.Wolves. Seriously... wolves.None the less best game ever made of the genre. I will rate this 9/10.20 Bucks is nothing for what this game gives back!! BUY IT!,Rust

2017-02-09,0,0,348,True,Recommended,Rust in itself is a great game it has come a long way and has a wonderful support team behind it with constant updates and developer input. There are plenty of community servers ranging from role playing to primitive to suit your individual play styles and the official servers have good admin support as well. Fair warning there is no tutorial so head over to youtube and watch some RECENT videos to get some up to date tips and tricks. I recommend Ramsey simply because he is a good guy and funny to boot. Another warning The community can be toxic and many people will kill you on sight no matter how new you are. But with a little social interaction you can join up with others who are friendly and this is the only true way to play Rust effectively.,Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.I used to play Rust a couple years ago and it was wonderful. If you want to you can read my old review below. However after a hiatus I thought I should play again so I opened it up was impressed by the new menu and then went on to be dissapointed that none of the servers would connect giving me a generic ""could not connect"" error. Next I went on to be dissapointed that the game couldn't even handle closing forcing me to open up the Task Manager force the game to exit and experience a frame rate drop to only a couple frames a second as Windows attempts to figure out why Rust isn't working. Next I went on to find that the community help on these issues is either from about 2015 consists of a thread of people saying ""post this elsewhere"" or making other useless comments or both.In other words I can't even review the game itself because I can't get the game to do anything other than show me the start menu and crash when I try to exit. It's rather dissapointing because I used to really like this game.2014 Review TL DR Rust is fun. The game is in alpha so there are bugs. Also expect to get the things you build broken at times. But if you know how to play a survival game and build away from people then you should be OK and will surely have fun.It's important to keep in mind that this game is EARLY ACCESS. If you are expecting a polished game do not buy this under any circumstances.In this game you are given a rock bandage and torch and dropped in the middle of nowhere with the only goal as surviving. There is a creative element to this as you are allowed to make things out of various materials in the wilderness. If you have looked at any of the pictures you will see massive buildings. Those are in no way an exaggeration or staged shots. You will find those so if you want some creative elements go nuts with the game. Joine a non pvp server if you want to create (and that alone).Its actually quite fun as it does combine the survival and creative quite well. It is early access so it does have bugs but its all being ironed out.However the one main problem with the game is the community. They have a tendency to KoS. This should be no surprise as its a survival game but I've found quite a few people dont understand what an open world survival game fully means. So if someone kills you don't . I've heard enough about that in games such as Nether and DayZ (Mod). You're in a survival game get over it.You can break doors/walls/just about anything made of wood. And metal doors and all that are hard to make. If you do it right you should have no problem (for example dont be that dumbass that tries to build a wood castle in a high population area).So if you can take some s and bugs and know how to play a survival game get the game you'll love it.",Rust
2017-10-11,0,0,331,True,Recommended,I enjoy the new rust update with the updated blueprint system. If you're lucky you can immediately get a ak 47 or endgame gear like metal armor etc. I see a lot of complaining about scrap grind but it isn't THAT tedious. In one hour you can get over 800 scrap by recycling everything and anything you find.This blueprint system gives the game a sense of progression and now when you get base wiped you aren't entirely stuck with nothing since blueprints are tied to character. I would like some items to be reduced in scrap cost though and the workbenches or at least the level 3 one to give everyone in a base authorized on the tool cubbard access to level 3 crafting so I don't have to sit in a chair for hours crafting stone walls..urh such a waste of time since you can't do anything else due to canceled crafting if you aren't in front of the table.The pvp is fast and raids are exciting.

2017-02-10,0,0,570,True,Recommended,You know there is a ton of people who complain about early access and especially how long this game has been in it but I like that there is an active community of devs who are constantly improving the game and adding new features. Not only that but theres so many concepts that the community has created that the devs have put in the game they are a part of the community just like any of the players. Most of the bad reviews are from people who have 1000+ hours in the game and are tired of it but that's any game. If you have thick enough skin for a real challenge I HIGHLY recommend this game and I don't do that often in fact the only other games I have given such high recommendations are fallout 2 new vegas and the witcher 3. Yes it is brutal. Yes there are cheaters. Yes you will die countless times before you get a feeling for the game and even the best of the best die.. alot. but there is a great community (even though there constantly killing eachother). So if your down for a challenge like permadeath survival and believe that bears should have the right to walk through walls then this game is for you with loveRay J P.S I made Kim famous,Rust
2017-01-21,0,0,216,True,Recommended,I would like to write down a review about this game first the concept of this game is awesome I do really like playing rust we survive in rust world and it's fun but idk why after I close the game and want to play again this game won't start because Easy Anti Cheat crash so I decided to refund this game maybe it's because this game still in early access and second the minus of this game is when I play my fps is so low around 20fps it is still playable but you know game with 20fps even I already setting all the graphic in low and fastest but still the fps is so low well maybe someday when this game is already in final state I'll buy it again. But consider this before buying an early access game sometime the game crash so the choice is on you.EDIT The developer is so good they add an update and I can play it again although still sometime the game is crush and there are a cheater in it some cheater jump so high and other can't die but the dev is active so it's still worth to play,Rust

In that precious down time you can craft items that will help you survive. Building a base is essential to keep your resources safe however by the time you finish putting the roof on the door is usually being broken down by other players nakedly raiding your stuffs. 10/10,Rust

So I recommend to build a home away from the eyes of the other players .In the new patch appeared red animals where you can find different things and resources that you will find your first weapon you 'll want to kill the first oncoming player but do not forget that the next time his place can be youI highly recommend playing with friends as you will quickly master and develop the game.The game is worth the money.,Rust

Also some items like plastic explosive are very rare and even though you can learn how to craft them the materials for them are still rare and you need 2 plastic explosives to blast a single metal door....... this means if you make lots of doors and split resources in different rooms it will make it a nightmare for people to steal and if others do it it will be expensive for you to steal ...even after all this i still like the game and since it's still in alpha things might get better,Rust

2016-02-25,0,0,456,True,Recommended,Rust has huge potential but it needs to be found. A basic description of the game would be it is Mine/Survivial craft on steroids. Pretty graphics and resource mining/converting. It is also a grinder in terms of repetative behaviours (mining logging/smelting) which makes it doubley infuriatioing when one dies. There are many ways to die in the game and its pretty brutal. A couple of hits and you are down. Time and resources are lost for nothing. You will initally die being food for random wandering wolves and bears. You will also be mercilessly hunted down by fellow humans after your loot or to eat you because they can. Each time you die if you have not managed to construct a base with a bed you will wake up naked on the beach with a rock and will have to start again from scratch. The real terror ( in a real sense) comeas in human to human interactions. You are out gathering resources and hear footsteps (even worse maybe a few footsteps) do you sit tight and not say a word or do you try and engage? Sometimes people are in your base and you can hear them trying to break in and steal all you possess. Ive had good and bad experiences from chatting to people. In essence I woulod say you need friends in this game (maybe clan) it is a lonely grind playing alone. The maps are massive and the random nature of them is great. Ive not tried other mods yet but suspect there are many more good ideas that can be put into practice. All in all a good game that needs to steer away from grind.,Rust

Fix the animals going through the walls god dammit XDPros Fun Gots a challenge on every wipe the pvp system is very good Very rewarding when playing with someone you can share some laughts from the 65% toxic people there is some that are realy owsome,Rust
2016-12-20,0,0,102,True,Recommended,Now i dont have much time put into the game but i believe i have a pretty good idea on what im supposed to be doing... SURVIVE. I started playing solo on my first day worked out alright till i went to bed that night woke up hoped on to realize oh look your 1X2 hut was raided and i got rekt. They took my stone tools and and some wood and stone then killed me. I wasnt to upset untill i spent an entire day playing with one other friend we had built a pretty large base and had accumulated a good amount of resources had some weapons on us and felt as if we were doing alright.... Then it all went down. 2 guys walked up to our base with a rocket launcher blasted through 4 doors killed us took our stuff and we had to begin again...Now im going to RECOMMEND this game because it can be highly addictive losing everything and wanting to get back on and start over and want to capitalize on what you did wrong. The Highly frustrating part of the game is until they wipe the server everyone has an advantage over new players and fresh spawns because they literally have all the high powered weapons. Lots of turf wars going on lots of very large clans that enjoy raiding you till you delete the game. But if you are able to find that one spot and good mats. worth it if you dont mind starting over all the time. also try joining a clan if you really having trouble.,Rust
2016-12-20,0,0,559,True,Recommended,8/10Before i start this review i would like to say that most of this is my opinion DPRO Great dev team updates every thursday great pvp takes skill to play (and be sucessful at it) building system is very stable farming can be relaxing (depending on your opinion and the server)CON comunity Huge groups roam around killing people for materials hard to play solo and experience the full game (so bring a friend or play a modded server) vanilla servers tend to have hackers (aimbot/esp) players act like hours in the game are everything.All together this is great game especially if you have friends so give it a try,Rust

2016-12-18,0,0,767,True,Not Recommended,"PROS 1)Fun when there isn't a whole bunch of s on your server. 2)A decent selection of guns weapons tools and armor.3)Modded servers4)Weekly updates5) Beautiful Graphics6) Good enough gun mechanics (Weak guns are easy to use and better guns arent)CONS 1)Terrible community (Worse than the day z community and I thought that was bad)2)Horrible optimization Game is running at 70 90FPS and randomly drops down to 10 30fps at times and sometimes freezes. Its annoying as it gets me killed and it happens way to commonly. AMD Users beware.. 3) Trying to play this game solo is a nightmare. Everyone goes after you and dealing with a whole squad of people is just insane. 4)LOOONNGGGG loading times even with an SDD and fast internet.5) Component and XP systems sucked they should just go back to blue prints. I don't wanna grind my off hours upon hours on end just to die to a kid with an AK. Its so annoying.I honestly wish this review could be better to be honest. The game is amazing but with the horrible optimization community and Component/XP systems the game just seems to keep going downhill from here. Update after update seems to be worthless. I see in the patch notes ""optimiaztion fixes"" yet I still see terrible frame drops. I don't really recommend this game to anyone unless they have a really high end computer and they want to experience getting killed every few mins. If any future updates finally makes Rust good again. I will update this review but until then.. sadly.. this review will have to stay like this.",Rust

2015-12-01,0,0,299,True,Recommended,I have experinced 200+ hours on this game and plan to play much more. The game Dev's are constantly making this game a must play for survival lovers beautiful graphics and a ton of fun. I've had countless great experinces in Rust It is unique to 7 Days To Die and ARK. There is ton's to do in this game and you will find yourself never wanting to stop collecting resources and raiding bases and upgrading your own so you will be a force to be reckoned with.,Rust
2016-06-26,0,0,117,True,Recommended,Rust will destroy your life. Personal relationships with people you know and love will deteriorate over time until you realize it is too late... no one even knows you anymore so you stay home and play rust waiting for the next server wipe so you can exact your revenge... My faith in humanity is destroyed 10/10,Rust
2016-03-25,0,0,1562,True,Recommended,It's a fungame to play but the longtime motivation is lacking. You can build a safe base (beside c4 and rocket) in less than 1 hour after that it's just grinding for gear and to raid others. As there is only pvp in this game and weapons are easy to get (if you got bp's for it) the sense of raiding itself is stupid as the outcome is mostly worse than you invested in c4 and rockets. There needs to be an higher motivation to grind maybe a level system where you just can enter different locations with better gear. Which brings me to the point that there is not enough gear/weapons or stuff to craft which is really usefull. There is only one set of high level gear and only 3 weapons which are good (ak bolt semi auto pistol) Which makes it pretty boring. Also the possibilty to farm HQ in very low time with Quarrys makes the sense of raiding beside being a total jerk to your neighbors uninteresting. So in the end it's a fungame in case of building something and getting your stuff together but 10 days after a serverwipe it gets pretty boring. As this is considered as an Alpha and the price in sale is normaly around 10$ i still recommend this game and hope they will find a way to make it more interesting for the longterm.,Rust

Right now Helk is just testing different things and I find it enjoyable to see these different apsects come into the game. This game is hard to play by yourself.

2013-12-12,0,0,148,True,Recommended,I have been playing rust since the very first day it was released. The game is not just your basic survival shoot em up game. No... You need to really survive. Starting out with nothing but your trusty torch a few bandages and a pet rock you need to mission out to find your first lucky tree or pile of wood to beat the seven shades of sh*t out of it to make your first little home from all the nasties out there who would like to eat and kill your naked There is a system of growth in the game like technology ages where you move from cloth to leather then to kevlar. From firing a home made shotgun with the help of flint to the final stages of pulling out a M4 and blowing your intruder to high heaven.This game has changed alot and it is only going to get better. I have watched Garry and his team make this game from a sausage fest which include bunch of naked men trying to beat the living day lights out of each to a game where every second you are online counts and God help you if you log out in the wrong area.... you sleeping body will remain there for some other player to have their way with you or even worse the elements taking hold of you and turning you into nothing but a very sad little girl with PMS and a will to destroy everything.In my opinion the game is EPIC it has grown and yes there are bugs but God DAMMIT... You dont care because when you have that holo sight pointed to that SOB that just raided your sh*t and get that headshot in... Man oh Man... You run over and make sure you make a nice serving of Tea on his face... TRUST ME... EVERYONE has done it DGrab yourself a copy of R.U.S.T and enter a game where the days of survival has been taken to a complete new level.,Rust
2013-12-12,0,0,62,True,Recommended,This game blows my mind. It's early alpha and about 10x more playable fluid and enjoyable than DayZ ever was. If they never touched this game again I think it would be an easy 8/10 (for $19.99). If they continue adding content and expanding the game wow this will really be something special. I have a lot of faith in the developers behind this as Garry's Mod is still going strong. I highly recommend this game.,Rust

2013-12-13,0,0,63,True,Recommended,This game is great in fact so great i've died multiple times and won't get mad because it's finally a survival game where it's on you. Some of the features are harvesting cutting wood farming materials and building a house. The game has built in VOIP so that's pretty good especially when you run up on a air supply drop and a guy yells what do you think you're doing and kills you. As for graphics they are really sharp looking for a early access. Gameplay mechanics are wonderful there are guns in the game but it's not very hard to find them or craft them. Players there are some friendly people that will help you out and then there are those who have formed a group so be careful. Servers you need to remember what server you play on cause your gear and items will not transfer. Also one last thing that I thought was awesome when you log off the game depending on your server if it's a sleeper server when you log off your guy goes to sleep in the game. So becareful where you sleep cause a player can find you and kill you and steal your items.,Rust

2014-05-17,0,0,44,True,Recommended,It's a fairly stable game. For an alpha the mechanics are fairly polished some work is definitely still needed before it becomes completely playable.

It's much better than DayZ in every way imaginable.Buy it now in alpha while it's only $20 because it will definitely be worth more in it's final version.,Rust

2017-02-20,0,0,120,True,Recommended,"Generally have a hate for ea survival games. But this was one of the first to exist and is more than worthy of that title. Not only has it gone through COMPLETE redevelopments of the game it has somehow managed to actually get better. Most ea games I see reach a peak then slowly stagnate for a few months until ultimately dying from malnourishment at the hands of the devs. The devs here have frequent community blog posts and indepth changelogs. This is a decent example of how ea development can be done right. I genuinely forgot about this game once the ""legacy"" version got canned. I just assumed the devs had taken the money and ran. But years later I've finally gotten back into the game and even in the few weeks I've been actively playing again I've seen numerous good updates being pushed. The only tricky part is finding a good server but once you do you're sure to have bundles of fun.Great game for the small price. For sure the best survival game on steam in early access. Cheap better looking and more content filled than all the alternatives.",Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,68,True,Recommended,This game is easy to lose yourself in. It's still in beta but it's on the right path. I like the gameplay albeit it is a bit frustrating when you have bandits kill you no apparent reason. If I were to find anything negative about this game as of now it would be there are some bugs isn't optimised properly yet hacking is not uncommon and a general feeling of paranoia and inability to trust people.If you want to learn never to trust anyone again play this game. You can build shelters and stuff. Pretty nice ones too. It's also great fun to have sieges on enemy camps. And holding people up at gunpoint with a 9mm with no ammo. They don't know but if they call your bluff you're screwed.The cons I wrote will most likely be solved in the current development in the game. I look forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer.Now if you'll excuse me I have some... trespassers that need a warning shot.,Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,346,True,Recommended,**Updated review**Ok... so i admit that my previous review may have been somewhat harsh but i have to say that any game that stirs this kind of emotion in me now days deserves some further attention. Indeed this last week for the game has been interesting for the developers with the router and ddos issues they have been having. However aside from attackers making the game all but unplayable for many folks the dev team rolled out many new updates (sometimes several daily). Lets not forget it was prime holiday season too... So my hats off to the team and their devotion to moving the game forward. Updates fixed a number of issues for players including my inability to connect to most of the servers. So I'm inclined to to change my rating and make this a positive recomendation for players who want something different (and initially) very challenging. This game does offer many different elements to appease many different player styles and preferences. The trick now seems to get players to immerse themselves long enough to discover the hidden treasures this alpha title has to offer. On another note im looking forward to the modding communities response to this game. Garry (of garys mod) has stated that this game will be readily moddable as the game moves forward (in fact there are some mods already available!). This should make for fun and diverse playing environments and configs!**old review**this game would be interesting if it were playable yet... Many folks are having problems connecting to any other servers including the official servers. All forum posts in this regard go unanswered with a few possible solutions pointing to the typical or standard affair of 'check your router' or 'check your internet connection'.... And to be honest im getting tired of companies charging money for an incomplete product so WE the gamer can spend our time sorting out their issues... As far as actual gameplay goes I spent an hour dieing of starvation (as there are no sources of food that i was able to find) wandering aimlessly because there is no way to map your surroundings in a setting where most things look alike and the rest of my time trying to figure out how to cook a piece of chicken (which another player was kind enough to give me) over a campfire obecause it isnt clear that i needed to hold down the 'use' button instead of just pressing the 'use' button... Of course once i built a campfire and figured out how to use it i was disconnected for no apparent reason and never was able to reconnect again.... Not my idea of a fun game but I do enjoy the minecraft survival style play idea (with upgraded graphics) though it is nowhere near being a fun playable experience in my opinion. Think ill just wait a few months and try again. maybe my opinion will change after all the paying alpha testers have solved some of their problems for them...,Rust

Definitely a ""mileage may vary"" type game.Even with 4 other friends we struggled to even start the making basic materials to actually survive a night or two. I even watched a near 12 part series of videos explaining the sort of tech path you should be taking. Didn't matter because if you do manage to make a somewhat stable living situation you will either be shot or attacked to the point you bleed to death anyways. Again this is my experience.

2016-12-25,0,0,472,True,Recommended,Where do I even start on a review of Rust? The community in almost every single server is toxic you grind for hours on end only to get everything taken from you and you build a beautiful base only to have it griefed. Yet you keep playing. I outgrew rust but I have to say when I had a few friends playing with and it still had that new game feel it was great. It gave a feeling of desperation when you heard footsteps around you that no horror game could replicate. The sound of rockets blowing your base up gave an adrenaline rush usually reserved for real life events. Everything has consequences and it was great for the first 300 hours or so. Eventually that wears off though just like any game. I won't go into great detail about it since you probably haven't played it yet and probably already know any game can't retain its magic for hundreds of hours. If you have a couple friends and want to feel legitimate fear from losing an item you've grinder for or an endorphin rush from a successful raid this is a great game for you. Facepunch seems dedicated to updates and against any paid DLC unlike Ark.,Rust

2013-12-16,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Don't try this alpha if you are playing alone. A few reasons I've quit playing 99% of players (including people on the supposedly noob friendly servers) will have no hesitation gunning you down in their kevlar armor while you run naked trying to find the resouces you need to survive the first half hour of the game as your health counter trickles down.Talking of resources half of the time you'll spawn somewhere where you can run around for ages without finding some of the crucial starting materials. Rock is hard to find and I've died twice of hunger simply because I've never encountered any animal to kill for food. And even if you finally start getting a handle on things creating shelter and a couple decent weapons someone will break your door while you are logged out and steal everything. Finally the PvE is increadibly boring as once you find a place where animals spawn and you get a bow you'll pretty much never run out of food which takes care of the survival part leaving you with nothing to do except pick fights with other players out of sheer bordom which explains why everybody is at each other's throat all the time.TL DR Boring PvE boring crafting terrible placement of resources and everybody is better equipped than you and will murder you.,Rust

2016-12-23,0,0,455,True,Recommended,I was told by some people on reddit about this game and it took me a few weeks to buy it. First server I joined was an official server. Resources were few and far in between so it was extremely challenging. After joining the rust reddit I found out that as a beginner joining a modded server where supplies are abundant and bases spread out with a wide variety I realized how steep the learning curve can be. Quickly I understood what resources are needed the most how to build a base fortify it and made my fair share of hard to raid bases. I reccomen this game to anyone who likes getting an adrenaline rush from a video game because of the terror many things bring you. After a while I joined back to official servers and quickly established a base raided someone who attacked me and overall accomplished more in a few hours than if I would have stayed on official only. Game is a 9 or 10 out of 10 but added things are always great. I would say giving a player the ability to chose a spawn when naked is a great idea for a an update,Rust

2016-07-06,0,0,308,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game in concept survival base building coop/pvp and it's quite addicting. The problem as most people have pointed out is other players. It becomes obvious fairly quickly that the best way to secure resources is to just take them from other people which sets the unfortunate precident that if you see another person in game that you don't know I'd say there's about a 80 90% chance they will try to kill you regardless of what stage of the game they are in. That said the base building aspect is quite good and assuming you are in a low enough population server you can make some fun fortresses. Just bear in mind that the same people looking to secure resources are going to bomb their way in eventually...,Rust

You can spent time crafting all your as a solo player. Then you can go out with full gear and then you will die when DUO player came up to you. Really find a friend to play with and rust will be a great game. You can have a lot of fun base building and killing other solo player and steal all their loot. wanna play alone? NOPE. Play with a friend Yes. Playing with LOTS OF FRIENDS? OH YEAH!So just do it ... with a friend and dont try to play alone.

2016-12-25,0,0,508,True,Recommended,All the people ing about how the community is toxic are right. but just because they are right doesnt make it a bad game. people who about people killing on sight and what not are just who need to grow a pair and get good. im a solo player the hardest in rust and i dont find it very difficult to get a large base going and get end game items. yea u will get killed a few times off spawn and get rolled by a zerg but thats part of the game. it makes getting that final base all the more rewarding. Rust has a special place in my heart as its the only game that can actually get your heart pumping from being nervous. devs are prob the best for an EA game. 10/10 would kos a person ing about a toxic community again.,Rust
2016-12-25,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Many people on here would say that the game is not worth and due to the community. Based on my expereince with Rust the community is actually very nice. You just have to find a server that is right for you. There are some servers where people have no mercy and will always kill you but it is possible to find a server where people will be willing to help you and guide you in becoming a better player. The only issue I would have to say are minor bugs that can occur such as the animls being able to go through hills and boulders other than that it's a great game. 8/10,Rust

2016-05-21,0,0,238,True,Recommended,This game is one of the most difficult games you will ever play for the sole reason that almost everyone will kill on sight but is this very fact that also makes the game fun. This game can be very rage inducing game but i would reccomend that you persist until you get a solid base set up. The game gets fun at that point and you go from the hunted to the hunter. Overall a very good game with a great idea surrounding it the game is extremely fun so long as you get over all of the kill on sight people and the hackers. But i would say this game is well worth the 20 dollars and it is worth a shot if you enjoy hardcore survival games.,Rust

2016-05-22,0,0,1792,True,Recommended,Where do I begin.....Rust isn't just a game you play. It is a game you become involved in. I have played many hours and invested much time into this game. It has become very rewarding to me. I have met friends and I have many memories. My gamer name General Griefus has spawned from this game. It is not often that you see a game that impacts future games. Rust has come a long way since legacy and I am glad to see they are taking it seriously. For a long time I had doubts on the future. And when they threw out legacy I thought Rust was doomed. But they have made countless updates and have proven to me that they mean to finish this.I highly recommend this game for good memories and good friends 10/10,Rust

Garry would rather make more skins for the game instead of making this a legit real game like I know he has the money for already.

2016-12-27,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I'm so torn with this title. After circling it for quite literally years I finally gathered the muster to purchase it and give it a shot. What I discovered was a delightfully in depth game that held quite a bit of promise. It felt like Minecraft but more realistic. Plus of course the added bonus of graphics that were far more advanced. Most of the crafting system seemed logical and I was able to figure it out without too much help from online tutorials. That being said I'm not (sadly) not sure I could fully recommend the game to new players. Including myself. See this title has been around so long that at this point it has become nigh impossible for any newcomer to advance to the role of high ranking player on any given server. And without a designated single player mode this game is left feeling like a reclusive club that refuses to accept new members. Is it fun? Yes. Should you play it? Perhaps if you can muster up a small group of friends (I'd say around 4 5) that can run around with you and help start something worth protecting. Without said comrades you'll find yourself hopping from sleeping bag to sleeping bag hoping to steal and hide enough materials to one day construct a small hut that might feature a door....if you're lucky.Three Stars,Rust
2016-12-27,0,0,114,True,Recommended,Interesting game.The only downsides is the insane time it takes to get into a server out of the 18 hrs I have logged I think about 10 or so is just connecting to servers either from the queue or the asset loading.,Rust

Would not recommend playing if you battle any sort of depression because when you spend 8 straight hours building a magnificent behemoth of a base and it gets blown to smithereens because you left a crack in your wall you will feel...... things. I have been playing since legacy and let me tell you this game is leaps and bounds better than it used to be. Gary and his team have been pouring weekly updates into this baby for the better half of this year and it shows. Nothing can make you feel the adrenaline or the fear that rust can give you.

2014-03-08,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,"I came into rust with the highest of hopes. ""The game that DayZ should have been "" it was called. Unfortunately I think they've lost the magic.Affordable as far as simplistic solely multiplayer games go and easy to play.People don't like to be told what to do but knowing basically what to do when starting a game is always nice. Rust gives very little ""Hey do this"" when you first start the game and initial confusion is easy but it makes up for this with the game's simplicity of controls. The fact that you can remap all of your keys is a nice addition. The game runs fairly smoothly on the lowest graphics settings so long as you have a decent ping but that's where the smoothness of gaming ends. Ping is not regulated at all and unless you get lucky nine times out of ten you'll find a player whose ping is double their IQ and the chances of you hitting something you can't track are slim to none. This leads me into the hitbox and attack animations. The aiming on every gun in the game leaves something to be desired. Yeah I understand that i've just crafted a gun out of home smelted metal chunks but if it looks like an M4 sounds like an M4 and uses M4 ammo I expect the ironsights (or red dot sight) to be on point like an M4. This however is not the case. The bullet spread (benefit of the doubt on this) is quite large as far as perfect aiming at a perfect target is concerned. Most of the time the gun will fire just off from where you think the center of the sights is. This leads to a waste of valuable ammunition and to you giving away your position and intent.Melee combat is a different beast entirely. Good luck fighting anything with a rock hatchet or pickaxe. Melee combat feels slow and uncomfortable. It's basically one big game of strafing roulette. Try to time the 1 3 second down swing to perfectly match you crossing into where the enemies' hitbox would/could/should be and if you miss hope he doesn't hit you either. (If it's an npc you had better have those bandages ready... npcs don't miss.) The developers have tinkered with the ammounts that different items heal you and there's not much to be said for that except that if you're bleeding you need bandages or medkits and no healing is instant.Base building used to be nice until one of the more recent updates rendered laying a foundation about as rewarding as a game of russian roulette. The foundation SHOULD and USED TO glow red when you couldn't place it and glow green when you could. Now it glows green you try to place it and it breaks successfully wasting the 8 planks (and I assume scrap metal) and valuable time spent crafting it. Did you get lucky and manage to place a foundation erect walls and a doorway (metal door recommended) and slap on an indestructable ceiling? Well then you had better hope that nobody has explosives. One well placed explosive charge will turn your wooden wall or door into sawdust leaving your valuable 9mm reserves open to looters.Should the NPC base in this game even be reviewed? The devs have stated that it's open to change and has already undergone one drastic change. The initial builds had two types of zombies infesting the areas near towns. Now mutant red war painted animals roam the landscape thirsty for blood and packing unrealistic ammounts of .223 rounds and metal building supplies. Every animal in the game drops chicken breasts. I'm not really sure what to say about that other than that it seems Rust Island might be part of the Matrix...Tools which are fairly hard to come by when you're a fresh spawn now have a durability rating and can break after enough use. This feature is certainly unwelcome as the game gives no indication of how to repair the useless item which is now taking up a valuable inventory slot. If anything it's just maddening.PVP is ruthless merciless traitorous and overall something which renders the game impossible to play on well populated servers. If a group or individual holds the power they will never relinquish said power. The endless supply of craftable guns and armor stacked with the veteran player's ability to craft advanced items like weapon attachments and metal housing leaves the group with power in power and leaves anyone unfortunate enough to cross their path minus any carried supplies.While you can share your door code with friends you cannot create a party or see your friend's location in the world. This makes playing with a trustworthy group very difficult as it is impossible to keep track of who has died who is alive and who is about to plunge their pickace into your back.The ammount of bugs and troublesome features/updates far outweigh in my opinion this game's fairly affordable price and potential to be the next big pvp survival game. 5/10.",Rust

You can run for miles all you will see are rocks trees some bugged out animals water bases and barrels.You need to smash barrels for everything at it's core its simply a smash barrel simulator.Wouldnt play this game if you paid me per hour time is more valuable than money and it sure aint worth wasting on trash like this ""survival"" game.IF YOU ENJOY STARING AT YOUR SCREEN SMASHING BARRELS PLAYING WITH THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY OUT OF ALL GAMES IN THIS GENRE &amp PVP WITH NO OTHER CONTENT THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!",Rust

I can't say that I would ever reccomend this game to anyone and it has nothing to do with the game itself. It's the community that makes this game unplayable for us. We eventually found a server where we weren't immediately killed on sight as nakeds and managed to get a small base built only to have the server admin abuse power and jack his friends up with gear. We left that server and literally every other server we tried it was like this....spawn take 5 steps start harvesting wood get shot dead. rinse. repeat ad nauseum.The game isn't bad....but the community is absolute sh it and renders the game unplayable.

2016-12-29,0,0,108,True,Recommended,This is by far one of the best games I've played. Unlike Valve Facepunch has spent the last few years developing this amazing survival game and listening to the commmunity not just updating the sounds. I'm honestly suprised at how Facepunch is willing to put up with the whining the community has thrown at them over the past years while they practicaly gave them what they wanted. If you end up getting bored which I doubt you will there are multiple different server types you can play on such as builder (build whatever you want with unlimited materials no pvp) Hunger Games etc. Ever since the very early alpha (before experimental) the game has been very enjoyable to play and it's mindblowing how far it has come. I can't wait for the full release and support facepunch all the way. Don't listen to the reviews from salty players who just got killed in game. It is honestly great and if you are in a server with s just find a different one.,Rust

2016-05-05,0,0,151,True,Recommended,I just want to say that if you are a player who gives up easily don't play.Look the game is one of the best survival games out there. the visuals are great animals provide a challenge throughout the game and wolf hunts are one of my favorite pastimes once I get far enough to enjoy it. There are almost 100 blueprints to study to progress beyond the starters of cheap bow and makeshift shotty. There are five tiers of blueprints ranging from painting frames to assault rifles. The main problem is the toxic community but for some reason after more than my share of shameless murders by others I keep coming back. The main reason for this is that feeling when you fight someone who is at your level and win. it shows that you have skill and sometimes when you slip through the cracks of end gamers and you will eventually then you can have your own base make huge progress and become one of those end gamers that patroll the roads killing humans for sport. And that is the reason I give this game an 8/10.,Rust

2016-11-23,0,0,1671,True,Recommended,What to say about Rust... I've played Rust since it's original (legacy) version and I've had times where I've played nothing but this game for a month straight and where I've ignored this game for a months straight. Rust is frustrating because you can work for hours to achieve something go to get lunch and by the time you're back a group of ten raided your base and stole everything you achieved for. However when in a group of ten you off the entire server and get raided and lose all your loot.Idk I'm just writing this to get the Steam Awards badge.8.5/10,Rust

2016-08-11,0,0,172,True,Recommended,I have only played 44 hours as i write this review but the game is amazing. Yes it is an aplha and yes it is probably the longest alpha ever BUT the game is amazing. Being able to build and group up and attack is awesome. The only real problem is the AI's for the animals. They can get stuck in rocks to forever rotate in and through and around a rock or other building. The bear's and wolf's can attack from like 30 yards out and are impossible to kill without about 20 pistol rounds. Overall the game is great. If the deadly creatures were not so bugged it would be perfect. Im glad it is a aplha so people can not bash the game for being a full released game but yet always had the bugged animals. THE BIGGEST AND GREATES PART OF THIS GAME IS &gt THEY UPDATE VERY FREQUENT. They have updated this game 4 times since i have owned it.,Rust

2015-06-29,0,0,228,True,Not Recommended,Hacking Simulator 2015.I'm updating this review jokes aside to say that this game is really fun to play by yourself (smashing people in the head with rocks) or in a group (raiding exploring etc.). There is a load of content that could be made for this game but the devs are working on the most basic functionality each week which is of course very exciting.Those who do not know Rust is made by Facepunch the company that is well known for creating Garry's Mod and is therefore lead by Garry Newman who I have full trust in in creating a full survival game sandbox that is constantly innovating and bringing out cool new features.You can build a house hunt chickens for wolf meat craft weapons shoot bows. It is more than a PvP game the whole thing is a social experiment! It reflects on the actions of people to decide it's outcome sure you'll probably be killed a few times by naked strangers but in the end you will find someone that won't kill you on sight and that person will be your friend.

2014-03-15,0,0,131,True,Not Recommended,"It has promise I'll give it that. However the explosives grenades airdrops and modern machine guns really ruin the game as it is described. There really is no ""survival"" aspect to it at all unless you're referring to surviving PVP. The PVE aspect of the game needs a great deal of development IMO. After about an hour's playing time the only thing that ever hurt me from the environment was falling from a height. In two days I had gone from a naked rock weilding caveman to a SWAT member in kevlar with an assault rifle and enough breaching charges to get into most buildings. In fact it takes more time gathering resources to keep people out than it does to get in. And don't get lost! There is no compass only a road map (not even topographic) that isn't even available in the game you have to alt+tab to your browser to look at it. And if you were thinking of navigating by the sun forget it! I've seen the sun rise and set in the west on the same day. And yes i'm sure I was standing on the west coast looking out at the water! How is it I can get mission control? to airdrop me explosives but I can't get a compass?Plays more like a slow Unreal Tournament than a survival sim. The game really only has two modes the slow grinding of rocks and wood piles (yes wood piles.. someone has kindly cut limbed and bucked your wood for you leaving it in a nice little pile on the side of the road) and the ""oh someone's shooting at me!"" mode of PVP. After a few days you really only have fun in PVP. I realize the game is still in alpha and hopefully Garry or others on the dev team read this. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the survival aspect of the game. Farming livestock maybe? More options when building would be nice especially the ability to remove foundations and pillars. Maybe more than two building resources? Concrete? Also struts and structural members besides pillars. I dislike not having the ability to build out from a structure.My number one gripe with this game? How in the hell do you make an M4 with nothing but sheet metal and a rock? Where are the tools where are the abilities? What sense of accomplishment does the game hold? It only took me two days to learn to make everything! After that it's just PVP.I would say unless you're looking for a war game with a few other things to keep you occupied between battles or you're a big fan of having your stuff blown into and getting your head bashed in with a rock while you're asleep at night wait until this game is in beta or beyond.

2016-07-31,0,0,149,True,Not Recommended,I got this game and it was amazing. Truely great game design where the gameplay could go from fully satisfying while you had under control to absolute mad rage whenever you would lose all your earnings to a raider or unexpected bear. However I have recelntly quit playing this game since the XP update. Instead of a game with unexpected turns and twists we now have a game where nearly everyone is freindly to new players on the server and giving them items for that sweet free XP portion when they use them you are relentlessly grinding XP and levels for a predifined curve of items to unlock instead of the randomness and risk of blueprint hunting and the monuments are now nearly useless (because there is no desire to loot what once was blueprints) unless you are just joining a server and in need for tools and food which you could much easily get from the supplying veterens of the server in trade of being their XP slave. Once this game was about luck skill and risks but it is now primarily focused on grinding. IMO you would be better of buying farming simulator if you are into endlessly harvesting resources.,Rust

We all gather materials to make a pretty nice base and we fortified it and made it all nice before we logged out for the night. My other friend got off and so now we were going to head off Rust but we wanted to make sure that the base was all secure before getting off. When we did that a bear glitched up over the rocks that our base was in and killed my friend. We decided to log off with the bear in our base because it would help protect our base while we were off.

This game is a FPS shooter with building and crafting.. But more on the FPS side..You can watch twitch to get an idea of the game...The game in vanilla form.? Well just leave that to groups clans and more than 2 people playing at one time..The balancing the devs are doing is more to control groups/clans.. ( rightfully so )I wish the devs would quit thinking ""No wipes"" because alot of the community plays for 3 5 days then stops untill it wipes.. It should be a 5 day wipe cycle and the devs just accept that...You can watch this every week people jump on Thursdays and by Monday / Tuesday the servers are dead.. Most of the time it don't pick back up untill the server wipes..I have to say this is a really great game and the new era of ""FPS games""..The old days of spawn die spawn die rinse and repeat have hit a peak in terms of popularity. ( CSGO COD BF etc... )This game is the newer slower type of FPS game.. Build a base to protect and help protect you while you learn to run around like a crazy maniac stealing and killing.. ( 2 of the worst things in real life ironic it's what this game is about )For first time players.. Do your self a favor and go strait to modded servers.. This way you can get a feel for all of the items in game.. If you do go into the ""vanilla"" servers. You will rage quit and want to never play again.. You have been warned.Devs have tried to make this game suited for solo players but it just don't work and makes the groups/clans only get stronger..Vanilla is for veterans and groups/clans...Modded is the communities way of ""balancing"" the game for solo players.. It works quite well really...I am an older gamer I was playing CS 1.0 back in 2000 2002 so my ""clans"" have all grown up.. Also having a full time career makes being in a ""group/clan"" not feesable...I have found alot of love in this game from the modded community.. And thankfully so.. I enjoy the game so much more than the wasted time on vanilla.. I do recommend this game it is one of the best games I have played..Just don't go onto the ""Official"" servers unless you have 2 or more other people to play with..

2017-01-14,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,This is a very good survival game but i think that it would be better if we can have a world that only people we invite can play. The server and maps also take too long to load and only end up getting killed by resource rich people who are already geared up with the best stuff in the game. Its kinda good but its too hard.

I would recommend a game that is fully finished over Rust.

2016-11-27,0,0,295,True,Not Recommended,I remember when I played in the legacy days and why I quite. Right before Rust got put onto the new version it was horribly toxic and full of hackers on my servers.People would use notepad++ turn off doors walls whatever sleeping bag through a door they couldn't see kill themselves and repeat until they got to loot. One person could destroy everything in a night two people could take an inventory of your best doodoo and destroy the rest. Eventually the only way to get past this was a few things.Put barriers everywhere hackers have to now turn off an extra thing in order to kill you or destroy it. also fill the entire floor with boxes so they have to detroy it to sleeping bag through. also spikes everywhere possible so they can't fly through.Also a glitch where you could stack an infinite amount of stairs on one block so you could spend hours destroying a few hundred stairs/ramps that were put on one block.Also every server with any players was abolutely filled with hackers.I remember a community that was only mostly KOS where you could join massive groups and you could trade with people and only be murdered some of the time. And even then its a hunt. You track that group down and they know they're being hunted. They need to fortify or always be moving loot and hoping to not get killed on transport missions.But the community is now somehow more KOS and while I'm not entirely sure if the hacker issue is as bad as before but if it still is you need to ask what it is worth. This game has been in development for years and the biggest thing I can say is now it looks prettier.I wouldn't be surprised if people can still turn off doors and walls with some exploit or another or some hack and just destroy literally every box in your house. It was happening for a long time in many different ways in legacy and don't be surprised if it's still happening in the current but for all I know it isn't.I was in one of the largest groups on a large public server and there were amazing all nighter raids trading missions having to do espionage and get door codes from a guy and pretend to join his clan to be able to have an easier time on raiding missions.It was awesome.But the only way to have the truly awesome experiences in Rust are to play every or almost everyday and join a massive group.So if you want to play wait for a sale and commit a summer to it and then never touch it again.,Rust

Life essence. Never again obtainable. I can understand raiding but when I log back on the server to find my entire base's structure removed I can only assume hacking or Admin abuse. That is only one incident I have been killed countless times while farming PvPing by hackers. Seen speed hackers roaming the plainsFly hackers soaring through the skiesBeen shot through walls. Yes no clipping bullets... or was he invisible? Come back to completely empty crates playing solo.When the hacking ping situaion is fixed I will change it to a Positive review.,Rust

2016-08-25,0,0,299,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game is everything you could want in a real apocalyptic survival game. First and foremost it is in beta any complaints about lag glitches and the like are just silly because that's the whole point of a game going through alpha/beta otherwise it would just be called released. Second and what should be more important gameplay. The concept is basic but great you wake up with nothing (realistically no stat pants couldn't hurt haha) and every piece of resource you need you have to gather. One issue on some servers is that resources aren't spawning quickly enough or at all from what I hear but that's because the game is in alpha... aside from spawning rates resource execution is great maybe in the future they will reskin some rocks to look like discarded metal for realism but as far as gameplay goes it's all the same. In a real survival situation you wouldn't find piles of a variety of resources naturally just some wood and minerals. Animals are scarce in some areas and that's completely realistic too unless you're on a farm if there was real life apocalypse you would not see bears and boars walking around main paths constantly. The sleeping bag is a great feature. You can save a spawn point and use a metal door to hopefully keep your things safe. This allows you to actually form alliances and make friends but doesn't add a ""haven/neutral"" point in the game which makes it so much more exciting. Lastly community discussion. Yes the people are mean and vicious and perhaps they are kids (I like how that's become an insult these days it's a videogame for Christ's sake!). This is what makes this game great. Who expects there to be tons of people out there willing to help others and extend trust and a welcoming hand to total strangers in an apocalypse? Most people you run into will be desperate and selfish some well run the other direction because they are scared lots will become bullies because they can and a few will begin to band together in these beginning stages of hard times. This is what I've come across so far playing the game and this is what makes it pee your pants scary...what I assume you were looking for when you bought this game. For anyone who wants a nice community with easy to gather resources and mobs that hit you for 3% of your health play minecraft. For those who played for 30 mins or an hour and got tired of crap server lag and crashes and glitchy gameplay just keep in mind it's in alpha and will get better.

2016-09-03,0,0,177,True,Not Recommended,ok at first i found the game new and exciting learning the machanics of the game but not long after you realise the truth of the game if you arnt in a clan or dont have the best equipment/weapons then you will get mowed down everytime you see someone and even if you manage to build a base the next day when you log in you'll find it destroyed or looted or both unless its made from the best materials.How the game stands now is if you are a new player you dont stand a chance. if you play every day or have other people helping you especially when you are not on line then you can survive.This game has potential but not at the moment. it totally screws over new players and helps the long term players that is if you can even get started when all you have is a rock a 1 minute into the game you are kill by someone with an AK47 with a scope and metal armour.,Rust

2016-08-22,0,0,710,True,Recommended,"Best $20 I've ever spent. People don't understand that this game is still in development. It offers endless fun great player interactions and high stakes competetive gameplay. None of the big things people complain about are actually that serious. Clans while abundant (I am in one) TEND to fight amongst each other. Solo or 2 3 player bases are way more plentiful. Besides clans are literally suggested in the game description... ""Create alliances with other players and form a town."" People just get upset when they get killed by someone with a clan tag. Yet they have no problem playing and building with 5 of their friends not wearing a tag and going out killing/raiding. Cause that's totally not the same exact thing... There's a bit of a learning curve but honestly it's worth it. My piece of advice to anyone starting out is just to remember that it's only a game. You will die you will lose all your hard work and you will be FURIOUS. Just let it go and start hitting trees. When you end up on the opposite end of that it'll all be worth it.",Rust

2016-08-14,0,0,451,True,Not Recommended,This game is not only fun it's highly discoverable and surprisingly stable. I had a memory leak crash leaving it open overnight and it often crashes on exit when it doesn't matter but I've really experienced no other problems. I have a kind of weird semi budget PC (FX8350 2xZotac 950 AMP! in SLI) and I can crank up the quality at 1920x1200 and get good frame rates. The graphics are worlds ahead of anything else in the genre and the interface is absolutely top notch.The down side is that you will get massively griefed even on servers that claim to be against griefing... which to me pretty much ruins the experience. So I wouldn't pay for this game (I got is as part of a humble bundle) but I would play it... on a private server. Unfortunately there is no other single player mode but to run your own server wihch requires that you download the game all over again as usual. Ah Steam. If you don't like getting griefed you will need a private server period.,Rust

So far Steam has been pretty easy to use and it does look very good overall especially the store! That's not the point tho! Point is It's easy to get into but hard to masterAt times really punishing but can also be really rewardingIncredibly fun to play with friends not so much soloThe social aspect of the game makes it very interesting to playProbably the most important thing Rust is contantly updatingI'm glad I gave the game a chance and don't consider any minute wasted on it.XP Update It's alright needs tweaking.

2014-01-09,0,0,201,True,Recommended,it has alot of potential good graphics and an over all fun atmospher. with that said even though its almost impossible but geting rid of the hackers would be a great thing. spending hours building your base just to have it hacked into ruins the fun of the game. finding craftable items is fun but once you got most of them trying to find the few you need is a pain and most players who don't need anything wont trade. very few gun attachments would like to see more and more guns armor monster or animals. a mini map or some sort of map would make navigation easyer but its more fun to try to remember ware everything is. over all i would recomend this game only because of the survial tower deffence. im sure once it is outa alpha it will be a bit better.,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,176,True,Recommended,Absolutely even as an alpha though there may be hackers. Hackers are being dealt with as a top priority. Fun game to play with a group of friends. Or stick it out solo and have a more tense experience.,Rust

I nearly myself as I began to run from him. He laughed with delight as I fled saying all sorts of serial killer things and for the first time in a video game I was scared to my core. It felt like this was all was real... In an attempt to lose him I ducked into a radioactive town full of zombies and bears.

2016-08-23,0,0,57,True,Recommended,The game is very addictive and even though it's still in alpha it has a lot of content you'll easily sink tons of hours into this I've been playing for less than a week and already have 40 hours.However and do keep this in mind this is an alpha game so many thinks are still broken and the game does not run well by any stretch of the imagination. That said it is playable and enjoyable and the devs are constantly updating the game with meaningful content. There is a community but it's pretty hit or miss I recommend you try a few servers before you stick with one. Is it worth the 20$ right now? If you can look past the obvious alpha issues yes but if that's the sort of thing to ruin your experience I'd wait at least until it goes into beta.,Rust

2017-08-02,0,0,147,True,Recommended,If you are thinking about buying this game I recommend playing in an empty and non popular servers first. Servers that are full/popular make it very difficult to learn the game and if you have no knowledge of the game I would also recommend watching youtube videos on how to build. Unfortunatly instructions are not given to player well so immediatly you begin to feel lost and annoyed. When you know what you are looking for and understand how to obtain the things you want the game becomes more of what i believe the developer intended. At least thats when I began to have fun. The game on it's own without players is quite fun as well just to survive and build.,Rust

Can't wait for the game to be finished.! ) ( won't be for awhile )EDIT Since my last review I have grown tired of this game and now hate it. Every server I join has little squekers with almost everything killing me.It takes me almost 3 trys to get a base going without getting killed by people with overkill gear but after awhile I get raided by people that have been on the server for ever and have alot of I came to the point where I cant even enjoy this game anymore.

2017-02-10,0,0,3023,True,Recommended,I purchased this game years ago when it showed it had zombies. After playing for a week or two they removed the zombies for radiation animals. Then they switched to the new system they're using now. Over all this time I managed to spend 2300 hours on it. Def worth the 20$. Battlefield servers are absolutely a blast. Recommend for everyone to get. Although I would suggest ages 15+ as the characters ar naked and there's lots of profanity and racial slurs. The only cons i have with the game is the consistent memory leak. And the fact you don't get to choose your character. I was once a man then randomly I came on and I'm permanently stuck as a female. Absolutely hate this.,Rust

2017-02-10,0,0,274,True,Recommended,Rust is a game where you lose. And then you win and sometimes both at the same time. Rust is a good go to for evicting children from a hovel made of twigs and broken dreams midnight swordfights against legions of russians with rocks or some good ol' fashion divination through the scabs of your most recent encounter. In my opinion if you want to play rust there isn't really an alternative. Rust provides it's own experience that once was excruciatingly cancerous groups of 70 with unlimited firearms and impenetrable bases no longer no more. With blueprints gone there is no quarter for zergs the game has come into it's own firearms are a chance luxury and playing on high population servers means everyone is on edge and jittery you can kill that dude with the AK so long as you have something sharp to poke them with. Rust is most enjoyable in the early pre wipe stages where guns are an extreme rarity or on medieval/primitive servers where meme magic wins most fights. No roof camping nobody has a roof. The playing field is level and for those first 24 hours the game plays like DayZ but replace the survivors and guns with Zulus and spears. Rust is spear chucking steel swinging child murdering goodness. Rust is what you make of it compare my review to other people's and see the difference in perception. Rust is it's own thing with it's own idea in everyone's eyes. Rust is the 46 to my 2.Playing Rust is like selling motorcycles. You work 47 hours a week 11 hours a day on weekdays and maybe just maybe you'll make some big score from some rich looking to trade in his Spyder.You will lose but your victories will be forever.I will now post the lyrics to TOOL's song Lateralus.

Got to stab a guy with my spear when I spawned right when he was looting.It would be nice to have more servers without the ability to blow up a house ( C4 rocket launchers ). That would really help for people that cant play every day. It would be cool having to stalk your prey outside their houses instead of just blowing your way in. But thats just me ing.

2016-01-31,0,0,422,True,Recommended,"Rust is... complicated. Writing a review is hard when I have mixed feelings about it but I'll try. I'll start by saying I would reccomend it but not if you are easily angered by dying a lot and having everyone try to kill you regardless if you just spawned.The gameplay Pros It's a fun game and has amazing concepts for building and all that. Having to build everything you own is a really really rewarding thing when you step back look at your base your gear and you just say ""yeah... yeah I did all this."" It's like Minecraft int hat regard. It's just amazing when you make something and really like it too. Guns are crazy hard to use at times but once you get used to it PVP and PVAI is really fun. Bows are great for starter weapons and they keep adding more great stuff. It's a good game in these regards.Cons Alpha so expect a ton of glitches and bugs at times when they add new stuff. Sometimes stuff breaks but Gary's pretty on top of getting it fixed. He's a solid developer. For sure. However he has been making some mistakes in my opinion. These mistakes are that some of the things he's adding and thing he is implimenting make it easier to play when you have a group but if you are solo you better get to be a good shot and quick because gathering materials and building as a solo player is not only difficult because of the amount of folks trying to kill you all at once but also difficult because of the sheer amount of you have to collect to make a respectable somewhat resilient to raids base. The amount needed is really only obtainable in two ways. You either have a huge group say 4+ people or you're only getting supplies by either killing everyone you see who's walking around for what they have on them or raiding someone elses base or a groups base (while they are offline and getting the stuff to build C4 and Rockets takes you guessed it a big group or killing folks wo are out and about). Pretty much if you're solo you have to kill. If you're a group you can gather but it's easier to just kill everyone. This brings us to...The Community Pros Finding a group when you find one it's really fun. You can build gear and bases on a quick and crazy scale very quickly. Getting into a group while hard when no one trusts one another is well worth it. You can trade with people if you want to go try to find blueprints (which you need to build most gear and nice things like external walls and traps). However this comes at the risk of that person deciding to just shoot you and taking what you have. With that in mind trade with caution. Cons Oh dear God. Everyone's an hole. Everyone. If you aren't you get rolled. If you are you get rolled. If you are an hole in a group of holes you're going to do alright if you guys are good shots and good at raiding. Other than that expect to die and have people talking crap to you. A... Lot... Like... a whole hell of a lot. Honestly other than League of Legends this community is probably one of the most toxic.In conclusion It's great fun when you are with a lot fo people the game play is great when bugs are being kept up on and when you are in servers owned by other players you aren't going to run into hacking a whole lot because admins are on it pretty well. The community has it's moments but we're mostly holes. I'd give this game a solid 7/10. It's not a bad choice if you want a fun survival PVP game. It's worth the money but you need to have a lot of time to dedicate and a thick skin and low temper.",Rust

Rust is being changed a lot and this obviously comes with lots of updates and server wipes which if you have spent a long time deovted to one base and one server it is very VERY disapointing to see it all taken away.

2016-02-22,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,"""It's playable solo"" Right. When most all players kill you on sight with guns crossbows etc. How can you possibly play alone? How can you possibly play at all? Make a base as a new player learning? Good luck when you log off to go to work you'll be dead and ruined while you're off. Trying to gather materials to get restarted? Good luck that guy over there has a gun and he's been watching. He'll kill you just 'cause ""Rust."" My chief regret was not realizing this sooner. Thought it would be awesome based on watching some funny Youtubers play. Wrong. ""So find a non PVP server"" so then you can't really learn how to play competitively. No chance to learn no chance for fun. Deleting and regretting the fact that I can't get a refund.",Rust

2016-02-22,0,0,168,True,Not Recommended,Great game! I have had alot of fun with it for the two weeks and nearly 85 hours I have played in it. I finally got a good amount of BP's and built a really nice base. I dont mind getting raided because its part of the game. But when a hacker just flys on my roof and waits for me to go outside and then proceeds to enter my house it is just beyond frustrating. I have been killed by aimbot countless time. I have had hackers go threw my walls and steal my loot and take over my base. But the worst thing of all was I had my official server deleted. After all these hours the server is just deleted. So with that said it is pretty frustrating game where you finally get going and start to have fun then you must restart because your server was just deleted.,Rust

2016-02-23,0,0,200,True,Not Recommended,The building and scavenging reminded me alot of minecraft. The gunplay and other player versus player mechanics reminded me alot of Call of Duty. This whole game is a grind. To get yourself built up.. only to fall sometime in the future. Whether it be to other players griefing your base and taking all your things or server wipes. All in all.. I can't reccomend this game to anyone who doesn't like 'farming' for hours upon hours.,Rust
2016-02-23,0,0,398,True,Recommended,As all of these survival games are slowly dying due to lack of dedication and consistent updates. This one has seemed to keep me coming back even after long periods of break. The game looks great runs great and has very dedication devs constantly adding great new things to the game and its only getting better. They have big plans that I am very excited for. I've been playing this game since Legacy and from that day on I knew this was one to keep my out for. Just buy it its a bargain for 20 dollars.,Rust

2016-09-25,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,The game has potential but the inability to defend yourself early on any kind of populated server is kind of t. If you get lucky and survive long enough before getting raided by fully armed s who do nothing but troll you to get a base that takes you 8 10 hours to build you will realize that it is easily destroyed by the same s that just run in and blow everything up. Good luck getting solid enjoyment. If you enjoy wasting hours of you life on a game then buy this and prepare to get raided by english boys.,Rust
2016-09-26,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Rust is a great time killer and honestly you can make some great friends. It's fun entertaining and there's always a lot to get done and to do. Pros Pretty simple when you get to it Crafting / building is fun Teaming up / raids / looting Good multiplayer system XP / levelling up Super pro You might catch someone naked running away screaming which is such a weird but beautifully entertaining sight.Cons Still a bit buggy animals can run through rocks. Optimisation isn't greatOverall I'd definitely recommend it. It has its faults but I think the fun makes up for it.,Rust

2016-09-26,0,0,15,True,Recommended,A good game with many flaws. The game relies way too much on the kindess of other players or rather relies too way too much on other players not ruining your fun. I spent 7 hours of game play to find a server where I wouldn't be KOS by any player until I found a server that had very few players on it at all and even then after many more hours of painstaking farming of stone and wodd and other materials I had made a house I could be proud of to then have some little rat of a player put a code on lock on my door stopping me from getting in to my own house. The game either needs a single player mode easier access to private server for just yourself and maybe some friends or better security on having other players not be able to modify your creations. The bade idea of the game is very good but I have been brought to genuine anger by a game because other players are terrible people and that does not make a game fun.,Rust

Only down side i hate which is making me no longer want to play the game is how it erases everything sometimes after an update. i can understand if its an official server however if it is my own server i should be able to set it not to wipe all the hard work and time i spend in the game.

2016-08-01,0,0,194,True,Not Recommended,Rust has always been a truly amazing game since legacy but the devs wanted more. They made a new game and it was fun for some time but with recent updates it is going downhill. A lot of people will agree with me all of these new nerfs are making the game almost unplayable if you want to play alone. The game is currently ruled by big clans I recommend that you wait some time if you want to enjoy Rust by yourself or with a friend. l Please devs stop changing the game it is getting worst and worst by the update.,Rust

2014-12-23,0,0,1752,True,Recommended,The below review is a few months old now so I've decided to add a quick update. I think most of the bugs have been fixed and Rust is finally starting to run smoothly. FPS is decent even on low end PC's.The game has been seriously overhauled and it feels like they have employed some good game devs as of late because it's really reflected in the gameplay. Rust looks and plays great. I've changed my recommendation to a thumbs up once again. I've played Rust since it was first released on Steam and have over 420 hours played at the time of writing this. In it's original legacy format the game felt fresh and exciting. Fast forward some time and we have something that's completely unrecognizable to it's predecessor.The Rust development team felt that they needed to completely overhaul the game and that they did. So over the past few months we've been subject to an array of changes and updates. On any given day a player can login to the game to see a completely changed game experience. This has it's good points and bad points. The good points being that you know the Facepunch Studios team is actively working on the game unlike some other early access titles. However the drastic changes with every major update feels like they don't have any real direction with where they want to take the game.Last week for example the game was updated every single day somedays even twice in the same day. That resulted in a poor experience for the average gamer as it forced servers to consistently wipe user's creations every day. It also made it difficult for server admins to maintain a user base. The patches that were released were poor and full of bugs. It's quite clear what the dev team has done and that's solely rely on the players to test the game for bugs. Now don't get me wrong the game is fun and has great potential. But I feel that they could improve the user experience if they released patches on a strict schedule and tested them thoroughly before a public release. The need to resolve these issues is pressing as the craft/survival genre space is becoming extremely crowded and competition is getting stiff. Facepunch studios need to decide soon where exactly they want their game to be within 6 months and focus on that so the experience for the average game is improved. Rust has so much potential but it's ruined by amateur software developers who are incapable of releasing patches correctly.,Rust

2016-09-17,0,0,615,True,Recommended,Can't see why there have been so many negative reviews of rust recently. A lot of them seem to be blaming admins of community servers which has nothing to do with facepunch/the devs of this game. The only thing wrong with it atm is the xp system which as it's early access was to see if it works and if people like it. They'll more than likely be removing it and I've honestly never seen devs put so much dedication into their game in a long long time. I 100% recommend this game to pretty much anyone. Obviously it's a lot more fun with friends but you can play solo or make friends in game and still have loads of fun.,Rust

2017-01-24,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Is this game worth $20? Hmm maybe. To be honest I would consider it more along the lines of a $15 game however when you throw in the fact that there's a good modding community massive server wars (always fun) servers are usually always high pop and the fact that the game has only gotten better over time I'd say the $20 price tag may not be as steep as you think. The game definitely is fun and enjoyable don't play with a low spec rig though you do need some good hardware for this game.,Rust

2017-07-10,0,0,236,True,Recommended,"More than 100+ hours logged? Its time to write a review....Rust is an interesting game filled with fun at the best and worst of times and savagery during both as well. I used to run with a clan that had players in lots of different timezones and we ran shifts that were timezone specific. This highlights an important feature of Rust....It is always active and full of life.One thing about Rust is that its always active....meaning that you must constanly log to make sure your fortress wasn't raided while you were offline and thus defenseless (unless you had turrets).A good experience that also highlights the savagery in the game is when a friend and I had played together in a Battlefield server. We had trekked up a mountain while under withering fire from fresh spawns and sniper towers we must've spent an hour merely reaching the top as we had to make constant battle with said sniper towers. When we finally reached the top my friend and I built our own tower to stake our claim and to also snipe fresh spawns from (relative) safety.Low on fun as we were we started a sniper war with a pair of people that were previously allies as we shot them in the back when we entered their house and were distracted with shooting a couple fresh spawns from their perch. All the while my friend was shouting ""It's RUST not TRUST!""Overall with the new blueprint system and the awesome attention the Devs put to the community I would reccomend this game to anyone into survival/sandbox games!",Rust

If this ever changes I'll redact this but as of right now having spent ten dollars on a product that doesn't work and not being able to get refunded for choosing to try to fix said product instead of return it because that's how much I wanted to play it gives me the moral right to leave a big salty thumbs down.,Rust

2016-11-23,0,0,1220,True,Not Recommended,I recently gave up ark for this game and played the weekly wipes because I was really enjoying it. But now we have Aimcone added which is complete garbage. If you have no skill at firing a gun this game is for you. The gunshots are completely RNG doesn't matter how good your aim is just spray and pray you'll kill em. The devs do not listen to anything we want and the community sucks. Instead of getting the game in working order or reverting the recoil people are suggesting lawn mowers and more useless roleplay crap which is why the game is in it's current state anyways.Servers last 3 4 days on max and a few hours into wipe the servers will be cut in half.,Rust
2015-02-01,0,0,1327,True,Recommended,"Rust is an open sandbox game with servers as populated as 350 people playing at a given time on a single server. I have been playing ""early access"" for around two years now. Every week they post a devblog with significant improvements to the game. Sometimes these improvements will be gameplay tweaks performance tweaks or new content altogether. I actually look forward to reading their weekly devblog to see what they have added next. It really is that frequent to see development progress. It's the ultimate ""early access"" game that spoils the fan base.The game has an intuitive user interface that is clean and simple. It has basic gameplay mechanics so you don't have to worry about binding 20 keys (no proning leaning crouch running etc). The basic movement mechanics compliments the extensive crafting library nicely.The best part of this game is that there is not a storyline to follow. You create your own story. Want to climb up in the mountains with a friend and try to survive? Want to explore towns and try to find a weapon so you can attack random people? Want to open up your own store shop and sell items to other players? What to build a shack in a cave and scare the bajeezus out of others that are exploring? Want to build a mega secure base that perhaps nobody can penetrate? Want to build up an arsenal and raid an unfriendly neighbor and take all of their loot? Want to build a trap base and watch people turn the corner and get blasted by your shotgun trap? All of these things (and more) are possible in this entertaining and exciting game.With all of that said this game is not for the newbs. If you're a newb you will likely struggle. It's also important to play with friends. If you have nobody to play with find one in the server.Cheating can certainly be a problem so find a community server that has active admins. As long as admins are active they can keep things under control.I highly recommend this game.",Rust

2017-07-12,0,0,63,True,Recommended,Great game honestly. Or maybe the concept of the game. The game still has to be polished and balanced out. One thing I can say to people that are looking to buy this game if you can't spend 3 hours per day on the game don't buy it. You won't get far with that kind of playtime it requires a lot of attention especially when most servers are wiped every week. Getting back to actual gameplay starting out is probably the iest part (duh) because you can't find any stone. You can farm loads of wood but you need rock to really get things going. Oh and in my region (Lithuania) there are not a lot of non Russian servers. ing hell why is that? Couldn't you Facepunch just let us decide what servers we want to see and which one's to filter out? That really bothered me. All in all great game really fun even going solo is a really fun experience.6/10,Rust

2017-07-12,0,0,249,True,Recommended,Rust is incredibly addicting you'll lose hours playing it when it only feels like minutes. The challenges presented within the game always have your mind going and wondering just what you'll have to do next to survive. Everything from a hunger bar being too low to happening upon another play who is fully armed can pose as a threat and the quick thinking required makes it a fast paced and entertaining game. 10/10,Rust

2017-06-27,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"Not going to waste any time on this game. It's impossible to play when other people keep offing you the second they see you. Even on a ""noob friendly"" server I got killed within 30 minutes of spawning. Didn't even have time to build a base or any real weapons. It was a lot of running around collecting wood rocks and cloth and then I lost it all within 2 seconds of seeing a guy off in the distance. Not even self defense. I wasn't anywhere near him. He just fired two shots into me and that's it game over time to do everything all over again. I don't even have the motivation now to continue playing because why even waste your time trying to start something and build a base if some with a better weapon than you decides to end your game just to loot a few things off your corpse.This game is just like all the rest wasting your time collecting resources that you're gonna lose very quickly to s with guns who dont REALLY need those 30 rocks and 4 cloth that you have on you.The prefabs are also useless and provide no loot so have fun exploring those and finding absolutely nothing that can help you survive.Kill on sight mindset ruins the game.All your inital efforts get trashed the moment you see another player.Don't waste your time.",Rust

2015-06-09,0,0,410,True,Recommended,My friend and I recently picked Rust up again we jumped in a community server and we met up instantly (we used to play a lot and let me tell you finding your friend by spawning right next to him is like a miracle) and we started gathering. We were just minding our business when we stumbled across a wooden cabin. The cabin seemed pretty structurally sound minus the twig like foundations it was placed on. Being the good samaritans we are we decided to destroy one of the foundations to help him donate to the needy unfortunately some of the older players on the server has the same idea. they came armed with rocket launchers and my friend bolted like any smart individual would do. I tried to hide inside the house but that didn't seem to stop them they could have entered through the open foundation of the house but they had to show their superior fire power and they blasted the wall open and then used ther Assault rifle to gun me down in cold blood.A few minutes later we managed to meet up again my friend still had all the resources we found we finally settled down on top of a mountain and much to our delightful surprise we found a map that allowed us to traverse the wilderness without getting lost. Unfortunately we heard some explosions while exploring that same day and while using the map we realised something. It was something that made us feel a sense of despair the sound of explosions came from the direction of our fouse. We sprinted back through the forest to make it back only to find our door gone the walls severely damaged and all of our metal shards gone. To make matters worse they were kind raiders who left us pants in the storage boxes we made we couldn't feel angry at them.,Rust

2017-07-02,0,0,232,True,Recommended,I love this game although it takes alot of time and effort to get started (If you are playing vanilla Modded is for . I know people with more than 4000 hours on this game who helped me get started and now thinking about it they can turn insane sometimes (not in the good way). New players should be playing on community servers with 10 40 players to get a feel for the game if you are thinking of buying it.It can also be frustrating and create a sense of untrust between players. However it makes you become more aware of your surroundings and builds an unease of the thought of someone watching you which is the crazy part (pretty much). The only main advice for new players is to try to put in the hard yards and learn the game I have seen many quit this game because they got raided and lost all their stuff or they just keep getting killed over and over again. Try to find people who can help you learn the game even if that means running around the map talking to people or using all chat to find someone. Hope this helps you with your decision! ),Rust

2017-07-02,0,0,539,True,Recommended,"Great game even when playing on your own. Though it's more fun when teaming up with others. The game gets standardly updated on a weekly basis (every friday). Due to that the updates are obviously usually minor but occasionaly there's an interesting change to the game. The game has been in development for like 4 years already which worries me sometimes considering what has (not) been achieved during this long time. Personally I don't care how long it takes before the game gets launched officially as long as they will do it rightfully. There are plenty of instances of games where the developers just called a game ""finished"" half way through during the alpha stage launch it and drop all support. I truly hope the developers won't eventually do the same to this game which is what I'm fearing for. Right now the game is fun to me but I'm looking forward to bigger updates to the game such as multiple new items to craft or something. The lack of it causes me to burn out on the game relatively fast.",Rust

Sadly I was ban from a server because I call the Admin and his friends out. They were cheating and keeping others from being able to do anything. The base they set up was not taking damage. The rules they have posted are all lies. the server name is( x500 GA THERING/ PVP /HOME / HIGHLOOT /INSTANTCRAFT ) Its disheartening that when you ask to talk to an Admin the Admin just kicks you out and has said that its ok to cheat.

2017-07-03,0,0,531,True,Recommended,This is my favorite survival game to date. Such a love hate relationship I always end up coming back for more. The developers constantly update and improve the game. The graphics are pretty amazing the crafting is fantastic and the engagement factor is second to none. The second I get in game I can't get up from my chair until i've either died or I am waiting for resources to cook. With that said I have never been more upset from dying in any other game than this. It is pretty difficult to get set up to where you are semi safe in the game and you usually die several times before you get there. You typically die after spending about an hour getting enough supplies to make some kind of a base and you're on your way to find a good spot and you die and lose everything. I will stop playing this game for a few weeks or months because i'm frustrated but I keep coming back for more.If you have not played this game you have to give it a try. It is kept up to date and is very competitive or better in my opinion than other games like it.,Rust

2016-03-02,0,0,456,True,Recommended,UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg.2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.,Rust

2016-03-04,0,0,1243,True,Not Recommended,Rust has/had great potential but its a money making scheme for Facepunch right now and has been in Early access for a stupid amount of time and they use that excuse for everything. They don't appear to have much of a UX team and continue to make what they think are UX improvements which in actual fact end up irritating a lot of the player base. They act on user feedback they just handle it very badly.All of that you can live with but the game is currently ruined by exploiters and Facepunch seem incapable of doing anything about it. They openly acknowledge its an issue but still continue to work on new items/features rather than harding their server side code. They seem content to make it someone else's problem by way of VAC or EAC which simply doesn't work and the user base is powerless to do anything about it. There are regular occasions when a huge portion of the server has reported someone flying around and killing people and destroying bases and nothing happens for days if at all.,Rust

2017-11-21,0,0,952,True,Recommended,I love this game. I've spend a lot of time playing and have had a blast. This IS a WIP game meaning it hasn't been perfected 100% so I can't wait to see the final result. Rust is a post apocalyptic survival game where you can either survive by yourself or with friends. You'll start out as a naked person on a beach with a rock and torch. You'll need to find resources in order to do necessary things like building a base and getting warmth. Starting out WILL be hard as there are other people who will most likely kill you on first sight. But if you devote enough effort you will eventually be a well armed player who can withstand anything thrown at them. The only problem I have with this game is lack of character customization (Even though you can spawn in with different features and genders which are all determined randomly.).Anyways if you want a free roaming online post apocalyptic survival game then here you go. Would reccomend 11/10 stars,Rust

I am also in team so if you wanna play this game alone you shouldn't get it really but if you have a few friends like 2 and more you probably should get this or for more fun stack up with 3 friends of yours and get the 4 pack which is cheaper. It's still in alpha so yeah it's not that stable I can't change from female to male my skin colour so if you are a black fella (no racism) you gonna be a hunter in the night... not kidding. I got killed by a black caracter 3 times in the night. I had an ak while the had bows and all the time it was a 1v1 not 1vX.

If you get punched you have to get back up and start plotting your revenge. Never give up and prepare to lose everything you have repeatedly.While I had the most frustrating moments in this game I also had the most rewarding ones. You will find friends enemies for life a false sense of security tears blood and sweat along the road.

2015-02-22,0,0,153,True,Recommended,As a solo player I've spent many hours playing Rust Legacy and it was quite fun.My review is focused on solo gameplay and I'll just explain why the new Rust ruined lonewolf fun.1. Farming it's now 75% of a solo player gameplay chopping trees all day isn't fun.2. It is still a weapon race game survival is just an excuse to fight with big guns but in Legacy you could easily find good weapons farm zombies and fight against big teams now you need hours and hours of barrel farm to find this good stuff considering you die and retry a lot because you are chased by others while farming so you have to secure any good thing to your house before going back farming more barrels.3. Communication the game has a good ingame voice communication but players tend to use teamspeak so they can easily approch your house without you knowing it. How unfair is that.4. Hiding you base in Legacy playing solo had this only one advantage the capability of hiding a small 2x1 or 2x2 base in the mountains which was the only place where you could rest and craft new weapons before going back to the fight. Now it is impossible for a solo player to hide they will find you rip your base and all your hours of investement in this game. Because you have no weapons you are weak.5. Moreover now you can help a mate to revive so if you killed one he will just ask for help to his friends and repeat until they finally catch and kill you... twice ez pz.,Rust
2017-01-01,0,0,53,True,Recommended,Product received for free. the game has one of the most cancerous community out there. filled with the saltiest people you ever met and lets not forget on raging kids that cry every time they get raided. honestly i've seen better community out there but you know what with all of these d***s out there i still love the game because of the mechanics of it. the way you gather resources to build stuff and to improve the security of your base is just amazing and I do love it. Killing other players has never been so fun because if they bring lots of resources with them they are screwed. not to mention that you can raids others to collect their resources for your own needs. and an wow I just sounded like what the community would say. so I am a d*** oh well so if your game type is survival and kill to be the best type. you might like rust and you can be addicted to the game. just don't be like one of those d***s or me,Rust

2017-06-08,0,0,160,True,Recommended,"Lets get a few things out of the way. This game is not only addiciting but also fun. It's also very very frusterating.Now that I've gotton those things out of the way we can truly begin. Rust is a grindy survival game with pvp and a little pve elements. The game now is mainly focused on pvp. In this game you will die and I mean alot of times. If you spawn in a highly populated server you will most likely die within the first 5 mins of spawning. It's very frusterating but it's also an oppertunity for you to maybe sercure a kill and get some loot. I recommned that you join a community server with low pop when starting. This way you'll get to learn the game and people are most likely to be nicer. There are a couple ""Non Kos"" servers on the community page on the game. Those servers are great for newbies that's where I learned to play. I'm also going to talk about the ""Twig Update"". For those of you who don't know about it you can now build twig buildings in building blocked zones. This makes offline raides even easier. You know don't have to be smart when blowing through walls you can just blow through the roof. The number 1 weakness of a base is usally the roof. I really do not like the twig update and I believe it should be removed.I also want to list the pros and cons of Rust.Pros.This game is addictiveThis game is funI believe it has great serverseasy to learn crafting and builidng system.Cons. pvp some of the weapons are kinda hard to learn. (In the recent update they made it to where tap firing is amazing.)community the community is split into about three groups. The Pvp'ers roleplayers and toxic dickbags. The pvp'ers hate the roleplayers and the roleplayers hate the pvp'ers. In Rust you will get killed outside of your base all the time. You will most likely always die when you leave your base if you're bad at pvp. I don't really have to explain the toxicdickbags do I?Zergs also known as ""Huge clans that will you."" Anyway this game is great go buy it and play with friends.",Rust
2017-09-22,0,0,305,True,Not Recommended,This game has many moments of great fun and if you're organized with friends incredible teamwork fun however this is also a great source of toxicity. You will find as this game is designed specifically for many server communities that they are incredibly toxic and very un enjoyable to play with / against. Due to the great open world mechanic it also seems to end up being fairly limited in the range of things that you do and discover while the developer is working constantly to add content and improve any aspect this seems to happen too infrequent or with too few changes that you are most likely going to find yourself taking large breaks of time inbetween playing. You might find monthly roll overs to be a bit of a draw back but it has become crucial to the game dynamic since building up from nothing is pretty much 90% of the gameplay that then you start to run out of the range of things to do and are either just building bases you don't use or simple roaming around blowing up everyone elses. If you can find this title rather inexpensive (10$ or less) then sure maybe try it out for the perspective sake of the genre otherwise I personally don't find it to have a higher price value.,Rust

I love how this game is a pvp survival game but I don't love how i can't decide how my character looks.

Me and my friend practically built our friendship off of this game. There are times in this game when you will feal like the king and times when you feal like everyone wants you dead and thats the beauty of the game sitting in your house as your fire casts an ominous glow around you when suddeny you hear several footsteps from outside you freeze turn off your fire and hunch over your keyboard praying to the rust gods that the footsteps are not carrying any explosives.

2013-12-24,0,0,70,True,Recommended,Rust a game still in its alpha at the moment is already an extremely well developed game. A well made crafting system allowing for base creation and gearing yourself up to survive against the elements wild animals zombies and most commonly in my experience other people. In my own personal opinion the m4 and mp5 guns kind of break the game due to being able to kill someone in full kevlar in a quick burst. This wouldn't normally be a problem but it often turns into a dayz esque game on most servers where the people that have been on for a long time simply kill the fresh spawns and people who are just getting started and there is nothing that can be done to stop them. I have high hopes for this game (one being modded servers with less heavy firearms) and hope to see it flourish as it continues toward it's release date.,Rust

2013-12-25,0,0,164,True,Recommended,"I highly recommend this game to those of you who enjoy hardcore survival. Find wood build fire hunt animals and make friends while all the while fighting off (or fleeing from) zombies wolves bears (shudder) and most of all dangerous players. I would highly suggest building a temp shack hidden from roads and main towns. Use the shack to rack up plenty of wood and stone. When able build yourself a foundation and get to work on a new house. Do not aggravate others and always try to make friends. Build a small community and you'll find yourself enjoying the fact that you can spend the days gathering and improving your community and your nights around a fire or camp site telling stories of the day or making plans for the next sunrise. You can meet some REALLY cool people...along with some not so cool people... But the community can be pretty solid if you know where to look and you treat others how you'd like to be treated. Don't be disheartened when you are stumbled upon by a raiding party that is out for your skins. As long as your community is strong and works together generally you can either A. Rebuild and thrive. Or B. Seek out those mother ers that destroyed your home and robbed you. Either way it's a thrilling game. Learning curve is moderate basics come easy advice is ALWAYS appreciated no matter your amount of play time and it can be a truly thrilling time. D Highly suggest getting the game!P.S. If you're looking for like everyone else press F1 when you spawn for the first time and type in the console ""censor.nudity false"". You're welcome. _",Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Reminder I'm writing about the older version of Rust (also called Legacy) since I like it more than the current version. Which leads me to the first point 1.Rust HAD a very nice feeling to it. The multiplayer on servers was very exciting and even in the (just) 7 hours I have played the game I loved it.2.The price for that game is justified since the graphics of the game (new and old version) are insane. You won't find any other game which offers you that good of an experience.3.The community is (mostly) very friendly. Most of the players are from Russia and I am from germany. Despite that I was treated very nicely though I haven't understood what they were saying xD.For that ammount of money I just recommend this to anyone who is open for some great games.

Kill and eat other humans or hunt animals and animals only either way it's up to you.With the new Rust updates I think it's briliant you have a perfect building menu which allows you to build how you so please.

2016-07-23,0,0,1215,True,Not Recommended,Rust used to be a fun and enjoyable game. First off blueprints was a decent system that needed slight tweaks to make it optimal. Instead the devs completely abandoned blueprints and integrated XP. XP at first was so broken with some users levelling up to max levels over night. Over the coming months XP was slightly tweaked to accomodate blueprints and XP was now 2x which made the game a lot more fun. Once again the devs abandoned XP and went to components.Components is an awful system. No sense of progression people get AKs in an hour after wipe it truly is awful. I don't understand the direction this game is going but the game has been out for like 3 or 4 years with no knowledge of the direction of where the game is going. Do not buy this game it's essentially Call of Duty with bases.,Rust

2016-12-08,0,0,133,True,Recommended,Soo. Lets review rust then shall we?Ok let's say its a funny game. And it really well is a funny game. With many downsides. So this is one of many reasons I am going to make a pro/con list. Yayyy Lets a go.+ The building system is very good and you can build most things you want. Of course it is still physics based means you can't build as high as you want because it's not very stable on the top. The game makes fun when you are making raids or just build. It's completely open to you. Please have friends because with them it makes much more fun. The animals seem to have a very high level of retardation. For example you want to kill a bear. Well that's good so far but now comes the point ITS IN EASY. The bear mostly doesn't even move because it is bugged somewhere which is kinda good for you but kinda bad for the gameplay because the animals are no in' enemies anymore. Same goes for every single other animal in this game except wild boars. You think bears are the most dangerous animals? Forget it because these little s will hunt you down so hard that the bears look like stuffed animals. Like WTF PLS FIX THIS!!! The engine. I don't say many things about graphics and so on in my reviews because I don't care that much. But not being able to play this game with a GTX970 and an Intel Core i7 4790k on Ultra Graphics Full HD makes me a little bit depressed. It's a really really laggy game and the devs have to fix this if they ever want to release this game...So overall...Even tho it has some flaws which have to be fixed it's a fun game to play and also not hard to learn. The dev team makes many updates and I think that one day they fix the animals. I recommend it to people who want a survival game where you start poor and after grinding 2 days you are pretty much rich and you don't worry about basics like food or water anymore. If you have any questions ask them in the comments. I'd be happy to answer them ).,Rust

2017-08-31,0,0,226,True,Not Recommended,It was good.But I can't recommend it until they stop forced server wipes.As understandable as they are this alone wouldn't be enough to unendorse it if it weren't for the stupid they're always bringing in that they break the game with and then nerf and make useless.Also skins in alpha. By principle this shouldn't be happening at all. No excuses.,Rust
2013-12-28,0,0,70,True,Recommended,On the whole a great game. A largeish map (though not as large as the Day Z map) with limited resources and lots of other players creates a great atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

What i also like is the fast updates and telling people beforehand that an update is coming out this gets me hyped up for like the new tank they added in the facial expressions when they're about to add in and many other stuff like the backpacks. this game is elvoving quicking and its getting better every day with new updates coming out and people enjoy them alot!,Rust

2017-06-28,0,0,327,True,Not Recommended,If I remember correctly when I bought this game it had lower memory requierments (it asked for 4GB of RAM). If you ask developers for game performance issues they will say you need better PC that's all no help whatsoever. I tryed to play this game on more powerfull PC game still runs really bad. The weird part is that I play GTA V at medium settings and it runs stable at 30 FPS with v sync. The RUST on other hand at it's lowest settings (including those from in game menu and game config file) runs on my PC at 20 FPS with HUGE drops (when I say huge I mean it drops to 3 5 FPS). When I put FPS issues aside there is more performance issues that you can't simply put aside for example game freezes every 15 20 minutes and it causes FPS to drop even more or sometimes it simply dissconnects you from server and you have to sit for loading screens again (sometimes game freezes on loading screen which causes game to crash to desktop and then you have to run game again and do more waiting). Also you would think by now developers would exit from early access I don't blame them they didn't with all issues they have but at least they should try to optimise the game they are working on but that never happened (lost interest in further development?) every update they make is mostly cosmetic doesn't improve gameplay in any way or game performance. I wanted to ask for refund long time ago but policy was that refund is available only for games with less than 2 hours and since most of my gameplay is loading screens I literaly played 1/3rd of time it's showing I was unable to do so. Game was fun at first and I must admit game had way less problems at start than it has now open world with survival tactics great concept and overall fun experience (ignoring all the cheaters and toxic community) but developers really broke the game with their un logical updates poor net code and poor optimisation. If I have to give grade to this game it would be 8.5/10 for the version I first bought and 3/10 for the game it is now. I would probably return to playing this game if they would make really huge update for their performance issues and not doing only cosmetic changes...,Rust

2018-01-13,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,I want to give this game a good review. I REALLY want to. The gameplay is awesome the people are... people and the graphics are amazing! However there are some major problems I have been frustrating over for the entire time I have had this game Wait The wait time in this game is insane! I had to wait a full half hour just to start a game.Crashes Whenever I attempt to click any 'cancel' buttons the game completely crashes. The game also crashes whenever something outside of the game pops up. Once that happens I have to wait some more to start up the game again.Lag This one might just be only me but once I finally start a game without crashing the server becomes a powerpoint presentation! It's completely unplayable!Conclusion Again I really want to give this great game a nice reveiw. But this game and the situation I'm in is stressing me out. Until these problems are fixed I will keep this comment negative.I hope the rest of you can understand.,Rust

2016-04-04,0,0,304,True,Recommended,So I've played this game for about 100 hours now. The start just like in every other survival game can be a little difficult at first. But as soon as you got more and more confident with all the possibilities this game will give you you will soon love it. No 2 days are the same. On one day you can farm and build a base whereas when you wake up you may find yourself naked on a beach because someone blew up your house. Or maybe you are the lucky one that blows up someone else's house. You never know.The graphics are simply amazing and I surley can say that Rust is the best Early Access Game I've played so far. There are many many updates that always add some new content that you instantly need to discover.Because of all the different possibilities this game never gets boring.Give it a try. It's definitely worth it.,Rust

2018-01-13,0,0,587,True,Recommended,"So I have a ton of hours. Not a lot but I've had this game for years. Throughtout those years a lot has changed. I jump on and off a lot because it's truly a early access game. The first version ""legacy"" was a really fun game! (unfortunately no longer avaiable to play!) It got old after a while. The devs had bigger plans so they scrapped legacy and started ground up. Since then the devs have made massive changes time and time again sometimes reverting changes they didn't like. The game may not be in the best state right now but the devs have a pretty good track record of listening to the communities thoughts and ideas. They also have a great way of executing their plans!

2014-11-29,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,Fitst off ABSOLUTLEY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I do not recommend this game to anyone whom would have to pay money to play this terible game. First just like every other survival game you need to depend on resoruces only here there's only two (wood and rock). Wood is easy to get by beating a (semi magical) rock against a tree while rocks are much more difficult. Now there are plenty of rocks around but only the special (low res magical) rocks yeild you stones. So say you finally get your resoures you want to build a base right? Wrong! The crafting system is terrible so you have to go out to outside sources (google/youtube) to figure it out only it's not fun like games as in Minecraft. Okay so you learn how to build a base now you get back in the game only to find that every square inc of every map is taken by skyscraper sized huts and unfinished boards of wood. And say you're one of the players who really plays this game and gets a huge base don't get too attached as server wipes happen alot. Also if you are a parent considering to get this game fo your child DO NOT GET IT. There is full frontal and rear male nudity. There is a filter but it is only for the front.All in all this game isn't worth the hard drive space let alone $20.,Rust

2014-01-01,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I am giving this game a 7/10. This game offers great gameplay from resource collecting raiding pvp and building. So far nothing is too unbalanced as you can build weapons pretty easily (you could have a character with a gun in about 2 hours if solo) however there is one feature that I strongly dislike. No matter what you do or where you log off people can kill you and steal your stuff even if you are logged off. Thats right! No matter what your stuff (even on your character) is never safe. Although this may be a great feature for people that play in groups it is detrimental for solo or small 2 3 man groups as you can always be killed even if you play or not. This is NOT for the casual player.,Rust

2014-12-01,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,Although I think Rust is a great concept for a game and provides hours of survival fun I honestly cannot recommend this game due to the anti cheat program used that doesn't allow you to use Test Mode on Windows. This completely alienates a large group of users that absolutely /require/ test mode to use various drivers for hardware (i.e. SLI audio sshfs etc). Until the developers of either Rust or Easy Anti Cheat fix this I will not recommend this game to anyone.,Rust
2014-12-01,0,0,0,True,Recommended,much like dayz except with less zombies. people often kill you before you even spawn which as we all know is always fun. it needs tons of work. it's very raw glitchy and unreliable. the gameplay is a blast if you can actually get the servers to load and survive long enough to actually experience it. it's fun but seriously needs a ton of work. it doesn't seem like facepunch is making much progress.,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,1075,True,Recommended,This game is pretty fun if you have friends enjoy serfdom and/or like random encounters with naked men typically resulting in death. The game is designed by a ragtag group of developers who are quite indecisive and have an epiphany on a weekly basis so expect radical changes in gameplay over time and countless server wipes. In the end I'd rate it a solid 9/10 and say it is the best survival game available.

Most survival games are rather boring but rust has done it just right so that it is challenging but not completly unfair and this pleases me. It brought a sile to myface and will continue to do so,Rust

2018-02-14,0,0,803,False,Recommended,After almost 700 hours of this game I can't be more happy with it's development. I've made countless friends through Rust and 1000x more enemies over the years. Rust is not for the weak of heart. People enthusiastically will ruin your day. All I can say is the more you stick around and learn the more you can hold your ground and create your own experience. There are plenty of servers that are PVE or low population for those who aren't interested in having diarrea playing solo while learning.As I said the development is brilliant. Prior to official release updates were released every few weeks or at least once a month. Today monthly updates are significant and saturated with changes that are directly affected by player feedback. Optimization has been improved in nearly every recent update in the last year to 2 years. There's always something to do and/or someone to hate in Rust. I've gotten every one of my gaming friends to buy Rust. All around 10/10. This has easily become my favorite game. Even though the other players make me want to drink bleach.,Rust

2017-08-22,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Sure the game is great when you get on and get gear farm things build a decent base and get away from kill the idiots who shot on sight (Which there far more than the anmout of people who live in a 500km radius of me and possible much more maybe even the the whole number of people who own this game) even if you've just started and have absoluty nothing. But the one problem that I face day after day is... Dissconecting because well nothing. I spawn in and can't even get up. So then I get off and get back on. And guess what it happens time after time after time. It might be internet. But if I can watch youtube and movie's in 1080p and also play Battlefield 1 while runnibg a smooth lag free 60fps. Then it's not the crappy internet we have here where I live. So what about my pc? You might be asking. No it's not I have a Alienware 17 inch laptop with a 1060 graphics card and 8 gigs of ram. So it's not my laptop that's the problem. I don't what it is but there's something wrong and I don't have clue what to do. I may recommend this for people but my problem and maybe others problem is that for some reason it doesn't work for me.,Rust

2017-08-22,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,While the idea behind Rust is very good and very nice and worth the $20 the game itself comes nowhere close to that. Admittedly I just started playing a month ago or so but still. Maybe it was good back then but I can tell you it is not good now. Any of the servers that you are gonna get on you know as a starter (so the noob ones or beginner only ones) are all filled with dummies like you gettiing absolutely nothing done. The blind are just leading the blind to nowhere good. The best part about these servers are when you pick a fight against a dude with a rock while you have a spear. 10/10 gameplay. I know that there are many videos and documents that tell you how to play but not to seem like I'm a TL DR sort of guy it ruins the fun to study something just so that you can play it. If you want to just hop right in and have so much fun with the people in the newest server well then this game is not for you. While I am sure that many people will love this game if you want to jump right into a game don't want to be doing nothing the first hour or two want to not get pummeled by people most obviously better than you want to not get left behind by bozos that won't help you for the same reason you won't study the gameplay mechanics to the core so you can get anything or just want your computer to not take 10 years or so to get into one single server then this game just isn't for you. It's not for me and that's why it gets a bad review. (,Rust

2016-09-03,0,0,158,True,Recommended,This Game is The best Survival/Pvp game ever i recommand it for you buy it,Rust
2016-09-03,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,"TL DR unless you have endless free time to burn the arduous cycle of grinding for materials only to have everything stolen/ destroyed so that you have to start entirely from scratch will get tiresome pretty quickly. Do not buy this game. I know that saying this is going to make it sound like I'm slating the game because I'm bad at it but this thing is way too frustrating to play to be worth buying. It works all the mechanics are fine there's not game breaking glitches or anything like that and the anti cheat is really good so there's barely any hackers (I never saw any).The problem is the playerbase. The whole game revolves around the player building up a base and collecting resources to upgrade weapons armour and building materials. It takes time and effort to get anywhere meaningful and once you've got a base you're proud of it feels like you've actually accomplished something. Unfortunately there will always be someone with more time to devote to the game who can raid your base and steal everything you've worked at. That alone would be fine its a survival game after all. What makes Rust such a pain in the is that no one ever passes up the opportunity to totally ruin your experience. People won't just steal your stuff they'll plant barricades in front of all the doors and change all the locks. They'll see you peacefully wandering the map collecting wood or stone and instantly kill you. They'll break down your walls and destroy your spawn point so that you can't even easily get back to your base to start over.I know that a lot of people are going to disagree with this ""but player brutality is what adds challenge to the game"" or ""stop whining and just get on with it"". Fine. But this review isn't for you it's for other people like me who underestimated going in the amount of time this game requires you to invest to feel rewarded and how easily all of that investment could be totally wiped out. I know that video games aren't massively productive uses of time anyway but this game really hammers that home. I've got 30 hours on record with this game and whereas that amount of time in say Fallout or Payday 2 would net me a pretty well equipped character a decent settlement or piles of cash all I have in Rust is a naked guy holding a rock and a torch. If you value your time the feeling of accomplishment or even just your ability to trust other human beings do not play this game.",Rust

RUST is something of a survival/hording/ragequittable game like DayZYou start out with just a rock and have to use the rock to gain access to materials like stone wood and animal fat/fur. You progressively kill/mine larger and larger things until you build a hut/weapons and then continue from there. Eventually you could have an empire of ""to scale"" buildings and armor/weapons. That is if someone does not just straight up merc your naked in the first few days. I have rage quit this game more than many others just due to the fact that experiences I have had with other players have ended badly roughly 90% of the time as they kill me and take my stuff.There are zombies currently in the game as ""placeholders"" but its been said that they will be replaced at some point.

2014-01-04,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,One of the first games I truly wish I could get my money back. I'd suggest giving 7 Days to Die or DayZ a try if you're looking for something similar. I haven't played those yet but trying to decide which one to spend more money on. Maybe Rust will be something worth playing down the road near release but absolutely save your money for now. You can have the exact same experience by downloading a free graphics engine loading up a standard map and running around. There is absolutely nothing to this game and the little you do manage to put together will be gone when you play next. It is riddled with well known hacks and bugs beyond the insanely fast decay rate of anything you manage to gather. The PvP is fun but it gets extremely boring as all anyone has is the rock they start with because you literally start over every time you play unless you have the time to play every hour.,Rust

An alpha is an alpha yes but a game this unplayable in alpha is sheer laziness. I LOVED the 3 hours I was actually able to play the game.

2016-12-11,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Product received for free. In Rust players must survive on a procedurally genrated map by collecting resources hunting wildlife and crafting tools. But you're not alone other players are also enduring the wilderness. Survive by building a shelter and arming yourself with weapons in an unforgivable environment.Pros +Intricate building tools+Procedurally generated maps (no two servers feature the same world with various environments to keep gameplay fresh)+Extensive crafting system (from wooden spears and burlap headwraps to pistols and Thompson machine guns create a large catalog of items)Cons No tutorial makes learning systems difficult Poor optimization causes crashes Time consuming to play effectivelyIt's an incredibly fun game that's easy to pick up. The procedurally generated maps ensure that it can be fun every time the server resets. Everything from simply harvesting resources to building a base is really intuitive. The constant threat of getting raided or jumped only makes the survival aspect of the game way more fun. Well worth the 20 on steam.,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,515,True,Not Recommended,HACKERS EVERYWHERE.Imagine a game where collecting resources and protecting them is everything. Now imagine the same world filled with about 50% hackers that casually walk through walls with impunity to kill you and take all your sh*t while laughing. This is that game.Don't buy it now or ever. The designers are amatuers that only just BARELY know how to make a game (they only ever made Gary's mod which isn't even a game but a ty mod). Just look at their joke of a website http //www.facepunchstudios.com/ quality... They're helpless to fix all the problems this game has and won't succeed against original titles like DAYZ (which again is a game the developers are riding the coat tails of because they aren't skilled enough to make their own graphics engine). Buy THAT game this unplayable hacker ridden copy pasted rip off of a half finished pile of sh*t.I understand it's alpha but it's no excuse to release a fundementally UNPLAYABLE game to paying customers.,Rust
2014-01-04,0,0,41,True,Recommended,this is truely an interesting game. the constant pvp makes every decision so much more important. it has some glitches only being an alpha but it is tons of fun if you can get started. build shelter collect materials. hopefully get a gun and ammo. get lucky and someone will help you out. the big problem i have with it is that your character doesn leave the game when you log off. so people will kill you and take your equipment if you arent prtected well enough,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,584,True,Recommended,"This game. If I could use a few words to describe this game those words would likely be ""rage inducing"" ""hiliarious"" and ""unique"". This game is not like other survival games not by a long shot.""Rust"" is a game heavily focused on survival multiplayer. From the moment a play spawns fresh and butt naked onto the beaches they are not safe. In Rust safety in numbers is key. As you go through the game you gather resources craft guns and materials build up your dream base and prepare for the worse. Nothing sums up Rust better than waking up one morning and finding your hours of hard work raided. Then finding who raided you. Then raiding them back. Harder.If you're looking to have fun with friends while also experiencing the joys and sorrows of failure this game is likely for you.",Rust

2017-04-04,0,0,203,True,Recommended,Game has no end to it. There is always something to do. There are allot of kill on sight players and for that reason it takes time to start the game maybe about 3 hours of learning so you can understand how to build a base and how to gather materials. The game has good graphics quality good gameplay personally played 123 hours in 2 weeks when i first bought this game thats about 9 hours a day.I recommend for everyone who likes survival games and looking at your own private parts.8/10 graphics some small details that should be fixed like the flashlight on a gun.7/10 gameplay experience. (mining looting raiding farming. there are obvious glitches)10/10 pricing. bought at full price of 19 99 7/10 realistic. Chicken meat from deer and horses cloth from animals very few body types little to no radioactivity at places where there definetly should be.I give this game an 8/10 very addicting good price nice graphics.

Rust has a few issues with progression but the developers are constantly trying to fix the issues that are present so I can forgive it.,Rust

The game itself is second rate with bad graphics and overall design but this game is not about the game but the community or rather lack thereof. There is no such thing as friendly in this game this game is just full of A**holes and D***s and you should prepare your a**hole to receive d*** because that it what you sign up for if you play this game.

2015-07-18,0,0,2992,True,Recommended,Rust is one of a kind. I've logged over a thousand hours over the last 15 months playing this game. Legacy got me hooked but was plagued by hackers. Watching and playing throughout the reboot has been amazing. The development team is top notch and is very active in the rust community usually giving the players what they want and when they don't it's because they have a good reason and usually know best. The only other game I have near as much time played is Civ 5 and that's over 5 years. Rust is amazing.,Rust

2017-01-20,0,0,62,True,Recommended,New people usually die. People should only buy this game if they even require the minimum specs or you won't have a good experience. I recommend practicing on modded servers so you can learn how to make a really overpowered base and eventually do great in Official Servers.,Rust
2017-01-20,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Awful to the extreme.The performance of the game is choppy and can't seem to remane the same for more than a few minutes. I achieved about 97 to 28 fps across a 4 hour session using a gtx 970 and an i5 4590.Most of the player base is toxic whether it be in game on reddit or when leaving comments or posts on steam.The game is grindy and repetitive with many players actively seeking other players to kill just to steal supplies or you door keys at which point they steal your whole base.The vast majority of players are either in huge or groups varying in size from 4 50 players meaning no matter how much work you put in they will utterly dominate all of the rad towns and monuments on the server and send out large well armed scavanger parties allowing them to farm barrels and animals with ease along with killing you for the fun of it.TLDR a mediocre game which proves to be interesting for a few hours unfortunately the vast majority of players would rather kill less well equipped players and steal their supplies or wait until they leave and raid their base while they're offline.,Rust

2016-01-17,0,0,228,True,Recommended,"As you can see in my many hours of experience I have on this game my review I one to trust.I saw the game on sale and thought I would decide to buy it considering on its current status.I began the game by waking up on a small beach alone wet and unsure of what to do. I walked up the beach to a nearby village (Im guessing that was player built). Using my voice chat to try call others for aid I attracted 2 naked men wish spears. Naturally I expected then to be hostile so I began to run. After about 5 minutes I duked them by running into a bush. At the same moment I accidentally hit my voice chat giving away my position. Then men then proceeded to spear me to death while screaming like banshees. ""ALELELELELELE"" was the sound to my recollection.After a few moments the men had calmed down and decided to let me live. I got up and after a few moments the men asked to join them in their spearmen army. After being slightly suprised by the attack and having no knowledge of the game I agreed and so they gave me the task of chopping a tree to get some wood. This took me quite a while due to me losing my rock from the attack. I spent around 5 minutes walking around where I had been speared to the ground looking for my rock and eventually found it had rolled back down the beach to where I had spawned. After finding my rock and equipping it I went ahead and collected enough wood for me to build a spear. The men tought me how to use the crafting menu and I was suprised at the super long crafting times (2 mins for wooden spear). While waiting with delight for my spear to be complete I was mauled by a bear...10/10 would get mauled again",Rust

2016-11-19,0,0,757,True,Recommended,rust is one of those games where you build a love shack in the woods with friends invite the neighbours over sit around the campfire singing songs until...a huge clan comes outside with flamethrowers to burn your shack to the ground so you and the fellow love shack members get to arms and defend your utopia and immediately get gunned down when you step out but then you make a new love shack and continue the cycle. in all honesty a good group and good interactions make this game better than most survival games ive played because you can be whoever you want to be in the world of rust.,Rust

2016-09-01,0,0,2091,True,Recommended,"Pros 1. Unforgiving. At one point you can be the king of the server and the next thing you notice you have nothing at all. It's like dark souls but it's not souls you are losing. You can lose ALL your progress.2. Addictive and rewarding gameplay. Farming building raiding roaming. Choose your style.3. The gunplay is satisfying and the primitive weapons don't lose their purpose after you reach ""lategame""4. You can enjoy the game both in solo and with friends. For a true roguelike experience go solo.5. Active developers. Bi weekly update with the devs actually listening to the playerbase.Cons 1. The game is a memory hog and you might find yourself in trouble with even 8gb and less RAM. Atleast this was the case for me and I ended up upgrading to 16gb wich somewhat made it better.2. Overall performance isn't that shabby. The graphics are not so well optimized but it's an alpha so I'm sure these things will be fixed in the final product.3. Loading times might be frustrating if you are not the most patient of people.4. Big groups and clans dominate the servers. There is power in numbers and you might find it frustrating trying to advance if you're going solo or with a small group. 5. Animals are very glitchy might teleport inside your base and may cause you an untimely death. Watch out for those bears!Overall If you are looking for a roguelike fps exeprience this is it. The unforgivingness is a huge thrill. Best enjoyed with a group of friends but solo is also viable.Recommended and stay safe!New component system makes point of interests a very busy place. I also like how they ramped up the radiation to new deadly heights.",Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,323,True,Recommended,If you were disappointed by Dayz well... don't worry this game is something that dayz wished it could've become. It is so much more fleshed out compared to it. The combat feels great the hits from your guns (if you hit) has some real umph to it. Building bases is enjoyable designing a fort can be a bit stressful at times though. Especially when you're in a server with a bunch of other people who want to gut you when you're not looking. The player sleeping body/ logged out mechanic is pretty neat fixes the combat logging cancer that some cheaky players do in other games.Overall the game is amazing and even greater when you play with your friends (or make new friends in game).,Rust

2017-12-04,0,0,60,True,Recommended,This a great game. There's a good amount of updates. It has lots of potential I hope that they add in character cusomization soon though it is sorta annoying that you have a predetermined person that you cant change. That's really my only complaint about it but even that's just a small thing so I give it a 9/10. This game was worth my buy and I hope to continue see it evolve into a wonderful game.,Rust

2017-08-27,0,0,723,True,Not Recommended,I would like to say that I enjoy this game but I think that the community is far to to be able to say that. I meet 1 good person in every 100 player interactions and that s this game... Solo is impossible because all you do is get swarmed by the many clans that roam and kill everything in sight. 3/10 this.,Rust

2017-04-28,0,0,306,True,Recommended,THIS IS AN EARLY DESCRIPTION. MADE IN APRIL 2017 MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN AND THE GAME HAS BEEN IMPROVED VERY MUCH.I'm not gonna write such a big description of the game I will just write my opinion about it and give some advices. This game is very good for a survival and you will never get bored of it because you will always have to do a job. Well most of the community sucks you might just be naked and get a headshot but expect that you will do the same so dont blame the others xD. Do not buy it if you won't play with friends Rust is not a solo game at all. You have plenty of options to play battle royale battlefields and plenty of other modded servers that will give you a different expierience.Don't worry if you have FPS drops its physical cause of the bad optimization.Last but not least you will need some good headphones.If you want to be the king of the server or something like this its very important to hear where the noises are coming from if you want to counter raid or if you are in a hunt with another player.Gameplay 9/10Graphics 9/10Optimization 5/10Sound effects 8/10Community 4/10Anti Cheat 5/10,Rust

2015-06-26,0,0,1229,True,Recommended,"UPDATED REVIEW This game has massive amounts of content that is ever dynamic due to being ""procedurally"" generated by the individual community and map. As you can see in the first two comments below my review a salty pleb I destroyed and harassed was so angry he stalked my game review. There are so many ways to play this game I can't even begin to describe it. Start with existing friends or forge new friendships and survive on your own making allies and enemies on your servers as you go. There's a reason why this game has the most of my gameplay hours and at the discounted $10 or even the $20 when I bought it long ago it is worth it.Old review Although the game may improve I found it ridden with hackers and glitches I was dissapointed and may buy if improved in the future.

You build base which is closed from all sites and blocked with cupboard (it means only authorized persons are awaible to build in that area). Then comes guy with leaders and boost up on the top of building because he CAN BUILD in YOUR area. Now after few updates you must find blueprint for higher stuffs (guns building stuffs etc.)Pros + having fun on stupid things + building and decoratingCons IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME once you are raided you ended,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,555,True,Recommended,People moan too much about this game but I think it was a well worth buy. Take into consideration it's only still in Alpha this game has a lot of potential since the creator is Garry Newman previous creator of Garry's Mod which is still played till today. Rust is a lot of fun I can't wait to see what the future holds in for us people who complain about being killed constantly should take into consideration even if you're a naked spawn or well geared it's an online survival game so it won't be easy. Once I let a naked guy ran past me and as I went passed him he turned around and killed me with an m4. So anything is possible I just can't wait for the anti cheat system to be implemented. But other than hackers it's an amazing game non the less get some friends to play with. If you're alone in the world of Rust you're most probably not going to survive it.,Rust

Overall it's a survival game I learned to build huge bases in and sell blueprints to said bases for lots of cash.I took this game both seriously and extremely gleefully.I've been a part of forty man crews before and led groups of spear rofltossing morons against heavily geared players.I have never been died of laughter harder than when I was under someone's porch chanting nordic poetry with a terrible scottish accent. Cons...the community has grown younger. Don't let that stop you! Kill those squeakers and keep on running DThis game is also a game for friends so don't go alone. That or do some team searching when you get in game. I personally recommend finding a group of fun loving mates to play with.Enjoy the cancer and unless you build a compound the size of an island and as tall as Mont Saint Michel you are probably boned xD,Rust

2017-11-27,0,0,1594,True,Recommended,Although I rage quit or just stop playing at times never has there been a game that held my interest for 4 years. The randomness of this game is unparalleled by any other and there is no community that is so bad and so good at the same time. All around this is one of the best games I have ever played and I will keep coming back for years to come with weekly updates being an amazing longevity factor to keep the game fresh. Thank you Facepunch for this absolute indie masterpiece.In all the hundreds of hours in different survival games I have never found one that gives you that adrenaline rush I know everyone who plays rust gets. It is not for the weak you will get beat down and door camped betrayed raided and everything in between but if you work through all the rage you will find an amazing experience on a new map and new wipe weekly or monthly. The game is never the same where you build how you play who you play against what randomly happens from players helicopters airdrops broken as wolfs and so much more 1400 hours in over 1000 more hours in any other game I've ever played and I'm still coming back for more multiple times a year.Just beware if you have any sort of life out side of ur bedroom it will suffer and you will eat dream and play rust 24/7 for ur entire wipe. You can't even image the rush of being raided or getting raided. Finally with so so so so many massive changes with this game massive entire system over halls that at times you will hate you and stop playing because of it don't worry you will be right back some time soon.,Rust

2014-07-09,0,0,744,True,Recommended,its a great game pvp i tried briefly alot of kill on sight most servers if u have a lot of friends on a pvp server it would be fun u would have a better chance of surviving longer pve servers u get a chance to learn the games basics at your own pace which is beneficial its a pure survival game cut wood mine stones to get resources kill wolves and bears for theirs skin and food plus random drops on mutaed versions of the animals and of course a lot of building houses and bases with wood and metal which i think is the most satisfying part of the game lets u bring your creative side into the game the game i think the game could use some new content the way it is and it would be that much better but i guess the creators of the game want to redo the whole game again because they cant work with the code of the program hopefully they add new content when the reboot is done or i feel they will lose their players other then that its well worth a try,Rust

I payed like twenty dollars for this? And then I payed like another 40 for a video card so I could actually run the game. And it keeps crashing like I IP connect and it goes for a few seconds and then it just stops. It gives me a message saying it crashed. Maybe once I actually get it to you know work then I will post another review.Update Finally worked. 51 hours in and it's one of the best games I owned.

2014-07-12,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"Rust Developed by Facepunch Studios.This game is quite enjoyable although I would have to say it does have some flaws 1. There are no goats cmon Facepunch you could of atleast added goats.2. There are no killcams or SnD gamemodes SnD is a vital part of any FPS game Rust has no other gamemode than 'survival'3. There are no lens flares while playing I noticed that there aren't any lens flare whatsoever we need lens flares J.J Abrahms would not approve of this and quite frankly I don't either.4. No woodcutting skill. If you're going to make a game always add a WC skill so players can ask other players ""WC level?""5. That rock is so ing overpowered ok so I was playing collecting wood and ore as I usually do and nek minut I got qouted in the head with a rock! I en got KO'ed and lost all my 6. There aren't any carrots honestly if there aren't carrots there is no point playing. Carrots would be a nice touch in this game.7. Rabbits. These ing rabbits that get around thinking they own the damn place. These lil s run around and cause all kinds of mischief they have so much perversity and I cant even get a ing shot with my .22 because they're too damn fast.8. Red animals These red animals literally up I stand around 10 metres away from them but nope I'm too ing close to there personal space. They drop some pretty nice but still.Other than that it's a pretty good game. 10/10",Rust
2014-01-10,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Highly recommend this if you have friends to play with. It will make things a lot easier on the PVP Servers. Also I would advise for you to go on a PvE server before heading out into PVP you should learn how to play craft and how certain things work before dwelling into the world of getting shot on sight.Regardless this is a great Alpha and I can hardly wait for the full version. Totally recommend this to you and your friends. GET IT NOW! ),Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,91,True,Recommended,"Definitely the best of the bunch! Compared to (for example) Dayz the ability to craft items and the feeling of a real survival situation are what set this apart from the rest. I own Dayz and to me that game simply felt like a ""loot quest"" without any feeling of achievement. While the gameplay in Rust is a bit ""clunky"" at times this will likely be remedied in future and we all look forward to the many improvements to come. Server choice is a crucial point which is determined by your gaming style. While I prefer a PVE type relaxed server there are those who will prefer the almost ""Call of Duty"" typre PVP servers where you barely get beyond using a rock as a weapon. I look forward to future updates which will improve upon an already impressive game which definitely stands out among the rest.",Rust

2014-01-30,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,It had become very hard for me to write this since I have tried many times to hope for the best. Since the first day the game came on it ran more or less well so a bit of broken hickups here and there not much any one can do about that. Yet as much as I loved the movem ent being around others as well as building up. The game became broken and very bugged as updates rolled in and that was what became a let down for me. If it was able to run with out another outside sorce then things could have been diffrent and it would still be in stalled.. Becareful when playing and down loading it will bugg out your pc if you aren't careful. Not to point out that it crashs more times then works. I Do hope that it will get better and perhaps one day I can come back in to the fold to enjoy it yet until the bugs and risks are taken care of I dobut I will be playing any time soon.,Rust

2014-09-28,0,0,146,True,Recommended,"I would like to start this out by saying that I've had a generally positive Rust experiance. Aside from a hotile enviroment (which can be fun and frusterating) connetion problems with my internet and most of all hackers! Generally speaking I find this an enjoyable game.That was until today. It was another common rust day on server 8/28 Fresh US EAST Vanilla Airdrops Active Admins No Dura PVP . I was out gathering resources with a group of friends when we were attacked by bandits. There were three of us and one was dead and the other severly wounded when out of nowhere a savior appeared. He killed both bandits and was generally very friendly. Long story short both bandits whine and call him a hacker call us hackers and the admin kicks us 2/3 of us without even investigating. When the last man politely request to know why his compaions were kicked his was told to ""shut up or you'll be next"" he replied saying that he shouldn't be kicked because he has never and won't hack (neither do any of my teamates). Him is promptly kicked from the server. We have NEVER HACKED AND NEVER WILL! But after puting in several days worth of work just to see it vanish in seconds has lead me to the conclusion that...1.Rust is a FUN game as stated we spent several hours/days of plaing I can confirm this.2. The offical servers are unplayable due to the high concentration of hackers and or established players.3. Modded isn't fun play COD if you just want to spawn with a gun and kill people4. Community is all fun and games till you fight with what I assume was a Admins buddy I enjoyed this server. The admin had claimed over 800 hackers kick on 9/28 but then we are kicked without proof... makes you wonder if the time and effort invested in this game are truely worth it.We are the Garrels (player names) and if you can send any helpful info it would be appreciated.",Rust
2014-09-28,0,0,461,True,Recommended,Rust. Everyone is playing it lurking around on top of the hills waiting with their esp to aimbot you in the head. I say if you can't bet em join em. However I am a little hipocrytical because I do not hack myself and ive killed many hacker and run them off servers. After the 300th anniversary hour that I played Rust I decided to try a hack out on a sandboxed and completely cut off from internet Rust. Its absolutely rediculous. People can steal your stuff through a wall without even a scratch on a wall. You can unlock your blueprints with one hit to a keyboard button. You can see ores wood piles mutant animals animals loot bags from 500m away. You can shoot someone in the head every shot withtin the range of your gun. You can make the game 24/7 light. You can hide walls ceilings and kill people through their own house.These are all things that happen to everyone in legacy mode. You cannot survive in official servers and you can only survive in those servers that run RustEssentials because it auto bans hackers.

2014-10-03,0,0,926,True,Recommended,Note This is a review of the now legacy version we all know and loveTo anyone new to the game or unfamiliar with this. The first version of Rust is now called legacy as the developers have been working on a overhaul for Rust.Rust is a open world sandbox survival multiplayer game. The game has no offline mode. The aim of Rust is to survive and get the best equipment. In order to do this you must mine chop wood hunt build and kill other players or dangerous animals that are an obsticle to you. When you enter any Rust server you will start as a naked cave man with the infamous rock. You must work your way up to be able to get good guns a big house ect. Rust is a team based game but it can easily be played solo. The gun play in rust is decent for the scale of the map and amount of players playing in one server but there can sometimes be a problem with blood markers (you shoot someone blood is shown on them but they recive 0 damage) unfortunately this will never change because they have halted all development to this portion of the game. Some of the key aspects of the game are airdrops planes that drop supply crates containing rare items such as C4 used to break into other peoples houses. Another key aspect is the Rad zones which are zones which have small buildings that contain crates that (to be continued),Rust

Joined a server that had an admin online noob friendly PVE and all that got shot on sight by someone cuz i was trying to hunt some animals and i was too close to his castle/pile of home. I asked him why did he shoot on sight i was but naked and had a bow he responded ""those are my animals"" and "" i wasn't allowed to hunt near his home"".This game is about 100% pvp. U dont need to build anything just kill other players and take their loots that s it. Nothing else it's just pure troll.

Money hungry devs waste it on shiny objects that they think will distract their community from the fact that NOTHING in Rust has progressed other than visuals in the past months. Before ""Experimental"" Rust was released I thoroughly enjoyed the limited amount of game content. Even if after a couple days it just became drab. The experimental version is visually pleasing though the devs have wasted all our money polishing a game that's got limited replayability based on the fact that the devs neglected to add new recipes structures etc. Essentially the devs have neglected the community's desires for a more sustainable play experience in favor of a smooth looking game. They basically put $5 000 rims on a $500 car. Not a great business or gaming model. FFS people play minecraft because it's PLAYABLE to 'end game.'

2014-01-18,0,0,33,True,Not Recommended,Rust is yet another early access survival game that everyone has jumped on the bandwagon to. Sadly it is a large portion of this community that has essentially ruined what is already quite a fragile and easy to destroy concept.The reason I write this review now is largely down to the progression of development and how torrid the game has become. Updates are horrifically slow and glaring issues which should be getting ironed out are being overlooked. It may be an alpha but there seems to be a real lack of dev support for them to justify a price of 15.The game itself is like any other in the growing genre except it can be manipulated with cheats bad admins and people that are just out of grief/troll. The community is immature and horrible most of the time and it just diminishes the concept as PVP overrides the survival aspect. You can spawn be killed in seconds and then have to start over. This can happen frequently and even when you finally get some items together and focusing on surviving you run into hackers which plague the game. The inventory system is quite neat and easy to use but the combat is incredibly ropey along with the engine. Visually the game is bright and pleasing on the eye but the landscape textures are very bland and it's all very copy and pasted. The setting may seem large but it's very repetitive in time.Too many people are giving in 10/10 within the first 10 minutes of playing thinking it is the best game ever created. This is a bug ridden alpha that's probably 3 years of completion and even then I can't see how they can prevent the community from delivering the final nail in the coffin.DayZ may have a catalogue of woes itself but it is probably the best in the genre at this stage. Rust is not unique in any way it's just a first person survival game with glaring technical and concept issues that are years from rectifying. For 15 I do not recommend this and in all honesty even as a F2P game it wouldn't even be worth your time.A horrible experience.,Rust
2014-07-21,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,It's just a PVP gank fest full of cheaters and hackers. There's no character customization you're just a white naked bald guy. The voice chat adds an interesting layer to it and the crafting is kind of fun. But the environment poses no threat so there's very little incentive for people to cooperate. I got this game because some friends of mine were playing it but I got disgusted by it first. I saw the problems it had. Pretty soon they also saw the light and rage quit. It amazes me how popular this game is it's pretty awful. I also don't like the main creator's attitude. His recent Twitter comments about gender and character diversity in games pretty much sums up almost everything wrong with the gaming industry right now.,Rust

2014-06-29,0,0,175,True,Recommended,Rust is a multiplayer survival game the graphics are realistic much like many other games out there in the new generation of technology. Despite still being in early alpha rust has proven itself to be a wonderful thrilling game in which those who may seem friendly can easily betray you within a second. The building has proven itself to not quite live up to the expectations of the rest of the game buildings are only made as blocks however are still in extreme detail.

2014-08-07,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,"I think everyone bought into Rust with their own idea of what it should be. I bought into it as soon as it came out and was encapsulated for a couple of weeks. I had hoped for an open world survival game sort of like what Minecraft offers except without the mining or the ""craft."" That's what I found Rust to be a bare bones survival game with as little crafting and construction as possible. I wanted to constantly feel on the move like a nomad. It's not that Rust didn't deliver on my expectations rather it hasn't seemed to deliver anything. Months later I feel stuck with an amorpheous blob of a game that has suffered an identity crisis at every corner. Half a year later and I cannot point to any real improvements in the game. Not only that but the developers have scrapped their old engine for a new one. This should be good in the long run however it truly reflects the developer's inability to cope with the popularity of the game and the development it demands as a result.",Rust

Except I waited in a loading screen for 10 minutes until i crashed.(i7 processor 12 GB Ram GTX 660 OC 3GB)I put the auto settings to ""Good"" and for that 10 minutes I managed to run around locked in at 60 fps but alot of world loading glitches while you travel through the world which I would imagine would be veryupsetting during a PvP chase...This game looks like so much fun but I dont have the time to sit in these kind of loading screens to have thegame crash with the amount of bugs i faced in my first hour I would not recommend this.But because the game looks awesome I will try again another day and maybe change my review.",Rust

2015-02-20,0,0,477,True,Not Recommended,EDIT I've changed my review since the addition of the XP system. The game is totally different now. The tension is gone. Big clans have taken over most servers. It's just not fun anymore. Without the blueprint system progression is completely linear. Hit rocks and trees. Gain XP. Unlock something. Go back to hitting stuff. Stop for a minute to build a few things or tend to a furnace. Go back to hitting stuff. PVP is rare and even when you do PVP you don't care if you lose your stuff. It's stuff you didn't need anyways. You were just out farming for XP. There's no risk/reward anymore.It's just not fun. I'm taking a break for a while until they figure out what they are doing with the game. OLD REVIEW BELOW ( Logged in for the first time. Woke on the beach hit a tree with a rock got some wood hit a rock with a rock got some stone made a hatchet. Walked up a hill. WTF? Random naked dude coming at me. Naked dude hits me with a rock. I die. Wake up on beach again. Make more stuff. Die a few more times. I Figure out what I'm doing eventually build an awesome base. I get a gun and some ammo the get bored. I go for a walk and find another base but the door is locked. I hear activity near by so I wait. And wait... And wait. Finally someone shows up and goes inside. It's night. He comes back out. I wait again. He goes inside and I sneak in behind him. Now inside his base I shoot him. I destroy his sleeping bag (spawn point). He has a ton of stuff. I remove his door lock and take over his base. Wow. He has so much stuff! I'm king! 15 minutes later I start to wonder. Was what I did wrong? What if he was nice? Screw it! This is Rust!All jokes aside. This is quickly becoming the best multiplayer survival game out. The project has come along way in two years. The team's decision to scrap the original concept and start over has really payed off in the past month. There is a ton of gameplay now in non legacy and it will soon have more content than the original. If you quit playing rust b/c of the issues with legacy and the major regression that happened when they decided to scrap it and rewrite the game now is the time to get back into it again.Way to go Facepunch. Thanks for showing everyone how to do an early access game!,Rust
2016-05-24,0,0,954,True,Recommended,so i've put just over 600 hrs on to this game and is now one of my most favorite games that I play at this time. Im not the greatest player on rust but that doesn't stop me from coming back almost every single day. In my opion this game is better if u play with friends but its still playable by yourself. I started out just playing this game by myself but eventually I had made friends in game and we end up playing together as a team which is so much easier than soloing it. One of my biggest problems with this game cause there is a few is the grind if u aren't the type who likes to grind for hours then this might not be the game for u but if u are that type who plays games in where u must grind u should oh definently get this game. another thing is high pop servers could cause people to quit and never come back to the game so i would recommend that u find the perfect balance between low pop servers and high pop. That would be in the range of 20 30 players. If u get this game and if u are lucky enough u might just see me there and plz don't be a in game that ruins the fun for everyone else.,Rust

You can play the old legacy version but it has been months since I was able to play the new experimental branch. The new version is where all the updates are happening and where the game is heading so if you have bitdefender don't buy until they fix this problem. Otherwise I would recommend the game.,Rust

2014-08-27,0,0,217,True,Recommended,This game is very interesting I really liked the sort of the game and I recommend to everyone that likes Survival games. Especially when you are buying with your friends is make the game much more fun and making you to play longer period of time. This game is really difficult and does not fit people that would cry from every second that you lose your things and die. If you die you lose all the stuff that on you (If you have house then no) same about raiding houses. But as easy as you lose your stuff as easy as you get the stuff. I would tell you to play in %100 Vanilla Servers much more fun and much more challange for the players. Enjoy from the game ),Rust

2014-07-29,0,0,437,True,Recommended,i will always love rust i met most of my PC gaming friends in that magical land.Yes FacePunch are starting again but no one can say that the experimental looks worse than the current version. I will admit i havnt been playing much recently but that is because i played it so much when i first got it and when they stopped adding new content i got bored because i burnt the fun away.Come on guys you supported rust this far dont leave now just because they realised they needed to restart and make the game look better and who knows maybe the servers will have even less lag when the experimental is ready and yes they are making other projects as well but is that realy a bad thing? If you have too many people working on one game then it gets hard to organise which means 2 teams might work for 2 weeks and both produce a revolver which means one team has wasted their time.So what do you all say?

2014-07-03,0,0,231,True,Recommended,I truly do recommend this game. But number one rule for me is never make a home near a radiation location. You will be constantly raided and greefed. But i really recommend this game because even though it only is in alpha the graphics are pretty good. There are a lot of bandits in this game but also a lot of good people. No matter what server I go on I find a group of good people and join up with them. There are clans on every server but clans fall and rise so often in this game that it doesnt really matter. On one server i played in three large clans fell within two days and two new clans rose up from the ashes the very next day. I really recommend playing this game especially with a friend!,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,1848,True,Recommended,Been playing Rust for a year now seen it go through XP system components and now to a BP/ component hybrid. It's definitely had its ups and downs but I think Rust is at a point now where this is the system that takes it out of Early Access. The last few months have felt like a PVP death match rather than a true survival game. People are complaining that it's too much of a grind now but it's a survival game it shouldn't be easy to find a gun within the first hour. The new system completley removes that and with the newest update make it even harder for clans to rush AKs. People have become normalised by how Rust was getting guns and being raided within the first couple of hours was a very real threat. It's back to how it should be and a huge step in the right direction. The guys at Facepunch do an incredible job of listening to their fanbase updating the game every week without fail. Ignore the new negative reviews it's just salty kids who want something different to what Rust is destined to be..,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,217,True,Recommended,"I nominated this game for ""Most likely to ragequit"".Imagine the most angry you've ever gotten at a game. Now multiply that times 10. Welcome to Rust!If you've never played it This is the crafting survival game that most others aspire to be. In general is fun to explore. Gameplay is brutal and its engaging. When you survive an attack from another player it feels good. When you are raided or killed you are cast back into the mud again with nothing but a rock. Its a big deal. You can build a castle and lose it overnight. Really dynamic and intersting.Now for the criticism The community is pretty toxic. The game generally seems to favor lowlifes that do nothing but farm and build. Raiding a base takes hours and takes so much work. There's a snowballing effect. The 'rich get richer'. Its like some weird Libertarian thought experiment come to life. Indeed play the game these are your young internet white male potty mouthed Trump supporters. They're here to raid your base and grief you. That's how you play the game.The highlight of the game is base building. Its really fun. witha littel work you can build a hut and eventually your own castle or labrynth. I hope they add even more to this part of the game.The graphics are simoultaneously great...and garbage. You basically need to run on the 'fast setting' to get bit of a playable game. The shadows are like glitchy and weird. This game looks like it was built in Unity and poorly optimized. Hopefully that comes soon enough. At the same time the sunset over the ocean the darkness of the night and the overall quality of models and textures are high. The scenery can be breathtaking. I think this will improve but for now it admittedly needs attention.Oh and the animals... They are straight up lobotmoized maurading meat sacks. The AI is really terrible. The animals literally run up mountains and through rocks. I've been slain by invisible bears (that I guess fell through the floor or something) I feel like the game could use some mutants or something and the animals should be localized to biomes. This part of the games needs serious work from the devs. It's figuratively garbage.But here's the thing I still recommend it. Its not that expensive for the amount of enjoyment. But be warned. Event the strongest willed of you will ragequit at least once. This game gets under your skin.",Rust

Great fun building and fighting there are strength in numbers and in this game the more people you play with the better off your be. You can play solo but its not like the other players will leave you alone to do your thing once they find you. I'd recommend due to the hours I got out of it the fun bits and the fact that there are new updates weekly even though i think bi weekly updates would be better.

Great for playing with friends (you need them tbh).Not recommended for people who hate dying all the time and restarting all over again. The community is loving but harsh.

2014-08-04,0,0,384,True,Recommended,Rust is a very fun game but not so much if you're new to this type of gameplay. My advice would be to join a very small server and learn the basics. Once you've got that down a bit you can jump into more populated servers. This game is all about surviving and doing it better than the next guy. Its about building bases and destoying others. Its about looting the wide open sandbox world that has been created for us. I dont want to give too much away so ill leave it at this. If you've never played and are into games like day z/minecraft/7DTD This will be right up your alley. If you are horrible at survival first person shooters... id keep looking for a game to better suit you. This game gets one million stars out of ten from me.,Rust

If you were on the fence on buying this because of the amount of time you have to play get it!If you plan on playing solo play on a multiplied server so you'll acually have a chance to get started.With this being said you can play on normal times 1 servers and still have a good time.

2015-01-30,0,0,869,True,Recommended,This game is great and the devs are obviously working very hard on it. As you can see i have plenty of hours on the game and each of those hours has been packed with everything from edge of the seat thrill to wanting to snap my keyboard in half. This game has a very unique community that disgusts you at first but you quickly come to love and understand. If you like PvP then this game is for you. As for the devs working on this game let me put in to you this way the devs have this game that everyone loves but it isn't quite working in the capacity that they envisioned that game to be in. So they go and recreate the game code entirely!!!!! You know the devs are looking out for their game and want it to be the best game they can make it when they undertake such a huge project so that they can make the game the way they've always wanted it. And so that the players could still play a playable version they left the old version up while they remade the new one. The devs push out lots of great updates and progress every week I love this game and I love the devs I recommend this game to everyone who likes PvP and isnt afraid to get back up after they've been knocked down.,Rust

Definitely play the game and don't lose hope if it gets hard just keep pushing. Or find a friend or two and enjoy a small party or even a big group but just don't be an a**ho**.

2017-10-19,0,0,58,True,Recommended,Very entertaining game with many features and an appropriate learning curve. Only thing I could suggest is an inbuilt singleplayer for learning rather than having to make players set up their own private server in order to prevent the inital string of dying to more experienced players. The server resets do help to keep to game fairer however prevent newer players from ever reaching lategame as well as being incredibly annoying for server owners since you cannot choose to remain on an old version,Rust

2015-03-09,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Trust me I want to say this is a good game. New Rust sucks in every way a video game can suck. Lag missing textures broken gameplay mechanics that used to work no servers in my local area and the developers know this and have known for years. Updates only seem to break the game even more. Trees give little to no wood. Wood piles are rare. Stone is common. You need absurd amounts of wood to use that stone. Do you have a house foundation? Good! No you have to find blueprints for walls. Did you find a generated structure? Well run because radiation will kill you within 20 seconds now. Did you build a house with a door? By the time you get on tommorow someone has killed you and taken all your food. Speaking of food there are little to no animals. But when you do find a pack of dear boars birds a lone bear or a pack of wolves. They can outrun or kill you. Old rust fixes this. No lag or missing textures. Good gameplay. And plenty of servers. So play old rust or you will bust a hole in your fancy gaming cpu.,Rust

2014-08-07,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Why do the flares look like ?,Rust
2017-10-19,0,0,873,True,Recommended,"500 hours in i think its time for a review So a bit about the game rust is a open world survival game with some roleplay elements. Depending on your server your experiece will vary. There are alot of options for players everything from pve only(killable animals and ""boss"" mobs(heli bradley) to full on pvp servers (start with end game gear and weapons and go on a killing streak). the games concept is simple you build and make stuff with components/resources you find in the wild you research items that you find in the wild to permanently learn them you eat you kill you live and if you dont like your neighbors blow them up. While the devs have been somewhat ambiguous with the direction that they were going. It seems that they have finally decided on a direction recently. This change has reintroduced a old mechanic (the blueprint system) and merged it with the mechanic they were currently using( the componet system) which in my opinion has been a very welcomed change. It has brung some liveliness to the servers. and a improvement in the comunity. Thanks to the new system there is alot more communication people are trading now more grouping together and team building more people exchanging information etc etc. ofcourse theres always trolls its still the internet and theres always gonna be some trigger happy guys. I feel I can reommend this game to everyone because in its current state its become alot more ""noob"" friendly with more people willing to talk instaed of shoot on sight (I heavily recommend a mic or things can get nasty) and you still have enough diversity in the modded scene to get a taste of everything in the game",Rust

2017-08-28,0,0,376,True,Recommended,So after playing with the BP update I thought I would update my review for this game. It continues to be my favorite game and whilst the BP system has helped extremely with the amount of BS in the game and making it more of a struggle to get higher tier items. It still doesn't solve the problems of large groups and the negative setbacks of being a solo player. I also believe a stronger survival element would help make this game more enjoyable but where it stands my review changes to the positive I would recommend this game now I just wish it would be more difficult to get guns and ammo for the guns.,Rust

2014-10-16,0,0,28,True,Recommended,"I bought this game due to getting sick of the same old MMO hack and slash game and return x and y and get z. So survival game is my new venture. However I do like playing with others even if it is a pvp setting. So here is my first day playing. This is a great game and is constantly being updated and improved. Trust nobody! Took no time at all to get the hang of the game and the people on the server answered every question even politely believe it or not! With that said this is pvp and they are coming! So I spent a couple hours collecting wood and building myself a decent little shack complete with a hallway. So I'm out gathering more wood thinking the cover of night would shield me from any possible attacks or at least let me run away and hide. I had also spent some time building a nice chest to put things in. I had countless amounts of wood weapons and other goodies stored away. If its behind locked doors enemies cannot come in. Until.So Im minding my own business when I all of a sudden hear someones footsteps I turned around and there they were!! Two of them trying to slap me around with rocks! Quickly I ran into my house and locked the door. They were stuck outside! Haha Me +1 them 0. So then they start hacking away at my door with rocks. Both taking turns as it gets old hitting the mouse button I guess. Suddenly literally after about 15 minutes of hacking away at the door and me taunting them that they cannot get in they burst in and kill me. Stealing my house and all my belongings inside. So then I respawned sighed and said..""Damn"" and started all over. This is Rust!",Rust

2014-08-12,0,0,31,True,Recommended,This game is extremely fun and addictive although it could use some improvement. Most of the crafting is fun although it is almost ineffective compared to scavenging in radiotion zones. I feel like this game you either play as a scavenging hermit or a ruthless killer. Going in large groups is intimidating but is hard to maintain making groups of 3 4 much more common. new spawn killing has also been a problem as people will kill you for no reason even if you try and be friendly. Sadly there is no fix for that.,Rust

2014-10-12,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,I have very mixed feelings about this game. Yes I do enjoy the concept of the game. Yes the mechanics of it's crafting and survival aspects are well built out. But no the multiplayer is just not that fun. For starters the designated servers are simply ruined. Hackers are rampant on every corner of every map and the fact that they had to remove aspects of the game because other players ruined it for the rest of us is proof to the point. The server system is broken. Yes you can play on private servers but the world resets and abusive admins basically make any and all progress redundant. If this game were fixed 6 out of 10 but it has been so long without a proper update... 4 out of 10.,Rust

2016-09-15,0,0,1241,True,Not Recommended,This was my review to the game when I first got it. This game is a great game to get on with friends. Although the game is a bit of a grind game it is still fun. You can build virtually anything your heart desires or you can take a different route and explore the pvp aspect of the game. Altogether a great game and I fully recommend it. After the most recent update that added components it is way too easy for large groups to get weapons and components I used to love this game and how if you were a solo player the game wasn't impossible but after the updates that have been coming out this game is no longer fun. I really hope facepunch realises this and fixes it this game has so much potential.,Rust

2014-08-09,0,0,79,True,Recommended,This game I must admit is the prime example of what can be achieved with a solid committed hard working development team. They are by far the best. For one I have not seen a single person cheat on this game and that in itself is what manifests inside this game to make it quite brilliantly the experience of a lifetime. Not only that but Rust is the only game they focus on without a doubt. Clearly every single developer they have works on Rust. I even personally know some of the on site cleaners who secretly have experience in C++ and various 3D animation software. He used to be my school janitor till he dropped out of oxford for being too good. But don't mind that a fundamental change to the history of games in the making is something facefalconpunch have managed to completely achieve as a company having no commitments AT ALL to designing other games full large storages of their res' go to building this game from the ground up once again. For the very reasons detailed explicitly above this game has my full undeniable and gratitious support for the future and beyond.I recommend this game!,Rust

I've been abused so many times by the admins of these servers and Facepunch has made it so I must pay to host my own server. I understand that this game is in alpha. But it has been a very frustrating experience for me. I love this game but I hate the servers. Also I'm sick of constantly being called names and threatened without any repercussions for the offender. My girlfriend also plays this game and she has been sexually harrassed several times because her voice sounds like a womans... Someone ever told her she needed to send him pictures of her breasts to get an item she wanted. This game has made me lose faith in humanity. F this game. F games in general.

2016-02-05,0,0,103,True,Not Recommended,Just remove Linux support...I barely review bought items/games at all and never had the urge to defecate on someone's head that way. Let's start with a positive point.The game itself is good if you like that survival style with no given goal. I played with a buddy built a nice base and all that stuff. There are many things to explore. There are many things to re discover because there are server wipes every now and then. It's still in alpha.But it's poorly optimated for Linux. I watched it a while in Steam store before I decided to buy it. As far as I remember Rust was already available for Linux users some years ago. So they had plenty of years to fix this but they decided to not do so. I have 10 15 FPS maximum at lowest settings and every update breaks something new. Today's update fully removed ground and wall textures as well as player models. According to reddit other players have this issue too. Literally unplayable.What the devs say you may ask? Then take a look at this https //twitter.com/garrynewman/status/615071229947564032If I knew about that 'statement' beforehand I would not have bought this game. They make it available for Linux users don't do testing for that platform at all and charge them for the full price. On top of that they call their own customers 'second class citizens'. Apparently Facepunch chose their company name for a reason. If you look for a word to describe this practice I would suggest 'fraud'.I definitely regret paying the full price and therefore supporting this studio. Congratulations you ripped me off. You are a disgrace to any indie development studio which decides to support Linux as platform. But you won't fool me twice that's for sure.,Rust

2017-10-12,0,0,804,True,Recommended,Re Introduction of BPs has slowed down progression for the better and the game feels so much more fun to play. No more power grind to end game loot within the first few hours. You actually have to be successful with lower tier loot in order to progress which is infinitely better. Thanks Facepunch! Obviously a few kinks here and there but the game is moving in a MUCH better direction. Solo players and new people will cry but honestly I'm not sure what was fun about getting AKs and C4 on the first day. Nice to be able to sleep without fear of my base being blown to smithereens on the first day. Feels like Rust again ),Rust

2016-02-13,0,0,346,True,Not Recommended,I did have a reccomended review of this game and it used to be one of my favourite games on steam for a very long while but sadly my love for this game has ended and it is all becuase of the community back when this game was first released the game was new refreshing and all round easy to play with a helpfull comunity and alot of solo players so it was easily playable if you didnt have many freinds to play with (i played in a small clan of 3 5 players) but large clans have now taken over and the game is almost unplayable unless you have around 6 10 people to play with.the community is also very toxic now throught the influence of the big clans and many people have stopped playing becuase of this. There is no longer or rarley solo players that can last a whole wipe without being raided. i have took a very long brake from the game since they got rid of blueprints i havent really played much of the game. i hope this game regains most of its fun times back and i hope to be playing it again soon but in the state the game is at the moment i cant reccomend this game as much as i would like 2.,Rust
2017-08-30,0,0,1048,True,Recommended,In this game you definitely need to play because its gameplay captures it's not Dise in which you just need to wet other players and zombies here you will have to survive in a harsh world where everyone is for himself !!!,Rust
2014-07-13,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,This might be a fun game but who can tell since you are typically killed before even getting the most rudimentary items to build with.

2014-09-21,0,0,31,True,Recommended,It's a good game. But the user needs more information and control over the game.Allow a Single Player for starters just let a player get used to the basics of crafting and surviving without the odd troll who comes along with a Revolver every 5 minutes. Giving the player more options in a Single Player mode such as No Enemies More Spawns so the game is easier to pick up.Just needs a lot more work and help with new users.,Rust

They may look the same and act the same yet they can never recreate the feeling that this game gives off the entire time playing it. Maybe it's the manliness of running around murdering the innocent with no pants on and genitals flying free. Maybe it's the rush of adrenaline you get when 4 people wearing black kevlar knock on your door asking for tribute. If you are a fan of gritty survival fps games and a little dark humour this game is defently worth a go.,Rust

2017-08-04,0,0,3902,True,Recommended,Rust is a mixed bag with me. I started long ago and progressed into owning and running a popular server. I've seen the developers grow and expand this game for better (and sometimes for worse). The small changes at first were miniscule largely meant to add more fun more challenging and fix bugs. This game used to be about finding unique ways to get into peoples bases. They've been making the game way too easy now because newer players were complaining. Mini games? Cmon guys. If you're going to do that have a few old school servers.I still like Rust but I think you should know this If you're into a game that is constantly changing and survival based you'll like this. When I say constantly changing I mean in regards to the game play. Mecahnics and whatnot often change as the Developers update the game every week.,Rust

2016-01-19,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Oh Rust. The game you love to hate but hate how much you love it. As far as an Early Access Game goes this one is in the top selection with a fantastic environment of building raiding and becoming a dangerous wanderer across the land. You'll make a few friends a lot of enemies and it'll take a lot of time to get the hang of it. But in the end it is an extremely fun game with its greatest potential in playing with a group.I will continue to support Rust and hope the developers will continue to add new content and polish the game to perfection. (Or atleast make it so bears can't scale mountains in record time...)9/10 for gameplay interface and environment to play in. Just remember to jump into a Community server for the best experience.,Rust

Once it loaded I was pleasantly provided with a game that is immersive and extremely fun. I only have 2.3 hours recorded in it right now but man were they interesting. Tips Make sure you have a mic. Having a mic will really help you progress further with other players. Make sure you have people to play with. It's fun alone but even better with a group of people. Give the game time to load. It takes a good 2 5 minutes for the game to process everything it's loading. Find a good server that has a low PING. Follow these and you should have a good time. Now go out there and get killed by a bear dog or Steve Buscemi.,Rust

2016-01-22,0,0,609,True,Recommended,Rust is base building survival game. The main objective is to upgrade your technology and equipment and to develope territory against other players. While playing the updated version and legacy version I can say that this game has a lot of content to explore and many features to be used. Because Rust is still in its early developement It is hard for me to say this game will continue to be a creative crafting and hunting game. I believe Rust is best served wih friends and should totally be enjoyed that way. My favorite part of Rust is being able to construct your own base the way you want and how you wish to organise your plunder. Overall I would give this game a good rating.,Rust
2016-01-22,0,0,637,True,Recommended,I friend introduced me to Rust via Gift.After playing Rust I now no longer have any friends this game gave me cancer.10/10 would do it all over again.,Rust
2017-10-11,0,0,344,True,Recommended,Solo play is possible but since resource gathering is a major aspect of the game more bodies will have an easier time.Raiding is mixed. Once you get a large base you will likely only be offline raided. Online raids are almost always against smaller bases/new players. The performance is great. You can easily tune the graphics settings to get a consistent FPS.Weekly updates usually one or two performance upgrades plus a small content item and general item balancing. Large content patches happen every few months.Devs are still working hard on trying to find a progression system that fits the game so there will be some good (and bad) ideas implemented over time.Bretty gud game 5/5,Rust

2014-05-12,0,0,80,True,Recommended,I haven't played this game very long but so far I think this game is great. With factors such as crafting building surviving and PvP who wouldn't play this game? You start off with a rock a torch and a bandage. You can use the rock to collect resources make simple tools and continue to build on. Despite being an early access game I like its feel and see big potential in the future for it. It is worth the $20 and as soon as you enter the world you will not even put the game down. I also recommend this game for people who have played Garry's Mod since it is made by Garry Newman and his crew or who have played other survival games. This game is good for people who are new to the survival genre of games like myself.,Rust

2014-06-23,0,0,14,True,Recommended,If you want a game full of s this is the game for you.Imagine yourself alone in the wilderness and completely naked(yes actually naked there's an option for you to disable the censor blur) with only a rock a torch and some medical packs to start with. Now imagine starting out collecting resources and then just as you are about to make your first shelter you're shot in the head from a random person in the distance with a late game weapon.Now you're dead with none of those resources. And the scumbag who one shotted you is laughing in chat calling you a noob and he's not going to even bother picking up the low level loot that you spent half an hour collecting.This is how RUST works. You can't host a server so those servers who do show up on the list are filled with kids and adults alike who just want one thing to absolutely destroy your life.,Rust
2014-06-23,0,0,171,True,Recommended,Rust is a good game based on a great idea with immeasurable possibilities. The worst thing I can say about Rust is that the creators have made a striking sandbox with a few quirks resulting I believe from its early alpha status. By and large it is a good start and I think fans of the survival genre should watch Rust and see what it evolves into. I heartily recommend it. But I will also add an addendum. At this point it is early and the game still has a long way to go. I think part of that evolution may be that it has to decide what type of game it wants to be. For instance in its current state the pve side of survival is anemic to say the least. This brings to light one of the least enjoyable aspects of Rust other players. Be warned in that at this point in alpha while also enjoyable to a lot of us Rust also seems to appeal to that niche group of sadist gamers out there who tend to derive pleasure out of thinking up new and creative ways to torment other players. Rust has given them the tools to do this with very few limitations. Take note This is not all players but the current rule set does attract this sort. While many games encourage player vs player mechanic Rust is unique in that it requires a large time investment from gamers with great loss upon death. Because Rust is not a simple FPS (respawn without great cost) people looking to torment others have found a home here and will often use pvp (and pve) as a means to get their fix. And by the way if that is what you enjoy that is perfectly fine. No judgments. Personally I m hoping this is purely a result of its current early alpha state. Again it is just as likely you will come across a solid group of survivalists out as the other sort but be forewarned.,Rust

2015-12-08,0,0,34,True,Recommended,"I wake up on the beach with no memory of how I got onto the Island. No memory of my life. No knowledge of who I am. The only thing I knew was that I needed to build a campfire somehow. Somewhere.I found a rock along the beach as well as a torch a bit inland. After coming across a tree I begun to swing madly at it with the small fist sized rock in my hands. Smack after smack. Thwack after thwack. I slowly began to degrade the bark and the wood underneath as my onslaught continued onto the plant. Eventually I had weakened the wood enough and tore out a chunk of bark and inner wood. Using some of the vines on the tree I tied my rock to the jagged shaft of wood and created a makeshift hatchet.Noticing that I was stark naked with no protection from anyone or anything that this mysterious land could have in store for me I began my work collected plants wood and pebbles until eventually I had been able to make myself some garments and wraps for my feet. I then was able to make a bow as well as some arrows with a bag that served as my quiver. With my goal of making a campfire next in mind I set out to hunt something worth cooking over my soon to be campfire.After treaking through rocky terrain and frozen tundra I continue to not see any wildlife to collect. Starting to grow hungry I look around and notice mushrooms growing between the rocks. Not seeing any alternative I began to feast on the unsuspecting shrooms until my belly was full and I felt satisfied. After finishing my feast I hear branches snapping in the underbrush. As I look up to see what the cause of the noise was I see it A boar.The hunt was short lived as I chased the wild creature shooting arrows into it as it ran from me. Eventually the wounds from my arrows caused it to slow down and I was able to catch up with it. As it collapsed gasping for air I put the creature out of its missery with a swift blow of my hatchet to its skull. It twitched and continue to do so for a few moments but eventually as all dead things do it lay completely motionless. With a meal ready I began to prep a campfire.It did not take long as I only needed some logs and something to spark it and set it ablaze using the tree sap as makeshift lighter fuel. With the flame ablaze I began to skin and prepare my meal. With the pike in place and the boar rotating above the flaming inferno. I sat next to it staring into its firey depths until without warning I hear a small explosion and feel myself get hit in the chest. As I crumble to the ground I see a figure walk out from the woods with a rifle in his hands and a grin on his face upon seeing the boar I had prepared. As he neared me I held up my hand. A voiceless plea.He looked at me for a few moments before grinning and pointed his rifle at me.""Don'tcha worry you sorry sod. I'll make it quick and painless.""With the pull of the trigger and a small pain to my head I crumbled down. As I lay there with the darkness taking over I stare at my little fire. The way the flames liked the boar meat held over it by a pike. The light cackle of the logs as they slowly turned into embers. With that the darkness took over and I was no more.10/10 Would get killed by a random again.",Rust

2017-10-08,0,0,306,True,Not Recommended,What the actual this game has become. I used to play for hours just to have this feeling of being safe with friends in a 1 by 1 wooden house with a mere camp fire. Now the only feeling I get is the one of my being teared appart by full geared ers hunting scrubs for some stones. Yet I can't blame these full geared ers since the only way to get stones is to chase scrubs. To sum it up the devs apparently deleted every ing stone spawn and I'm sure they'll soon make some packs of stone you'll be able to purchase for 99 99 USD. Do not purchase this ing game unless you want to spend 3 hours searching for stones and end up finding 50 when a freakin' hatchet is 200.

If they'd actually optimize the game instead of adding new useless community market items that'd be great. I can't play this game with some of my friends due to their pc not being able to handle it but Dark Souls 2 and the likes are running just fine.

2017-10-09,0,0,364,True,Recommended,Used to love this game but after several fresh starts and tedious farming I started to just play modded servers for epic gun fights but that unfortunately means your base / loot isnt worth anything. Game is best played with 3 / 4 people on vanilla servers the farm and struggle at first is when I most enjoyed the game slowly and steadily fortifying your base and doing trades with other groups.Havent played in a while but overall if theres a few of you you should but this game!,Rust

2014-05-08,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,(2016 edit below this review was written about 2 years ago) Bought this game a while ago have yet to play more than 15 hours. This game is very fun if played with friends the only problem is getting into a server with friends and even more difficult is findind said friends. This game could use a map better sever system and overall a more polished design. A tutorial would also be nice. But aside from that wait until the game is updated a little more before buying it.EDIT This game is horrible now the devs ruined it by completely revamping the game. I'm pretty sure it's never going to leave early access anyway. This game is bad don't spend your money on it.,Rust

2017-06-09,0,0,144,True,Not Recommended,You should not buy it. It's not fun you spend a lot of time and you get no progress. Official servers are wiped every 2 3 weeks most of the players (90%) are hostile and will try to kill you even if you are no threat to them and they are clearly stronger than you. I've played quite a while trying to find a better server a better experience and hoping that this time it will be different. The game is not nearly finished yet the developers are working on designs and concepts while there are clearly more important things to do like optimizations and balance. Srsly don't waste you money and time don't buy it.,Rust

2017-09-09,0,0,149,True,Not Recommended,I like the game itself so detailed in graphics.What I really dislike is how toxic people are and how you will never ever get a good base going unless you spawn beside a raided base which have good stuff in it. The PvP is just either rushing with a shotgun or pure luck.Stone seems really hard to find where you flood in metal ore/sulfur.I wouldn't recommend this game if you are playing solo might aswell just go trickshotting in CoD or CSGO.

2013-12-15,0,0,70,True,Recommended,This game is great when playing with your mates or even people who you just meet in the game. I was surprised after playing this game how little of the time i was killed by bandits like in games such as dayz. Usually the people you meet in this game are friendly and give you resources to survive or they even let you survive with them.I give this game a 9/10 the one being the off chance you get killed by a bandit and rage quit.

2013-12-15,0,0,187,True,Not Recommended,"Ok I gave at the beggining a good review to this game although I must change it bypassing the fact that servers have being offline for SOME (more than 75% of rust users) players for the past 5 days (check community if you don't believe me check the date I am writing the review and check for the discussions) the game it's just scripted by idiots.Let me exapand most of the time you work to gather stuff and you might have even 80 hours of gameplay behind you but that doesn't matter because you will LOOSE ALL YOU STUFF EVERYTHING. Yep that's right ""chill though it's alpha right?!?!"" ok how about the times that you loose all your stuff for those 5 minutes lags where you just simply log out and log back in and everything dissapears?!?!.I do understand it's alpha but with such problems you SHOULDN'T HAVE RELEASED IT!!Also make sure you make friends in pvp servers and make sure they have the best guns because you won't survive AT ALL. That's right seems like some admins like to favorite some users and those users are particularly sadistic and even if in some server some admins do not favorite users it will be you with a slow rock again 5 or 6 people with rifles and guns.Resources are almoust RARE TO RESPAWN it takes ages and I MEAN AGES TO FIND ROCK!! I do understand it should be challenging but this is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGING! (FROM SOMEBODY WHO LIKES AND PLAY A LOT OF THIS KIND OF GAMES WHERE YOU HAVE TO GATHER RESOURCES).Also let's not mind the fact that even if you are lucky and you might be able to play in one of the few non pvp servers guess what?!? You might still get killed by a user how?!? THERE IS A TONS no no sorry an IMMENSE AMOUNT OF HACKERS IN THIS GAME!!!And you still will die or loose all your stuff!!!This game is definetly NOT WORTH IT NO IN ALPHA AND WILL DEFINETLY NOT COUNT ON BEING BETTER AT RELEASE.This game is made for make a quick buck out of loyal steam users!!!

2013-12-24,0,0,42,True,Recommended,This game is very fun it is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The only catch is that it is pretty demanding and there are lag zones once in a while. If you havea great computer you will be fine but dont buy it unless you have at least a GeForce GTX 650. Otherwise this game is great as long as you have friends and enemies. This game is like a mixture of Minecraft and DayZ if you like those type of games this is a game for you.

2017-06-28,0,0,431,True,Recommended,"While the toxicity of certain members of the game's community are hard to ignore Rust more than makes up for this through its intense gameplay with a sharp learning curve and no forgiveness for the weak and unskilled. Gameplay In Rust every player starts naked on a beach with nothing but a rock and a flaming torch. they must gather resources to craft tools weapons and armour with the ultimate goal being to build the biggest base which is made easy by its simple yet complex basebuilding system kill lots of players and raid their bases for loot until you're sitting on a gilded throne of weapons and resources. This crafting based gameplay is typical of most survival shooter/pvp games and those who have played any similar games before will find Rust's systems intuitive and easy to pick up. What On Earth Is A Wipe? Rust uses procedurally generated maps which change every time a server ""wipes"" (meaning it changes the map and all progress and constructions are erased). While this may seem like a bad thing it's not. It keeps the game fresh and stops a powerful clan of players from permanently dominating a server. Servers can choose how often they wipe with official servers wiping Monthly on the first Thursday of every month. The most popular servers are weekly wiped servers while some even wipe as frequently as every 2 days! Visuals Rust's settings are very customizable especially the graphical settings which can be tweaked so the game runs on even the most basic Asus laptop. On the flip side the graphics can be ramped up to create some of the most stunning visuals in an open world game as big as Rust is. Conclusion In Conclusion Rust is a great game. If adreneline fuelled gunfights and incredible visuals backed by a deep and suitably complex crafting and basebuilding system sound like your thing then Rust is the game for you!",Rust

2015-02-19,0,0,258,True,Recommended,This is my 1st survival game and so far so good. It's true it has is ups and downs but as far as i can tell is a lot fun specially if you play with friends.Pros Good base building have tons of fun building Good loot system you can go to a rad town and get various types of loot not just guns ammo and armor it's pretty random which is good good movement controls can easily get used to good community dispite some players most of them are friendlys and are happy to help but hey it's a survival where the strong winCons Animals have some movement bugs You can't ever die from hunger or thirst Stacks are pretty low (1k per stack) by standard It's tiresome to be pressing W and SHIFT everytime you see an airdrop and have to run half map to get it. The spawn of trees and stones is pretty slow so again you have to walk some time to gather resources and if you have a furnace you need to have gathered a huge amount to keep filling it.Based on what i said and considering it's an early acess and has updates every week the game is worth buying and it's cheaper than most survival games.,Rust

2015-07-16,0,0,67,True,Not Recommended,"THIS IS MY OPINON I'M SURE MANY OF YOU LOVE IT BUT I DO NOT When I saw my friends playing this game I asked them if I should buy it. They responded with a quick ""Nah it sucks. Don't waste your money on it."" I bought it anyways just to try it out. When I finished downloading the game I started it up to see exactly what I had gotten myself into. The first server I load into is a Russian server as soon as I joined I got kicked for not speaking the native language. After a couple looks into some servers I found a noob friendly server. It was pretty cool not gonna lie but then it got kind of boring. Hitting things with rocks until you have enough supplies then getting killed by a mic spamming speed hacker isn't really fun. I thought that maybe I haven't given the game some time so I played it for two hours straight. It was boring and I tried to get into it. I honestly kept telling myself that maybe the game isn't that bad. But in my opinon it wasn't very good. Sorry to all of you survival game lovers but I just couldn't.

2017-01-22,0,0,16,True,Recommended,I think this game deserves more credit. The developers need massive kudos for giving the game account based randomly generated avatars with different faces races and sexes. We're so used to having character creation in games that we treat it like it's a requirement. For those of you that disagree with this choice by Facepunch Studios take a look at Ark Its a similar game and it has one of the worst character creators in recent history. You end up in that game with 4 foot tall bobbleheads and lanky monsters with giant hands and big feet. Even if you want to make a character look normal but unique you'll find out that you look exactly the same as everyone else just a little bit taller or shorter buffer or skinnier. With randomly assigned avatars everyone can look different without being monsters.I want to see more games perma assign avatars to people. It mimicks real life and I think it does wonders for immersion. When they fully flesh out this feature people will be looking more at your avatar than the name above your head to identify you it think thats a great thing. (I always like to turn off nameplates anyways). Hopefully this is something we see more in the gaming world.,Rust

2017-01-31,0,0,223,True,Recommended,"This game is honestly great. I put 60 hours into it within the first 4 days I owned it.I will admit people are right about animals being wonkey. Animals clip through walls which is incredibly annoying and I wish FP would fix it. Besides that the game gets bi weekly updates and they listen to the community and play the game themselves. Another downside is the community is aids. This can be expected though due to the nature of the game (kill everyone and take their loot). You can't be a and play this game or you'll just sit there crying after someone kills you. There are nice people though.Other than that the game does get pretty boring by yourself but it's pretty easy to find people to play with. I found my current friends after I killed them when they were mining outside my base and I revived them after taking their weapons.This game is meant to be FUN which does happen. The very first time I loaded into a server I met a fellow naked who was reading Dr. Seus. On a different server (official Reddit server) I had a kid walk up to me and started hitting the tree I was at and he said something along the lines of ""Since we're friends now want to rock fight?"" to which I responded hell no because I had 2 health. He threw his rock at me and I went down of course he then procceded to beat my skull in while saying ""Hey that's pretty good.""Even after all of that it's what makes me love this game.",Rust

2017-07-12,0,0,125,True,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game unless you have allot of time to dedicate towards it. I tried it because some friends of mine insisted I did. I usually like ruthless games but Rust isn't very rewarding for how ruthless it is and it's not optomised to be as ruthless as it is. I crash allot for some reason at random moments such as when the helicopter shoots a rocket there seems to be allot of hackers who can head shot you .5 seconds after they see you I have had my doors opened some how by a group of raiders without them needing to input a password and resources are so scarse that you need to spend half an hour trips salvaging so you can run back and hope you don't get shot. I am doing allot of complaining but I tried to like this game since I realy like the concept but there are just way too many flaws for this to be any kind of game to dedicate time into.The last straw for me was when I logged in today and saw that someone built twigs onto my barracks roof jumped over my barb wire walls destroywed my wood roof and sunk on in to destroy/loot everything. I can take a loss but I realised I can't possibly put in the time some of these younger guys are and that I will never be able to compete like I need to because of that.In short don't but unless you have1 Allot of time to sink into a wipe2 A decent sized group of friends to play with I'd say 6 8 at minimum3 Are the calmest coolest mofo on the planet that doesn't get ragedAlso what's with the random gender generation?

2016-08-10,0,0,72,True,Recommended,Rust does a lot of things good (IMO that is) like how relativly simple the crafting/building is the minamilistic UI and the maps.BUT the games does a lot of things wrong as well. First there's a lack of things to really well do aside from building. Meeting your survival needs in this game (hunger/thirst) is not difficult so once you've got even a small stockpile of food and what not you're left with a distinct lack of stuff to do unless you plan on building some massive complex for and giggles (which is fun to do not gonna lie).Second there's no easy way to play solo. You have to basically install and run your own server if you want to and while it's not difficult it isn't exactly intuative since you have to use SteamCMD.Third the game isn't really eassy for new players to get into depending on what server they decide to try first. Larger servers are often newbie gank fests with large clans running around doing nothing but trolling new players. Smaller servers are often OK but again you ruin into the first problem I mentioned a lack of things to do once your done building (even when factoring in building decay).And finally we have how long this game's been in Early Access. It's been 4 Years already and that's kind of a long time IMO.So do I recommend this game? Well kind of. It's fun if you have a group of friends to play with but it's also one of those games where it's going to turn people off for one reason or another. So my recomendation is to wait for a sale or it to be part of something like a Humble Bundle.,Rust
2015-10-07,0,0,2918,True,Recommended,"I'd love to see rad zombies protecting loot and I'd also love to see radiation in all rad towns(ironic?) The good old 200 radiation and you start dying would nice compared to the current rad damage system. That a cool feature. Oh yea and the good old rad pills don't dehydrate you thing? Consequenceless toolbar spam items ftw!!! What happened to designated resource valleys and wood piles? Gathering or harvesting anything had a predictable risk in designated areas. Building far out in wasteland should result in you being naked and resource less. Those hills with tons of rocks dividing every designated area were also pretty nice for bailing on a run(also for hiding bases) Why am I explaining fundamental map design to a game that used to have exactly that? Oh yea and who the heck came up with components by themselves and not paired up with blueprints? I'm not talking blueprint fragment grindfest the good old research kit stuff. Was that not the original plan back in the day? It would be a perfect way to bridge the two art styles while keeping both progression systems. It would also help with weird situations where you want to make something but you don't because you'd rather have a armoured door(gears *cough*). Have a tier workbench system that requires certain parts or items to do or craft something while also reducing times and slots depending on the tier. Researching should be a simple research kit and the chance should be the state of the item you're trying to research. Don't forget blueprints with that they are the key to everything.Spice vanilla up a bit and bring back 250 5 10 stacking and slow building. the is up with the stacking? It's so damn cluttered and adding a external backpack isn't going to fix that. I already have a backpack in my prison pocket why would I need two? Just merge some items and change stacking.Tool cupboards should a way to authorize people to remove but only through the original structure owner. Blatantly showing anyone in the area that you are building blocked is kind of cancer and and allowing people to build cheap twigs up your base is equally cancer. I like my server that allows ladders only but not on high externals in blocked zones. There's also multi code locked tcs on there so no one can actually grief your base with anything but rockets and c4. Oh rockets are op why can they do so much splash on structures it's no wonder the building system is so centric on having the biggest ing base you can possibly make with a combination of all your resources.Before I finish this off ya'll have to check out these far cry 2 jamming/breaking animations. Bringing cleaning kits into the workbenches I mentioned would be a whole lot more immersive than just having your gun break when it hits red. The guns should rust and be more likely to jam the more you use them(until it blows up) .556 cleaning kit 12 gauge cleaning kit and 9mm cleaning kit https //www.youtube.com/watch?v wrPy450A4usA lot of features of legacy seem to be making a comeback update by update but ""Experimental?"" is fundamentally flawed compared to its predecessor.

Rust was fine at first but once Garry got millions(i think 40+ million idk) he basically ran and took it.

2015-09-06,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Wanna know why?It has one of the worst communities in a online game. Everyone will murder you even if you have a rock.. not to mention if you build a house you will be murdered if you move away from it or open your doors. I say this not because I hate the game. for the most part I love these types of games when theres a community backing them. Hey if you're not part of a clan from the get go you are F'd. Here's the thing.. I know this game is about death hardship and building a new frontier basically but when it comes down to it you will NOT get to experience most of the good awesome stuff you see on youtube. Just because you can't survive on your own the first 2 3 days. you will be spotted... and killed on site by everyone.Oh also the pvp realms are spawn camping crap where you're lucky to live maybe 3 seconds before being murdered horribly by about 8 people at once lol. So yeah? all in all this game is freaking HORRIBLE. minecraft is a better alternative by far even though it's not amazing graphics. this game is so bad I would LOVE to have a refund lmao. It's just that bad.,Rust

2014-12-11,0,0,6207,True,Not Recommended,After 887 hours I've decided that although the game is pretty good. Offering crafting and building dwellings to defend. It seems like the game is engineered for trolls and hackers. Even on community servers. If a plugin is added for anti cheat anti fly or anti bagging the server gets listed in the modded section. Soon after the population drops and the server dies.Modded should mean a complete different game mode and not a few anti cheat measures that protect players.I've seen this cycle happen on 3 different servers. It always starts with fly hack raids or a bagging incident. After a few times of everyone losing everything to hackers the admins install plugins to prevent all the ways hackers can exploit. After a couple of weeks there's less than 5 people left.So hackers and trolls win and the game itself and it's creators assure it.New version trolls can even pickpocket and it was made default far earlier than it was ready.,Rust

BUTThere are some issues that make this game unfair such as teleporting broken &amp glitchy wild animals killing you instantly and the infamous ""Twig Update"" that lets players build low tier structures near your base.And also the most annoying f**king thing about this game is that I have to reinstall it everytime I want to play. Otherwise it just crashes on the main loading screen with an error code like ""RustClient.exe has stopped working"" . This might be the biggest flaws of the game at least in my opinion. But I do have hope for this game I've been playing since 2014 and I am still searching for a game that is at least half as good.",Rust
2017-06-03,0,0,437,True,Recommended,Great game overall. Would love for them to incorperate a better gun fighting style/melee weapon style the current one just seems to be missing some sort of balance especially for the easier obtained weapons such as the 1 shot pistol and waterpipe shotgun being worthless to make as the wooden bow is very overpowered. Also wouldn't mind a Pve server with more aggressive animals and possibly PvP zones. Still an awesome game already reccomended to all my friends.,Rust

2014-03-25,0,0,58,True,Not Recommended,"The Game has alot of good ideas and plans ahead of it but I would suggest not buying it yet.There are alot of exploits in the game still which allows greifers to wreck havok on you if you become their target. (Forced disconnects from server and while d/c'd they can kill your sleeping character even if on a non pvp non sleeoer server)Dupes and various speedhacks and cheat engines that spoof the server system and cheatpunch (anti cheat software)Game has potential WHEN it is finished otherwise your just throwing you money and time away.EDIT To elaborate being killed isnt the harsh part this is a game where they can loot everything you were carrying so if you think your stuff is safe on your character becuase its ""not a pvp server"" guess again just takes a forced d/c and you'll log back in naked and alone.

2014-03-25,0,0,64,True,Recommended,In short this game is amazing. It is fantastic. It has the potential to dominate the game market if only it wasn't for the community. In every server you join small or official there will be 8 year olds flying around ghost teleporting to you through walls and insta killing you with rocks. The game needs to be more secure. I understand the game is in alpha but it seems like there is no protective wall in place for hackers.,Rust

Prepare to be on your toes at all times not just the typical first night of minecraft here where you're scared once and then that's it. This is a extremely harsh world only meant for those willing to give up their weakness and be one with the caveman.

2014-03-25,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,Do not play this until at least late Beta. The idea and gameplay are a lot of fun. but until they fix guns and C4 this game will be a constant frustration. you will build up your supplies make a base find lots of cool stuff and be unstopable....as long as you're online that is...... it's very saddening and frustrating to come home after work and go online to find the house and supplies you've built up over that last week has been taken by someone in 10 minutes while you were gone. even with metal walls and multiple layers of spike walls they can still break in. i like this game but until they fix these PvP issues i will not play anymore.

AS SOOON as i got home from work i got on and played till i passed out.But this has gone too far. Rust went from happy fun times with your youtube buddies and IRL bros to 11 mexican kids screaching so loud you want to die and saying every known to man curse word ever.The devs have stopped listening to us and only listen to the (remember these kids) 11 MEXICAN 10 YR OLDS that have 700+ hrs due to there dads eating guacamole and damned doritos all day whilst playing this game.MANY times have i tried to contact the devs for answers and for a LITTLE bit of closure about why the game is SUCKING so badly or if things will be fixed....BUT NO GarryNewman and his Facepuch crew had the BALLS to go and tell the whole community that *You have no choice in the outcome of the game you NEVER have* The second you start this game your in a living hell due to these kids that only play the game because they found the uncensor button in consule commands. then it is just hell because you have clans of 40+ people who own half the map...I have been the leader of one of these factions and had around 100+ people in my clan it was soo easy to take over the map we built a wall around the main snow mtn of the island and through half the map so i owned the serverIF U ENJOY ANY OF THE THINGS IVE LISTED....still dont get the game cause it is crap right now and has been in alpha stage since release so....2+ yrs?Edit When you spawn on a populated server theres a 95% chance you will get spawned in someones spawn prison and on vinilla servers your screwed unless you somehow attack them with your fists (Wich you cant do) so you need to leave the server or get an admin to help you suicide.I continue to play this game once in a while but if my Experiences get better i will change my review and maby invest more money in the game.

2017-08-18,0,0,280,True,Recommended,Ever heard of Sisyphus? The greek king who was sentenced to Hades and as punishment must carry a rock up a hill only to have it fall to the bottom just as he gets to the top. That's Rust. In Rust you start with two rocks. A functional one and a metaphorical one. The functional one you use to gather resources with. The metaphorical one is all the progression that follows that first strike of a tree or mining node. Eventually you morph that rock into an AK 47 or an 8 story base or a 14 man clan or even a simple shack. But becasue we are in Hades nothing ever works out for anyone. The rock always falls. No matter what you do. No matter the height you push it to no matter how many walls separete the raiders from your loot the rock always falls. Even if you manage to survive and gain a kingdom of sorts you'll just get bored and move to another server. The rock always falls.It's simply a matter of asking yourself...I'm I having fun doing this? I'm I happy as the boulder falls to the blacken sloop?Thats it. This game is extremly frustrating and you will learn a new hate for yourself and your fellow human beings as you play it. But every myth has it's trials. I recommend this game because it teaches people the value of work and how easy that work can be exploited in PvP or by the devs (who appaerntly don't play this game becasue there're alot of OP mechanics). This game is only for the Sisyphian hero that lurks within some of us the kind of person who instead of cursing the geared up tards who just stole 20+ hours of your life. Simply brush it off and pick up the rock.Server Canada 2,Rust

2017-08-18,0,0,8,True,Recommended,"Let me start off by saying ""This game is very weird"". I don't mean that in a bad or good way. Rust is a game which doesn't exist in just one state of being. It can be the best game ever at times like when you meet one of the most powerful people on the server who gives you around 30 bear meat. But there are also times when you take slightly too long to load in and your organs are being harvested by a naked black man. The game itself is quite fun cool crafting systems fun weapons nice animals and wonderful locations. The community is where the game's flaws are unlike some games where the community only adds to the game the community IS Rust. The enjoyment you have with this game hinges on whether you meet a good or bad player. Though it is fun trying to talk down psychopaths from killing you. I enjoy talking to people especially stranger with I occasionally do in real life as well to the dismay of my friends. If you are a social person who wants the game for the social aspect go for it. If you are in it for a challenging survival experience get it. If you are expecting to not die over 300 times within the first couple hours you may want to reconsider. And most importantly if you are some sort of scum who enjoys being rude mean or like killing onsite please don't get this game we have enough. Now I would like to talk a minute about how the game runs the answer on my computer poorly. Though I do play it on a laptop though it is somewhat beefy it has a built in graphics card so meh. It will run fairly well on most pcs though. The game looks nice even at the lowest settings so I don't mind turning settings down. It does take awhile to load in however and I experience frequent crashes as does my friend with a nice desktop. All in all I really like this game and think it is definitely worth checking out if you are a certain type of person like one of the ones specified above.",Rust

2015-09-21,0,0,161,True,Not Recommended,Review Date 21 September 2015I want to like this game... I really do. I have played off and on since it first hit Steam back before the current re launch. I have sunk hour after hour learning to play as efficiently as possible. But there are still so many issues with this game that it has essentially become an exercise in futility. The idea behind the game is great but the execution has left far too much to be desired. Here are the items that I feel truly make this game either unplayable or a waste of your time and energy.Cheats I won't dignify them by calling them hacks since most people that are abusing the game are using premade kits that don't require any computer skill further than downloading and installing (Don't believe me? Just check YouTube). There has been a consistent issue with cheats since the very first iteration of the game and the same ones can still be seen in game years later. Aimbots continue to be popular along with speed hacks vision hacks flying (which is not exactly flying but weird air jumping) and anything else that can give an advantage to someone who evidently feels that they are simply inadequate or just want to grief other players who follow the rules. Dozens of hours of personal time invested in a game can vanish in 3 minutes to one individual using a cheat and there is nothing to offset the loss.End Game There is none. The initial goals are to establish basic supplies build a base and then work on gathering additinal resources and blueprints. But there really is no point to it. You eventually get to a point (barring cheaters) that you have built up a sufficiently strong base that can ward off anyone who doesn't have 100 C4 charges. There is nothing else to do therefore you wind up with bored individuals with automatic weapons and armor who have nothing to do but harass new naked players who are only armed with a rock. Sometimes these individuals are solo but you will often find a group of 2 or 3 (occasionally with 1 running a cheat) who simply roam the entire map griefing anyone that they find.Rascim and Gay Bashing With the introduction of signs in the game you will now see a wide variety of hate messages posted throughout the world. I have encountered just about every variation including anti semitic messages and the typical poorly spelled rascist insults. I don't know why I wouldn't expect this in any game these days but the point is that I have never seen any attempts by an admin to lock down on this type of behavior (even on servers that state that they do). The use of local voice communications is typically used for anything other than simple chat. 95% of all speech I have heard is beyond hateful and some would result in criminal charges if taken to law enforcement. Once again I have rarely seen any admin take steps to offset this.Ultimately the community in this game is leaning more and more towards the toxic extreme. People playing the game quickly learn to be distrustful of anyone that approaches them. Preemptive retaliation becomes the norm and this is the worst part of the game. It will teach you to be distrustful of everyone around you.,Rust

2015-09-03,0,0,298,True,Not Recommended,So I recently wrote a review about this game and it being a good game. I stand corrected. The old rust was WAY better than the new rust all you guys had to do was work on the old rust and update it so there werent as many hackers. That's it. Or at LEAST keep it in. now i have about 100+ hours on the NEW rust and at first it was cool but the most recent update just blew it. Guns now have a recoil that is REDICULOUSLY too much and you can't even build a base without it being blown up the next day. Please... for the love of god... just bring the old rust back.

2017-05-06,0,0,752,True,Recommended,Awesome game devs listen to user feedback and come out with heaps of updates and bug fixes regularly so no complaints there. Love the open world gameplay and crafting. Player base is pretty toxic though sometimes you'll come across a a good guy (or if you're really lucky a nice clan) but it's rare so don't go into it thinking other players have a sense of fair play cos they don't and will end you. The only salvation is to git gud and pre emptively strike. Harder to do solo so bring some mates. 10/10 brutal no mercy gameplay would not change a thing.,Rust

2015-08-11,0,0,400,True,Not Recommended,The game is good everything is balanced. However the only thing that is unfair is something out of the control of the devs. The best part about rust is teaming up with friends and even strangers to achieve a greater goal. However this causes people to try to join the biggest clan and the game devolves into one clan running around raiding everyone else. I played this game with one friend and while the experience was fun I was dissapointed when I realized that we were basically sitting ducks waiting to be raided/shot,Rust

2015-08-16,0,0,14,True,Recommended,This game is really fun if you can find a server with a lot of people and not a lot of dumb buildings every where you look that are empty.The first thing that happened to me while playing this game was I found a new friend then we found a house that we thought was empty went inside saw a create with some loot then heard the hallway doors closing turned around to see that we were both trapped in a room with just our rocks and a few other rocks and torches we looted from the box so we both hid in a corner across from each other. Then the only door in the room opened and a man with an axe killed us both.....My second attempt at playing a found a house that said free stuff so I followed the sign and ended up in a whole with one way out problem was it was locked with a key code and bear traps all over the ground in front of it &gt .&gt in the end I couldn't lock the door and died from bear traps.,Rust

2015-08-16,0,0,78,True,Recommended,A survival game with integrity the developers will tell you straight up it is a work in progress but do not be dismayed. Rust is a game that has had time put into it and is worth adventuring in. The voice chat ingame is excellent if you get to a server where everyone does not kill on sight you have probably found Heaven.There are a few main ways I can think of to play. Roleplaying servers Servers with rules (no griefing raiding limitations etc.) No rules Survival battlegroundsThe one thing I'd warn is that there are hackers that can ruin all of your hard work. As long as your server has active admins however this shouldn't be a problem. Have fun!,Rust

2015-08-17,0,0,376,True,Recommended,Ok time for me to write a review with my well spent time in this game...First off here are the pros and consPros Really beautiful graphics (In my opinion at least.) Has a REALLY good building mechanism and you can make almost whatever you want to. The graphics adjusting system is REALLY nice. Perfect speed of gameplay. (AKA nothing takes too long to do.) Honestly it's not that expensive And a lot LOT more.Cons The animals will SOMETIMES not follow logic and can faze through rocks or climb straight up one when it's not possible... Honestly what would you expect... There's a LOT of bandits so it's pretty much KOS if you're on a big server.Nothing else i can really think ofOVERALL I'll just say this game has improved a great amount ever since i played it about a year or so ago at first when the whole system changed i kind of gave up on it because my computer couldnt really handle it but now i got a WAY better computer and i love the way it runs so the game is way more playable and like i said with the graphics adjustment i can get like 30 fps with my r7 240 even with some pretty high settings and the game will still look amazing (If only i got my r9 280x... Then i would bump things up...) this game can be insanely fun if you get other friends to play with you and since the game doesn't cost too much you can get most of your friends to play this (unless they make excuses that they don't have money even though they got gaming pc's or some other excuse...). So overall i'm just going to say you would incredibly love this game and you would probably spend hours on this game like i probably will watch out for the bandits and get your friends and make your own rules... GET THIS GAME IT'S AMAZING!I'D RATE 10/10 IGN,Rust

2017-08-10,0,0,1689,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Rust you can start the game off really good or you could spent a 100H just sying. i came out lucky and went on a low pop server to get used to things but now i'm semi decnt and more playing towards the pvp side of things the developers need to be able to make up their minds on say recoil. see guns would be good if you could see the differnce between a good player and a newbi but nothing like learnable recoil becuase that's a load of s**t. overall i would give this game a 8/10 because it is the only game i know of that updates weekly so keep it up guys!,Rust

2016-09-16,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,"Simply cannot recommend or play this game based entirely on the ""community"". The game itself has the possiblity of being fun but quite frankly the fact that it is multiplayer totally ruins it. Everyone who plays the game is a jerk and I have never seen a gaming community this bad and I thought Combat Arms players were bad...You begin with nothing but a rock and a torch. You can gather resources and craft items and weapons... except you can't because everyone you encounter WILL kill you at which point you spawn with nothing again in a comletely random spot (so good luck finding anything again). The rock and torch themselves are worthless but someone will still kill you and take them.As you progress (if you progress) you can build a base in a sorry attempt to survive and keep your stuff. As soon as you log out however someone will C4 a hole in a wall kill you and take whatever measly loot you might have accumulated. Logging in again will kindly inform you that someone has murdered you while you were away. In fact it is probable that the only way to actually play this game and get anywhere is to simply never log out and never step away from your computer. If you do either someone will murder you and you will have to begin again.You might think to yourself ""Oh maybe I'll find people who won't chase me down and kill me"" but this is simply hopeless optimism. Any server you enter you will find that not only does EVERYONE kill you if you are naked EVERYONE will encourage you to kill people who are. It would be easy to wander around pretending to have nothing then suddenly pull out an assault rifle and start murdering people. So yes everyone will kill you regardless.So there it is. I feel that I gave the game a good go until I realized that I didn't want to play a game in which I hate everyone and everyone hates me. That simply is not fun or rewarding under any circumstance. The game could be playable as a single player game but that too wouldn't actually be all that much fun.",Rust

2014-10-12,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,Hi Rust has the potential to be a great survival crafting game but competition for resources is too tight and game is extremely glitchy. My nine year old son earned some money and all he wanted was Rust. He has given up even trying to play. I believe this game needs alot more work to be worthwhile to play. More animals spawned and more breakable rocks for a little easier resource collection. Our number one glitch is logging on to a server and we can't wake up. My older son and I have spent a significant amount of time trying to play and successfully wake up on a server about 25% 30% of the time. I would recommend the game if it wasn't so glitchy and perhaps there was a single player option.,Rust

2016-05-02,0,0,543,True,Recommended,Summery Has a steep initial learning curve gameplay experience varies by the attitude of other players on each given server.Longer Naked and alone with a rock for company you must find a source of food in the next 20 mins or die. A naked man accosts you with his rock he ignores your pitiful attempt to claim that you are friendly the wild light of hunger burns in his eyes. After a vicious struggle you brain him with your rock. Deciding that low on health you have no choice but to resort to cannibalism you butcher his corpse (with the rock) and seek out wood to make a camp fire to cook a lovely bit of leg on.Later and replete from your breakfast you explore a dilapidated power station. A crazed naked lady chases you with an axe luckily a quick spear throw to the head saves you from becoming a snack. You have lunch and gaze lovingly at your new axe.Later still you have a house with good views over rolling fields its all going rather.... BEAR!THERES A BEAR! ARGHARGH ARGHHHHH!Respawn at your sleeping bag (deployable spawn point) HOW THE HELL DID THE BEAR GET INTO MY HOUSE?!OH GAWD ARGHARGHHHHH.....Later after having rebuilt your supply of tools and kit you head out for a swift bit of hunting a naked man throws a spear through your head and butchers your corpse while singing over voice chat.A Lady wearing a wolf head shoots you at close range with a shotgun.Wolves eat you.You starve to death.You awake trapped in a spike pit.Sever (dependant on sever) Chat is often a litany of banal and repetative racism and homophobia (As with many other multiplayer games). And so on.You will die a lot this is fun. Challenge FUN. Make friends it helps a lot.,Rust

2017-05-27,0,0,217,True,Recommended,Rust is the one game I keep coming back to Server Wipe after Server Wipe.It's ruthless tough and frustrating at times but this all adds to the real survival the game forces you to attempt. It's a genuine start from nothing to owning a full arsenal of weaponary and attempting to raid other bases.Whether playing solo or with others it's exilariting surprising and occasionally even frightening. Don't be put off from having bad starts when you first play there's a huge learning curve of priorities but huge fun to be had. Would whole hearteldy reccomend to all.,Rust

2017-05-27,0,0,906,True,Not Recommended,I've personally played rust on 2 accounts. my OG account that had 1500hrs in legacy an this one with barely a 1000 in the past 2 years. i loved this game every update but when you think of how a dev can ruin a game well look no futher. countless petitions to revert back to 2 updates ago but before i go any futher let me explain. the devs thought it would be a good idea to ruin one of pvp's key mechanics TC blockage. for new people to this game it made where only people authorized on the TC could build in its area. now the lowest tier of base walls an foundations can be placed even inside that circle even tho they arent authorized nullifying all base defenses.. i watched the player base drop almost 47% lie if you want devs but the proof is there. you ruined a game that many have played for 4 years faithfully an its still EARLY RELEASE! so kudos to you for losing almost half of your player base in less than 2 weeks. 0/10 highly not recomended unless the devs pull head from a** an revert the update.,Rust

2015-08-10,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,I really like this game and I think it's a fantastic survival game however the Mac client doesn't run smoothly similar to that of a badly winewrapped game (and I'm on a fairly beefy Mac). Tbh I really miss the old legacy version but in any version at all if you try to join any server you'll immediately be killed so it's almost impossible to progress if you roll solo. Even then it's very hard to do anything because when you log out you fall asleep which allows you to be killed and looted even on a non pvp server. Also with every new update the servers are wiped and you have to start all over again. IF Facepunch would just give this game single player or a legitimate way to solely play with friends then I'd say that this is probably the best survival game on Steam but untl then not recommended.Please add singleplayer!

So anyway I was biking (IRL) and a pebble slid under my tire and make a sound alot like a silenced M4 shot. I blacked out/flashbacked I remember me standing outside of small rad with my friend in the night then him getting shot right infront of me. I woke up like 5 seconds l8r and realised I had almost when off the road. So if you want to play Rust Legacy seriously then get ready for stress that follows you into real life. Includes constantly shaky hands when in stressed moments.,Rust

But eventually I started learning how to survive off the land and make shelter for my friends and I. Slowly I began to love this game and began making bigger communities within my servers. All of them known as ""Settler's Valley"". Settler's Valley became a place of friendship and commerce with (on each server) about 15 people in the small towns that my friends and I formed. When I die in Rust (unlike DayZ) it is easy to recover and fun consistently. Yes there are bandits but a fair amount are willing to talk with you before killing you and taking your goods. I highly recommend Rust even with all of its bugs and glitches.UPDATEAfter the games overhaul I find that Rust has become both more satisfying and more annoying at the same time. The building deterioration is insanely annoying and the amount of materials required to upgrade walls and such makes it near impossible to upgrade your whole house before it collapses.",Rust

2016-06-09,0,0,1647,True,Recommended,Great game lots of fun it's really cool to see how you can go from having just a rock to have a massive base and weapons of mass destruction. I have played the game many ways you can play solo massive clan small group or as a town. All are fun ways but sometimes playing one style forever get boring so I like to mix it up. One thing is the best way to learn in this game is by making mistakes it happens a lot like when base building over time you will get better after you get raided a few times you will be able to see weak spots and improve on them. It is still in alpha so there are a few bugs but they aren't major and they are still adding things to the game every week,Rust

2014-03-03,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,I Gotta say that i like rust when i first bought it but now it's just a vicious cycle of the normal gameplay. First you get some wood and any kind of recources you find then you go to an area close to the abandon building making it easier to loot them (if you play like i do) then you get food a furnance a sleeping bag and all you need to put in your cute litte wooden shelter and then you go offline... thats when the no lifed 24 7 players raids you while in your sleep and you get online and probably spawn far away from where your house was after the raider killed you in your sleep. You're most likely worried or confused so you run aaall the way back to your house that seems to look unfamiliar... the door is missing and all your stuff is gone. Wellcome to rust only those with freinds playing all the time and those playing much themselves might enjoy this game but for me i give it a 4/10.,Rust

2014-09-03,0,0,87,True,Recommended,started out this game by myself harvesting in the shadows ususally at 1am in the morning so no one could see me. after a while i made a big base near a rad town and collected many usefull items. at this point i was obsessed with making sure that none of my stuff went missing so i would log in every hour or so just to make sure everything was good. So as time went on i died a couple of times and had some conflict with this big group so i decided to recuit people. they built thier base next to mine but when they would log off i would break into thier homes and replace their doors with mine so they could not hide anyting from me. then eventually i began trapping people in thier bases just for fun and at one point i started building a base around someones base and supplied them with food giving them hope. yup this game made me into the killer i am today 10/10 i would recommend this game,Rust

I would say that it is exstremly hard to get started on officail servers and would highly reccomend playing on a moded server. i have alot of time playing both and have played since pre alpha. i also reccomend watching a few videos first that way you know what you are doing when you start and so you wont get rekt. its not impossible to play solo however it is fairly difficult i would play on a server with clans so they can help you with raids. all in all this game is amazing and definatly worth the buy. 5/5,Rust

2015-06-06,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Rust is an amazing sandbox/survival game. Part of the fun of it is running around gathering resources and building an awesome base but i believe that the best part of the game is the interactions you have with the other players be it good or bad. I love the feeling of having mates around or even the opposite feeling of constant fear of the other players. here is one of my experiences So i spawned fresh on the beach met two other guys we decided to team up one of the guys became our leader. He said he would be dictator and his only rule was dont be mean to others so if we killed any random who didnt harm us first he would kill us because thats being mean. So then it came to night we made a campfire cooked up some human arms and ate them in peace a 4th guy joined our group then one of the original guys turned on us so we killed him cooked up his arms. The leader said that even though he tried to kill us it was a sad day that we had lost one of our members. Then the other guy pulls out a guitar and starts to play a sad song so it was really peaceful and we were eating human arms listening to music and then some guy runs out of the bushes and kills us all with bow and arrow. 10/10 would friend again,Rust

You are not OP at the beginning but playing much will make you very strong and help you to rebuild faster if you die. I recommend playing with some friends against other people.I hope they will make many updates as fast as they can and bring more loot and more stuff to craft in the game!And very important is to make the map bigger.,Rust

2017-02-05,0,0,108,True,Recommended,Quite a fun game. Haven't experienced any pvp situations yet always end up killed in my sleep. Bases raided often even on low pop servers. Love the mods ),Rust
2017-02-06,0,0,2,True,Recommended,I like this game it was definitely challenging to understand by myself but once a bunch of my friends and I played together it became second nature.The games spawning system and no map(initially) makes it hard for you and your friends to locate one another. It definitely takes time. If you like world building/crafting and surviving onslauts of more seasoned gamers this game is for you. At time the graphics get sluggish when the sunlight/time changes. But remember it is in an Alpha state. Hoping for faster 'Use button' response or functionality. Not sure the size of the team working on this game but the characters models should be a little cleaner if possible and for some of use who care about gender and race that would be cool too.Because everyone starts off naked with it slightly weird and yet comical to me. Make sure you play with your friend or make friends because your build will get destroyed or character will get killed off,Rust

2018-01-17,0,0,418,True,Recommended,"Pros Game overall is great weekly updates developers are really involved. PvP is great starting off with a rock and torch and find a way to survive. Crafting is awesome and the building your base isn't a grind. sometimes filling up your TC can be a grind tho to prevent decaying of your base. I've really only played solo so yes it's possible to play this game solo and have fun just have to be sneakier and smarter about situations. Graphics awesome running SLI 660 ti's ""old cards"" and still easily manages 60 fps. Goes on sale quite a bit and at $9.99 you can't beat it. Cons The community in game is toxic never seen such toxic players (kids) in a game. It's really a kill or get killed and very rarely will you find someone helpful. Clans are taking over most servers which make it more difficult to do solo still possible just more of a pain have to hide away somewhere away from the main areas which makes scrap grinding more of a pain. Most Facepunch official servers seem to get DDOS quite a bit by players who have gotten banned which is unfortante but there are good servers out there Rustafied Rusty Moose etc.. oh and age range seems like 12 16 so hopefully u don't mind squeakers yelling dumb sh*t at you when they kill ya",Rust

2015-02-04,0,0,2776,True,Recommended,Oh Rust how you have changed.You know how certain things are special unique to their own? Nobody sounds like Marilyn Manson nothing tastes like coffee nothing smells like pesto nothing feels like burning yourself and nothing looks like somebody getting kicked in the balls except for what it is.Now there's rust there is no other experience that will make you hate both yourself and everybody around you quite like Rust.Enjoy wasting thousands of hours for no apparent outcome? Enjoy really getting into the niddy griddy of human nature and mankind as a whole? Do you enjoy lying to people for personal gain or the possibility of befriending somebody in need just so that they can murder you and take everything you have?Well Rust is the game for you if you said yes to some or all of the above.Now on a personal note I've found a lot out about myself in Rust ...both sarcastically and legitimately. I am not a solo player at least in this game called Rust. I do much better in groups.Note if you don't like fighting groups or being part of them do not venture into this magical game.I am however great at uniting forces and making it even more difficult for other people to want to play. There was once 3 super powers on a server I won't name .. clans who ruled them all. I had made friends with people from within all 3 clans and helped create a merger that lasted a few wipes.It was chaos sweet beautiful chaos. Bases were created that were impregnable and rockets were made in abundance that were instead used as bullets.BittersweetI have also played with many other races/ ethnicity and on a genuine note I am really appreciative to the creators of Rust for this. I have picked up a bit of basic Korean due to time spent with zergs speaking of zergs the Chinese I've played with are hilarious and fun to play with. Russians yes they are just like in the movies crazy.. But also some of the most loyal to play with. Portuguese these guys have huge hearts and instantly befriend anybody nice to them great guys. Phillipinos are fairly timid until enraged then fly off the handle like you would imagine a shark with legs on land... Canadians are as nice as you think but have some weird subconscious military tendencies that both impress and alarm you why you never saw it. I'm sure I could go on but I'll leave you to find out more.All in all I have quit Rust only to find myself coming back to it after updates and patches etc. The people in Rust make it as much as it is as the gameplay within.Sure people suck but if you can give a few a chance and venture into language barriers and aggression Rust is more than just a game it can be quite an experience.,Rust

I would invite friends and create huge bases and go on raiding missions. On one map my team even beat the admins. it was literally incredible. Then you decided to muck it all up and re write the game ..... Nows its rubbish and easy as anything.In old Rust (as i like to call it) i would struggle for days in a shack trying to remain hidden and gather enough resources for a 'proper' base. On the new version within 2 hours me and my friends had a mountainside condo village complete with adjoining bridge and platforms. New Rust has ruined Rust. New Rust is rubbish.

Then he will t bag me and call me a noob before he shoots me in the head!If you want to buy the game to play with your mates in a group buy the game. You will have fun and you will have a decent chance of not being ed up the by a clan as soon as you put a base down depending on the server. If you want to buy the game to play solo don't just don't.

Community is existent but only if you know the people you're playing with ahead of time. Otherwise it's pretty fun. I only wish I could change my avatar.,Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,82,True,Not Recommended,After buying I have found out that you cant change skincolour so you are forced to play as some random poc. Dont force this tumbler stuff on a game. Havent played further I hope steam refund this social justice game.,Rust
2017-12-18,0,0,93,True,Recommended,If you dont care about losing everything you worked for and having to restart on a constant basis this is the game for you. Solo is hard but also adds a lot more fun to the game because you have to be a lot more tactful. Having a friend at your side helps during those pesky raids and pvp moments.I definetly recomend playing on a very low pop server when first starting to get the hang of the game mechanics first.,Rust
2017-12-06,0,0,311,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun game but the community is horrible. If you want to have fun play on a solo server. That is where there are less hackers and it is more fair (as you won't get a 20 man korean zerg making it impossible to build). Only buy if you have an extremely good computer. I had to upgrade mine to play it and since then the game has only gotten more demanding.,Rust

2017-07-26,0,0,3484,True,Recommended,Its competitive grindy can be PVE*** (almost never) very rewarding to see a base you built or win a good fight and get gear or raid a base and hoard mats kill many animals have endless good/bad/funny encounters and last but not least you will die. You will get raided. You will want to punch the neighbors cat and burn the Beanie Babies from said traumatic events. But such is life in rust. It's the epitome of a dog eat dog world and yah there's troll and hackers and 8 year olds swearing at you and drawing swasticka stickers everywhere but really what game doesn't have these things. Grab some friends and some adult beverages and start mining the nodes to build your empire! 10/10,Rust

2018-01-01,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,There's literally no reason to play this game. The community is Toxic there's literally no one who can be trusted. The combat is trash. The game is poorly unoptimized even for EA there's no excuse with how long this game has been in development. Some servers won't allow you to join until 3 hours in so you cannot refund. To put in short if you're in a server that hasn't had a recent reset you're petty much just a farming NPC to be robbed for someone who's already well adjusted and spends too much time playing this game. Even if you do get to a point of building a base have fun trying to keep it healthy with the rediculous amount of resources you will need. All in all there's better survival games out there without everyone having the same kill on sight thought.,Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,379,True,Not Recommended,Over two years later since my first review this game looks great but the community has totally ruined the game sadly... will never play this trash again.Most toxic community i have ever encountered in my life of gaming.,Rust
2016-12-26,0,0,565,True,Recommended,I feel like too many people give this game a bad rap for it's community. Don't get me wrong the community is pretty trash but not recommending a game based on that alone feels a bit unfair. My strong suggestion is that Facepunch adds a singleplayer option as many dislike the mpPvP aspect of it especially beginners. This game is total hell for about 30h after purchase while you learn the basics of the PvP system base building trustworthiness etc. After those 30h it becomes a hell of a lot more fun. There's ups downs adrenaline kicks pretty much everything that makes a game fun. Another suggestion is that you only buy this game if you have friends that would play it with you as playing solo ruins the fun of it especially on multiplayer servers. It also makes it easier to build a base and gather materials.If you get this game you will be sad when your base gets raided you'll be sad when you get destroyed by a guy with 1000 hours with an AK 47 but you will also be happy when you raid your first base are getting raided and fend off the attackers. This game as I said is an up down game and you will definitely feel like sometimes and like you're on top of the world at other times. And trust me although you may think it would suck having to start over again after spending 10 hours on a base it actually is a good thing because you usually start to get bored of your base within a few hours and just end up roaming around and PvP'ing. For people that like a grinding game that has a lot of fun ups and downs adrenaline kicks etc. This is for you.,Rust

2018-01-09,0,0,459,True,Recommended,A fantastic survival game. You start out naked with only a rock struggling to survive against nature as well as players while scavenging for food and supplies. Working your way up from scared naked man with a rock to an AK toting fiend with a massive base on a hill picking off anyone who dares to come near with your rifle.,Rust
2018-01-09,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,"You have to be a special sort of player to appreciate this game in its current state.It's buggy. Crafting and building is interesting but there's just not enough to craft or build.You'll get insta ganked by established players. Constantly.If you do build a protective base someone will destroy it and kill you by the time you've logged on again.The area is huge. I mean proper huge and well detailed. That's not enough to allow you to disappear into the wilderness on a high pop server however.Servers are frequently wiped in order to help prevent huge blocks of established players ruining it for everyone but that brings its own frustrations. Namely ""Oh I just built my base but now everything's gone again and the guy who logged on at 3am now has a shotgun. Shotgun beats rock.""PvE has no real challenge in the current build. There's not really much point in exploring beyond finding a few grinder/crafter locations and scrap metal. Animals leave you alone unless you get too close without spotting them. The zombies appear to be gone.It's a game which has good bones. It looks like it could be excellent but honestly at the moment I'd just play 7 Days To Die (which has a very similar feel) or ARK (which doesn't).",Rust

2014-11-18,0,0,79,True,Recommended,A great game especially for some Multiplayer gameplay. I recommend playing with someone on Skype as it will create a whole different view of the game. Instead of having to do everything yourself and keep fining extra armor and weapons you can finally have someone to give all the stuff to and get stuff from them. Playing on a random multiplayer server and expecting the same is risky and unpredictable. I love this game especially when I team up with some friends. It's actually fun to run through the wilderness looking for each other dodging wild animals and praying that a mutant doesn't agro on you. I give this game 4.5 stars only for the fact that there is some minor lag. Well done Rust!,Rust

Smack rock get stone. Build base be safe. Get raided rage quit for a week.Thats how it goes there arent really any other danger than other players and a military chopper that come by every now and then.The game gets montly updates with new content or just updates on bigger updates down the road.Like the tank and AI that came somewhat recently.All in all you could easily call this game finished yet we get updates all the time good updates.,Rust

2015-11-21,0,0,194,True,Recommended,So as a person who loved this game I have chosen to give a review why this is one of my favorite games The feeling you get when you have played and grinded for over 3 or 4 hours to start building a house and someone comes and kills you aint that great. But on the other hand when you are the one killing the feeling is GREAT. Imagine being killed and getting revenge! That is so nice. When you get some weapons and you start murdering people that just started. I LOVE IT. Its either be the butcher or the cattle. There is no honorable code. Everything is allowed. This is where the game can get tricky aswell. For example if there are way to many clans you have no way of doing anything then its just a endless grind to die basically. This aint a game where you play solo. You need to be able to make friends or you will get raided or die. 11/10 Gr8 b8 m8,Rust
