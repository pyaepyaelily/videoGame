2016-12-07,0,0,102,True,Not Recommended,This game is tormenting to play I stopped playing this game due to raging at the toxic kill on sight community. It is so painfully frustrating to spend hours of your time gathering recources build a small base then a advanced group or individual will come along kill you and continously kill and raid you untill you leave whilst taking everything you have so you have to start again. And that repeats over and over again its a continuous tormenting cycle of getting bullied. Its a breeding ground for bullies and psyhcopaths if we evolved with the mentatlity of the comminity in this game the world would be controlled by Negans (Walking Dead).(And for those people who say the game is survival of the fittest shooting unarmed naked people is cowardice and disturbing)Its not worth playing so I stopped. Im happy I got it for pennies on humble bundle.It got massive potential but until the devs work out a fairer system and make it satisfying to play then I wont be touching it.,Rust

2016-12-12,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,"Spend 3 hours trying to build your way up to a bow and arrow. Run into person with an RPG that wants your arrows I guess. Respawn. Spend 1 hour gathering enough stone to build a stone hatchet. Game lags and when the game becomes responsive again you are dead. Respawn. Play game for 5 hours and begin trying to create your first gun game crashes. Restore the game and it returns you to where you left off with all of your items restored to you... Only they made your body lootable this whole time. So you lose everything you spent time into getting because the game crashed and they kept you an active player.This ""Early Access"" release is now 3 years old. Wait for them to actually release something that is playable. As you can see from my time played it does have some potential. The potential is currently far from realized.",Rust
2014-07-25,0,0,1996,True,Recommended,Do you like farming/Grinding for supplies and then having a base actually pay off?Then this game is for you The constant pit in your stomach after you've just raided someone! Or when you get ambushed in the mountains and you manage to fight your attackers off it's the greatest feeling! But then the unthinkable happens You log off for the night only to get home from school or work the next day and find your base ransacked and your sleeper killed it adds an entire new concept to video games and the survival genre!Now would I recommend this game? YES!! Very much so The community on some servers are great! Say you just bought the game and just logged on for the very first time and you need some directions or some info if you just type in the chat what you need 9/10 times someone will help you build a base gather resources Or just give you a tour of the best farming places!Rate 8.5/10 Would be 10/10 but the hackers in this game are crazy Being a former hacker myself I know just how easy it is to download some hacks and start silent killing people from hundreds of metres away..,Rust
2015-02-03,0,0,527,True,Recommended,great game! really. I know this game is still on alpha but its great already. obviously it needs some adjustments since it is on alpha. anyway i like the new patch 45 but i really miss some things from the old patch like when you build something it shows you a bar like a timer for when the item will be ready. i think both this and the actual time (that you added this patch) should be togther. the other thing and this is important please bring back the research kits it is really weird to get 1 arrow/1 shotgun ammo from a chest if you cant research it... its basically just 1 shot... anyway love your new patch but it does need some changes is my opinion. great job.,Rust

2016-12-25,0,0,89,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I received Rust as a Gift from a friend and so far this is what I have to say It has been a Very Good Experience overall I have to admit I was very demotivated a bout the Early Access Tag (because I've bought a few Early Access games) but I ended up loving it instead.PROS Very engaging when you are in a server with enough people it keeps up the tension of surviving other players.Survival elements are there but they are not annoying I think they are balanced enough so that you have to keep them on check but it's not something that you have to grind about (talking about basic needs thirst hunger warmth) specially the warmth/cold system allows you to build or plan around it.Simple and Efficient crafting system it's complex enough so that it doesn't feel dumb but is not annoyingly overcumbered with a lot of different elements and tricks to get early and medium tier items.Very Nice enviroments the procedural maps are filled with vegetation and it gives a good feeling to run around in a forest (for ex) and it creates very good opportunities to hide ambush and move during combatCONSIt's still a bit buggy (although not that much as you could expect from an Early Access title)the AI of the wildlife is very very simple and they sometimes spawn inside your basethe ""biggest"" CON (Not So CON) is that you cannot play this game alone or at least is VERY difficult because the community around it is quite toxic to say the least. but that's also what makes the game exiting in a big way.Besides I think is unfair to jugde a game for the quality of it's users.100% recommended I keep looking forward for more updates",Rust
2016-12-25,0,0,116,True,Recommended,Had a lot of fun with this game despite the toxic community. Personally prefer the ability to build without ALWAYS being able to penetrate the base and steal my stuff. Be prepared to lose everything frequently.,Rust

2014-01-18,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Well as I have watched other people play this game I can say that it has great potential and a fantastic start so far. However that seems to be only on PC... If you are on Mac like I am though the game is just unplayable my specs are well able to handle the game but it lags awfully on Mac so if you are on Mac and wanting to buy this game I would have to say dont waste your time but the developers have said that they are working on fixing it... So you could buy it now while it is probably at a discounted price before the game is officially released and just wait until they fix everything to play it. But if your playing on a PC then i would highly recommend this game and suggest you buy it now.,Rust
2014-01-19,0,0,185,True,Recommended,This game just like 'Garrys Mod' has much re playability. Guys don't take this game at what you see in the pictures it looks plain bland and not much to it. This game has a LOT to it. An extensive crafting system which requires ingame item blueprint drops to unlock new items. This game has Zombies although there are plans to remove them. This game tops any other zombie survival series like DayZ Infestation Survivor Stories and 7 Days to Die. I am really looking forward to where rust is going the game has great potential. For an Alpha it already has such a solid feel to it. Get some of your mates hop into a server and spend many hours with them gathering pvping raiding crafting and building. This game is endlessly fun.,Rust

2015-01-09,0,0,14,True,Recommended,"It all began when I woke up on a beach. I feel lost and confused. I seem to have forgotten absolutely everything I've known even how my head is shaved... I look around and see nothing but trees some boulders and in the distance I see a couple of rusting abandoned shacks that lay on top of a hillside that I can assume were made by other lost people like me. I wonder around for a little and see a sturdy rock and I examine it it seems good enough to be tool. A weapon. A friend. As I pick up this rock I feel the urge pick up. The urge to survive. To see what lies out in this mystery of an island...Later in the day I have utilized this rock by hitting a tree as well as some other rocks and collected valuable resources. My crafty mind begins creating things that eventually become real in my hands like a wooden spear with a sharp stone tip a stone hatchet and a handy torch. I wonder the island more climbing passed what I like to believe were homes across a hill like many of the other hills and I gaze downwards at the beatif ... I'm not alone. Somebody else is running towards the houses near from where I came from. They hold a rock as well. My first instinct is to hide and watch. But as they approach I feel that they are hostile... I run.After traveling farther from where I encountered that person with a panic filled mind I hear a very loud rumbling sound far in the sky. I look up and expect to see something come from behind the hill at any time now. What is it? A plane?! Where did this come from in this desserted island? It is flying very close to me. I wave I jump I scream I yell for help! I don't know who they are but I feel a bit of civilized comfort. I feel a good feeling one that says ""I'm not alone. We're not alone..."" But wait it keeps flying it doesn't see me swinging my torch in the air. After it passes I see a large object drop from it. What could it be? Who are these people? After adventuring to where what seems to be a cargo has landed in an open field with nobody else around I make my way towards it and begin looking for what could be inside. Suddenly I hear footsteps running on the other side an animal perhaps? Or a threat.. Two others from both sides armed with spears see each other through me. I back away just as they do. One says ""shoo"" and the other says ""lol."" Are they speaking my language? Or are they from a different origin I wonder... Soon after the one that said shoo immediately charges me with their spear and cuts my arm. About after terrifying minutes of circling one another and hopelessely flailing our spears I manage to kill both of them. I loot what I can and head out in a hurry before it gets dark.Later in the night I hide between some average sized boulders and try to clear my mind from the fear growing inside me. I somehow manage my way to craft two large furnaces and begin smelting some metal ore I have gathered from the enemies I killed. I experiment and craft gunpowder from other resources and make bullets. I make tools like a pickaxe. Simple easy things that everyone like me can make naturally. I even manage to craft a homemade pistol. Suddenly I see a bright torch ignite from around the corner and I bolt up with my spear in my hands. It is someone that has nothing. Nothing but a rock. We look at each other as I lower down my spear. It now comes to me he has no clothes to stay warm in through the night. He is naked. I look down and see that I too am naked. Everyone is naked. And bald. I ask if they would like to stay with me for the night. To work as a team of course. This could be the person I first saw near the shore. After some agreement and an awkward moment being my first friendly encounterment they take watch with their torch as I craft us supplies and weapons to hold us off. I show off my homemade firearm and ask if they would like one too. He says he has some metal of his own to place inside the burning furnace so I let him. After he turns around I notice a figure sneaking up behind him in the dark. What seems to be yet another naked man holding a rock. Does he possibly want to join our team and bec nope he kills my friend and I miss 10 shots and he kills me too and steals everything while chanting inaudible things. As we lie there bleeding we stare into each others eyes... Death is close... he says ""uh wut happened?"" and with my last breath I say ""we died. it was nice knowing you naked friend"" ... He responds soon afterwards with ""well I'm getting off."" We close our eyes and rest in peace. lIk if u cried everytim. r7 8/8 m8.",Rust

2014-01-06,0,0,225,True,Not Recommended,"*Before you read any further keep in mind that I've had almost 100 hours on the game when I made this post. Aka I'm not someone who played for a couple hours then ragequit.* This game has potential but there is little reason to buy or play it in its current state. Hackers are everywhere and hacking the game is EXTREMELY easy. Most hacks just involve editing or moving very easy to find game files. 99% of the people who play this have a killstreak mentality. Meaning all they care about is nonstop killing and nothing else. So no matter what you will die very often until you finally find a very isolated place to make a base. Also it doesn't matter what you have on you people will kill you anyways. I tried running around with absolutely nothing as an experiment and I was killed at least 12 times in a half an hour. People were killing me just to kill me. This game is made to be WAY more than a Call of Duty clone but its turning into one. Since most of the players just have one goal ""KILL ALL PLAYERS"". Admin abuse is all over the place. You will see many many many admins who give themselves items spawn themselves airdrops nonstop run around in godmode and kill everyone blowing up bases with unlimited c4 supplies kicking/banning anyone who complains about their abuse etc. I would highly recommend that people wait quite some time to buy this game. It is no where near complete enough to be worth money. Keep in mind this is an alpha. However if you're wanting to buy it for entertainment and a stable gaming experience just wait.",Rust

2015-08-14,1,1,346,True,Recommended,I played the game a long time ago right after they took the zombies out. The game was really cool back then and i started playing it again it is an awesome game although i was pretty sad that they took out the weapon modifications because i remember the flashlight that i had on one of my weapons which was cool. But I would definitly reccommend this game just have to get your material's early make a base and place down your bed and set your spawn there. It is really hard to get started because a lot of people like to kill the weak one for fun but once you get started you can go on from there find a town and get your things that you need to survive. It's an awesome game i can't wait to see what the developer come out with next. PS please bring back weapon modifications. ) thank you,Rust

2016-12-09,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,"I love this game. It is a great game. The visuals are great it has great sound clips. The building is fun hunting for survival items is great chasing after drop planes is a great way to view the map. Just all around solid!Some of you might be asking ""But Southern Bella if you like the game so much why are you giving it a negative review?"" The answer to that is simple my friends.The community. Now don't get me wrong. There are some great players I've met. But the number of great players who will help out and form alliances or who just follow simple rules are few compared to the number of people who get on just for the joy of utterly destroying everything on one server then hopping on the next server and repeating.I don't get a lot of time to play games and my playtime is limited to Friday nights and Saturdays and sometimes that is even iffy. So when I spend all of a Friday night building up my house and supplies only to log in the next day to find all my stuff and things ruined by some a hole mere minutes after I log off. It's annoying. Especially when I know the progress I make on Saturdays will be ruined by the time I get on the next Friday. It is not fun for me. I would love for there to be a single player option right from the menu instead of me having to work the LAN files to create my own private server...or having to rent one.",Rust

And the models. god damn. when you look at another persons gun model its all the same. instead of putting in these pointless updates Hire yourselfs a couple of people with the millions you got and fix the glitches models and everything else you havent fixed since the game was released. considering how much money you got from selling the game and the large community that has grown over the past year.

I can see how some raiders are frustrated that when they raid somebody's supplies they get xp for it...who cares?

I haven't encountered any bugs so far maybe besides animals being able to walk trough walls and teleport up the rocks.

2016-08-30,0,0,128,True,Recommended,"Rust a reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture which is appropriate since it's what people will kill you for. In Rust you have very little options in life. You can't decide your character it's based off a random character generator that is automatically locked with your Steam profile which has lead my to become a wanna be Samuel L. Jackson. Not that I take issue with that seeing as he's still in better shape than I am.As a long time owner of Rust I have experienced the old version of the game just long enough to be called an OG and have seen the new changes that we now have and earned the privilige of me being a settler. And settle I did! Over and over again. I came across a someone who shot me with his entire armory. After pacifying the gentleman and explaining that I'm just passing by I realize how in danger I am. It's pitch black outdoors wolves howling in the night and worst of all bears. The incarnation of Death itself. Capable of passing rocks and walls like me in Fallout with cheats on. Which lead me straight back to that gentleman as I serenaded him with a guitar I found off another dead body who died by natural causes...I think. After I went into his home I actualy became good friends with him. And through living in the house I made more friends. But ah it's online! There's no such thing as peace and prosperity online! I learned the hard way that not everybody oops most people are not interested in talk only having waving people stand at gun's distance as they give you a 30 presents from their loving gift launchers. Of coarse death is to be expected but playing on all servers make me realize people are either you have a gun or you don't and if you have a gun you're free to act like Saddam Hussein to his Iranian neighbors. It might be just because I'm upset because I got lit the up twenty times over. But I feel that even on a brand new map where all are equal one somehow finds a machine gun and begins his reign as dictator.But this review can't be all anger coming off from idiots that don't affect gameplay. Firstly there's the basic survival menu. You have your life bar your food bar and your water bar. If any depletem you die or begin to die. However I found a way to stave off death with the use of cloth and furiously wrapping it around my arms. This way I managed to become immortal to the needs of my body. To the elements however I am VERY mortal. After learning how to play I came to the eventual conclusion that once you have a decent gun you don't need anything else. Self sufficient farm? Fah! Houses? Fah! Having a sniper rifle (affectionately called ""bolties"" by the players) mean that nothing is beyond your reach and you can kill your way to a better quality of life. Swords are useless and armor becomes useless once you get better bullets. But once the player discovers the ing tower of Sauron they would need to find ""friends"" who you can barely stand to tear this thing to bits and pieces and destroy someone's hopes and dreams of living peacefully.Overall the game was fun. Yes it was fun. Games like these rely on social interaction and without a couple negatives here and there I don't imagine I would ever have played this for more than 20 minutes.",Rust

I know its early access but there are serious issues with the officail servers and they havent been fixed in a long time. They are all overrun with hackers! There is no point to playing right now. You can invest 100's of hours and then ramdomly get all your stuff destroyed by a hacker who can see through two layers of metal walls and shoot your stuff with a shotgun. I'm all for raiding if you dont cheat ie. using c4 and what not but this just isnt fair or fun when half the people on the server are so clearly cheating. I dont know why there is a warning at the loading screen against cheaters because Valve doesnt do crap about them in Rust.,Rust

2014-09-03,0,0,226,True,Recommended,This is personally one of my favorite games ever created. It's a harcore no one gets it easy style game. People kill loot steal and you have to do anything it takes to survive. The envirorment is stunning yet completely unforgiving. Food and resources can be hard to find leaving you starving and bleeding to death in the dirt or the king of a great town with well crafted defenses. How you play it is your choice and your choices will give you a reputation with other players on the server ultimaltly deciding how people treat you in the open world.,Rust
2017-04-15,0,0,249,True,Not Recommended,It's in alpha state since Dec 2013 and I don't think they are planning to stabilize the game soon all your stuff will vanish whenever there s an update also it can disappear if it falls and passes through a rock this is the most glitched game I ve played animals can run through walls (I think they fixed it) and some other annoying glitches like installing an object that clips a little outside of your house to get used by whoever is outside. Game style disappoints me doesn t matter what you do you can t hide or make an impenetrable fortress sooner or later it will disappear by a clan of demolishers or by an update which means wipe therefore everything is gone almost in all the official servers is like this. I love constructions but here you are forced to make it freaky and crappy focused only to trap riders if you wanted to make a cool looking castle or a cozy hut forget it it will be an enjoyable target to be burned. I bought this only to play with friends but it really gets on my nerves it has some realistic aspects and some ridiculous aspects you can t build anywhere you want you are forced to build wherever someone sees your building even inside caves hey new neighbor here! so construction system is an illusion it will be gone next day. I recommend this game for players that will play in GROUPS power in numbers and then dedicate yourself to make explosives or collect junk it gets grindy so in conclusion the whole game is reduced to collect fast before you are destroyed so you can destroy others. In my case I enjoyed going man hunting but the main features for me are awful in my opinion if this game could allow forever lasting buildings I would be motivated to become a squirrel that collects and collects but it could be gone at any update. Everything else regardless of buildings is just another FPS with a huge map where you can loot whoever you killed or get killed and loose everything. I almost forgot! I know is a rated M game but the community is very very toxic lame insults racism and degenerated messages is what you will read/hear most times almost everyone hates everybody without provocation.

2017-02-22,0,0,1133,True,Recommended,So I've had this game Since about a week after it's release and played it on multiple accounts racking up 1000's of hours and I reckon it's high time I posted my indepth review so here goes Legacy Rust was a huge part of this games charm the combat system and overall feel of the game and although it's a distant memory way it will always hold a special place in the hearts of the veterans of Rust.Now for the curren't build you spawn naked alone on the beach confused and here your adventure begins it is what you make of it and nobody but you decides what you will do as you walk towards the mainland unless of course a hungry bear decides that you are going to be his next meal if you can't run fast enough.Rust is a unique game like no other there are many many other sandbox games each with their own unique charm that you can almost guarentee that Rust has had some kind of influence on clones and copies aside it really is a special game no wipe is the same one wipe you might build a huge base with all the loot in the world and be the kingpin of the server other wipes you might find yourself harveseting the dead and cooking it over your campfire to stay alive Rust's replay value is huge which is why I come back week after week.Pros Great with friends or solo (although solo can be more challenging) Very adaptable mechanics you can learn quite quickley but there are still little things that improve your gameplay Reasonably balanced PvP all things considered Base building and making land yours is incredibly fun Multiple ways of raiding other peoples hard earned loot at all ends of the resource scale Extremely unique player interactions (Some trash talk but mostly just funny remarks) Procedural map generation so no two wipes are the same PvE events like the airdrops and Helicopter battles Weekly updates from a VERY active and engaging developer who really use the early access title as it was intendedAll things considered Rust has a lot of positive attributes about it that make it a fun and interesting game to play many of which contribute to why people keep coming back week after week and enjoying the game.Cons Quite lengthy loading times on lower end machines Animal pathing is a bit wonky (This is being adressed in a coming update) Lack of Rad animals and other micro level PvE events (Rad animals being a great feature of Rust Legacy) Zerg clans can be a bit frustrating if you are a solo or small group (although this is not a reason to detract points from the game) Lower end systems may suffer lag spikes due to the large maps and player built structures New players might feel a bit overwhelmed as the game has no real tutorialAll games have their negitives and drawbacks and Rust isn't perfect by any stretch of the term but Rust really does justice to the term early access in my opinion if there is a game in EA that you could get behind Rust is that game weekly updates and very supportive and active developers alongside a fun and banterous community really make this game fun to be a part of sure there are times I get frustrated and lose all my hard grafted gear and base but you can guarentee I'll be back on the beach bloodthirsty for revenge come the next wipe.I couldn't reccomend a game more than Rust to sink hours days weeks years into and for 15 it's a steal Grab your rock and torch and let's start our journey.,Rust

2014-01-06,0,0,303,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun MMO Survival game. As a Pre Alpha there is still a lot of work to be done however the game is still a lot of fun. There are some bugs that you will encounter but just remember that it is an Alpha and with your feedback it will improve in the coming months. check out my RUST series on YouTube!www.youtube.com/officialfarem,Rust
2017-04-14,0,0,491,True,Recommended,Early access done okay fun with minor issues. Rust is in an early access state and has been for a few years now. Typically this would be a sign of the developers abandoning the game and running with their money. However rust is updated weekly and the developers are very communicative. They at least seem to be trying to get the game up and running. The optimization in this game is mediocre. It's not at all perfect in heavily populated areas you can expect dips in performance. The game itself is fun enough to warrant buying. In my opinion it could use an overhaul to all their current player vs. environment mechanics. I think this because it is fairly non existent at the moment and the largest threat is other players.,Rust
2016-10-20,1,1,30,True,Not Recommended,Cant change gender or anything pretty sad. I get it I dont really care but the fact I have to play as a ten year old cancer patient with a mans voice just kinda turns me off. Atleast give the option to be a different gender.Another point is the killing. People kill you are you alone with nothing and starving and seconds away from dying of hunger? They will still waste a bullet on you tired of these 17 year olds who run around killing all noobs. I cant live long enough to fight them its a game of hide and seek and they dont have to hide. You CANT fight them and if you talk and try to be nice nothing changes. Ive spoken while running around a rock that I have nothing they still will kill you. Its sadistic.,Rust

2015-05-31,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,Do not recommend this game because of several things. Gameplay is good and graphics are pristine however optimization is non existent. Furthermore loading screens for booting up the game and joining a server take forever and once you do join a server you run into buildings and people everywhere most of which kill you on the spot. It is impossible to keep up with people that have put hundreds of hours into the game and this ruins the experience. You also lose progress and resources you have collected all the time which is very frustrating. Overall this game is not worth getting until it is refined and the issues with it are fixed.,Rust

If you play it long enough you will learn to love it and then quickly hate it. and after enough time you will begging to realize that this game is absolute garbage. It doesn't matter how good you get with the guns in this game or how complicated you can make your base when it take two people with hacks that just come in and within 5minutes that can take and use what took you 40 hours to gather and prepare for. Note don't bother yourself in trying to talk to them they are the worst type of cancer that will only infuriate you.The anti hack software for this game is such that you can't play a week on an OFFICIAL SERVER without getting all of your taken stole in unfair contest that is rigged from first site. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The creator is more worried about what the next addition to this game is more than whether people can actually enjoy it.,Rust

2014-05-26,0,0,67,True,Recommended,The concept of this game is great. Love the way you can build in almost any place int the game. The gun aiming system is great cause if you dont make your mark you are a Dead man. I think this game has a lot of promise for future development so with this said. This game rules been killed a lot of times killed a lot of players and build and found a lot of houses that have been made. The game runs smoothly on my pc that only haves 512mb video card so when i turn the grahics down it runs great. Try it out it should be a blast. Welll when the servers come up again.,Rust
2014-02-05,0,0,73,True,Not Recommended,Rust is one of those games were you dart out into the open and collect all your goodies as fast as possible before fleeing back into your home and cowering in your own feces as you listen to the sounds of players outside your door panting heavily and leering at you between the cracks of your wall. Most of the time is spent stockpiling every item you collect in boxes logging off for the night and waking up to find your home has been sacked by vikings of the night. Futhermore while all wildlife will give you chickens....and you can hear chickens you will never...ever...see...the chickens. In the end Rust is a dramatic game where you will easily get all the end game content curently offered within ten minutes and it then boils down to being raided or raiding while players are logged off. The hightlights of the game are Brazilians asking if your a girl and then swearing to not kill you as they do not kill girls.,Rust

2017-07-02,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,"I understand that this game is trying to appeal as a hardcore surival game but it's just too much for people just getting onto a server for the first time. Maybe people have more of a chance once a server is wiped for a fresh start but if you miss that chance well fat chance getting anywhere unless you're friends with the people dominating the server. The last time I played this game was almost two years ago. Then it was at least manageable to find a simple resource such as stone. Today I spent around 30 minutes finding stone and once I did I simply received a good head shot from with someone with an AK and all the time spent simlpy looking for stone went for nothing. Stone. 30 minutes just for stone. Shouldn't be this difficult finding stone since there are stone like objects EVERYWHERE but they cannot be mined.Does this game still have wildlife? The whole time I played this session I didn't see any wildlife. I kept from starving by eating random scarce mushrooms and a single piece of corn that I came across. Lastly the game doesn't seem very optimized. Lots of frame stuttering going on with the ""Beautiful"" graphic option after travelling a short distance. The game does have good looking graphics however.Sad to feel that this game may be heading in a wrong direction.EDIT Just tried again to give it another go. Went onto another server with a lower population. Was having a decent time this session. Managed to get a small base with four walls and a furnace. Things seemed to be looking up. Then sure enough two players that were ""controlling the area"" decided to just blow up my roof and kill me with explosives and an AK. I had a spear and a bow.

If you can set up a base with trustworthy friends it's great fun.Cons This game crashes consistently. In the rust world this is terrible because your player is open for looting while the game is crashed. Playing for a mere 2 hours the game crashed 5 times. That's about one crash every half hour. So every half hour you have a potential to lose your items without being able to defend yourself. The roughness of the game. Rust is meant to be rough but the community is just terrible. If you can find a good server there are a few good people but it doesn't account for the sheer number that will just shoot you on sight. This would almost be acceptable but when mixed with the constant crashing of rust it's not acceptable. Early access BS. Seems to be another game hiding behind ""early access"" so they don't have to squash bugs. I would wait until this game is fully released (if ever) to play. If only they got rid of the bugs it would be a very enjoyable experience. Not beforehand however.",Rust

But with rust you can make teams with different people build bases which can be bigger and better than they were before make guns go exploring raiding other peoples bases etc. and in my opinion i would say thats what gives it just that extra push for me to say i would favor this game over minecraft.

2016-01-21,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,There was a point in time where rust was something I looked forward to playing on my weekends.I would hunt build raid and meet new people.That rust is now gone and what replaces it is a new version of it that has overly complicated crafting system no tutorials and no options to change your settings ingame that and a load of gamebreaking bugs.I cannot comment about the game content at all because I can hardly walk a few steps before the entire game slows down and my rust crashes or I die.I miss old rust.......I really do......,Rust

2016-05-01,2,1,850,True,Recommended,Well well well. So you want to play rust the video game. Good choice this game is balls to the wall rad. Never before have I played a survival game that crafted its core mechanics so well. The base building is smooth and fun to do. You can build houses in this game that you could never afford in life. The system allows you to use nothing but your inguenity to create a defensable s*** shack.The weapons and combat system is cool and feels satisfying. While guns are hard to use they have that heft to them that real guns and your fat b***h just have.The farming system is well tuned and balanced. The rock gods bless the nakeds with plentiful crafting supplies. No need to craft a bow using your right arm the hair on your back and your smallish d**k when times get tough. Just grab a cup of coffee put on some tunes and sprint out of your house and literally rip a tree stump out of the ground.Slavering at the bit at my accurate description of this game I see. Well hold on there you tremendous cancerous a** hole. This game is only fun for people who have over 500 hours of in game time. There are two people in this game naked noobs grabbing thier ankles and a group of armored gang bangers. Its actually impossible to make a base all by yourself on a populated server. As soon as you got some farm and start making a base people come and stop you. I don't advise trying to make friends. The majority of the people who play rust are the same people who tell little kids that santa isn't real and then later in the day pleasure themselves to the image of the childs crying face. In all my time playing rust I have made two bases and both were with a friend. One lasted 2 days before I was betrayed and lost the house the other lasted 8 hours before someone blew thier way in and stole my collection of fashionable beanies and boonie hats. Also its really f***in hard to get the reciepes to build anything less s***ty than litteraly just a repurposed piece of bark.Yes this game is fun but it is impossible to play unless you have two traits about your being. One you are more patient than a f***ing rock. And two you have managed to keep your cheese and onions stench repressed long enough to befriend a couple other cheeto encrusted pain loving sociopaths who will play with you. If you buy this game you will get to see the darkest side of humanity and over time lose yours. If you don't I don't know you can go back to playing minecraft you f***in pansy motherf***er.,Rust

2016-05-04,1,1,201,True,Recommended,Rust. Don't trust anyone. That's one of the most common sayings. I'm not going to say Rust was the first of the survival genre. There are many of them now DayZ Ark Hurtworld just to name a few. The genre is quickly becoming saturated. But unlike others Rust still holds strong by far my favorite. With the development team able to release updates with experimental features and quickly refining them sets Rust apart from others. Though Rust isn't perfect. The first two hours are grinding. The blueprint system favors groups. But what's most important is that the development team has already out lined goals to change the systems. Which once again sets Rust apart. The ability to rework basic systems hear feedback from community and update at a realistic speed. Not like you see from other games which update over a lengthy time and make the game feel stale. Plus on top of that after the first couple hours the game is fun and extremely additive. At $20 Rust is a steal.,Rust

2016-05-10,0,0,2818,True,Recommended,Edited 11 4 16They removed the hated XP system and replaced it with a new crafting system that makes the game much more of a sandbox. I still miss some of the social aspects of the old Rust but the update yesterday was pretty brilliant. It is worth checking out.Just make sure you Youtube some strategy guides if you try playing it.Edited 8 10 16They used to have a system for advancement with an element of randomness where crafting abilities were gained randomly by exploring and could be traded or sold between players. They removed it in favor of an experience point system.There is little motivation to explore the rad towns or deal with other players. Materials gathered for research needed to be protected in the old system but under the new system there is no such value placed on random drops. That means there isn't much of value in your base to protect.That means I don't feel like building one. Now you farm so you are permitted to craft and you craft so you can raid people that did the same thing.I'm sure the game will improve in the future. Right now I'm not about it.______________________________For my review I'm going to tell a new player how to play solo.Step 1 Collect a small amount of stone and wood make arrows.Step 2 Collect Hemp and Wood make a bow.Step 3 Make more arrows. Congrats you are now able to defend your loot. Do this before making tools.Step 4 Make a hatchet and a pick.Step 5 Kill animals to get fat and use it with your hemp to make fuel. Get stone and wood. Make a furnace.Step 6 Hide the furnace behind a cliff and only run during the day. Hide a sleeping bag in a bush nearby.Step 7 Burn metal ore in the furnace while you are chopping wood. Get 2 3k wood and spend 1k on a toolbox. Let the furnace make 250 metal frags.Step 8 Get stone by hitting nodes. Step 9 Make a tiny stone base one level high no more than 2x2 but maybe smaller. Put the toolbox inside and wall it off with stone. Use the metal frags to make another door.Step 10 Be careful leaving so no one runs inside your house. Do not open the door to your house again until you can make another furnace inside and have enough metal ore and wood to make a second door for the house before you leave again. You must have two doors back to back like an airlock a furnace and a walled off tool box to block building authority a storeage box and a sleeping bag inside this tiny tiny building. Use this building to store materials to make a larger base.For bonus points build your base as far from other bases as possible while still building near a road or power lines. Do not put your base down unless you SEE hemp growing. Do not put your base down unless you see multiple nodes.More bonus points for finding a small stone base with a tool box you can access and a prebuilt furnace. Putting doors on a raided and empty base is easier than building one. Even more bonus points for using someone else's furnace to make a door before you kill animals.Warnings do not rely on wood walls wood floors or wood ceilings. They will be destroyed. Stone walls only. Wood doors only if you can put a metal door inside the wooden door while someone is destroying it. It can by time but you have to put a metal door deeper in the base.Master level build extra bases and fill them with doors and random loot boxes each with stone wood hammers and building plans. If you log on and see you got raided move inner doors out and patch the walls make one supply run and get back on top in an hour.I love this activity. Best video activity n/a.,Rust
2016-02-22,0,0,629,True,Recommended,Rust is a game where you work hard build your huge base have everything you need inside it and just admire it's beauty then in matter minutes watch it get destroyed and all your work burn in flames and people steal all your stuff as your body lays on the ground with 12 year olds teabagging you before they help you up so you hope they'll let you go with your clothes still on just to watch you fall on the ground again after they shoot you.,Rust

Everyone is a grade A git and will do everything they can to ruin your day... but this is part of what makes it fun.The only thing that really lets the game down is hackers. The team seem to spend time working on more pointless aspects of the game like music or a new door they need to spend quality time to make cheating harder. Hackers go unchallenged on official servers and even on servers like Rustafied openly boasting in live chat that they cheat. The creators don't seem to care about the amount of cheating that goes on. You spend a lot of time in the game crafting the best items to go out and PVP against others but alot of the time will die instantly to aim bots from 200m with triple head shots. If they could solve cheating Rust would truly be a 10/10 game for me. As it stands 7/10.,Rust

There's always a hacker that will cheat the anticheat system.

Reward in Rust is easier to achieve when playing in a group or with friends so I reccomend finding some buddies and hopping on a server of your choice to get the best experience.

You can spend hours hitting trees with a rock build a small little house trying to level up so that you can protect yourself and then lose it all when someone runs 20 feet from you and shoots you then they destroy your house and everything you've accumulated.This will happen again and again and again until you are sick of wasting your life playing a game with people who have nothing better to do than to kill you because they can. It's not like you have anything worth anything to them. 1000 wood some food and no clothes doesn't matter. You'll respawn and run for about 5 minutes till you find a wooded area again and start hitting a tree with a rock and boom some guy runs up and kills you for the 30th time.The playerbase just spam memes and phallic shapes on signs anyway if that's any signal to the maturity of the people who play it.Find a better use of your time.,Rust
2014-01-22,0,0,800,True,Recommended,"If you're trying to decide whether your money is better spent here or DayZ BUY THIS GAME IT'S MORE COMPLETE.Here are some reasons why Now this game has ALREADY given me hundreds of hours of awsomeness despite it being in alpha.Let me give you a comparison I have 285 hours on Rust and 9 on DayZ at the time of this review.This is NOT because DayZ is a bad game. But it's simply because what Garry Newman (Creator of Rust &amp Garry's mod) has brought to the table has all of its elements complete. What I mean by this Is all of the mechanics are working currently. There's no gamebreaking bugs. No character's disappearing no zombies running through walls/gates/doors like in DayZ standalone. Also In my opinion Rust has a lot more promise than DayZ. Garry has said he is not trying to make Rust ""like every other zombie game"" So he's going to be replacing the zombies soon with something hopefully more interesting. Also you can build your own bases in Rust! A fort if you will to fend off any invaders that try and ransack it. In this game you will also never find yourself running around for 4 hours only to find nothing. Instead you can craft all your tools/guns. You can start on a new server run into a radtown and if you get lucky there could be a gun in the very first crate you search. Or go hit a couple rocks with your rock then some trees build a furnace and slam yourself together a Revolver!Another cool thing about the crafting is the ability to research objects you can't craft. So say you just killed somone for their full set of Kevlar armor (The best defensive equipment in the game) But you want to learn how to research it so that you can craft it yourself. To do this you will need to kill zombies in Radtowns to find Research Kits. You can use these on an object and it will teach you how to craft it. Taking away from the need to kill zombies for the Kevlar armor blueprints. (Rarer spawn than kits) Because often times then not it will be easier to ambush someone in kevlar than harvest it yourself.I'm gonna keep this review short all in all Rust is an amazing game so far with incredible things to be added soon (Cars Helicopters Different armors/Building materials.)I would definitely recommend it over DayZ if you're trying to make up your mind.",Rust

This game this game will make you feel like trash with a rock in your hand all naked in the wild or a ing beast terrorizing every single out there with an AK47and some c4s.

2017-04-20,0,0,2247,True,Recommended,Will likely go down in history as one of the best survival games ever made. It's a brutal experience and survival on a high population server is extremely competitive purchase with this reality in mind. I decided to write this review to mention a few things that you don't see from the screenshots. You don't see how intricate and clever the base building techniques are and how bank heist esque and surgical a base raiding experience can be. You can pinpoint weaknesses in other peoples designs and outsmart them on an engineering level. You also don't see how much potential there is to simply outsmart well equipped enemies and straight up dunk on them. For me it's what I dreamed of as a boy running around outside buildings forts and fighting bad guys with your buddies to back you up.,Rust

2017-10-19,0,0,916,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun and engaging game. You easily get sucked into building a base collecting resources and currently blueprints. As a sandbox survival game it hits the mark. The effort the devs put into balancing and updates are superior to alot of games I've played. The only downside to Rust in MY opinion is the playerbase. I will hands down recommend this game to anyone with more free time than they know what to do with. However be aware the worst part of Rust is the majority of the people who play it.,Rust

2017-05-06,0,0,122,True,Recommended,My Personal Rust ReviewRust is an open world sandbox survival multiplayer game and it is BRUTAL.By brutal I mean that it hardcore but fun game.The best way you can play is with friends it is easier and better if you prefer solo then you need to learn how to survive alone.Here are the Cons and Pros ProsThe graphics are awesome you need a good computer to run this game atleast at 50 fps.There are not only survival servers there are many more like Battlefield Creative RP and many more.The building system is the main reason that this game is sandbox amazing system.ConsThe community is really dumb nobody is friendly unless you are in a PVE server the bad side of the game.AI. the AI is stupid example a bear can see you from 100m away and if you don't have weapons to kill him you are dead.some resources are hard to find like stones are not rare but not easy to find them.That is it so i recommend to play this game but you need to find friends that play Rust or you it will be harder. I don't care how long is the loading screen after you are in the server you don't want to stop playing.MY SCORE 8.5/10.,Rust

So many stories so many new friends and frienemies.

2014-02-16,0,0,97,True,Recommended,"At time of writing Rust is still heavily in alpha stage with various problems plauging the gameplay and servers. That aside if you are lucky enough to find a server that suits your interest with people that have common goals then you are certainly in for a treat.I was fortunate enough to come across a PvE based server with a great community. The game and the server community instantly pulled me straight into an addiction. I clocked 81 hours in the space of a few weeks and I'd find myself scratching the bugs under my skin if I wasn't logged on.The concept of the game is entirely survival survive against the cold hunger thirst weather animals and most importantly other players. Admitedly I'm not a huge fan of the whole ""people can kill you when you're logged out"" part losing all of your hard work while offline and unable to defend yourself but that brings another element into the game strategy.So far it sounds like I'm reading straight off the brochure but you'll understand when you play it.My ratings below Audio 7/10 Ambient sounds are lame and the sounds the animals make suck. On the other hand the distant gun shots during the dead of night have a tendency to run a chill down your spine.Visual 6/10 Not exactly pleasing to the eye but as I mentioned earlier the game is still HEAVILY alpha and I'd expect that to change. That aside the textures are pretty cool but having crappy mountains and glitchy rocks puts a damper on that.Gameplay and content 8/10 There are enough varied items in the game to catch your attention for several hours and more to be expected in the full version release. On that same token if you were to play by yourself in the game you'd be very bored. If you were to play on a server with griefers than you'd be frustrated. If you find yourself a decent server with people who either allow you to get on your own two feet or help you out or play with friends then the game is out of this world.Replayability 8/10 I did put a lot of time into the game more than I should have. And to be brutally honest the time I spent in game was due to the server I was playing on as opposed to the game itself. The game did allow for this server to exist however but it was more of a social aspect than playing the game.All in all I would definately recommend this game to anyone. I would probably suggest to hold off until full version release or at least beta due to the problems you experience at this stagee but playing alpha I don't know what else you'd expect.This game has great potential and I am excited to see where it's headed. The only real problem I have is that it runs very poorly on lower spec machines there needs to be more options to allow users to turn it down a notch removing the grass doesn't always work!",Rust

2016-05-05,0,0,70,True,Recommended,A very enjoyable game where methodical thought and planning rewards those who utilise it. The development of your character and your chances of survivng heavily depend on resource gathering and obtaining blueprints to allow for more advanced items to be constructed. The game is incredibly beautiful has a massive scope for further development and doesnt have any massive game breaking bugs (that I have stumbled across as of yet) with only the animal AI being the most noteworthy of issues.An easy to use mechanic for creating structures is employed to give just enough freedom for people to create bases of all sorts.Highly recommend this game!,Rust

Yes some are as toxic as acid like the high population servers but if you look for a smaller less populated server it ternds to be much less toxic or not at all. So to be fair it all depends on the server you join as to your experiance you will recive.

Dont know what to do and how to pick up anything to start crafting asks for help nude from the stranger girl getting a tribute of some collected logs. Dont know what to do. Asking somebody to kill me in chat.. Suddenly Bear appears and kills me. 2. Spawn near someone's hut saw something beneath it. Bring out my stone for pelting it was a dog. I thought to tame it.

The learning curve is very long but once you learn to accept death and loss the world feels like an oyster and every bit of power feels like an incredible new tool.

There is no way to ""win"" in rust the only thing you can win is a bottle of self accomplishment that feeling when you craft that sweet oh so sweet kevlar armor when you finally finish building that impenetrable fortress when you finally kill a fresh spawn.Yes I and many others have experience spawning into the server for the first time as a naked with nothing more than a torch and a rock you smash at some trees and smash some rock enough to make yourself a nice stone hatchet your mid craft and you see a group of bandits coming your way you can't run (Since crafting slows you down) you turn around and bang before you can even say ""I'm friendly"" you are dead.Enough of my t ranting about Kevlars killing nakeds let's talk about Legacy and how it's not ever going to be updated again.A few months ago Garry decided to release the experimental version (Fully revamped) of Rust to the public it's now the default version of rust although you can easily switch between the two Garry said that they will not be supporting Legacy anymore and they will be focused on providing Experimental with updates.Let me tell that doing this killed Rust Experimental feels like I'm playing some rust rip off made by an autistic 12 year old Darkrp admin the coloring and new graphics look like I will admit the UI Looks great but I'm not a fan of experimental.Legacy had so much potential it could go places Garry could create a whole new genre of gaming with this but he didn't for sakes Garry we believed in you.",Rust

2016-12-21,0,0,988,True,Recommended,"Rust in my humble opinion is the best fps survival game out there! It has come a long way since its early beginnings and has been transformed into a beautiful experience. The switch from legacy Rust was absolutely the right decision and as the hacks and exploits have been fixed or removed more weapons and crafting added and the experience point experiment coming full circle the game is quickly nearing completion. There are still a few things that I hear people whine about 1. The community is a bunch of KOS freaks. A. You play serious PVP and that's what it's all about also everyone goes through the same thing. B. How about play some PVE first? C. There are also plenty of no KOS servers so try a bit harder and go find one... D. I have made many friends on RUST from all over the country (and the Great White North too)2. The changes that have been made ruined the game A. Game play has dramatically improved. B. Explioits and hacks are being cleaned up so the cheating bags have to play by the rules. C. The component system is more realistic than any other ""crafting"" system out there. (using a pipe some gears and a gun receiver is still a bit far fetched but better than crafting magic!!!) D. Radiation is plausible in post apocalyptic scenarios and although a drag it does add to the gameplay. (Plus if you don't like it there are plenty of non radioactive servers. E. The overall look / feel / sound has been polished by developers that clearly understand this game genre.This is one of those games that has tons of replay abilty for years to come. I trust the developers and applaud them for what they have created and excited to see where it goes from here!",Rust

2017-04-15,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,Rust is and has been for a while now notorious for having the most cancerous community in the survivals. In fact it is so bad that the game is used as an official indicator from which to gauge other games with awful players.Guy 1 So do you like ARK? Guy2 I don t know man. The graphics look good but riding dinosaurs looks silly and the community is Rust level cancer. The game is for hackers and thieves. If you are looking for a reliable community you would be better off playing a game like 7dtd.Finally the devs are more interested in injecting the game with political statements about domestic non issues than actually protecting its customers from hackers and exploits. It doesn t matter that it is an early access game and is broken people still act like this is a finished product and praise it.,Rust
2016-12-25,0,0,687,True,Recommended,Seem slike ll these other idiots only care about the player base. And complain about how it's so bad. I have countless friends from Rust and they are all nice people. This game is a survival game down to the core. Just because someone kills you and takes your stuff dosent make them an . This game is survival of the fittest anything goes even if its a scumbag move. You need to realize people will be nice to you if you are to them. Some people never change and will keep shooting and those people become your enemies. Another problem are Zerg's. These really suck to go up against but if you watch Kcmo or other youtube channels they destroy Zergs on many attempts. Everything else about this game is amazing. The graphics the new system component system finally got it right and the game is in a great place. Next they just have to fix the animals and from what ive heard it could be somewhat soon. When buying this game you need to think about the type of player you are. Do you like to watch Tyler1? Do you play CSGO? If you are an alpha male you will enjoy this game. This isn't a single player survival game it's on a whole other level of dificulty.,Rust

2016-09-21,0,0,213,True,Not Recommended,"Definitely do not reccomend this game if you're usually a solo player. Atleast in the official servers. Pros Beautiful graphicsAwesome teamwork systemDevelopers listen to the fansGame gives you a really euphoric feel if you can actually get anywhereCons (Note some of these are just personal and changes may be made in the game that fixes these problems)Can be seriously frustrating and give you headaches if you get mad easily like I doReally experience being a solo player unless you play in one of the modded servers that makes you gather resources fasterRaiders/raids Raiders and being raided can be VERY frustrating you just built yourself a nice little hut to set yourself down in and you might be back from a resource gathering trip where you've gotten just enough resources to get that weapon or tool you're after. ""What's that?"" you say you look outside and see 5 people with full metal gear and AK74U's outside of your base screaming ""Ooga booga! Ooga booga! give us yo !"" and get blown up with C4 and rocket launchers immediately this is also why I reccomend modded servers for solo players because you've just played for about 7 hours straight and lost all your progress in a matter of 5 minutes. It's serious t but it's what makes the game fun (for them I guess) I've never personally raided but I've heard that it makes your toes stand up when raiding someones base always having the thrill of taking everything they own to progress yourself and your teammates (unless you're solo raiding of course). You always have that fear of dying but if you complete a raid it's most of the time worth it. The XP system (problem that will be fixed soon hopefully) I'm going to expand on the XP system that was introduced in Rust. You see some time ago Rust had a blueprint system where you would find blueprints of whatever you were trying to craft or you could take a whack at it yourself with research papers and such. I'm not too experienced in it myself because I just got a computer that could play Rust some months ago but from the fanbase this seems to be the most accepted system. People wanted the XP system at first but immediately after it was released it received constant backlash. Players hated it. I've had a experience with it and a lot of other people have as well. Please FacePunch remove the XP system.",Rust

2014-01-11,0,0,71,True,Not Recommended,Alpha ReviewI have to say that I'm just Barely recommending this game because it is a fairly new and great genre Straight up survival. I also recognize that this is the alpha and there are some things that are going to need improving. 1. Decay This just doesn't make sense. Building decays after a certain amount of time? Ok that makes sense but I mean building last for a long time even mud huts will stand for a long time. So 6 months or 180 game days for wood at least I mean wooden houses last for years in the real world. 12 hours...So say goodbye to your stuff all of it all the time.2. Goals There doesn't seem to be a reason to play 'except' survival at this point. Even if you got a sweet place with every schematic and you went around killing to your hearts content. There is no reason to keep going in the game once you've reached a certain point. Maybe instead of a goal they allowed the ability to create objects within the game or create more depth like diplomacy and trade. Clan operations and such. 3. Enemies Needs work no reason to get into this more. (Ex. Zombie has ten foot reach...)4. Exploration Needs more building the landscape doesn't feel like it has a story it's like gaming purgatory right nowThat all being said I'm probably going to play for a bit now it's just frustrating to see all of my hard work raided every dayNOT RECOMMENDED until certain things are fixed such as shooting through walls...,Rust

2017-06-17,4294967295,1,443,True,Recommended,So I'm going to be uninstalling this game right now but I'm going to give it a positive review but I'm going to point out at bad things in this game particulary in this review.I spent 20 euros on this game and enjoyed (more or less) 150 hours into it I found that completely worth it. However this game besides being amazing idea and mostly good implementation has few major issues so here is the list 1. And most important this is Survival game that is close to impossible to play solo and in every turn groups will have advantages. I didn't expect co op/group survival when I bought it so it's more or less my mistake.2. Dev team is active but they are doing monthly updates consisting of updating animals and stuff while servers die in 2 days. They are focusing on wrong things.3. This game is for years in Early Access and it's probably never to going to get out with this pace.4. Balance of weapons is catastrophical. 5. Server and game performance is bad optimization is complete 6. It has long learning process and by the time you set up a bit first 5 things from this review will kill your will to play.Now good things If you have friends that you want to suffer with this might be game for you.It's worth of try idea is great game is solid 6 in current form could be solid 10 with a bit more work a bigger Dev team that takes it seriously.,Rust

2017-03-13,0,0,664,True,Recommended,"I realize 70 hours(at the time of writing this) isnt a lot of gameplay but heres my take on this game. At first I had seen some people play the game and I thought ""huh that looks kinda neat but not worth $20"". Then a few weeks go buy and Ive found myself watching obscene amounts of videos on youtube on Rust. A friend mentioned that theres a site online where I could get a copy for &lt $15 and so I thought screw it lets just buy the damn game already. I will tell you right now if you are interested in survival games and you have not yet pulled the trigger on Rust just do it. Yes the community is pretty toxic depending on the server you're on and yes you will spawn and almost instantly get rekt by fully geared people despite having literally nothing but a rock and torch but I promise you once you find a server to call your home you will love this game. The 70+ hours ive spent thus far took place over about 3 weeks. I just cant stop playing this game. Obviously as a game thats still in alpha you will run into problems but as long as you know that going in you will be happy you spent the money on this. As far as the lifespan of this game is concerned they are still constantly pushing updates to the game and making it better. Theres relatively clear communication from the devs as to whats changing and theres a very consistent schedule for the updates",Rust

2014-04-24,0,0,609,True,Recommended,This game is truly a lot of fun. But you really need to play this game with other friends. If your by yourself and flying solo the game will be harder. If you don't have any friends who play this game try to join a group. It will be hard most people will just kill you. But if you get into a group you will enjoy the game a lot more. This game could potentionaly be one of the best games ever. It's still in alpha so if you don't like playing games that still have bugs you should wait to buy this game.,Rust

2016-12-09,0,0,284,True,Recommended,Pretty decent hardcore survival game with a decided slant on 'Dog Eat dog'. I do quite like the variety of weaponry but find it really hard to near impossible to play solo...the only way I was finally able to get ahead was join up with someone and even then we both only established a base with the MASSIVE help of two nice fellas (now neighbours). Which brings me to a main LIKE of Rust group anarchist behaviour. I have read of many that discount this game because they find peeps only wanna smack down everyone they see but I find at least on the server I play that that is not always true. I have spoken with quite a few of my neighbours all good behaviour and good will so far...yes I have been jacked and molested and griefed but what do you expect? All in all looking forward to expanding the base and gaining the upper hand when faced with threats.,Rust

The only time you get attacked is when another real person decides to attack you and likewise you could play this game by running around attacking people's bases. Worth getting lost in. Good environments that encourage exporation. Although in my opinion the time spent gathering resources on vanilla servers is way too long. The fun in this game can only be had once you've spent tons of time running around looking for resources someone else didn't already pick up and then the time spent actually gathering it...So i play on modded servers that increase the gathering rate and i recommend this,Rust

2015-10-16,1,1,309,True,Recommended,"For an early access survival game that drops you into the game as a fully naked (censoring available) man geared with a rock and a torch it's pretty epic.The hunger/thirst starts out low and some take that into too much consideration when they start out but the main concern is making sure you don't get killed by someone else.The objective is to ""survive"" and the gameplay as a noob is exactly that on the Official servers. Those who have been gathering the Blueprints for better gear don't mind the monthly wipes of items and bases but those who are just joining in? Well it's a ""dog eat dog world"" out here in Rust.If Official is too tough the awesome selection of Community Servers is always available. These modded servers can be interesting though. Some wipe items and bases at random... some every 2 weeks! Currently the one I'm on wipes even the Blueprints (that can take a long time to obtain) every 4 weeks(monthly) to keep it interesting and noob friendly.Biggest Con I find right now is that an attacking animal (wolf/bear) can hit you and deal damage while at a considerable distance.Biggest Pro I find right now is the epic replayability.10 for 10 will play again.",Rust

2016-04-18,0,0,70,True,Recommended,Rust is an early access multiplayer survival game that I had my doubts about. But if you play with a friend it is a lot of fun but can be frustrating at times.In Rust your only aim is to survive. This can be easy or it can be difficult depending on the type of people you find in each server. The community itself isn't THAT bad. I have seen worse but I have also seen better. The game is very addicting once you get the hang of it and start raiding other player's bases. The game encourages you to make friends with other people but to also kill other people who threaten or try to raid you. The voice chat works well for only people within a certain range can hear you. The game does have it's downsides however for it is pretty laggy and pretty glitchy. Hopefully in the future that will be fixed.Overall this is a great game and I have a lot of fun playing it with my friends. Well really this game is only fun if you play with friends so yeah. I do recommend it but the characters are nude but that can be turned off in the settings if you wish.,Rust

After the last update when we get serious damage it sounds like a broken box or smth like this. )And finally this game needs HUGE GRAPHIC OPTİMİZATİONS plz devs plz.

2017-04-26,0,0,239,True,Recommended,Rust is an amazing real time open world survival pvp game that is constantly changing and improving. The devs are dedicated and the game receives updates frequently. The devs aren t for better or worse afraid of changing fundamental aspects of the game to achieve the rust they want it to be. Rust isn t a game you jump into a few times a week and play for an hour or two if you want to experience (vanilla) rust it requires a lot of grinding and dedication to get started but it can still be very fun. Rust is best played in groups of 2 8 people where you can watch out for each other get a base down faster and get resources quicker. I personally don t enjoy rust solo because the game punishes solos in many ways. If you have a weekend to play with a few buddies rust is an excellent game that plays very differently than other games (bare a few games in the same genre).,Rust

2016-06-27,0,0,253,True,Recommended,A lot of reviewers are saying the community is While this is in some case true I have seen many servers where people are generally nice and don't try to shoot you in the face as soon as they see you (most of the time). I have just started playing this game because of the sale and I am having a blast. Survival at its best!Quick tips for any new people. Don't go in expecting to play one long continuous game. Chances are that you will have to start over. Often. Whenever you log off for a few days even a few hours you can't expect your camp to still be intact with all your things. If it is good for you! And if not well you just gotta try to get even further than last time! Each game session is different you encounter a variety of people and places some friendly some not. If multiplayer is not your thing you can set up your own server (there are plenty guides for that pretty easy to do takes 15 minutes) and you will be able to play by yourself. But I find that the thrill of losing everything in one single moment of inattention one single mistake is part of the game and makes it much more entertaining. You cannot let your guard down always be attentive to your surroundings and if you see someone coming for you just RUN!! Survived many encounters just like that. Oh and watch out for the dogs. These things are more lethal than a player with an AK 47. Don't go near those things! And don't get me started on the bears...,Rust

It started sort of well The game looks good has different play options like battle royale or just the regular server. I was exploring poking around learning to craft and harvest. Then I got killed by another much higher level player. Meh it happens not everyone is a nice guy right? I respawn. I start again. Crafting items gathering dying. Oh wait! Dead again?? By now they'd realised I was spawning on the simulator and were killing me before I could even stop being naked. Any 'noob' who asked for help in chat was hunted down and killed for the sake of it. Switched to a different simulator and more of the same. After what was almost two hours of dying roughly every 9 minutes or so while idiots on voice chat called me ' ' or ' ' I realised that while this game holds high potential for being fun that unless you already know a large group of high level players you're screwed. Even if all your friends all join at once if you are a bunch of 'noobs' then you are screwed. If you buy anything on a simulator they will raid loot and destroy it and you are screwed. Toxic immature community that is best avoided even at the great price I bought this for. Shame really.,Rust

2017-01-15,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Rust is the closest thing to real life that you'd get if you dropped a bunch of guys off on an deserted island. Your personality goes a long way... if you run into someone who's cool and helps you out it feels good... if you run into someone who KOS then it infuriates you especially if they had nothing to gain... then you'll find people who betray you after being by your side for a good while. Starting off naked you earn everything you use... down to medical supplies food clothing and weapons. So when you earn these weapons you appreciate them and you tread lightly.. which is another pro about this game you'll likely if ever experience anyone running and gunning. There is too much to lose. The greatest satisfaction is building your house and living in it getting supplies running into weirdos and some cool people. Rust is the most authentic social experience you'll get in a game. Within a week of playing it the graphics drastically improved. Some reviews people had issue with the graphics the graphics look fantastic and some models and animations are still in development. I once met a group of 5 guys and we had a campfire and cooked food and held it down at night as people passed through camp. I felt like I was actually camping... cool experience. Hackers suck. When you launch the game you get a huge warning of hacking and if caught you'll be kicked off the servers forever. Yet the game is littered with hackers and they aren't shy about admitting it. Some can walk through walls jump high speed run and auto aim kill from 100 miles away. Keep telling yourself it's an Alpha and pray it gets better. I must say I've been playing games since the Atari 2600 and even in Alpha I'd say that Rust is my most favorite game I've played.,Rust

2016-08-28,0,0,621,True,Not Recommended,This game is extremely addicting and incredibly time consuming more than most games. In order to be successful in this game you or someone playing with you must be on like at LEAST 50% of the time or all of your hard work will be for absolutely nothing and you will find yourself in front of a broken base seeing all of your hard work and all of the hours spent on your base turned to If you have a big group then it do whatever you want. The community on this game is so toxic. this is a kill on sight kind of game so if you just spawned in dont be surprised if someone comes along with 10x's more hours than you on the game who is full geared to kill you without hesitation. This game is cruel and cold. good luck finding your way in this game if you are new. you will definately need it.,Rust

2017-01-12,1,1,26,True,Recommended,rustbrown coating that appears on metal when it gets weta reddish or yellowish brown flaking coating of iron oxide that is formed on iron or steel by oxidation especially in the presence of moisture.Rust is an iron oxide usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides Fe2O3 nH2O and iron(III) oxide hydroxide (FeO(OH) Fe(OH)3). Given sufficient time oxygen and water any iron mass will eventually convert entirely to rust and disintegrate. Surface rust is flaky and friable and it provides no protection to the underlying iron unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. Rusting is the common term for corrosion of iron and its alloys such as steel. Many other metals undergo equivalent corrosion but the resulting oxides are not commonly called rust.,Rust

2017-01-16,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,"Warning! I just recently hit 100 hrs on this game and feel i should warn other players since Facepunch fails to do so. My irl Buddy and i were figureing the ins and outs of the game when we met another player in game who seemed to know his stuff. We decided to join him and his group and run around while he taught us some tactics. After 3 days of some serious grinding we recived a hacker buddy ban!?!?!? We are no longer aloud to play in the server b/c it turn out the guys we met were cheaters and not as good as we thought. So if you just play with people you really know and dont make friends in this game you should be fine. But if your like majority of people in the gaming community and want to make a clan and join up with people to have more power be very careful. I am extremley dissatisfied with the way facepunch has handeled this they refused to refund my money or unban me from the server or even consider it. They basically said we dont tolerate cheaters or anyone associated with them. Even though i met these ""cheaters"" in their server.

It's leaned away from the building and creative aspects of a survival game and turned into a multiplayer fps.

So I am walking around and see that someone has made a base but cleverly destroyed the ramp to get to the door so I could not reach it. So once I establish that this gayfag is actually in his base I decide to wait with my bow and arrow pointed at the door to kill him. Well about this time my son starts throwing a fit for some unknown reason and I did not want to miss the chance to murk this guy. So I decide to key up my microphone and let this guy listen to the sweet song brixon is sharing with me lol.. Almost immediately this dude starts complaining in chat asking why he hears a baby crying and brixon just keeps on and on and on lol.. Finally this guy gets the balls to open his door only to take a arrow shaft right to the forehead where he then dies and falls to the canyon floor below lol. He then goes on to rage because he had not set up his sleeping bag yet which lets you respawn in your base! Lol 10/10 would neglect my son again.,Rust

2015-07-24,2,1,750,True,Recommended,Very addicitive and great fun survival game. I would like one extra added when you die I would like the option to re spawn near to my dead body so my hard earned plunderings could be recovered. It's very frustrating when some random wolf or bear kills you after spending hours collecting resource or mapping an area only to lose it all.Nearly every update is an improvement and I look forward each week to seeing what new things have been implemented.The game looks great visualy with only a few minor tweaks needed like the amount of shadow flickering in the distance particularly on mountains.All in all this is a fantastic game and I would recomend anyone to purchase and try it out.Shmonks,Rust

2015-07-06,0,0,725,True,Recommended,"Having played the game for over 300 hours I figured it was about time to give this game an honest review.The Official Description ""The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Whatever it takes to survive.""Rust is at its core a magnificent social experiment in which the most ruthless and cunning survive. It is not a game for those easily upset and it is certainly not a game to be played alone.In my experience I've lived and died fought and fled built and destroyed and led rebellions and been deposed. Rust is one of the the most frustrating terrifying and satisfying games there is. Even though I definitely recommend Rust it is the level of satisfaction you'll earn playing this game is inarguably dependent upon what kind of player (and really what kind of person) you are.I'm not the kind of person that should play Rust I play as a lone wolf I get killed often because I don't kill everyone on sight and I try and fly under the radar by providing the more well off players with information and occasionally helping with tasks they might need. In the end I end up getting caught in the inevitable crossfire that occurs when two large groups collide.One aspect of Rust that is highly intriguing is that a person can utilize deception to their advantage. You can mislead people in such a way that they might think you are their friend allowing you to get close to them and assassinate them. You could confuse people as to your location. You can use it to avoid as much trouble as you can. And of course with deception you can just troll people.The game plays well and interesting things can happen when people come together. It all conglomerates into one big post apocalyptic island drama.Overall Rust is a great game but it's not for everyone. And remember (T)Rust no one...",Rust

2015-11-30,0,0,585,True,Recommended,After having 450+ hours in rust I can say that the game is most definitely worth the purchase. Rust has alot of action building and crafting to do. The PvP battles are fun engaging and rewarding. If you like ruining peoples day then rust is definitely the game for you!If you like giving kids abuse then rust is definitely the game for you!Pros Killing people is fun.Raiding peoples bases is fun. Still in alpha so more content is being added regulary. Game is well balanced.Well optimized. Cons Can get repetetive at times but if you don't mind that you will enjoy rust. Can be very time consuming. Because it is an online sandbox PvP world you need quite a bit of time for rust. Because your character and base stay in the game whilst your offline people can raid your base while you are AFK or offline at work. I found myself to love it whilst I was unemployed but now I'm back in full time work I don't really have as much time for rust. If you got 10 hours to kill a day on a game then rust is for you D!,Rust

If you want to feel like you are in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"" then this is the game for you. Boys running around with their little Piggy trying to kill you. ""Which is better to have rules and agree or to hunt and kill?"" PiggyThere is no reasoning with the players. They lie to get close and kill you. As you respawn they kill you. They walk the beaches with their guns to shoot you down... naked with you only holding a rock and torch. This game is toxic literally filled with psychos. I can't even imagine female characters being put into this landscape (you start off as a naked man). Lots of racisim too. I don't know if this game can ever be fixed. The community is just awful. ""Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!"" The boysThere are still somes bugs in the game. The animals randomly disappear and the rain blinks in and out.EDIT The problem with this game is the onboarding. Most people will kill a naked on site. So if you are new... you'll propably die senselessly a couple of times. You also need a mic so you can chat ingame. Communication will get you far some times. Solo sucks find friends earn trust and trade mats/ bp with others. After hours of play I finally made a nice little base. Since I created my base I can now focus of other aspects of the game. The sever we are on currently wipes every week... which is good and bad. Now my home will be gone and I must start anew but players start off on just about the same footing. Still a grind though. Watch some youtube videos learn your map and find the Rust wiki. Another thing that I liked about the game are their ingame skins you can buy in the steam market place.

I missed the whole zombie era but have played enough to know that in Rust you trust no one. I would advise any newb to start off in the smaller servers then when you have your bearings join an official one. It is more enjoyable when playing with others but can also be great fun whilst playing with oneself.I am intrigued as to how this game will evolve and when it does I shall update this review.8.5/10,Rust

My soulution is to play modded servers and pvp ones so you can release some stress.I love the concept of this game too not like many other survival games that you just run and collect stuff wasting your time failing to search.This game is a progress itself and sometimes being alone is the best thing to do.,Rust

2014-01-19,1,1,115,True,Recommended,"Rust is a completely open world survival game the only goal is to survive. With the game's current mechanics the way of doing that is simply killing animals building shelter from raw materials and banding with other players or hiding from them.Rust at the moment is in it's early stages of Alpha something you don't really see from commercialised games Facepunch have been very open with their plans for the game and as a result is has attracted a lot of fans and general survivalist players.It has several unique features that released survival games don't have which gives this alpha a cutting edge on other titles such as ""Infestation"". Players can communicate over VOIP and the structure crafting system allows you to build almost anything you want with anything you can it follows a very logical process of creating items. The world is open not greatly designed but it is an alpha at the end of the day. It has no map and it is very difficult to gather bearings without using large landmarks or creating them yourself.Like all games Rust has it's problems but for me none of those have been core issues. My issues with the game are ones that plan on being removed or changed in later versions for example The zombies are too fast Weapons are too easy to craft There is a lack of non firearm weaponsI've played this game with friends it runs like a charm. There were a few issues connecting to servers both official and community but overall the game ran well was quick to install and there is a very little lack of optimisation. Where there is a lack of optimisation there is a list of console commands provided by facepunch to remove those graphical issues to improve performance.Overall Rust has to be one of my favourite 2013 games the community is fun to be around the developers are so open to critisim and are easy to contact and they're open to suggestions.",Rust

You start out with the bare minimum a stone and a few bandages. However in time you can turn the bare minumum into an empire (Metal castle Full gear and the lovely res).

Although I will say that PVE is non existant in this game which is suppose to be a survival game which at this point it is not. The game at this point is just PVP arena where you build and get raided right away then leave or on the opposite side of the spectrum you build up so much you become overpowered against others making it boring. Still with all its flaws manages to be fun yet frustrating experience. Hopefully the Devs continue to fix the game so when it is released it has the whole experience PVP PVE Survival and all,Rust

2013-12-26,0,0,185,True,Recommended,"The first rule of Rust Never trust strangers!The second rule Make Metal doors!Imagine Minecraft and DayZ mixed together? While still in Alpha Rust brings a lot to the table (nothing new though). Weapons range from a simple bow to a powerful M4. What I most enjoy about Rust is that almost every item is craftable. This means that even if you lose your items to a bear or bandit then you can easily regain your losses. There is no single player in this game so if you plan on playing alone then you should probably stay away. You will not survive long if you're not with a group of trustworthy friends. There are hundreds of servers (although not all are full) to choose from so there will never be a problem with queues. I recommend playing on a low population server before diving into a high pop server since the map can get crowded with 100+ people. Unfortunately there are hackers present but I haven't run across many in my time. Always remember the first two rules of Rust!If you want to join my personal server then press F1 and type ""net.connect 23.239.109.130 28165""It's a 50 slot PVP server but there are active Admins to monitor cheating/bad manners.",Rust

If there is then it s about building a strong house fast become strong and raiding other players houses. But if there is not then it s more of a calm ""building your house in a forest"" kind of experience.I highly recommend it if you re looking for a surviving game with elements of building in it. Very fun game!",Rust

2016-07-02,2,1,66,True,Recommended,Product received for free. My friend bought this game in a 4 pack and was nice enough to give me a copy. So I loaded this baby up to see what all the fuss was about. I came to on a debris strewn coastline with not a damn thing on and anatomically correct lady bits (but I'm a guy???). I proceeded to explore my surroundings and found a wonderful pumpkin patch. I was pretty excited because who wouldn't be? I picked a few pumpkins and then noticed up stream there was a rickety old cabin type building. My curiosity got the best of me. I started making my way there when I heard a sound. In a fury I turned myself around rock at the ready. There standing before me was a man. But this was no ordinary man. It was the devil himself. Decked out in terrifying clothes no doubt made from the marijowannas. Atop his shoulders sat a carved out pumpkin. My heart sank. I knew it was the end for me. As he shot me in the face with his fully automatic crossbow I removed myself from my desk chair. Curled up into a ball. And began crying. My attacker must have heard this for all I heard after were the sounds of his terribly laughter. It will haunt me for the rest of my life.,Rust

2016-09-18,0,0,430,True,Recommended,I have to work for a living I have places to be gotta attend stuff.Every time I start this game I have to build everything up from scratch. I can't really see why I keep doing that. It's the same thing over and over again. Chop some wood farm cloth mine some stone and metal get a furnace cookin'. The fun lies in the element of surprise random encounters with other people unlikely friendships (I've made some) fair PVP battles (especially the bow is great) conversations in the chatbox getting lucky with airdrops finding good stuff. Every time I start playing this the basics are the same and repetitive. But the randomness the surprises reactions of other people that's what makes this game. Negative aspects are huge fully geared clans who will destroy everyhting you once loved in a heartbeat. But that's also a matter of picking the right server. If you've much time on your hands you could eventually be the king of the server. I will never be the king I'm always the hunter in the forest keeping an eye out for trouble around the corner. I really do love this game.,Rust
2016-09-18,0,0,612,True,Recommended,One of the best alpha games on steam in my opinion. Facepunch constantly keeps up with the updates and is adding more people to help with the rust project. My tip is tokeep up with the wipes and start on a server that wipes xp and map than start playing.,Rust

2016-07-31,0,0,1471,True,Not Recommended,Not suggested for Linux users. Works like crap. My system is old no doubt. But it'll run Skyrim with the settings around mid and a reasonable framerate (in windows) will play The Talos Principle in Linux at 1920x1080 with mid setting nearly flawlessly. Not this game though. Trying to see if it'll play under the same hardware in windows. No idea as to whether or not it will yet.

2016-05-01,0,0,1355,True,Recommended,This game IS fun don't get me wrong... I did have 72 hours like a week ago now i have about 140... I play this game because i think the pvp is good the community is funny and the game overall is fun yes... I will do pros and cons so lets get at it...Pros Alot of nice playersGood gameplayIt's repetetive but that feel when you get c4 and actually earn of it when you raid someone... &lt 3And probably one of the best survivals atmLoot system base building PVP PVE is so good i cant even explain it..Cons I remember i played this about 2 months ago and i got 60+ fps at 1080pNow i get 30 fps all low at 1080p so i dont play 1080p anymore...There's a quite bit of crashesNot alot of bugs but they're thereRust should do it so that you can turn off grass again as that literally boosts fps on some rigs with like 20 30 or just make it so that it doesn't ruin your preformance...Overall the cons are mostly preformance wise but gameplay wise the game is good...If you have an old rig then the fps is not that good but yeah.If you have a good rig then buy this if you like survival games that are intense...I give it a solid 8/10 when i get my new rig i will boost it to a 9/10 because of the crashes probably but yeah BUY IT,Rust

2016-05-10,1,1,62,True,Recommended,Basically if you die you lose pretty much everything. You can store a strongbox in a hut but they're destructable too and good luck appearing anywhere near them when you die unless you also have sleeping bags......which require animal skins...which require weapons to kill animals...which require staying alive for long enough to build tools collect resources build a hut a strongbox weapons kill 3 6 animals and fashion a sleeping bag before dying.GLWT.Took me a day to make a pair of pants and they were stolen within five minutes.Took me a week to build a hut and someone bashed the door in 30 seconds later killed me and looted my strongbox.Took me a month to build a stone hut with a wooden hut some distance away for backup and two sleeping bags.When I logged in the next day my wooden hut was gone and someone had beaten their way in and changed the locks on my stone hut.Who could have done such a thing? Someone with the kind of high level weapons you will never ever get in a world as hostile as rust.Back to the very beginning of the game by which I mean I went back to the point before it had been installed on my computer and I've never looked back since.It was definitely an interesting experience but I didn't learn much that I liked about myself or other people.,Rust

2016-06-09,1,1,1632,True,Recommended,Don't bother buying rust unless you are confident on being able to make friends ingame or have a friend or group of friends willing to play this with you.... Soloplaying rust is not as much fun as it is with teamwork and teamplay... you will be missing more of the fun and be more frustrated at others if you try to survive alone in cold and harsh world of rust.This is not dayz... even naked players can pull an AK out of their orthos slot... and theres no visual indication what person might have on him in his inventory... might it be a rock... bazooka... ak... grenade. Shoot first... check inventory... if hes clean you can rez him if you like.,Rust

2017-02-23,0,0,765,True,Recommended,I absolutely love this game .I recommend it to all of my friends IRL as I can . The building is phenomenal the map looks amazing there's endless amounts of things you can do from raiding to just trolling people . The main problem I see people have with this game is they say it's too toxic . What online pvp game isn't toxic . The only difference in rust is you're going to get taken advantage of as lose everything unlike other games where you can just carry on . It's very very hard at first there's so much to learn although it is a lot easier for noobs now no backwards walls harder to raid . Face punch is by far my favorite developers not only for the amazing game but also because they are working so hard to make it better every single week right on time with an update . I can't wait till Thursday to see what's new . If you aren't a and love survival games I suggest you buy this and become a pvp raiding clan killing legend .. If you are a and or don't like survival games I kindly suggest you off and go download league . It's free,Rust

It's probably the best multiplayer survival game out there. Very much like a more realistic advanced minecraft without the block like design. It has great fetures and potential. A very fun game to play with friends not very fun playing alone. I am giving it 9/10. The last point is due to bugs and a loading screen that takes forever.

I in general dont like to play games that arent fully finished but since my friend gifted this to me i decided to give it a shot. and almst 60 hours later in the timespan of 3 or so days i am completely hooked. Survival type of games are games im not too familar with with the exception of something like Amnesia but thats a completely different kind of survival. I hopped into a new server on Rust with only a rock a torch and 2 bandaids. Now i have all kinds of guns heaps of food and a pretty decent sized base that me and some other friends i met through the game now live in. The community is pretty friendly from what ive seen so far sure there's those particular people who go around killing people for no good reason but since its PvP you cant blame them. Either way i believe this has the chance of becoming a fantastic game and something i can see putting hundreds maybe even thousands of hours into. Even in its alpha stage i do believe the game warrants its $20 price tag and if youre a fan of these type of games youre missing you if you dont get this.,Rust
2014-03-11,1,1,509,True,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game for the mac but the overall better gsme in by opinion is DayZ but it is only avalable for windows.But keep in mind rust is cheaper and probably a bit easier to play. It is a great game.,Rust

2015-06-11,1,1,1131,True,Recommended,*After many updates and a small GPU investment i can now safely say that this is again a good game it is fun to play and there is alwayes someone to fight. If you think the games to slow go on a 10x server that to fast try a 3x. What ever you chose im sure youl find a way to have fun.Play time 700h+ (I had a diffrent account that i gave to my brother)Ok this game was amazing i repeat was amazing. I could run it on my potato at around 30 40fps. There were aton of grate plugins for servers the map was of fair size and loot could be found. If you liked the game loot how it was there where servers for that. If you wanted a more fast paced kind of game where you could jump in and get loot like that there where servers for that too. However there were a ton of bugs the bugs couldnt be fixed on the current engine so the develpers started the game again exept they took everything that made the old game good took a on it. Giveing us a map that was way to big loot that was no wear to be found and frame rates that unless you were running on a 700+ rig look like a playing with a flip book for a moniter. However this was ok because they gave you the choice to play the old rust on launch if you so wanted to but now they have scraped it completly turning the game that i once couldnt wait to get home and play in to a game i consider a waist of 15,Rust

I think it is about time that I write a review on this game since I have dedicated so much of my time towards playing. Rust is a game that I am willing to play I enjoy the grind as of the most recent update (blueprints V2) I think the game has improved a lot as before this update there were people roaming with AK s on the first day. I believe that rust is heading in the right direction as they release an update weekly and I am always keen to see what new feature they have released. All in all rust is a great game and I would recommend it to any one as it is unique and always being updated.10/10,Rust

2014-03-07,0,0,151,True,Recommended,"Its money worth and I didn't regret it so far.Positive Aspects Easy to learn simple game nothing too complicated in there Almost weekly updates Nice atmosphere High potential (Game's actual content is by 5 10%) Countless servers with different rules / plugins / community very ""free"" Gameplay very fun in interaction with other people Negative Aspects Still has some bugs (as game is in alpha) Decay on buildings can be molesting (specially on wooden ones) List of Community Servers can be confusing (too many incl. many empty ones) Can become boring quite fast if played soloThe game itself is supposed to be a survival game. Unfortunately this seems limited atm to ""survive"" against other players as once you have your basic stuff the environment isn't any danger anymore. At this point one must not forget that RUST still is under development and in early alpha so we still may expect alot more of content than it is by now.You better have a rather high frustration limit as this game might force you to start over again and again (and again ...) after being killed and raided. One should see this as a challenge or try one of the PVE Servers (there are also economy servers and such).So yes the game is actually pretty good specially for its alpha state and there's still much to expect from it in the future.And btw after me having the game my husband and my brother have bought it aswell after seeing me playing so I guess it can't be that bad )",Rust

2017-11-16,0,0,67,True,Recommended,"Where to start with this game.Skip to the end for summary.SYNOPSISYou wake up in a post apocalyptic world you have no idea where you are or who you are but your first thoughts go to survival with rock and torch in hand you start hacking away at a tree in hopes to create a shelter in so that you can survive just a little longer then BAM a bullet goes through your brain from the AK 47 of some guy dressed in road signs the last thing you hear are his taunts ""Noob Git Gid"" as your eyes close all you see are his balls slapping your face.You wake up in a post apocalyptic world you have no idea where you are or who you are when a very strong feeling of deja vu hits you with rock and torch in hand you set out to survive... Wait is that a naked guy with a pumpkin on his head?GRAPHICSDoes are sum nice tiddies fanservice aside the graphics in this game are really THICC... I mean nice. Jokes aside this game is not the prettiest nor is it the ugliest the style really does bring that post apoclyptic all around me is death hopeless feeling while still remaing rather nice to look at.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay feels kinda of clunky and THICC. The animations aren't the the greatest and kinda put me off but all other aspects of the gameplay are enjoyable. It is also not ver intuitive but it does bring that feeling of ""I don't know"" that you would have in a apocalypse so it kinda makes sense that you must fend for yourself. Finally getting a base set up and getting tons of resources only to have them stolen away you then rinse and repeat until you get strong enough to do the same to all the other people on the server.And yes that is the best feeling in the world stealing all the other people's phat lewt.WARNING THIS GAME IS GRINDY AND YOU NEED TO BE COMMITED TO IT.STORY AND LOREYou wake up in a post apocalyptic world you have no idea where you are or who you are but where the hell is that music coming from... you climb up a hill and find a guy singing dubstep. A spear goes through your neck.MULTIPLAYERThis game is all about that multiplayer. Sure you can go onto a server with no people and play by yourself but thats WEAK. The whole point of this game is to screw other people over while not being screwed over yourself this game is amazing multplayer if you have friends to play with otherwise you can just slave for a zerg clan or try to fend for yourself though that's almost never going to work it is still fun. It is extremely fun just to be toxic this game doesn't ban toxic people but instead encourages it. You could meet a nice guy so you follow him back home then he stabs you with a bone knife and takes your stuff. The community is straight up toxic but it doesn't even matter if anything that toxicity is what makes Rust Rust.CUSTOMIZATIONHey I don't remeber selecting to be a white chick oh wait you I can't chose? So this is my life now.Besides the non existent character creation you still get to have skins in this game and the cool thing about the skins is they are almost all created by the community Thank you community for this Turkey Rock we are about to recieve... To the head probably. MISC You need a mid to high range PC No tutorial though this does make the game more immersive Used to have zombies now has bears. THOSE F*CKING BEARS. Yo dawg we heard you like spawning so we put a base outside of your base so we can snipe you on your way out. More stranger things happen than Stranger Things. I spawned in the snowy part of the map and now i'm dead. EXTRA THICC Tanks and Pumpkins and Caveman Guns oh my!MY PERSONAL ENJOYMENTThis game is like an abusive uncle to me. Its cruel to me for my own good you soon toughen up to all the taunting that goes down and you soon start to enjoy it. The story is non existent but who cares?

2014-11-03,0,0,66,True,Recommended,"Ok there are a lot of reviews out there. Some say it's good others say it isn't worth the time or effort (at least the experimental version anyway). What do I say about the experimental version of Rust? I think it has potential. Yes I have had problems getting stuff to be placed I've had server crashes every 5 minutes but why do I continue to play? It is a question that I answer with it has the potential to be GREAT. Long have I searched for a pure survival game that isn't Minecraft (if you would consider that a ""survival game""). I wanted to be dropped into the world with nothing but the clothes on my back and my brain to survive. Then I found Rust where you don't even get the luxury of clothes on your back. I began foraging supplies then was attacked by a bear and died. I respawned on another side of the world where I again gathered resources only to find out I don't know how to open my inventory! Crap! This game is REALLY hardcore! It doesn't even give you a tutorial! After pushing a bunch of random buttons (primarily the ""I"" button) I discovered through forums that the inventory button is... CRAP! A wolf found me AFK and now I'm dead. I then respawned in the MIDDLE OF A DEN OF BEARS! I knew I had to either sneak or fight my way out! So I decided to go balls to the wall with my rock and began bashing a bear's skull in. I killed the bear only to die from severe bleading.These were the things that I wanted from a survival game and I got it in the Experimental Rust. Yeah we all know that Legacy is soo much better but hey give the developers a chance. We are playing as they are developing.Personally this game will stay in my steam library for a LONG LONG time! It's fun interactive hardcore creative buggy at times depending on what system you're running on but an overall awesome game.Unless the developers decide to give this game a story line.

2016-07-18,2,1,1,True,Not Recommended,I would like to note I am aware I have barely played this game. Let me explain why. There is no singleplayer and the multiplayer is terrible. If they could add a singleplayer the game would almost top most survival games. However you are forced to play with other players. Of which I should note. Are extremely hostile naked and will smack you with a rock y. I spawn after a lengthy load. As I spawn asleep I struggle to wake the up. After waking up and getting to land after sleeping in water I notice a naked man hitting a rock onto the top of a small shack. I watch him for a small amount of time before the roof breaks and he falls in. I try to go inside to see if he is okay. He chases me with a rock for three hundred years. As I travel or should I say flee. I pass many terribly built structures and finally pass a group of three naked women I stop to admire and than I got smacked by a rock. Bleeding badly. I fled into a river to find a new naked man spying on the naked women looking around for the evil naked man chasing me and not seeing him I spy with him.

2015-10-04,0,0,1035,True,Recommended,Brutal but seems to be a better choice over H1Z1 or ARK considering the price and decent optimisation. The game doesn't succumb to survival cleches like zombies but instead focuses on the conflicts and peace between the players by implementing several mechanics for attacking and defending bases but also sharing houses and territory with other players.Edit Try modded if you're solo.

2016-01-19,2,1,273,True,Recommended,"If there ever was a metaphor for crack addiction this game personifies it best. Also I'm sure they modeled this game off of Somalia.Firstly if you spawn into a server already well on it's way you will HATE this game. You WILL BE TROLLED over and over and over and OVER (get the point) again. People in this game will make you hate humanity until you realize that this game was designed as an outlet for all those children bullied throughout their pathetic lives. And by children I mean 5 year olds who just heard the F word for the first time and won't stop repeating it until their voices go horse. Once you get passed that and find someone who will let you live long enough to put some pants on you will begin to see the charm of this game.At first you will say ""I will rise above the trolls and griefers I will not be a dirty turd and p0wn n00bs (over and over and over again). I have standards higher than this I am a member of the HUMAN RACE after all!"". However this WILL change this game WILL change you! Eventually when you get an ax you will begin to grind said ax on anything and anyone within swinging distance. The ax will lead to bows/arrows and then to guns grenades rockets land mines ect. Oh this will not suffice however soon YOU WILL BECOME THE TROLL. Your favorite food will be the tears of your enemies and the screams coming from the piles of nakeds just outside your door will be the only music you can sleep to at night. Yes you are now the monster you feared you'd become. At least you can paint peacful paintings on your wooden sign outside your home hiding the shame and disgusts learking inside.This game is addicting I now find myself tea bagging random strangers in real life.

2016-03-06,1,1,1029,True,Recommended,"For a game that is currently at its Alpha Stage I find it sensational (9/10).Initially I found it quite difficult to get started with but after approximately 100 hours of game play I felt I had a genuine grasp of the game. The real hook for me was the 'time investment' factor into to tasks and how ruthless/fragile the game can be. A perfect example was when I first started I spent a solid 2.5 hours gathering timber and stone to prep a base / I then spent 30 minutes crafting boxes / shelves and upgrading my base to stone until I realised I required a Furnace to generate Metal Fragments to create a Sheetmetal Door + Code Lock. Hence I had to venture out and hunt local animals to acquire the animal fat (for low grade fuel) to produce the furnace and after about 45 minutes of hunting I had attained enough cloth and animal fat for 3 furnaces (of course now I am far more efficient). On my venture back I was attacked from an absolute savage camping in a bush with a pipe shotgun and then polished off with an arrow to the spine only moments from my front door. To my grief the key to my wooden door was taken by the savage he then accessed my front door killed me as I awoke from my sleeping bag then hacked at my sleeping bag before I respawned and cleared my building rights.I swelled with Rage but then moments laughed it off ""reminding me that it s just a game.""My cheeky brain then took over from the disgust of what just happened and realised thatthe 2.5hours of gathering + 30minutes of setting up + 45minutes hunting and then being assassinated took up 3hrs &amp 45 minutes of my time just like that.. Giving that filthy wanka 3.75hrs of my hard earned effort... i.e. 3.75hours ""time investment"" for me became +3.75 for the savage stranger in literally 2 minutes. **I then punched my dog my wall and my family portrait in fury**This forced me to ironically 'adapt' 'evolve' my early game play style to a. Box out my tool box so no others can access it even when my base is breached (unless extreme measures are used)b. Create an airlock to my base (second layer of passage for those who don't know the expression)c. Bury a small stash in a secret location before doing my errands so that if I am killed before returning there is no risk of my base being breached (this of course a temporary measure until I acquire my code lock and metal door)d. Do not annotate on my map the exact location of my base so that I am not tracedetc etc etc.Long story short this is the best survival game I ve played It truly is cruel and rewarding and can be addictive so don't get too involved.I do recommend this game for 16years + as it requires a higher degree of logic and ""mental prowess"" to be successful as a solo player.For those who are wondering l too have become a filthy wanka .",Rust

I have about 250 hours logged on the game that I have owned for nearly the entire life of the game. I have played on and off since it came out and currently I feel like the game is a much improved version of when in first came out. I read the road map and I like the idea of the XP and level system/skill system. I think it would be interesting if you would grant certain skills or XP for those players with a lot of play time or have owned the game for a long time like myself. A little perk for those who have been here since the start through good times and bad times )As for my opinion of the game I originally purchased it with 3 other friends not a month or so after the release. When the game got too intensive for my one friends Mac and the game began to take shape of what it is today we drifted away disappointed of what it was becoming. Fast forward a year from then and whole lot of progress from the developers team and we get to where we are now back to a game that is fun to play and in my opinion well worth my original $20.",Rust

2014-09-21,0,0,79,True,Recommended,the game is realy horrid when geting started because everyone in the game is just either a squeeker who follows you or a bandit (95% of the time its a bandit) and you just constantly die straight after you get a glimmer of hope that you may just soon get established on the server. so you have your little shack with the wooden door and you have your fire going to cook the chicken you collected from pigs and you have a bed down as a spawn poing and your little wooden crate to store your loot and mabie even a bow as a defence. But suddenly you hear footsteps outside on your roof and circling around your base. ITS BANDITS! your not sure what to do sit and wait or do you be a man nut up and go outside to defend your small semi established kingdom you call home? ofcourse you just be a about it and stay in the base because who are you kidding you have a pair of pants on and a rock to defend your sorry the bandits start hiting the door with their hatchet and you tell them to leave you they say no. you offer them everything you have for exchange for your pathetic life. they decline and simpily disreguard your cries for salvation. the break the door down they kill your helpless strugling half naked vessel you call a body and take what little gear you own and break your bed. you respawn where are you? you dont know but what you do know is that you have to start again but this time you will get bigger and better until one day you have established yourself succesfuly and you make yourself the king of the server the richest raider that ever lived the most dangerous bandit to come across. all until one day you get raided your base has all its doors replaced and you have to start from the begining.,Rust
2015-05-15,0,0,860,True,Recommended,"Ultimate Survivalgame! Playing from the early start when Rust (Legacy) was just started on steam.I loved the way it develops i run multiple servers for Rust Legacy and Rust Experimental and i will keep doing this until the client reaches RC state ( or maybe longer?) .The game is still in Alpha stage and gives the player so much fun being a survivalist in the early state after a apocalypse.From running with a rock to hunt down animals gather resources to build your home or tools that makes you gather easier so you can build more and more ( think of Tools/Guns/Ammo/Buildingparts/Usable items).Till hunting down other players to raid their bases and take all their stuff so you can move up the chain of eaten or be eaten only the strongest will survive!

2014-02-12,1,1,82,True,Recommended,The game is simple and easy to play yet harsh with the various radiation zones that litter the landscape. New players will often get lost fairly easily in game but with the help of the 'road' and hopefully friendly players new players will be able to get up and have fun. That being said most servers are PVP and players are rather more bandit then friendly they often shoot first and loot second for new players a PVE server to better understand the game is far better. Sometimes when your not careful the game becomes a harsh and unforgiving environment and the struggle to survive becomes more apparent which personally is a great reminder that Rust is survival game at its coreOverall with the harshness but also rewarding experience players will love the detail and at times complexity of RustWould recommend 10/10,Rust

The sheer amount of stuff you can do is staggering. Want to get a few friends and farm for endgame gear? I've done it and it was a blast. Want to hop around on servers messing arond? That too. Everything that can be done in this game can be done in its own way that's so much fun. It's easily some of the best fun I have ever had playing a game and I don't think that most of the stuff that happens in Rust can happen anywhere else.10/10.,Rust
2016-06-23,0,0,170,True,Recommended,"in the video ""your first"" day of rust"" they should have had (get killed and all your stuff taken and start again) but to be real i have had this for a long time good and bad hours back in the old legacy days of rust... it has definently improved alot and i cant wait to see what else they do.pros beautiful looking game good combat crafting systems and a good game that u can either casual play or go full balls deep in gamecons community community and the glitches that happen every once in awhile and maybe a few more but there isnt to much to complain about... when legacy first died off rust just sat there slowly dieing.. then all of a sudden they started almost from scratch on a new version of rust and ever since then u can go look at devblogs and they update it a good amount and its always fun to play as a game in a whole i would rate this 8.5/10 it isnt the perfect game at this moment yet.....but i hope that it will be on top of the survival genre soon.... and if you read other review yes u will possibly lose everything to some bandits.... but if u care that much about it either never go offline or never play survial games cause that IS a part of it is that risk",Rust

2016-11-27,0,0,598,True,Recommended,This game is not for the feint hearted. It is going to kick your and beat you down. It is full of people who want nothing more than to blow into your house murder you and take everything you worked so hard for. The community is nothing short of sperglords and trolls. And that is why I love it. People whine and cry about roof campers and naked hunters and KOS. But this is a game of resource wars it should be expected. But this game is built in such a way that a naked with a few spears can take down a full kitted guy with a well placed headshot. Got a huge clan on the server? Place cabnets around their base and raid their external cabnets. Make them frustrated. Make them squirm.Those who are skilled and smart will thrive in this game if you have the determination. But this game is not for everyone. Be it the game itself or the community this is not a place for your feelings. So take your fifi's and put them away for a few hours.,Rust

2017-02-24,0,0,818,True,Recommended,So pushing 800 hours I can give you a solid review. Playing this game solo is hard. You will get rolled over and over again by 3 5 man roaming squads. BUT playing solo is more satisfying as well... I mean EVERYTHING you have you earned yourself. Makes pvp more thrilling. I would recomend roleplaying ( talking to random people using the in game mic ) and getting cool with people in the game to start off. Like I said before playing the game solo is fun yet hard but I feel playing this game with a friend or 2 makes it just TOO fun. building up a big base together defending that base when a zerg clan tries to shoot 20+ rockets at your base as you kill people and repair up and keep them at bay go to sleep KNOWING you killed all those baddies but wake up in the morning to see they just came back 3 hrs later when you were sleeping and took everything!Hahah no lie this game is fun. Mastering the Recoil has never been more fun. If you love Risk vs Reward play with a VERY competative pvp scene then this is the game for you. KILL ON SIGHT. NO ONE IS FRIENDLY. TRUST NO ONE. Those are the 3 laws of the land on Rust. ENJOY!,Rust

2014-02-11,1,1,13,True,Recommended,"Gotta remember this is in ""alpha"". With that in mind the game is solid. You'll die alot and you'll see the worst of mankind in the other players. Thats kinda the point though. At the moment the game doesn't have much in the way of long term play value. Even if you are one of the first in a fresh server and can build your castle you'll eventually bore of the limited crafting options and PVE elements. In time I'm sure the ""Rust"" design team will fix that. For now you can spend a good weekend as a barbaric caveman.",Rust

Btw another game called 7 days to die basically same idea as rust but more progressed then rust is currently. please do a better job then them cause it looks good but has many things that look stupid to me.

2015-06-18,1,1,751,True,Recommended,The Rust community is cancer 1% of the people you meet will be friendly the rest will kill you when they see you even if you don't have anything they will still kill you but that is what pvp is about. I like this game alot but being killed everytime you spawn in and run somewhere and try to establish the base gets boring after the 3rd when you lose everything over and over,Rust
2015-06-19,1,1,281,True,Recommended,"Ok so Rust.Rust is a very time consuming game. You start off with a rock and a torch and basically need to gather resources and set up a home and satisfy your hunger/thirst. This game is basically Minecraft and DayZ thrown into a mix up but with better gameplay than both. This game is very frustrating as you will come across teams of players that get quite large in Rust I have made 50 friends in 192 hours. Pros Crafting Crafting does take time and requires a fair amount of time to get resources but is one of the better aspects of this game.PvP PvP in Rust is great it is very annoying but is great fun. It takes time to actually get good at Rust PvP and the excuse ""I am really good at CSGO"" does not apply with this FPS game.Hunting In the early stages of this game hunting was quite easy and simple as even if you spooked the animal it would only run 10m or so away but in the newer updates it has picked up quite a lot more animals have been added and when you shoot/wound an animal you either hope you kill it there and then or you try and follow it as it runs away and bleeds out however if you do not follow the animal there is a good chance your going to lose it seeing as they actually run away now.Community The Rust community is mixed it has it's good and bad. I am fortunate enough to have met around 50 good players in Rust that I now call mates. People have a way of trading gear not shooting on site and healing random players when killing them by mistake. Food So the food aspect of this game is fairly basic you eat and your food bar fills. However the greatest part of Rust is when you kill your first horse boar or even deer and realise. You just harvested Wolf meat. It is always fun too kill a horse and cook up some Wolf meat from it.Cons Cheating Rust Legacy is now basically dead and the few that remain are mostly hackers as the amount of free cheats for Rust Legacy that COMPLETELY up gameplay for others is incredible. Valve no longer protects Legacy as they once did which grants 80% of the Rust community too cheat and avoid a VAC ban. However it is very easy too catch these cheaters I reccomend not wasting your time on Legacy. There is obviously cheats for Experimental for those who are willing too pay for hacks such as HelioS or Iniuria but even then admins are very good.Abuse Of course every game that requires anybody to start a server and become admin has admin abuse Rust is not as bad as some games such as Minecraft or plain old Counter Strike but it is still there in my time on Rust I have seen admins spawn in 250 airdrops at once crash servers ban players without testing harrass and abuse players and kill in God mode. Unfortunately there is nothing anybody can do about this but it is there on the odd server.Rust overall is a game that will keep you on the edge and have you tense in frustration. The sound is great and it is always fun too go down too the beach and get chased away by 7 people screaming ""Allah Akbar"" into their mics. In Rust you have the ability to build hunt engage in PvP gather take players hostage trade raid make mates or just simply play forever alone and make yourself a hill top mansion.I really reccomend Rust despite the negative reviews from players who may be experiencing FPS lag problems with cheaters not a proper understanding of the game or even just not their type of game. If you enjoy games like H1Z1 DayZ or The Forest I believe you will enjoy Rust. It has come a long way since it's original release date and I still believe has a lot of potential. I reccomend you have a decently good PC as Rust does require a fairly good processor and video card too run it smoothly keeping that in mind I ran Rust fairly smooth on around 19 FPS using a HP Laptop with AMD A4 6210 APU with AMD Radeon R3 Graphics 1.80GHzInstalled Memory (RAM) 8.00GB (6.94 Usable)System Type 64 Bit Operating System x64 Bases ProcessorI hope this review helps you decide whether or not you wish too buy Rust and have fun.",Rust

2015-07-20,0,0,583,True,Recommended,This review was a joke review I'll try to do my best to make it an actual review.First off Rust is a survival game you have to invest time into my review will be broken into 3 sections Survival Crafting/Building and the PvP.Survival The survival aspect of Rust is what makes it challenging the Hunger and Thirst can get you when you least expect it to.The godly animals that can warp from the ground to a rock they are standing next to are hard to hunt but yield good rewards.Each tool you use in order to gather resources is different PickAxes are used to break down Nodes you find around Rock clusters to gain Stone Metal Sulfur and High Quality metal ores.Hatchets are used to gather Wood.The best way to gather leather and animal fat in this game is with bone knives.If you use a wrong tool(for example hatchet on a node) your aim will shift up by a considerable amount.Crafting/Building The Crafting and Building part of this game is what requires you to invest time into the game.Crafting takes time unlike other games and the materials required for certain weapons and armour are hard to find.The buildings you make are always vulnerable They can either be taken down with C4 or Rockets.There are a variety of building parts to choose from that may or may not make your building more resistant to explosives or gunfire.The best part about building in Rust is the Stability system.Stability ranges from 0% to 100% 100% being the most stable.PvP The PvP aspect of this game makes it all the more thrilling.There are a variety of weapons to choose from from Clubs made from broken Femurs to modern day Light Machine Guns.I won't go into depth with all of these weapons.You know how Counter Strike has Recoil patterns? Rust has them too but the Horizontal recoil(The one that goes left and right) is completely RnG. There is a bit of luck to controlling yourRecoil in this game.The hunting bow is probably the hardest ranged weapon to master in this game it shoots slow moving projectiles but is highly rewarding when you hear that headshot hitsound. Best of all it is a default weapon you don't need to learn it to craft it.The Crossbow is a non default weapon which means you have to find it from blueprint pages or barrels scattered accross roads and monuments. It is way better than the hunting bow since it fires the arrows faster and has more base damage.Over all this game gets a 7/10 for me there are some optimization issues but anyone with a computer made within 5 years can run this game at atleast 30 fps.,Rust

2015-12-30,0,0,1412,True,Recommended,Rust is truly a standout top notch survival game. The gameplay coupled with the freedom to play however you wish lends itself to highly emergent and immersive gameplay scenarios. Thi is the best survival game hands down but this just isn't for survival game enthusiasts. This game belongs in EVERY FPS fan's library. It's easily worth the modest price of entry. The replay value is limitless. I've gotten my money's worth 100 times over.On top of everything Facepunch Studios has displayed incredible gumption in the face of critique after they scrapped Legacy Rust but what emerged (Rust in it's current form made from the ground up!) is absolutely amazing. They have shown an awe inspiring level of attentiveness to the community. Their work ethic with respect to constand updates and bug fixes and their dedication to making this game truly great is exceptional. Development has been 100% transparent throughout the duration of development leaving its users secure in the game's future. In kind it has improved markedly every step of the way. Facepunch is THE company that every other company should model their Early Access titles after. If you don't own Rust you should. Start with a couple of friends and dive in head first. You won't regret it.,Rust

2016-01-01,0,0,1626,True,Recommended,Best survival game I've found to date.What I like Raiding is pretty balancedSleeper function is a really cool and innovative ideaPvP is great. Gunplay feels awesome besides the shaky holo sights *This has been FIXED. Holo sights work great now* . Guns are very well balanced.Building is fantastic. Quite a lot of customizationLots of different servers to fit your play style. Spawn timers are balancedSleeping bags allow you to spawn your friends in from deathCrafting menu is intuitive and easy to use once you get the hang of it.Weekly updates and the developers are really on top of their game. Best communication from devs I've ever seen.What I don't like PvE content is lacking. Animals etc are not a threat. They did just buff bears though and they are quite mean now.No vehicles..yetPoorly optimized but progress is being made on that frontArmor in my opinion is completely imbalanced. Face masks completely negate most headshots. Armor makes no sound while sneaking.Quarries afk farm for you and are pretty efficient.,Rust

2016-01-01,1,1,1118,True,Recommended,This game gets a good review BUT BE WARNED! I do not recommend the vanilla version of the game! You will spend a whole 24 hours in real life just to get set up for example if you go raiding the total time required to craft a single c4 from scratch is almost 27 minutes ALSO! you will need a whole c4 more just to break a stone wall.. which most people have and more walls behind that! and on top of that you will need raiding essentials like guns clothes armor ammo which would take AGES! Unless you like extreme survival frustration risk and time consumption i recommend modded servers. Don't be discouraged when i say moded. It involves no work other than joining the server. The gather rates are higher and you instant craft this means in some 8 times gather servers you could be up and raiding in a half hour! Compared to the hours you will spend working and dying in vanilla. This is all considering you have blueprints. Now what are blueprints? A blueprint is simply learning how to craft something all advanced things require these such as C4 rockets guns base defences etc blueprints can drop or you may get fragments which help in the research of Blue prints.. Upon this whole mess moded servers drop more blueprints and fragments while vanilla has it pretty difficult. Now i do recommend this game in moded version. Its very fun and addicting. I would recommend it giving vanilla 4/10 and moded 9/10 ),Rust

2014-03-27,0,0,360,True,Recommended,Buy this game immediately So I've been playing Rust for a while and I definitely say that no matter what this game in Alpha is better than most fully complete survival games on the market. It makes other games in the survival genre boring and lackluster by comparison. Rust is a beautiful game with incredible graphics even on the lowest setting. It has a lush and vibrant landscape with majestic mountains and an even lovlier sunrise and sunset. Rust is the kind of game I can't get mad at no matter how many times I've been raided or killed. Rust could easily ascend to be the next Game of the Decade upon release (or at any point thereafter). My friends and I are always ready to sit down and enjoy some delicious Pig Chicken and be ready for our next great adventure in the untamed wilderness that is Rust.10/10,Rust

2014-03-27,0,0,115,True,Recommended,"Rust away Previously in Rust I was playing the game with zombies instead of the bloody (or red) animals. I have also logged on after the update that replaced the zombies and I have to say I'm a little torn yet I understand why they want to do the natural survivalist game seeing as every game seems to be a zombie game now a days (not a complaint). This will be mostly the general game play setting and feel of Rust. So as a brand new naked guy that is spawned in the middle of nowhere yea that's right butt naked born from mother earth herself as if a miracle had just bloomed a huge horned flower that blossomed into you. You start by running and harvesting materials from animals trees and rocks if your smart. If your not smart you'll run until you find someone that is going to kill you or you'll run far away from a bunch of hostile animals but let's pretend your smart. So as you gather materials you will probably start wondering ""what am I doing with my life""... in the game I mean. Well you can open your inventory up and as far as now you look center top of the screen and you will notice a tab named ""crafting"". Curious? Click it. You'll find a list on the right side of your screen pops up. This is a full list of things you can create once you click an item it will drop a material and quality list below that. Now that I've tricked you Ill make you aware that out in the open world those red animals I mentioned occasionally drop ""loot bags"" that may contain things like ""blueprints"" which if used with an item that is not in your crafting list will create a spot for that item as well as include materials and quantity. Also in towns or civilian buildings you will find chests that can contain the same things. Typically better loot as well as a higher quantity. Once you've gotten further down the line in the game you'll have a house and some things inside that house. Maybe you'll also have chosen to wear some clothes. Whatever it is you'll find that the game kind of ends once you have found and learned to craft all items in the sense that there isn't really any story to the game yet. Who said you need a story to play a game though? Altogether this game has a very exciting and expandable foundation for what could be one of the best survivalist crafting games of it's gen!",Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,56,True,Not Recommended,"There are two ways to play Rust (in its current state). Spoiler alert both of them suck.Currently the game can be broken down into several phases. In the first phase you wake up naked in a field with nothing but a rock a torch and some bandages and must learn how to survive in a harsh world full of things that will make quick work of you if you give them the chance. Luckily you've apparently received survival traing from Bear Grylls himself and after a couple days of hunting gathering and drinking your own you'll find yourself fully clothed sufficiently housed and probably armed. Now begins the fun part!In this next phase you run around aimlessly gathering materials and killing zombies raiding abandoned towns for loot and hoping every time that you'll get something extraordinary. Mostly you won't but the variety between smacking rocks with a pickaxe and becoming an expert zombie hunter is enough to keep you doing it until you find something great. That special something is of course your first real gun. And what can you do with that gun? Of course you can kill more zombies and continue on your present course or if you're so inclined you COULD be a total .As I mentioned before there are two ways to play this game. What I've described above is for the most part the friendly way to play. Being that this is an online only game you will undoubtedly run into other players and you will be given the choice of how to deal with them. The friendly option is to help them if they need it or leave them alone if they don't. But there's a small problem with that being friendly is how you lose the game.I'm reminded of a team building exercise designed to be employed in offices and other workplaces in which the group of interest is divided into two teams unable to communicate with each other and a game is played in turns. Each turn of the game each team must make a choice Red or Blue. If both teams choose Red both teams will receive points. If both teams choose Blue both teams will lose points. However if one team chooses Red and the other Blue then the one that chose Red will lose double points and the one that chose Blue will gain double points. Obviously the best option for the whole is both teams always choose Red and everybody wins. But the best option for one team is to always choose Blue counting on the other team to choose Red and completely them over. (If you look into this experiment you'll find that almost without fail teams choose Blue repeatedly and both teams lose.)In the end Rust is just a very complex version of this game. The Red way to play the game is to gather resources build a fortress to secure your valuables and be nice and helpful to everybody who comes your way. This is beneficial to everyone and nobody suffers. Except you of course when you are surrounded by people playing the Blue way which is to let all the Red players grind away at resource gathering and break into their houses / kill them to steal their things. Obviously this is the easiest way to gain access to rare things but you do sacrifice some of the experience of the game if you choose to play this way. Also you're a person.Understandably this is a part of the game. This is not something that was overlooked. It was definitely intentional that this trust problem exist in the game as a part of the experience. Much like the real world the fastest way to the top is by stepping on other people but unlike the real world there are zero consequences to your negative actions other than possibly getting bored with the game faster than you otherwise would. Further it is frighteningly easy to play this way. Structures are not easily built for defense and any things that provide deterrent to other players can usually be bypassed with minimal effort. And even so regardless of what you do you will almost certainly lose everything you have to someone else. The only sustainable defense against other players is to never be around them and in a game with no Single Player mode that won't last very long.I get it. It's not a complete game. Although I find myself wondering if it's not a complete game then why the hell did I pay $20 for it? Because I'm an idiot of course. ""Early Access"" is a sugary way of saying ""Public Alpha "" which is a short way of saying ""I know this is utter but please pay for it now instead of when it's worth any amount of money promise you'll enjoy seeing us change everything you came to love about it. Management""Conclusion Don't bother with this game until it's much more fleshed out. Hopefully the developers will address the social issues of the game that make it so unrewarding to play but I'm not holding my breath.",Rust

2014-03-28,1,1,50,True,Recommended,Rust is a fickle game where you will have your ups and downs. its all a matter of many key factors are you playin by yourself? or with friends? are you on a server where the denizens are friendly or are the the kind of people who will kill on sight. (KOS for those who are new to the survival genre.) usually your life when you start outs a 50 50 chance but as you catch on and you get with a good group of friends everything comes kinda naturally. Its an incredible game for an alpha and its one you can put a lotta time into. Youll have some good times some bad times some horrid times where you feel like rage quitting and others where you feel on top of it all. I am eager to see where facepunch studios decides to take this game ) sure its not the prettiest game but this games got whatta lot of modern and pretty looking games nowadays have challenge and charm. All in all its a fun and addicting game that i can see myself putting many more hours into and i cant wait to see what the future holds for rust. ) (P.S. it isnt a rust review without mentioning the naked men and rocks) D,Rust

After 60 hours of play I havent seen a single hacker but the more populated servers can certainly hold a few. Met a number of cool people and starting an entire neighbourhood can be delightfully entertaining while you build from the ground up and fend off would be raiders. There is a solid learning curve but once you get the hang of it it is a blast. Just make sure that when somone tells you that ""Alt+f4 gives you infinite resources"" you don't take their advice. The playerbase can be exceptional or frustrating. Find a server that works for you.Oh and deer drop chicken meat. 10/10",Rust

The people are a**holes. You can't do a server alone or for just you and your friends. And you cannot play offline. My experiences in this game have been horrible. I haven't been able to accomplish a single thing because all the other players keep deciding that they need to kill me for no reason. I understand it's part of the game. But at the sametime I feel there should be an offline type feature to prevent you from losing all your hard work and to avoid the people who only aim to kill you and beat you down. So... All in all I love this game but do NOT recommend it to people who do not have any patience to deal with a**hole players. But... if you enjoy the aspect behind the game and can handle dealing with said a**hole players you should buy it and support this company. They made a great product.,Rust

2015-09-25,0,0,189,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a survival game in which you must gather resources and craft items in order to survive. But sadly there is an element of human interaction which can be both friendly or hostile. You will soon find that everyone is HOSTILE. I do not know why but other players rarely if ever show reciprocity. It is quite demeaning to spend 2 hours building a base and crafting for it to just get destroyed by rage kids with rocket launchers. This game has a nice concept despite its good intentions other players are a large error factor which ruins a good game. I am displeased at best by this game it runs terribly on a GTX980 with a lot of frame dips. After doing some research I found that it is poorly optimised for most newer systems. So if you have a 980 970 780 770 you will not be able to run this game as smoothly as you should. I am very disappointed by this game it is a good game but the players are the most unlikeable holes you will ever encounter. Most players kill other players just because they are unable to defend themselves. I can only imagine those trigger happy players and anti social sociopath with little empathy and respect for others work and effort. I do not blame the developer for the players but I blame him (the developer) for the poor optimization. To summarise This game runs poorly on $1895 PC's The players are malevolent vindictive bullies with no respect for others Its overpriced and over rated. It makes my blood boil with rage. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO GET ANNOYED BY ARROGANT SOCIO PATHS.

2017-06-23,0,0,2141,True,Not Recommended,"The team stretches itself way too thin. We had promises of cars electricity PVE bosses NPC's ... Instead we keep getting new guns and gunplay reworks. They want AAA quality game without AAA budget and team sizes. For the same reason optimization is horrible everytime they optimize anything a new update destroys it. The game's performance keeps going down and down. Everytime I loot someone every time I open inventory everytime I fire everytime I do anything... Game freezes for a couple of seconds which makes it impossible to fight. No it's not my pc I could run it at 60FPS when It entered Experimental. I can't get it to go over 30 now. It's marketed as a Sandbox game but everything revolves arround PVP. Forget all the new things that were promised here's changes to gunplay. If you don't want to get wiped out as solo or a small group by a large clan you have to play it as much as a part time job. Now for the PVP. It used to be that hard hitting full auto guns (ak and m249) were hard to controll at full auto. So pretty much usless to full auto unless really close. You had to tap fire. But now even with the AK it's better to just spray and pray. And the person with better luck with the RNG wins. Which I welcome since no with my terrible FPS I can actually stand a chance. Doesn't matter if i can't see what I'm doing while my game is frozen I just hold LMB and hope for the best. Which is what my mates who can actually run the game do as well. The devs stopped making a game they wanted but focus on listening to the vocal majority. Thing is vocal majority is the group of people who have something they don't like about the game. The people who like it don't have much to say. ""hackers are only on official servers"" No they just got better at toggling on others. Haven't seen one since 2016 tho. And the main reason I hate this game the grind. Or better yet how much time you have to sink into it. It's no longet a weekend fun like it used to be in Legacy the game now requires you to literally ignore all other games drop countless hours into it and still can't even deliver fun. Everything's a chance get offline? Might get raided. Go gather for hours? Might get sniped. The same thing that added to the PvP also makes the game unwieldy exhausting and utterly tiring to play.

I unfortunately chose paper while he chose scissors.

2014-03-02,1,1,486,True,Recommended,"Possibly the best game I'll ever play. I'll list the pros and cons after I write an over all summary. MAKE SURE YOU READ CON #2Summary Amazing shooter/survival game some un realistic elements which take you out of the zone and some uber realistic elements which are so real they're a bit disturbing (such as puking/bone breaking noises). Definitely not a completed game but they've made this clear to us repeatedly. Considering this is still in Alpha definitely a 10/10. Incredibly early stage game and they would have to do something really wrong and stupid to screw up this package of awesomeness they've created. 10/10Pros 1 Actively updated2 Plenty of different types of servers some with modifications some with low populations some with high3 Never run out of things to do4 Extremely realistic except for buggy stuff which isn't intended (it's in alpha can't blame em)5 Guns sound insanely realistic not like the movie gunfire or reload sounds but the guns here have that realistic sound which people who have never handled a gun would think sounds like a ""light plastic gun"". Only in movies do guns sound like roaring machines that are %100 solid.6 The vomiting sounds and the sounds you make when you break a bone appear to be so realistic it makes me a little sick and puts me on the edge of my seat. I haven't really heard many bones break in my life but this is what I can imagine it sounding like if the break was severe.... And boy does it sound nasty.Cons 1 On most servers with a population of over 15 players on at a time the majority of the players are incredibly hostile and will kill you on sight. 2 Because of reason 1 the game turns in to more of a first person shooter rather than a survival game once you move on from the early stages which can be considered a pro if that's what you're in to. Only listing it as a con here because the trailers/screenshots don't hint to this at all when in fact this is the reality. This is %80 a first person shooter game once you build your base etc (whch can take a very long time depending on how sneaky you are since you have to be very sneaky around other people to avoid being shot in the face).3 Incredibly buggy and not many items considering the possibilities. This is only because of Alpha though.4 Water seems to be non existant I've never seen it and even if it existed it doesn't have any uses such as to quench thirst. Again I'm assuming this is because of Alpha5 Animal sounds are incredibly un realistic and for some reason they can't jump... And since when can a human sprint for 20 minutes out running a wolf?",Rust

If I have any tips from experience for new comers that don't want to grind and build would be to play in a ""rocks to riches"" playstyle with a couple mates.

2014-02-16,0,0,742,True,Recommended,"I have over 180 hours played of this game. That was before the feburary 6th update to which ruined the game. The game was fun and had a lot of appeal as a zombie survival game. The game was advertised as a zombie survival game and they removed them. This was all done under the guise of their ""early access game"" statements. They state ""this is in very early development"" ""things will change"" or ""Some things work some things don't we haven't totally decided where the game is headed"". The problem with this is that zombies did work. The only problem they posed was that they conficted with the lead developer's vision of the game (Garry from Garry's mod). This is where things really rub me the wrong way. The game is first advertised as a zombie survival game and now in an instant it isnt. All because one person decided he didnt want zombies! The comminuty of this game wanted zombies to stay but instead the developer did what ever they wanted. They took people's money and then gave everyone the proverbial middle finger. The updates they have added in the last few months have been lackluster at best. They changed what sounds your footsteps make THREE times (what a waste of time!). They added more items that have the same function of already existing items (sleeping bag vs. bed or revolver vs. 9mm). The only true update that has any merit is the update that changed how gathering materials works. Thats FIVE months of useless updates! During which they made enough money from the sales of the early access to develop a whole other game! The game has hit a very low point in gameplay after the feb 6th update so if you still intend on plaything this game do not expect to see the same gameplay you may of seen online. And as their ""Early Access Game"" states ""things will change"" so dont buy into the game if you intend on loving it initially.",Rust

2017-03-21,0,0,376,True,Not Recommended,this game is a ing chore if you play solo.it was fun at first.it was fun to get some good play time in while most peeps were logged off.but then I realized it became a nagging little . to play solo or to play as a casual gamer and invest my free time hard earned dollars I realized that this is such a drag. It's such a grind. I had taken a long hiatus from the initial launch and felt like picking it up again after playing subsistence. Like I said it was fun for a moment there. Game mechanics + game mechanics * raiders waste of time. There's better survival games on the market.the game has potential. somethings are cool like building and some skirmishing. but placing items that don't want to go the ground the tiered leveling of walls is incongruent with the amount of cost it takes. To that effect i find it eternally easier to find rocket parts to destroy than it is to find gears to make the sufficient armored counterparts. So in a nutshell. This is not a game to played solo. You will simply get out played if two or more people have their mine put to it against you. Never mind the stupid t aspects of the game that come off as lazy add content fix bugs later.I think if I could give this a neutral I would and that'd be a fair opinion. Unfortunately for some reason we still don't have that option (despite the reviews of games can show negative/neutral/positive).

2014-04-26,0,0,761,True,Recommended,I like this game quite a lot it s a good idea however it has a long way to go. The lack of objectives makes it a pointless endeavor especially when the map that you invest so much time building on gets wiped before you can fully enjoy the splendor of what you have achieved. The kill or be killed mentality seems to dominate this game to such an extent that just walking past someone can make you or him/her a target for an unjustifiable attack because everyone is so mistrusting and paranoid of one another an issue I think that goes to a lack of objectives or structure that the game desperately needs.

2015-02-02,1,1,131,True,Not Recommended,NEW VERSION COMMENTED FOR EVEN DUMBER PEOPLE !Dear Facepunch Studios I am dumb Regarding radiations &amp the conversion of hides to plastic bags which are renewable ressources. I did not know that fresh raw meat could kill me that fast had I known I would have not ate some so often. I prefer to starve than to eat from a freshly killed deer.I also ignored fresh meat could go bad in an hour am I that full of bacterias ?I also wonder why I hear a clicking sound sometimes in my head when I get near old houses am I mad ? Also I feel much less pain when wearing soft leather like fabric gloves and boots when I get close to them. I also wonder how I can make transparent animal skins after seeing a picture of it. Regarding the fact you need a blueprint to craft a spear and that's pretty much it I also must be very stupid because I need to see a drawing of a stick with a sharp stone attached to it in order to make some myself same thing for a smaller version of it and same thing with a stick that I bend using a strip of leather to project the said tiny spears. But I must be very smart also because I can assemble complicated things that project peebles at high speed just after seeing a drawing of it. Though I am very happy because the peebles I craft for those weapons are as effective and as smokeless as the ones I can find in old houses or hard cylinders I break all accross the island. Regarding the fact you can craft paper out of wood and Burlap (plant) out of animal fur On the other hand I must be very intelligent because I can craft paper out of wood without having to learn how to make it. I also invented how to make burlap out of animal fur but I am too dumb to sew those animal furs to make myself a nice loincloth that would prevent me to stick my small in the face of everyone I walk by. Regarding the hundreds of deers one needs to skin in order to make socks I also wonder how many deers I have to skin in order to make myself a jacket last time I saw a deer it seemed to me its surface area covered by skin and fur was larger than mine I do admit my retardation and acknowledge the fact I can waste a lot of materials but I seriously wonder how I can live with myself after killing a dozen of them to make myself new boots. regarding the overwhelming FPS drops(basically it is a crash) when going into 'caves' stay out ! I as a properly bred caveman tried to house myself into a rock formation but it seemed to slow my brain reflexes and the chemical reactions occuring in my eyes by an insufferable factor. No wonder why the cave bears are extinct and that my ancestors moved on to build their own caves. Regarding the fact one does not need to see a blueprint covering how to swim eat hold one's breath or wake up in the morning I also wonder where I learnt to swim without having seen any blue drawings of it though I would like to be taught how to hold my breath when going underwater. It has a use I just forgot what it was but it has one involves striking at a furry thing anyways it is not good in combat prefer your pointy stick not the one down there the one you need learn to craft But above all else I would like to know what to do with my bone knife Is it a symbol of wealth and success that will attract many females to me or is it a symbol of inconcievable retardation to hold one ? I think I have yet to discover what it is good for.Ps I have been a good caveboy and would like the following things for the last christmas _Skull jewelries._armors bones and leather._Loin cloths I also would like to wear the skull of the person I found sleeping in the bushes as decoration for it._Shields._I think a proper axe would be nice._A longer spear to poke people from further away._a drawing to throw spears. If I see it I should be able to make them no ? Or is it necessary for me to read it ?_Oh and a lever to throw the above item even further._More hair to keep warm and to scare other people._Fishes._Catapults or rams._Shovels and spades I have much to shovel.Thank you.Dumb.Dumb.(Edit not recommending it while it is in early access),Rust

2017-04-09,0,0,788,True,Recommended,I have mixed feelings. I love the game but its hard to not hate the player. The game is built in a somewhat toxic gamestyle. Nothing bad about it they did a good job at building a very competive atmosphere. Just don't get asshurt when you get rekt and told to git gud. Just git gud. Keep playing and making mistakes. Each time you get screwed you can take it as a learning experience and just not do it on the next server. My only issue is that I find a lot of admin abuse in the community servers. I wish there was a halfway between community servers and official. Some category for the professionally run community servers would be nice. Nothin is worse than losing cuz an admin is abusing priv. You can't learn from that. I also have a lot of ideas that would be cool for this game ie elevator gears/high qual/ rope/metal frags. can build into bases to go up a bunch of floors faster than opening and closing a ladder hatch each story.Cams that you can place around your base and check in on from a laptopCrude oil as a base defense. this would be nice to defend a weak spot in your base design or to kill doorcampers from above costs crude oil or low grade pour oil from base and light ground below on fire for a timechainsaw metal frags/lowgrade/wood/HQ can be used as weapon or to cut down trees yields 75 to 100 wood per 1.1 seconds (i think salvage axe is 50/1.25) breaks over time and can be repaired. costs low grade to run&gt &gt ....

You will eventually get bored and NEVER touch the game again. So find a server with ecenomics and teleports and stuff itll make everything easier. So you can form a group and all your friends can teleport to each other so you dont have to spend hours looking. After you find a server look for a group. In the chat ask an EXPERIENCED player to team up. And make sure he has ALOT of loot. This will immensly help you in the learning process.

Was a DayZ clone now more of a Minecraft/Fallout clone. Alot of fun specially with mates. Lots of amazing social experiences to be had.Rust 2.0 is even prettier with a slew of improvements.

Ive wanted this game for so long because i watched everyone play it on youtube (heres the kicker) 2 years ago. Things have changed. Its mechanics are almost undientifiable from past (arguable better) builds. As for the game it is very meh. It has its moments but materials are hard to come by. And the community oh the community. Its what you expect but worse. I was lucky enough to find someone at the begining who showed me the ropes and helped me get my bearings. then i died. Then a guy shot me. then another guy sworded me. another sniped me. one began to trade with me then killed me. a 8 year old treid to pvp me. i won but then died by a guy who was screaming profanity (use you immagination) and killed me. You see you cant walk 5 steps without being called a ""naked"" or if you are wearing anything anything at all shot. Most of the servers and 3 hours and up so good luck finding a server at the start. Also everyone acuses someone else of cheating. This could be fun with frineds but i havent had the chance to try.

2014-03-29,0,0,146,True,Recommended,"Human Nature The GamePeople keep saying that ""*********"" s ruin the game. Kind of. Kind of not. Depends. Do you want to play for general kind of fun? Build something for yourself and then through that allow yourself to engage in ""the end game""? You're going to have a bad time. Let me explain Do not look at this game like Minecraft. Do not look at this game like Garry's Mod (from the same people) or a shooter or anything. Look at this game like The Stanley Parable. It really is that kind of Game.This game is not about any of the game mechanics. This game is about letting you start from absolute zero and let life play out. You know some people don't get how closely this game resembles human life because they don't get what our lives are. You are born into a country into a city into a family. You're born into a wealth zone a religion a culture into laws and morals with a set number of possibilities before you that you don't really have to work so hard to achieve in relation if you didn't have those other things.This game is basically removing all the things people are born into. It has no nations cities or families. You're born into the wild. You aren't born into wealth or poverty into power or lack thereof. Much like in the cave on Dagobah you have only ""what you bring with yourself"" in terms of religion and culture and no laws. No laws whatsoever. An axe wielrding maniac or even a full pack of them may attack and raid you. Scam you mutilate everything you worked for. They can do it because there is no law outside going beyond what is possible to other players (hacking).The one and only adventage any player may have is bringing along friends and that infact can and is a problem often but only because of what most players don't realize in this game and the only reason why on a certain level in its current form the game fails to deliver it's pure idea of letting human nature take whatever expression they like.Most players don't quite ""get"" what ""no laws"" mean. People think ""no laws"" means you can do anything you couldn't before. While actually it simply means You can do anything. However people are so fixated on the ""what I couldn't do before"" bit that they often neglect entirely the other parts.Sure this is part of most games. You can't shoot up terrorsits with night vision goggles or turn into a werewolf or use magic. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do what you do in every day life. If anything you should because the freedom of this game should shine through to most people why the world works the way it does. Countries' goverments aren't the sweating scared and irritated gun wielding madmen that some caricaturists portait them to be. They don't attack eachother for better reason than ""maybe losing"". It simply is often in the best interest of everybody to play nice.In a world populated by the same scarred sweating gun wielding and irritated madmen it would be like Rust. Then what is different? Simply that people have no reason to think anyone is going to be decent. They can all feel that it's better to play together with others but they don't dare play with others because who knows when they'll betray you? Infact it's best to just shoot on sight in most cases.Oddly enough in real life this doesn't happen. Why? Because if someone is a known murderer they're going to get arrested their life (literally or less so) taken away from them marked forever. There is not so much need to defend one's self because there is not so much sense in attacking someone else.Similar laws exists here but you're not born into them. You have to agree to them by joining a group in the game if you can that is. And it will always be on the group's terms not yours because there is no higher power than the group. If you're thinking ""well that's like countries"" you're starting to see what I'm getting at.This game is beautiful. Not because it's a nice game. Definitely not because the people going around murdering others ""for fun"" are doing the right thing in any shape way or form as a civilized person. But they are doing the right thing in what the game entails. The world has to have enemies in order to have a reason to work together. Later those enemies are going to be more basic such as supplies needing to be seccured in larger quantities for survival but now we have the raiders.The only true flaw is that it isn't neccessary to experience the loneliness of the world in this game and to truly hammer in the worth of cooperation by stripping players of the option from outside forces.So does it make it a good game? Yes. Does it make it a good toy? No. A horrible toy. For fancy free and pure fun this game is horrible. It's going to break you. But if you are painfully aware of human nature want to be painfully aware of human nature and/or want to fight to make it into the best thing it can be or revel in its darkness This is the game for you.Pro tip though If you're a ******** to other people withing the game's rights you might be playing the game right and good on you. But that doesn't make what you do any less of a ******** move. Accept that before you ask others to accept it's validness.After all being a ""********"" is by defintion that you enjoy reveling in the darker side of human nature. And before you ask what the actual word is under those stars I literally just put in 8 stars. Because any of the words you would mentally put there fit that bill.",Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Once I was hunting near my cabin. Two guys passed by being chased by bears. They later came back shooing arrows at me. They chased me through a myriad of crags and once I lost them and snuck back to my home I found them waiting for me there. I suprised one of them with a shot from my bow and we battled for a straight in game day. It ended with me doing hit and runs from within my house. They broke through and beat me to death with axes.This game is not for the faint of heart. Unless you play on a small server you will die. A lot.

Lets be honest the game is pretty good i played a ridiculous amount of time and loved it. But i found a great community with an admin that cared. i made over 20 friends who i still talk to know that we have all quit the game. But before i found them i had a hundred hours of getting to end game or close to it only to be on by admin abusers or communities made up of a remarkable amount of little yippy kids that act like the little kids on consels do. great game needs more then a load of work though. for 20 dollars i would be hesitant to buy it unless you know you like this sorta game.

2013-12-30,0,0,210,True,Recommended,I do recommend Rust although only if you have other people who will actively play it with you. It has a very large potential but a lot of the time is spent just doing small things like chopping some trees hitting some rocks and things like that. While the end result of that is quite nice working up towards it can be tedious. Of course friends can make this better. The in game voice chat isn't great so I'd suggest finding some friends outside of game and having a Skype TeamSpeak or Steam call with them so you can hear them better. Overall quite a fun game.,Rust

2016-01-10,2,1,64,True,Recommended,This game. Let me tell you about this game. I like it. It's a good game. Now I haven't been around since the early days. Truth be told I only just got this game during the sale of the winter. An ya know what? This is a good fricken game. Now the game itself is rather addictive. Collect resources build stuff survive and hunt. It's fun. It reminds me of my Eve Online days except it's much more to the point. And less... Not fun. LIke Eve was. And I got over 700 hours in that game but let's set our gaze back to Rust.Rust. You know what this game makes me think of? After that? Pure multiplayer fun and tension. Then again but let's not think about that right now. See the fun of this game is of that from my World of Warcraft days. See I enjoy the base game but it's the people that make it thrive. Those little unique interactions no computer could truly give meaning too. Give it a few years of course before Siri gets a hold of your blender and attempts to slice you off. To no avail of course unless you were unlucky and got a big one. I do not. Lucky me. Heh... Lucky me...Seriously my characters wiener is so tiny. Devs please give me a bigger As I was saying it's the people that make this game interesting. Forming bonds with your fellow man woman or whatever kin thing you identify as in a world that's ruthless and brutal. And yet we can still gather round and have a laugh at my miniscule Also as we torture naked men and impose our will upon them. Perhaps we'll even sing songs and stuff. I don't know. Grab some buddies and dive in. Trust me when I say this world feels me with a sense of adventure. Scale this unknown territory and take what's rightfully yours! I personally am a loner. Which is rather sad because people seem to like me but I have issues with keeping connections with more than like two people... But spamming the mic will eventually get ya some friends or at least some silly situations that will surely bring you joy! This game is pretty rage enducing when you take it too seriously so be ready to die and have fun interacting with the people of this world. Even more so if you dont have any friends that play this game... It's like playing an counter strike without other people. It's just not as fun. So as long as you come in ready to have a laugh please stop laughing at my I can promise you that this will be the finest experience you've ever had!Also devs may I please have another shot at the genetic lottery? My is way too tiny and people are making fun of me...,Rust

2016-01-26,1,1,24,True,Recommended,"3 days in. 24hrs played. I'm too old for this I've deleted it. It was fantastic though. This game is the anarchic paradise you probably don't really want but you desparately fantasize about. Anthropologists need to play this game.17th century philosopher English Thomas Hobbes summised in his seminal discussion that man in his natural state lives a life that is ""solitary poore nasty brutish and short"". Yes he lives in ""continuall feare and danger of violent death"". He speaks of principles like diffidence &amp competition for resources that explains this tragedy and proposes a social contract a binding contract one takes implicitly at birth to keep our behaviour innocuous and respectful and progress beyond the inherit state of war.Rust provides a time machine to a time where the social contract is a forgotten relic an indecipherable parchment long buried with civilised society. There are some quirks though. Rust's main characters aren't grizzled cavemen established feudalists or refined monarchs. The archetypal character in Rust is a 21st century upper middle class 15 year old autistic eating trashboy ""Jimmy"". He greets you with ""hallo f* ggots"" walks around with his out asking for help and proceeds to smash your head in with a rock when you offer him food. He scribbles c*** on the walls and draws pictures of Sonic. A few short hours in Rust and he is you.This game is a fantastic microcosm of the worst of humanity. It tempts you to be an and you better be an . Also it is shocking that the word ""alpha"" is attached to this game. Sure it crashes and graphically it isn't the best optimised game but that netcode. Hundreds of people in an outrageously large map communicating over mic flawlessly and engaging in not entirely terrible combat.It's also a time sink and will probably turn you into a bad person so probably don't play.",Rust

2015-08-31,1,1,1639,True,Recommended,Well after playing this game for a while i decided to write a review about it !I played this game since the legacey (my legacy hours are around 500hrs)But i quited playing because i wasted my life on the game and there was no progress because they started over completly and my pc couldnt handly the newest rust in the beginning so i wasn't that interested anymore.But i kept checking the rust blogs and a few weeks ago i got my new pc and i thought why not give it a try.And i was amazed how much progress this game has made some things weren't the same like in legacy (a sample the pvp ) but i didn't care to much because i loved the new building system and the legit survival system !Now this is my main game again i love the new community and the new great potentiol that this game has.If u like to build a house gear up protect it with some mates explore and rule the server with your pvp skills this will be a game for u !Thanks for reading ! I hope i helped u a bit out !,Rust

2015-08-31,1,1,90,True,Recommended,"Do you love turning off a game knowing someone will undo any progress you've made while you're offline?Do you love the feeling when people in armor with guns laugh as they blow up your wooden shack with explosives?Do you love intellectually stimulating conversations such as if someone is ""Mad bro?"" or if so and so is a prepubescent with a high octave voice? Do you love beating people to death with rocks?Have you ever played the first 30 minutes of a game and thought to yourself ""You know what I wish I could replay that completely naked and with my wee willie censored out.""Then you have sadomasochistic tendencies and you will find them fulfilled in Rust's ""vibrant"" community.(My advice shoot everyone on sight especially when they come at you with a weapon drawn.)If you ignore the sometimes brutish community that make Rust's servers their Troll Bridges you will find Rust a beautiful survival game which is being constantly updated with new content by the developers. In my times running naked across the wilderness dodging bullets as I hobble together enough stone and wood for a humble hatchet and pick axe I sometimes stop stunned by a golden sunset or a tranquil grove (until I am shot through the heart and watch prone and helpless as my body is teabagged repeatedly by 4 players with AKs)Happy hunting.",Rust

2014-07-03,0,0,99,True,Not Recommended,Not recommended at all. First you need a really good computer and I mean that. I would say I have a fairly decent laptop if I tweak things I can play games at a pretty playable framerate. But this game I get 10 20 frames with tweaks. Anyway I can't really write a review just on FPS. Whenever I join official servers there is around 100 ping. That means if a person walks up to you and you ask them if they are friend or foe they say friend and decide to stab you in the back you don't really have a chance of winning because the ping is so high. You'll be at 30 hp before you see you are getting hit and what not. Lastly I logged off for about 5 minutes to tweak my game. I come back and I'm dead. I wasn't being attacked when I left or anything and I lost some pretty good stuff. So no I would not recommend this game for the price it is at at all. Save your money and get a better game.,Rust

2015-10-04,0,0,484,True,Not Recommended,"The massive drop in players on the game RUST isn't for nothing. There's no words to describe how infuriated and disappointed I am with this game in its current state.http //steamcharts.com/app/252490Rust started out as one of the most amazing innovative and engaging survival based multiplayer game that I had the privilege of playing. The game had a sense of tension and doubled as a fascinating social experiment in an anarchist enviornment.The question you're probably asking is ""you're saying good stuff about it. Why are you not recommending this game?""Simple answer The component system.Any sense of character progression and character development is completely destroyed making it impossible for people new to servers to obtain any fighting chance against other players because the zones that drop essential end game components is monopolized and controled by clans.The first crafting system the blueprint system was simple and effective. Not the best but certainly not the worst. The second crafting system the Experience system was tedious but still gave players a reason to keep playing. With the component system there's no point in playing you don't have any recipe knowlege that will make you stand out among your group/clan the game is 100% spoiled now. It's like having a cheat code in an old game that gave you all special weapons from the start of the game. Why play?Worst of all as stated before the places that have important components are controlled by clans. This means that a new player or someone new to the server is forced to visit high risk areas to have a fighting chance. If you lose your base and all of your stuff there's absolutely nothing to fall back on. There's no ""Well at least I know how to make ____ with minimal materials."" Not anymore.This game is NOT worth your money the player base is dying QUICKLY (and has been since the component system was released) and the devs don't respond to steam forum complaints at all.If you want a survival game that's better play Hurt World Age of Kings even Miscreated is better than this garbage now. The only reason people still play it is the same reason people still play WoW. It's for nostalgic purposes wanting to maintain loyal to a once great game.",Rust

2016-06-17,0,0,40,True,Recommended,RustSet in a post nuclear apocalpyse where the world is brutal and the people that inhabit it are even more so. You forage mine chop and kill to survive. Build bases to keep your booty safe and hope someone doesn't come along to take it and your pants.What Rust lacks in story it makes up for with the interactions of its other inhabitants. One minute you could be taking a nice stroll along the road next minute a naked person will try to smack you in the head with a rock. What do you do? Kill them? Make peace? Run away? That choice is up to you. Your adventures would also entail building a base that is if you want to keep all the stuff you find. Which may end up stolen in the future if you aren't vigilant.I find Rust to be a great game no matter how much people say that the community is bad. In my experiences so far I've met people who will help you and those that will destroy you. The game is all about your interactions with players without them it's just not as enjoyable.My personal rating for Rust is a 10/10 because it can be so damn great no matter how much you rage.,Rust

2016-01-31,0,0,2093,True,Recommended,"Ok well...So my first day in rust I did nothing died like 4 times and had fun doing it. Day 2 I call up my friend and we start playing rust. We built a little shack and didn't know what to do next. So we looked it up made a hammer and upgraded all our walls and door. We didn't know about blueprints so next we looked that up and ran to the water treatment plant which at the time we called ""big broken tower thingy."" So we got some blueprints and learned how to make wood armor and we thought we were so cool with our wood armor waterpipes and stone shack. We continued to get more stuff and then we went to war with people who tried to raid us and they had a clan so our shack went boom boom. Later we built a nice looking house and made it completely air locked. After this we kept upgrading and we didn't have much stuff. Next day which was the day before the wipe we found a massive compound with a little crack which if we tried really hard we could get through and we did. The whole base was left with the airlock doors open which we later realized is because the owners just left. We got tons of great things like AKs and Rocket Launchers/rockets and c4. We went back and stored our stuff. Then the next day we were raided somehow and lost it all. That same day the owners managed to find our base and hatched down our wood external walls. We then we threw everything we had at them. Literally. We opened our window and threw rocks and clubs at them. We managed to get them to agree to not use guns and we started playing what we called ""dodge rock."" We became good friends with them and now we all live in a massive compound we built together after the wipe.100000000/10 would play dodge rock again",Rust

2017-08-08,2,1,720,True,Recommended,Honestly this game sucks. Just absolutely blows but people keep coming back want to know why? YOU CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT Many things about this game is amazing and great. When I started out in the (Blueprint System) back in 2015 I came to love that version of rust than the game now in 2017 But they turned this into and game for the new players instead of the old ones so that they can bump up their sales.Pros Great game to waste your time Fun PVP and PVE Great graphicsCons Autistic and your daily intake of cancer (Community) Feels much like a job Guns get nerfed once the community cries about something about it (Buffs another gun for no reason) Crossbow and pipe nerfed #DidNotNeedToHappen Twig and Ladder build up Quarries uselessConclusionThe game is there it has potential. I just cant say that it is going in the right direction at the moment instead of fixing their broken game they will just add a new gun or add a new mechanic instead of fixing their old ones and that is why the game has lost 60k population after the blueprint system was taken out of the game. I do beleive they are trying to make the game much better for the new players and make the game worse for the old players.,Rust

This is probably the best twenty bucks I've spent on a game let alone a game in early alpha..For being in this stage of development this is a very solid game. Only a few little bugs here and there that will definitely be fixed over time. The gameplay is smooth the way that guns function is on par with milsim (even a few things that milsims leave out). Only one minor complaint. Not sure if I just haven't found it yet but there should be more graphics customization options. As of now we only have a generic slider that has about six modes of quality.Very good game. Only got a few hours in but I will definitely be getting more.,Rust

2014-01-11,0,0,29,True,Recommended,So I have played for about an hour and have had the worst time low frames no food or water laggy servers and on top of that zombies can hit you when you are 10 feet away and don't stop following you until you are like a mile and a half away. I bought this game for me and a friend thinking it would be decent but you can't even tone down the graphics Fanciest looks exactly like fastest. It's been out for a month and the least they could do is patch the glitchy grass that flickers while you walk. I played for an hour as mentioned before and I still coudldn't meet up with my friend because there isn't a map or even a damn compass. How am I supposed to direct my friend to my location? Read the ing clouds? Just a really game so far maybe it could get better possibly not change at all like Arma 3 did but for now I really don't recommend buying this game or be like me and buy it twice. EDIT Now that this game has had a few patches since it's been released it is extremely playable and you can go butt a$$ naked and let your balls loose for the world to smell.,Rust

2014-11-26,0,0,79,True,Recommended,"Rust survival and no zombies! You will have enough trouble from wolves bears other players starvation and cold. Heavy on the crafting skills you start with absolutely nothing except a large rock. No clothes no food nothing. All is not lost however that first rock lets you whack on trees for wood and on certain types of boulders for sulfur metal ore and stone. With these you build your tools from a stone axe to hammers and pick axes your weapons from a basic spear to rifles ammunition needs to be crafted also and lets not forget your home something to protect you from the predators mentioned above and to store your supplies. Decent enough for the survival sims Rust has the legacy version that's very popular and has a known map and the experimental version that uses a key on each server to generate a map that's unique to that server.On the experimental servers the animals just were activated recently ... there are 2 main predators wolves and bears these will roam around a bit and what you thought was a safe distance may not be in just a few moments. Other animals such as chickens wild pigs (boars) and deer also appear usually in wooded areas. Boulders along shore lines mountain slopes desert and plains provide the source for raw materials. A sleeping bag provides a spawn point and building a house with locks help protect you and your stuff.A new addition in November 2014 was the ""Toolshed"" which when activated prevents another player from building within 50 meters of it. Friends can be added to the allowed list to permit the beginnings of a town and cooperative elements in the game.Getting started can be difficult get used to the fact that even a well equipped play is likely to be killed off by the local wildlife.",Rust

2017-09-05,0,0,1168,True,Not Recommended,"The game was great but it has been slowly getting worse over time by the game devs making the wrong decisions starting with the removal of the blueprint system. Components are an autistic mess to store and sort through there are so many of them vs just blueprint pages and resources. The devs keep implementing mini games to all aspects of the game from hit the shiny spot on the mineral node to the new ""Learnable Recoil"" they added recently. The mineral patch was annoying but turning recoil into a mini game was what pushed me to the limit and stopped playing the recoil needs to return back to what it was. The devs added in ""Legendary Crates"" which just give people free explosives to instantly destroy whatever base you have been working on a new player literally needs no time or investment on the server before he starts destroying hours worth of work players have made and there is no admin/server side configeration settings to allow servers to change/turn off those ""Legendary Crates"". Devs removed craftable pump jacks and oil nodes so there is really no reason to build in the desert for oil everyone builds in the snow for High Quality metal since the mining quarry can only harvest it in snow.These major issues need to be fixed and changed back to the way they were before.

2017-05-08,0,0,102,True,Not Recommended,Sooo.....I got this game because I thought it looked fun and many youtubers I watch play it. I gave it a try and well it's fun for the first few days of playing.Pros Probably the best looking survival game IMO.Good customization(freedom to build how I want).Lots of players(pro and con I guess).Cons Hunger drops too fast.Wolf spawns are sh**.Too hard to survive for any length of time unless you get lucky.Spawns suck.Hard to find resources sometimes.My Story So today as in the day I wrote this I got back into Rust. After a few hours of playing (and dying) I finally was surviving for over 10 minutes. I had good enough things for a starter and was close to making my own house. Until I stumbled across an abandoned log cabin it was perfect. I checked for any other survivors to see if they were friendly. Btw this log cabin was far far away from anything else (Perfect for people like me who like to be isolated.). I scoped the area and no one was there. I went in started a fire and then headed out for some cloth. I could not find any cloth so I was gonan head into land. Now remember nothing was on this island but me and it was small enough that nothing should've spawned. Well when I took 20 steps away from the cabin a wolf decided to chase me (how did it get here?). I got away from it but was dying of the cold. So I made a fire then out of nowhere the wolf comes back and kills me. I spawn way to far away and bodies despawn quick. All my work was lost.,Rust

2017-05-08,0,0,1179,True,Recommended,I rate games based on how long I played them versus how much I paid for them. Because of that Rust has delivered the most value of any game I've purchased. Think about games you spend $60 for and only play for 25 30 hours. Rust was $20 and I've already played for 130 hours. If you notice a lot of thumbs down take a look at the hours they've played. If they didn't enjoy it why would they play for so long? Folks in this game want the game to play their way. I see Rust for what it is. An alpha game ever changing and addicting as hell.,Rust

2017-05-07,0,0,937,True,Recommended,"Nearly a year has gone by since I first played worth every hour for the price of the game. The devs are always putting out content which partly keeps me coming back every week I'm able to play. It's the enjoyment of playing with the people of a particular server I play on that I've I found to be a nice community that gets me wanting to play more. To which point I find It's a game that is much more enjoyable being play with friends. It's totally a rush if you want to play solo on a high pop server or if you're into more of a casual community style play there are plenty of ""Role play"" type servers out there for your enjoyment. I won't lie most people who play this game (that I run into on servers) are teens that are s and will kill you as soon as they spot you but every now and then you'll run into someone you'll want to add to your friends list and continue to play with.I love the way the guns feel in Rust I find it's not hard at all to control the recoil of say an AK but anyone new to the game is likely to think it's a bit much in terms of vertical recoil. I recommend people to join servers called Combat tag it's a very nice opportunity to practice using any of the weapons in the game not only guns and you can go against other players if join a lobby with someone.The building system is a bit dull when it comes to creativity but the devs are not finished with this aspect of the game and it's likely to be amazing in the end when the game is finished. Which is a down point in my eyes because they've been working on this game for many years and it's still in Alpha with many bugs and issues plaguing it like animal AI performance (fps wise) and a nasty community of cheaters (though you're not likely to really run into them). Playing on servers that are moderated by active server admins is a good way to minimize your chances of running into a cheater just be aware that playing on servers with admins whom actually play the game can be worry some because there's always an admin who abuse the system for their own gain.Anyways this getting a bit long. All in all I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to get into it just beware you're going to get hooked... you've been warned!",Rust

Build everything go pretty much anywhere you want craft weapons defend yourself kill for resources look for resources and watchout for bandits. This game really gives you an adrenaline rush when fighting other players because you are either going to win and get their materials or lose and they'll get all yours So rust is a game which you have to make sensible decissions to survive! Great skybox and atmosphere still a few bugs to fix (it is in it's alpha stages so updating will fix bugs and make the game even better with new additions.)

2014-01-03,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Well the game looks a bit nice for an alpha but needs a lot of improvement. Well for start decrease lag. Ihave an exelent pc but getting tons of lag. putting down graphics is an option but makes the gme look ugly. Also we need way more guns such as sniper rifles. Anther thing is one shot to the head with anyhing to anyting moving such as players and zombies would be nice. Veicles would also be good because geting arround the map is very hard. (no homo). last thing we need more loot to find its very hard to get stuff for now. tnx (just one problem there is nothing more heartless and murderous than most of rust's player. no teaming at all they see you they WILL KILL.,Rust

2017-01-01,0,0,338,True,Recommended,Ever evolving and best in class in my opinion. There are a lot of negative reviews but the fact that many of them have 1000+ hours played should tell you something about whether or not this game will give you $20 worth of fun. By any definition this is a worthy game and captures the tension of the survival crafting FPS genre.That said it isn't what it can't be and it never will be but it does what it does better than any other game to date that I've played and I feel like I've played this genre to death.,Rust

2016-04-05,1,1,1532,True,Recommended,Ok So time for a reiview. Be rude not to I suppose. Especially after considering I built my PC to play this game after seeing someone randomly stream this on a camera on a PS4. I have some absolutley amazing memories of this game. (some tragic) I'm currently in a clan and have accrured over 550 hours of gaming. (this game is still in Alpha at time of writing)Let's keep this simple...In a nut shell This is this best game on Steam bar none. Each and every single negative commet I have seen regarding it can be reduced to bitter people whom have not took the time or the patience to learn the game find a good server or form a clan in able to survive. All these people have jumped on the busiest servers and expected to just instantaneously take over which will never happen (make no mistake this game is as ruthless is it is rewarding) and as a result all have come away bitter/sour mainly due to a damged gaming ego. Please do not fall into this trap you will deprive yourself of the best gaming exerience/social experiment Steam has to offer.Just to put this game in perspective...In essence this game has cost me in the region of 1500+ to play. IT WAS WORTH EVERY ING PENNY.,Rust

2017-05-19,0,0,76,True,Not Recommended,After playing this game for a while and trying other servers it has come time that I write my review. As a survival based game its ok on a non modded server but when it comes to playing on modded servers there is a cancer that ends up ruining the game for other players. And that is orther players and clans. Its mostly the players that shoot on site new players and wait for them to spawn in. If you are a player that likes survival aspects of a game then dont play this game or pay on non modded servers. Because when the server has high loot and kits it goes from being survival to a sandbox creative game.,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Exactly what I was looking for! I've played Minecraft DayZ 7 Days to Die and this game is the best of all of those worlds. Not to mention it is in Early Alpha so a TON of improvements and potential for expansion is expected. I am happy I gave it a try. One thing though is you better make some friends or play with people you know or you'll have a tough time surviving let alone thriving.,Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,125,True,Recommended,This game is basically taking minecraft and turning it into a real life type of game. It incorporates survivial rivalries and friendships in order to carry on in the world of rust and mainly to survive in the game of rust.,Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,49,True,Recommended,A good game to survive and build own house. Untrusted waste land is showing up. like all other survival games you will never know the people appears to you is friendly or not. So for most time just shoots all unknows. weapon has a lot of choices like short guns machine guns sniper rifle axe and so on... Well for more words the BOW is the best choise ever than any others weapons! we tested all weapons compare the ammos costs weapon powers and DPS the bow is really good to use and easy to get. e.g. 1 shot per normal zombie 2 shots for normal animals 4 shots for bear. all you need to do is position a black point on ur screen to mark ur front sight. the trajectory is almost affact less. so a wave of Robins are coming...To build things... whatever you want to build resoures are never enough! so find some friends play together you cannot build a temple ur own unless u own the server. by the way a team of players could help to survive long because it is so hard to live by one person. one more rec Do Not Let The Server Owner Hate You! They Are The Rules In The Server... Oh yeah yah Furthermore do not build your house in any open area. u would find it dispeared when u next log in....Well as the developors claimed it still have planty of bugs and expects. Words below are my wishes. 1 for buildings remove a wall from my own house could be a skill but any booms!!! 2 the map is too small and the resoures is so less. 3 I hope a house could be set on some incredible places like above water... so actually for this one is talking about build something on the sea it would be more fun... well those are just wishes... i donot expect they became true without my wants this games still great to play!

Things will change a lot. We might even make changes that you think are wrong. But we have a plan. It's in our interest to make the game awesome so please trust us. I trusted for years. I hoped for the best of the game for years. I had patience and i had more than reasonable amount of hope. They have no plan. They have no right way of solving the biggest issues. Devblog 158. The game was insanely hard for solo players already but now it is impossible. It is IMPOSSIBLE. I know for a fact that the devs do not play the game themselves because the changes that has happened are counterintuitive and disgustingly bad. If i was being asked to change the meta of building structures i would be capable of doing that in an intuitive healthy and enjoyable way. Anyways had hope until now. It's all gone.

2017-11-08,0,0,2078,True,Not Recommended,"I have owned and played approximately 2 000 hours in Rust since early November of last year. Yes if you do the math on average I've been playing almost 40 hours a week of Rust. Yes I have a job and No I am not a neckbearded basement dweller. During this time I have played Vanilla rust on US East 1 with some time spent in 100 Airdrops and Combat Tags for gun practice. Rust is a very difficult game. A VERY difficult game both to play and get started in. Especially if you are a solo player. A popular Rust Youtuber KCMO said ""Rust has to be one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. But I also find it to be the most rewarding game I have ever played because of how hardcore it is."" For those of you that may be new to Rust check out this video from December 2016 a little under two months after I started playing. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v nnSZInxoMWMRust at it's core is a great game great concept good mechanics and interesting story. I've got so much time in Rust because I felt it was a great game and I loved it. I played it almost exclusively since I purchased it and I genuinely care about the direction it is going. Unfortunately that direction is not good.Being that the game is still in development coming up on 4 years now (You are not in ""early development"" anymore as your banner claims) a lot has changed since November of 2016. Those changes unfortunately have been in my opinion for the worse. I joined the game at a time where the XP system and blueprints 2.0 had been scrapped and the component system was coming into it's own. What a time to play Rust. I was able to make some friends and we began playing as a group. I have some very fond memories of solo bases in November December January and playing at odd hours to ensure uninterrupted farming as I was still very new. As I grew in experience I got better my base designs became more impenetrable and I have gone several month long wipes without being raided. Since then alot of positive new static content has been added to the game but the game mechanics have changed so much that the game is completely stacked against the solo and small group players and now favors large groups of people known as ""zergs"" and clans. This is even more so than it did before. They are able to farm faster build larger and get top tier weaponry and crafting supplies faster as a result of reimplementing the blueprint system and the absolutely cancerous hunt for scrap. The game is no longer fun and has become way to much of a grind. There was natural progression prior to this. There is just a slog now where a set back is monumental. A solo player can collect approximately 120 150 scrap per hour by running a road or visiting the larger rad towns and recycling EVERYTHING they get their hands on. With the implementation of the new blueprint + scrap system it is just too much and no longer rewarding. Prior to this there was a real sense of investment in time and reward. That is now gone as the time investment is just too much and this is coming from a guy who spent 40 hours a week on this game. The other huge issue is hackers. Rust is plagued with hackers. Active hackers using aimbots auto aim ESP speed hacks quick mining hacks and everything else. And passive hackers that are using hacks to gain a situational advantage. It's awful. The reports are not handled fast enough and there are no admins on official servers. (I've offered to be one multiple times given my time on the server). It's really a detriment to the game and Facepunch doesn't seem interested in fixing or addressing the issue. In closing I cannot recommend this game any longer. I have brought a couple friends into the game since I started but now it's just no longer fun. I hope that Facepunch Gary Newman and Helk (Devs) wake up tomorrow and see theses issues for the game killers that they are and revert to the November December January February March timeframe when Rust had it's highest peak players and things were awesome. TL DRRust was great in the Nov Dec 2016 and Jan Mar 2017 time periods and has gone downhill since. Changes to core game mechanics have been terrible. Some good static content has been added but the changes to the mechanics heavily outweighs that. Revert the mechanics fix your hacking issue staff your servers stop making the game into a grind balance your loot tables nerf the zergs blueprints and scrap system is cancer.",Rust

2016-06-20,0,0,1385,True,Recommended,Rust is the best game ever IF the stars align and a few different variables are working together perfectly. Rust is the most frustrating screen punching rage quitting game if just a couple of these variables are out of line so let me tell you what these things are. Good Server admins people who won't cheat who make sure to ban hackers and greifers who keep the server up and running and stable. If you don't have this the server can crash your base gets hack looted your base gets trolled and you can lose and i'm not exaggerating easily over 50 hours of work. Thankfully it's not hard to find good admins and fairly stable servers and there is an anti cheat system thata as far as I know works. Server population density you want enough people to make the world feel alive and dangerous but not so many you can't have your own little piece of saftey where you can farm resources unmolested and monuments where you get vital materials aren't farmed out by big bully clans. This can be difficult and is subjective to whether you enjoy relative crowdedness or not but ultimately it's a tricky one to get right as servers can die off or bad admins can up server pop and make the 100 man server which was perfect density into a 150 man cluster . You have a competant team rust is not designed for solo play period. A lot of raiding tactics farming etc. is unarguabley better with more than 1 person even 2 people makes a huge difference. A small clan of 3 5 people is perfect for most medium sized servers but getting this is harder than it seems. Rust is a big time sink gather resources takes a huge amount of time raiding takes a lot of time and more often than not there will be a few less active members of the clan who aren't pulling there weight and this just leads to tension and arguments. To get a small group of competant players who are fun to be around and pull their weight is extremely difficult to do but it's core to having fun and not getting rekt in every gun fight. free time you better be able to dedicate your whole existance to this game because a larger % of the server than you'd think are doing this. Staying up for 2 days straight cutting trees and raiding bases of those who actually sleep IRL is the essence of Rust. If you work anything more than a part time job or are in the middle of exams then you should just not play rust you'll spend your time building a base and collecting resources only for a 7 man clan of no lifers to come and farm with UTTER EASE from your base. You'll lose everything and probably didn't even have that much fun doing it. In rust unless your winning it's not fun mostly. Farming is a grind building a base is a grind but it all makes the victory so much sweeter as the risk/reward ratio is incredible.now if these stars align! it's not impossible for them to do so then you will have one of the most immersive addictive and great experiences of your life. You'll meet great people and experience great memorable moments if the stars don't align you'll want to kill yourself throw your PC out the window and eat yourself into a diabetic death. Rust is war and like war it contain's ecstatic highs and heart wrenching lows.find those 2 weeks of freedom some friends a good server plan a base out and immerse yourself in this incredible game but be warned if the recipe isn't complete you'll want to rage quit and cut your own off in utter rage.,Rust

2014-04-05,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I reccommend this game i mean there is still hackers and cheaters you cant blame them it IS in early access but aside from that its pretty good game.If your looking for a good stable not really buggy game then dont buy this but if you dont care for bugs that much and wont rage quit from hackers killing you then i suggest trying it out.I reccommend aswell that when you start off on this game dont pick a public server pick servers that dont have many players about 10 30 players so you can learn the basics of the game and not get hacked then go on to public servers with lots of players. On another note on public servers you probably wont find stones that much so if you find someone who has a stone hatchet kill them whether they be sleeping or not just make sure you get the first hit.so overall this game is amazing bugs sure but gameplay is awesome and if your looking for a good zombie game dont buy thisthe zombies are crap in this.But to continue on with what i was saying overall it is good fun awesome game to play alone or with friends.8.4 / 10,Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,299,True,Recommended,This game is incredibly addicting. It was the first game I purchased for my gaming pc and honestly I don't see any other game competing for the enjoyment it has brought me. I recommend it to everybody I know who likes gaming and they have all played it in most of the free time they have.This game is alot of fun since you can build houses or bases with spike walls floors walls pillars ceilings and even big wooden gates. If you develop successfully you will find yourself with guns worthy of defending yourself from animals people and of course people. People are dangerous which is why I mentioned them twice. People will begin to lose interest in the regular gathering of rocks and wood so they will attack others in the server for fun. Loot is also a big part as that's where all guns originate from.The online community is a problem as early hackers using aimbot influenced the way people react to skill. If someone is exceptionally good at the game they will be accused of hacking and if caught in the wrong server will be banned from that server and have to start over on a different server.There are only a few official servers and the ping is very high so community servers are attractive. The problem with that is owners of the servers and admins can act the way they want in disregards to the players.,Rust

2016-09-02,0,0,1780,True,Recommended,Rust is a brutal world without mercy. The game has an amazing developpers team that push out weelky updates monthly huge updates and communicate with the playerbase on Reddit. It has a complex building system that takes time to master perfectly. You will have adrenaline rush during PvP you will rage when you die. You will also experience the ultime high when you outplay someone during a fight and loot their full inventory.Rust due to certain decisions from the developpers is pushing towards mass groups and zerging unfortunately. It used to be small crews of people playing now you have large groups (clans) on pretty much any populated servers which rolls over the weaker playerbase without any confrontation because we simply can't defend against groups of 8 zerging you without any skills.Recent graphic overhaul is a success Rust is even more beautiful and alot more stable on medium spec machines. The XP system was a try &amp miss BP system was superior and will be brought back with a different more refined system from what we know.Rust is not for casual players not in its current state. After over 1200 hours played best 20$ investment of my life for a video game. I just wished the game design wasn't pushing towards more groups and zerging because Rust is losing its true core gameplay.,Rust

2014-06-29,1,1,56,True,Recommended,"When I first saw this game I was like ""This here game is like Minecraft but in 3D"" so I took the chances and bought it.But man oh man was I wrong this game was nothing like Minecraft!So esentially Rust is a game for online multiplayer only now that may seem bad but thats what it is your suppose to team up or go solo dont quit the game because when you do look for a hiding spot or someone might kill you esentially it wants you to spend tons of time on the dang game. But theres a catch you have a feeling of staying alive well in other games you also do but this game makes you scared when your mom comes over and screams to go to dinner your forced to log off all the time at dinner your wonder pondering if you are still alive and when you get back to the computer and you see your still alive whew your so relived. In Rust its a game about survival no minigames no nothing just survive. You can build houses making yourself hidden to all other players where will you live? In the open? Or in the mountains? Rust takes the feeling of the movie Lost where all you can do is make normal things such as stone hatchets pickaxes and.... Guns?! Thats right in Rust you can make guns while the process isn't as hard as say Watchdogs getting a $40 000 gun its still pretty hard to get some high tech stuff. While the game is still in its alpha stages I'd love to see what they will add in the game in the near future. Thats all for my review of Rust.",Rust
2014-01-22,0,0,206,True,Recommended,Since I first played Rust back in January 2014 I knew it was a game destined for greatness. An online survival game that revolutionise the survival genre. Since then I have forgotten about Rust. The legacy branch was placed in the back burner and the glitchy buggy mess that was Experimental took the lead. Since I left Rust Facepunch Studios have been actively developing it adding new content and fixes every week. One day Rust returned to my attention and I decided to see if it had surpassed its old roots legacy. And it has. Big time!The new Rust is completely unrecognisable from the old. Nearly everything about it was overhauled and redone from scratch and it makes full use of the Unity engine to deliver a paramount and absolutely georgeous experience not found in any other online survival game of this kind. Whereas Rust's original rivals such as DayZ have fallen into the shadows and others have taken its place Rust has continued to stay strong developing a strong and loyal community of fans as well as becoming one of the most unique original and memorable online survival experiences on Steam. For the sake of this review I will refer to the old Rust using the term Legacy Rust. Survival This is of course a survival game so how does the survival factor affect your gameplay? This time around Facepunch have put greater emphasis on the PvE aspect adding in different biomes with their own unique temperatures. If you're in the winter biome at night you will freeze to death if you're in the desert biome in the day you will burn to death. Unlike Legacy where the only major threats (aside from players) were hunger the incessant wolves and radiation now you have to worry about thirst and temperature. These added dynamics add greater depth to the environment and add a greater challenge. Furthermore the infamous NPC animals make their return and are made from scratch utilising better AI and animal specific meat (Bears and wolves no longer drop chicken breast.) Of course no online survival game is complete without its psychopathic inhabitants a.k.a the players. This aspect remains virtually the same as Legacy.Combat Combat has always been a major part of any online survival video game. It is the primary vessel for gathering resources from NPCs hunting others and defending yourself or just for entertainment. It is well known that Legacy Rust's combat was incredibly unbalanced. Those who wore full kevlar and used an M4 had an incredibly big advantage over their enemy and in most cases were unstoppable Now this advantage has been taken away with the complete overhaul of weapons and how they are used. The higher tier weapons such as the AK and shotgun are far more harder to find and craft leaving the Thompson (successor to the MP4A5) the handcannon the bow and various others. To combat this Facepunch also implemented better melee weapons including a bone knife and a throwable spear. This gives starting players a better chance for hunting and protection without needing to scour a rad town to get a weapon like in the old days because let's face it melee in Legacy Rust was a joke. Graphics and Design The visual aspect of Rust is what impressed me the most. The first time I tried new Rust out I spawned close to a snow biome and I was just breathtaken at the beauty. It is definetely a great looking game that makes use of Unity better than Legacy. There is more vivid colour lush vegetation and better looking forests. In comparison to Legacy this is where New Rust has changed the most. On ultra settings Legacy Rust didn't look too bad and had a sort of rustic charm to it. However it lacked any real colour as the dominant colour in the Rust world was a yellow ish colour something you'd see in Breaking Bad. As for design everything looks just like it's meant to. Clothes are no longer mere patches of colour to distinguish armour type but proper great looking apparel. It all looks crudely made and savage. Weapons are no longer professional looking but look the part Duct taped made of wood and stone and covered in scratches and bumps as if they were made by a bald psychopathic man. Conclusion Rust is an online survival game that is definetely worth checking out. If you hold your doubts because of Legacy Rust throw them away. This is an entirely different game that is constantly being added to thanks to its active developers and a strong loyal fanbase. I hope to see even greater things from Rust in the future.,Rust

I have only had this a few days now but im already hooked on it i'd recommend it to all my friends. The only negitive thing about this game is the occasion glithes and bugs but most are minor and not game breaking.

2014-07-27,0,0,122,True,Recommended,(Before reading this review please do not give insulting comments towards me or to other fellow members on Steam) Rust is a survival game based on DayZ S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and a bit on Minecraft. The game is created by the Facepunch Studios the people who also created Garry's Mod. Now the gameplay is fairly simple after a while you've played it. The crafting system is slightly comparable with Minecraft as you need sometimes the same ingrediënts in the game. You start as a guy in a middle of a field or elsewhere around the map. Currently there is only one map if I am not wrong. You only start with 2 medkits and a rock. Gameplay wise you can slightly compare it with DayZ only without zombies. You fight against certain mutated creatures. You can also get radiation poisining if you are being attacked or if you are staying in a radiated town/city/area. You will notice that if you're screen starts to crackling a bit or if you hear that certain sound of radiation. Gameplay Score 8/10Overall the gamplay is fairly alright and simple after a while playing it. Graphics Score 8/10Graphics on the game is pretty much alright. It's not fully optimized yet but you can get okay FPS if you turn down the settings. I can run it for example on medium/highish settings. The game runs currently on a Unity Engine. The details graphical wise in the game looks good. It doesn't look blurry or not minecraftish blocks.Score 9/10The price for this game is uh well okay but honestly it is for some points pretty high for a early access game. I think the game could atleast be a bit more less. But that isn't my decision. Price Score 7/10My overall opinion about this game is that it is an early access game and things could change a lot at the meantime. This is just an overall opinion for me for now. PS You'll probably see that I haven't played this game for a while but I think some of the stuff when I played it are still the same.,Rust

2016-08-29,0,0,385,True,Recommended,The new exp system is awful. Played this game a lot when it firstly went out it was great except cheaters.Then the new version went out was great too. Several weeks ago decided to renew plaing it with friends and what I got? Every 2 3 days the new server should be found with lvl wipes because as I m playing with 2 3 friend not 6 10 we can t do much against players which start after wipe with 10 ppl and play for first 35 h. And after several days there are 2 server states 1 there are no people on server excpet big stack groups which farmed lvl and made ak47 or smth like that( so it is play crossbow againts rifles) which runing and just killing poeple raiding and so on 2 there are lots of people but the frist option groups are present and all u can do with not much playtime(4 5 h per day) is to kill and raid people which are lower or + 5 lvl higher then U it is not so interesting. So in the end with this exp patch rust became and mmo with full item drop and no space for little parties with little playtime avaiblity(basically as all mmos but in common mmo u still have what u farmed and there is no need to star over and over again with server wipes ).But in the end it is still a good game but it became very timespending.,Rust
2016-08-29,0,0,297,True,Not Recommended,Facepunch must hate new players. I figured they it up more with the lvling system. Mass groups epic win and those 13yo kids that hate the world rust and chill theyre lives away. No defence against high level players and too long to do it by yourself or with 3ish friends. Was hoping this game would make a comeback but it seems all the devs know how to do is 1. Put as many restrictions on maiking firearms rendering all newcomers defenceless. 2. Make the most toxic community on Steam. 3. Take advice from a community of said toxic nerds. 4. Be not like dayz but like dayz at the same time. If you want a game to quench your thirst on hating every form of life on Earth Play this game!!!If you want a good game to survive against the hostilities of the enviroment with the threat of other players doing what they have to do to survive like you. Dont buy this game!!! Simple go look up a game called ARK Survival Evolved Same lvling system i know but its so hard to aquaire especially with dinos 'everywhere',Rust

2016-07-03,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,The game does do almost everything it promises and there are servers with nice people who will actually help you get started in this game. But having your hard work constantly destroyed or having the same 2 people kill you over and over again for 3 hours straight does not count as fun for me. I really enjoyed the gathering and building aspect aswell as the brutality of the environment. I also did like that other players can have such a huge impact on your game but I think that there are just too many a******s that spend their time hunting newbies. As for the game itself There are some parts of the construction physics that are really unbalanced and filled with glitches. Some of the glitches enable enemies to build arround your Base and enter it even without them having construction privileges. There are glitches where you may get trapped in the ground making you unable to move. The only way to get out is to die.It takes a lot of time to enter the game. Even with my quite decent computer that fully lives up to the recommended specs.For me the price of the game compared to the experience of the game is not compatible. Maybe get it on sale and only get it if you have a group of friends to play with.,Rust

I DIDN""T PLAY THAT TIME! I WAS TESTING unless this game has decent environment aspect this game is pure garbage as DayZ.The sense of this game is to be killed just for fun killed on sight. No matter of what. And shut up about survival ok?Unless you can play on 50 ppl server with 30 of your gang this game is simple dissappointment.i tried and reinstalled this game 4 times but nothing changes. At least I saw how low humanity is these days (in reality).It is nothing about survival in environment. It's all about killing on sight because you WILL BE killed on sight. It's camping strike. And it's in the best scenario in general you alone will be attacked by 3+ players of same gang.Terrible community. This game only gets on your nerves as you will be killed for nothing.PvP? NO NO NO. There's no PvP. PvP has rules this garbage DOES NOT. You cannot make a guild you cannot claim a territory you cannot even destroy your own building fast to clean the place out. There's no friendlist. There's no ingame communication. chat and voice is nothing. If you came to this game alone without skype fellows uninstall the game save your time and nervesAbout ""join PvE server"".

A game where you a naked man/woman armed with your rock and torch become enraged when a fully clothed highwayman murders you in cold blood to take your wood and cloth scraps.

2014-03-22,0,0,235,True,Recommended,Rust can be defined with a single word chaotic. There's all sorts of betrayal success and randomness involved all packed together into a neat game. There are no in game tutorials you are basically a child you'll be surprised at a single wolf attack die countless times and often get murdered by other players just because they can or simply because you had a rock that they fancied. In short Rust is a psychological game at most where you decide who you should trust or shoot you may build your own wooden/metal home only to see it raided the next game. If you don't mind waking up naked and starting all over in the next day then it's definitely the game for you.,Rust
2014-01-22,0,0,142,True,Recommended,i would say yes if your looking for that game where you want to explore and find resources but there are some bad things that want to kind of stop you theres a giant list from zombies to raiders who want your stuff and from killers that want to kill you for no reason if your an expert on survival and looking for a challenge this game is exactly for you p.s your never safe when your playing rust.

2014-02-17,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Although this game is still Early Access I think it already has many cool features and it is definitely worth the price. The developers are still working on the game and updates are released regularly. I'm looking forward to what Rust will be in the future this is a game which you should keep in your mind.,Rust
2014-02-02,0,0,684,True,Recommended,It's rare that a beta much less an alpha like Rust is this functional and this much fun. The minimal feature set even seems expansive enough because what Rust really comes down to is relationships and reputation. At any moment a meeting with another player can be anything from a friendly greeting to trading to cold blooded murder to unnoticed stalking. Rust removes the physical limitations between players and leaves it to them to decide how to interact with each other. It's a regular occurrence that you log in to realize your sleeping body has been murdered your house raided and everything but your researched recipes gone. And as Rust proves that's all the motivation you need to keep going. Whether out for revenge justice new allies or more efficient and raid proof building designs each death reminds all of us why we continue to play a game in such an early stage of development. Where most games would implement skills saves or some other kind of safety net for the player's character Rust forces the player to better themselves instead. Nobody's going to hold your hand it's actually more likely to be shot than held.Including the famed Garry of Garry's Mod the Rust dev team is one of the best I've seen at communicating with its players be it through general status updates responding to feedback or updating the beauty that is the public Trello development board. Considering the recent disasters of games labeled full releases that reveal themselves to be riddled with bugs littered with in game purchases advertisements and DLC and developed by teams that have almost no control over their project little to no QA testing and/or no ability to communicate Rust proves that early access can be one of the most effective ways to develop a title. I've paid $20 for a game that calls itself Alpha but honestly it's already earned every cent of that money. This is how a proper business treats its customers with honesty and respect. If you can only buy one game in all of 2014 you're reading a review for it right now.,Rust

Once I logged back in the game and I found out my hut was raided doors blown to bits and everything was stolen. I found out who did it I farmed and I was preparing for my revenge. I got a lot of explosives guns and I spent hours and days farming and building. Then I came to the house of the guy who raided me before. I blew all his doors got inside his fortress took all of his stuff destroyed everything he owned. Then I took all his clothes and when he was lying there naked I smashed his head in with pickaxe. I made sure his building privileges were lost and invited some strangers to live in his house. I built doors so he wouldnt come back inside. I took my sweet revenge.

We even captured one of them in the exterior battlements and used him to draw blood for medkits after setting him free he began building shelters all over the place creating a small ghetto town outside our base.

This game to me sends me on a rollacoaster full of emotions starting off on a wipe feeling like bc you have been killed as a fresh spawn 10+ times then eventually feeling better because you were able to start a base with your tribe (Max Barbas and Ryan). I have had some amazing experiences in this game with being in so many raids that its impossible to count them all and then also making so many bases that it is hard to count. I have made a lot of dank mates while playing this game (TSGH) but also made a lot of enemies while playing as well xD.

I am happy to leave legacy Rust in the past!

2016-02-24,0,0,103,True,Recommended,If someone were to ask me in a short sentence what rust is I would say 'Minecraft with better textures and move pvp'. In the simplist of terms that's what I think rust is.Is it good/worth buying?Yes if you have the time to play it. Rust is a game that requires many hours and a very hard grind to get the good stuff you have to go around collecting blueprint fragments and resources the majority of the time. Especially if you want to do any good raids (which will need c4 and rockets). If you don't have atleast 2/3 hours a day to sink into rust I would not recommend buying it.What are the negative aspects of the game? For starters it could still do with more optimization Secondly It has a extremely high amount of pvp it should have some servers where pvp is limited (so it could expand its playerbase by diversifying its target audience.Overall rust is a great game its biggest issue is most likely the fact that you have to play so much to be able to obtain the best things in the game (and only on the particular server you are playing on),Rust

2014-03-11,0,0,165,True,Recommended,Still need to play this game more before I can feel entirely confident in my review but I can say that in the brief time I've been playing the amount of entertainment I'm experiencing is incredible. It's challenging and the community can be brutal but some minor effort in making some friends can pay large dividends. I've been playing with a close group of friends and over the course of the weekend we've become known on our server and have begun setting up a large scale base which we hope we'll eventually use as a staging area to get into skirmishes with other groups of people.It's hard to describe why coming back with a large haul of resources can be so exciting but mostly it's the risk/reward factor. Even something as simple as seeing a rock node in the middle of a field can get your adrenilin pumping because exposing yourself to attain that resource may cost you everything on your person. The best suggestion I can make is to do some reading on getting started as there's very little instruction. Additionally make it a priority to make some friends. In a post apocolyptic world your best chance of survival is to band together with like minded people. Rust does an excellent job of making this simple common sense idea a reality.,Rust

Up to and including your morality apparently cuz most every mother F'r I meet in this game takes a shot at me. I digress..... If... if you like rutting a living out of the mud. If you like killing pigs with rocks..... if you like running naked from mutant wolves.... if you like cowering under the moon by the fire fearing every sound the night brings..... if you like building your own home and defending it from people less inclined to create and more inclined to murder and theft.... well.... then your gunna LOVE rUsT!!!!!,Rust

2014-04-16,0,0,111,True,Recommended,Well what can I say? This game has very good promise about it the only problem being is you really need a group of friends to play with otherwise it is really hard to survive on a more populated server. If you are playing by yourself go on a smaller server and get to learn your way around the game before joining the larger servers. Other than that this game is great!,Rust

2016-10-06,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,I played this game ages ago on a friend's PC and really enjoyed it. Recently i bought myself a decent PC with the intention of using it in the living room like a games console. Unfortunately this game does not get on well with the steam controller. After days of trying to fix it I have finally given up. Apparently people were using mouse software to counter act gun recoil. It seems to counter act the cheaters using pseudo random placement of the cursor after firing or auto kicking people who had the supernatural ability to consistantly refocus on the exact same pixel in the exact same amount of time after each and every shot was too hard. Instead they employed the help of Easy Anticheat which is supposed to block the use of any mouse that could allow scripting. The irony of all this is that the only time the steam controller touch pad actually works as a mouse in the game is to aim. It's impossible to get through the menus or crafting with a controller despite the fact that you're allowed to set control stick &gt mouse emulation before launching the game proper. To add injury to insult if you try to set the triggers to emulate a mouse click you lose the abilty to click on all of your HID devices and can't even quit the game.I will be avoiding products involving either easy anti cheat or facepunch studios until one of them owns this up and corrects it.,Rust

2015-02-20,0,0,301,True,Recommended,I'll will try to make this review the most helpful for the people who hasn't buy the game yet. In advance sorry for my english who isn't really accurate(I'm french). So I'll be covering different facts on the game and I'll try not to give my personal opinion about it. I got 247 hours so I know what I'm talking about.So first what is Rust?Rust is a survival game where the primary danger is the other players you start on an island naked with only a rock to gather ressources. The first thing you'll want to do is gather some wood to build a campfire for the night craft better tools to be more efficient and after start your own base. Once you have a safe base you can try to equip yourself with guns or melee weapons by breaking barrels or going in radtowns. The game become interesting when people try to raid your base with C4(or maybe you'll attack before). Then only your strategies can save you or teamwork if you're with friends. The game start to become exciting and you understand why you bought it before. You start to get scared of losing your base and all your ressources that you farmed for such a long time your hand start to sweat and you're are stressed like you never been in other games. You hear gunshots and soon the bip sound of the C4...Good things+ Incredible ambiance Variety of guns Unique Cool with friends No major bugs for an early access game Active devsBad things Community of s (+ It's fun to kill them) Farming simulator Spawnkill sometimes you spawn and get killed instantly by a full armored guy Near impossible to play alone Did I say the community is Really repetitive(goes with farming)Pretty much it I do recommend this game because it's really awesome if you have people to play with and it reminds me of the good times I had playing Minecraft PvP/Faction...If you liked my review be sure to comment my profile and Go see my steam community Blue Comet Discord https //discord.gg/H9zvp5xYou can also send me a friend invite to play Rust once you bought it ),Rust
2017-07-07,0,0,174,True,Not Recommended,I have a love hate relationship with this game. its good but every patch has made the game less fun to play and more of a chore. 1st they added twigging and ladder raiding not cool as now everyone can bypass all your defenses and go in through your roof. every time ive been raided its been that way the safest spot to put your loot is your 1st floor because nobody will bother going in that way. 2nd they changed ore nodes so now stone is rarer than metal. they attempted to tweak this by adding a increased chance of stone nodes in forested areas. this fix did not work. 3rd they changed it so junkpiles only spawn on roads. so having a desert base or a snow base screws you over on important components. if your not built up by a monument your getting nowhere fast. 4th..... the game gets progressively worse with every patch. its like they want to destroy the game. they take things that work away and replace the mechanics with something broken. i understand the game is still in an experimental state but its rediculous. 5th even with all this said i will still continue playing this game because im stupid and have no self respect (.,Rust

I think its a good time that i will write my review of this game..Rust Legacy.Man a lot of you people won't even know how awsome Legacy was. The game was just so easy and simpel. There were so many hackers that didnt get banned but you didnt even care because it was just fun. I played like 400/500 hours in Legacy Untill the Beta version of Rust came out. And my PC couldnt handle it back then.Basicly what im trying to say is ""LEGACY was awsome back then but not anymore not even worth trying.""Rust Beta.So i've been playing the beta version since i had a new PC.Man i just fell in love with this game. Everything is just great about it. And the best thing is the delevopers listin to the community!!! Every week there is a update and if the community doesnt agree with a update they let them know and they devel. will try and fix it or change it. Thats just 1 + side of the game.Building is just better and way more creative than any other game i've seen or played. The PVP isn't 100% great in my opinion but its good enough for now.The community is just pure sh!te. There are some grownups but a lot of players are young and just trying the you off Maybe turning of the chat is a good thing to do if you can't handle young and childish players.So at the end i've played 1000+ hours in this game and its just awsome you have to get used to it but you def will fall in love with the game.

2017-08-07,0,0,217,True,Not Recommended,Really want to like this game I like the base building and exploring is somewhat enjoyable. But its impossible to play solo. Most servers people are roaming with aks and its impossible to defend yourself let alone defend a base from 4 full kitted people watching them destroy everything you grinded for days for and take it all forcing you to restart rinse repeat. Maybe fun with a group of people but I would NOT recommend playing this game solo whatsoever. Its impossible to progress without continuous grinding for resources even on a modded server. 99% of people on this game are toxic as all hell and will kill you on sight naked or geared. Especially on high pop servers you cant even create a wood base on a vanilla server by yourself unless you play at the dead of night when there is the least amount of people online. So no I wouldnt recommend this game unless you love to grind because of a 4 man team destroying all you built and takng all the gear you obtained solo.,Rust

2014-03-31,0,0,55,True,Recommended,In short it's great. It's still in alpha and it's just as good or better than it's competing games. It's a bit like Minecraft. Except Minecraft is friendly. Minecraft somewhat holds your hand. Minecraft is pretty happy. It has creative peaceful mode. Rust doesn't. Rust is mean. Rust drops you in the middle of a field with extremely minimal tools. You will die. A lot. As much or more than in any other game. (Except Flappy Bird which is in a league all of it's own. But I digress.) And whether you're killed by wolves bears or naked jumping men with shotguns you will keep going because you want to be at the level of your killers. All of your work days of gameplay can be wiped out within 10 minutes. Oh yeah did I forget to mention that when you close Rust you don't disappear from the game world? Instead you lie on the ground sleeping. Anyone can walk up kill you and take all of your inventory. Fun right? Now I know it probably seems from this like Rust is a mean terrible death trap. Guess what? It is! But it's a fun great death trap. And if you can make it past those first few hours and have a few friends who you know won't backstab you you'll be ok. And then you can be the naked jumping man with a shotgun who kills new spawns. It's great. Have fun!TL DR Buy it. Now.,Rust

Ever wish that some one should just walk up and kill you literally 2 mins after freshely spawning in? Look no further! there are countles 13 year olds who will be doing just that! Then to call you a bunch of things and brag about how they just shot you 10 feet away with a gun well you only have a rock all well screaming into their mike with their high pitch pre puberty voices! Don't worry about combat logging because in this game you're charecter is always on the server! whether that means for a quick Alt F4 not to get shot or just to get off for the night. Instead of doing the logical thing of only laying down for a minute or so you will now be laying down from the moment you get off to the moment you are back on! Whether that means for ten minutes or 3 days! so dont exspect to be able to just pick up where you left off because odds are you are already dead! Not to mention you need incredible luck just to make it to the metal door stage. With all that aside Rust is very pretty and can be fun once you win the lottery of making it to the ""I have a big fancy gun"" stage. Only till a small child blows you're brains out well hitting a large rock or till he breaks in and has his way with you're sleeping body.

2014-04-01,0,0,1568,True,Recommended,Rust is a game for friends because trust is an absolute must.While you can play solo you'll need several people at least to build and maintain a home and protect it from attacks as well as to raid others. This game constantly has you on edge staying alert of your surrondings is the only thing that keeps you from getting shot and loosing everything you've gathered. It requires a lot of attention staying away to long from this game will see that your homes defenses slowly decay from attempted seiges and natural degredation.The community itself tends to be hostile trust no one. Someone begging for food is likely trying to get you to open your door to break in and kill you. An inocent freshspawn with no gear is likely stalking you for a larger group. The built in push to talk button makes social engineering an interesting factor. Your enemy will likely try to convince you that they're a good guy before they shoot you. Or very rarly maybe they are friendly you figure it out.all in all this game stole 100 some odd hours of my life so I like to think that its a pretty good game even if it is still early alpha and lacking in a lot of ways. The core game itself though is solid.,Rust

2014-04-01,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,This game is one of the reasons I no longer trust pre release steam games. Garry (the creator) has been horrendous about keeping us updated. After the community got to him enough he began to give us updates but they are all in a tone like he's annoyed by the fact that people wish to know where their money is going. We make him millions and expect a paragraph a week in return not too much I'd say? Regardless the game has the most toxic community I've ever seen. The game encourages farming new people never giving them a chance to ever enjoy the game. If you're the first person on the server and you grind congrats you've just won yourself the game while making it 0 fun for anyone else involved.In addition to all of this the game has numerous bugs. Which is expected but Garry doesn't seem to be fixing them. He's adding in gimmicks like item durability which punishes new players and is working really really hard on an item editor!! Perfect! Now when the item editor is finished and released Garry doesn't have to do any work whatsoever just let the modders take the game and do with it what they please while he takes alllllll the money.

2015-06-17,0,0,320,True,Recommended,Rust is a phenomenal game. It's still very much in development but having played from when it was still new and keeping up with it throughout all the updates I can honestly say that I'm impressed by the progress. Rust definitely still has a long way to go but it keeps on getting better and better. I'm looking forward to continuing to play Rust as the game gets updated and I'll be very happy when I see the game reach full release.,Rust

2017-09-10,0,0,1736,True,Recommended,First off if you are wanting to buy this game it is not really for casual players/people who are not going to play a lot throughout a span of a week. (Unless you play modded/battlefield) &gt P.S. THE COMMUNITY IS TOXIC FOR THIS GAME DONT CRY ABOUT IT IT IS WHAT MAKES RUST.... WELL RUST!Right when I bought this game in August of 2016 I really had no idea how it worked even though I was playing with friends the game was hard to pick up on. As I progressed and played the game mor each week I started realizing the aspects and building of the game. I started on modded because that's what my friends were playing and it was easier. At this time cave bases were a thing (and im not talking about the spaces for 2x2's and 3x3's I'm talking about the cave bases that costed 30 C4 to get into a loot room). Anyways playing the game solo when new is not really a good option especially if you have no idea what you are doing and it will be hard for you to pick up the game. I feel like now FacePunch is starting to take the game more seriously because they are consitently adding new things to the game every week whether it is new monuments guns optimizations or just new aspects (like twig building) or by just adding new people to their team. I respect them for adding the roadmap because now I know that this game will probably get out of early access unlike other games I think would (ARK DayZ) because I think those games are slowly dying out and the devs for those games dont care as much as facepunch does. If you end up getting the games there will be a lot of hard times and raging moments but through all of that the other aspects of the game is very fun like PVPing (and actually killing someone) raiding or just building if you are that type of person.I STRONGLY reccomend this game though if it is what floats your boat.,Rust

2017-07-01,0,0,35,True,Not Recommended,I've played the game for a while now and i feel like i should warn new players. Dont expect the game to be fun in the beginning. There are people with guns and huge bases everywhere and they shoot at everyone they see. You're basically gonna get bullied A LOT until you managed to build your own base. From that point forward you can start bullying nakeds. I regret buying this game. A lot of the people are genuine s. and i mean really. You just played for 2 hours and finally got some stuff together? they raid your base and blow it up with c4 for no reason. They destroy your sleeping bag so you dont respawn. No matter where you place your base people will find it and they will destroy it. Also avoid trespassing near buildings which is gonna be insanely hard because people built stuff everywhere. you cant even find a place to start a base. if you just think this is just a rant buy the game and try it out for yourself. prepare to get shot a lot even if you're an innocent naked with a rock.,Rust
2013-12-15,0,0,61,True,Recommended,This game is a solid survival game which is enjoyed best with friends.

2015-08-22,1,1,945,True,Recommended,Awesome game I loved playing it everyday but there are a few things you should consider before purchasing. If you're playing this and are still going to school you're going to have a tough time defedning your base. You have to be on everyday to repair your defenses and foundation (as they decay) if you dont play for a few days your house will crumble unless you're part of a clan that will look after things but trying to get into a clan is like trying to stick your in a cheerio. DON'T BUY IF YOU GET OFF EASY.... This game will make you violent demon from hell if you lose most of your good loot trust me. If you can control your temper by all means go for it but be warned there are little out there they will hack and grief your base and take your hard earned loot. This games got a long way to go there's a lot of work to be done but for the time being it's pretty good and fun IF you have friends. If you play solo its much harder. So grab some friends and play also this may ruin some friendships as iv'e seen good childhood friends turn on each other over who ate the last wolf meat or who researched the ak47 so good luck!,Rust

But in all seriousness Rust needs work but if effort is put into it it will be worth my 20 dollars. As of now yes it is a fun game to play... with friends. Being alone in Rust is like being on a plane full of terrorists with nothing to defend yourself with. Yes I do recommend this game. Only because it has much potential and if you wait it will turn into a game worth waiting for.,Rust

2017-07-08,1,1,88,True,Recommended,I'm probably still a noob in this game with my playtime and my experience but i still felt like writing a review about this game because the experience is very interesting to say the least.First of all I have never played PvP open world survival and I'm the biggest virgin when it comes to playing that kind of genre. So why the did I start playing rust? Simply answered I wanted a new experience and I got excactly what I expected The first 5 hours was me trying to build a base or even to get stuff to build a base and be killed everytime I saw another player. I managed to build a base but had no codelocker yet so we basically got (we is me and my friend). We joined a new server after wipe and my friend found some people who helped him get a base. We started expanding our base and helping those guys. In return they helped us and gave us weapons and ressources to enhance our base even more. I killed almost every naked guy I saw. Sometimes I spared nakeds when I heard them talking and stuff. I told them to go away and felt really professional when they did (hihi). First raid with our neighbours. Pickaxing foundations and trapping enemy in their base. It was fun. Friend got killed by spearguy I save him and get his shotgun and stuff back. Sweaty hands. I made lots of friends gifted my neighbours stuff and started to leave clothed people alive and made friends with them. Some clothed people talk to me and say they are friendly I open the door and they kill me. Sweaty hands. I trap them in thefirst sector of our small base and let them starve to death after shooting a guy. Mighty shotgun trap saved my Friendo was offline. I was sweating like After that all my confidence was gone every naked and clothed guy was not trustworthy and I basically got trust issues with everyone while my self esteem was suffering hard from being able to be raided and I was scared of going outside.Oh and they could improve optimization game ran like diashow with high settings (my pc isn't the best tho).TLDR Sweaty hands and trustissues.*Edit I can't go to sleep because I'm scared I'll be raided.

It is a game about going in building something that you like getting a revolver but wait. Stop right there while you where dreaming of hunting with that revolver guess what. You got raided by a 3 person clan and all you had to defend yourself was a couple ""weapons"" that are more like butter knives than spears or bows and arrows for that manner.

The worst part is is that if you took out the worst aspect of this game then there'd be no point. The people the community of people who play on these servers are pure evil. If you don't start playing on a wipe day or group with people you will be griefed bullied and harassed to no end. There are 12 year old kids screaming racial obscenities this is sad. This is the reason I went as far as renting a server so I could play Rust without all the toxicity with friends. I enjoy this game its a great game. The community is gross,Rust

2017-08-10,0,0,1274,True,Recommended,I cannot stress the ammount on fun you will have with this game. What I recommend is that you join a server called combat tags and you are able to try out weapons get better and learn aimcones and spray patterns for specific guns. Then you will should join a battlefield server where you get to experience a 3v1's roofcampers ect and how to deal with them. Next if you want more high pressure situations where your blood gets pumping play battle royal. Its essentially the hunger games but in rust. After doing these for a little while or just jumping straight into the game YOU get to choose what you want to do next. There are so many different playstyles in Rust and you need to find which suites you best. You could be a painter or you could be a pvper and never farm or maybe even a farmer if you got time to kill. It doesn't matter what you do this is Rust you will make friends you will get betrayed.

2014-06-05,0,0,145,True,Recommended,Rust is an fps survival game where you have to gather stuff hunt animals craft study explore. The world of Rust is huge there's no map or compass so you have to find your own way check the sun and mountains for directions this gives an extra level of realism to it because even if you know the map well it's still pretty easy to get lost.You can farm rocks for ore chop wood hunt animals for fat cloth meat leather. You can build your own shack or house if you have enough material you can build a fortress. On the map you can find little cities factories abandoned buildings most of these places have spawn points where you can find important loot bullets blueprints guns even but most of these places have radiation so you will need protective clothing or rad pills to spend enough time there. Oh blueprints you need them to be able to craft the more advanced stuff but you can also research with research kits and learn how to craft something that way. Basically the world of Rust is not really dangerous if you watch out for animals (bears wolves) and the heavily radiated zones. The fun comes in with multiplayer and you want multiplayer because gathering can be fun for a while but what's gonna happen when you have the biggest fortress and no one to protect it from? Boredom.There are around 4 5000 servers at the moment some of them are heavily populated ( up to 200 players per map ) others are almost empty. In Rust if you join a server you will have a character on that server you can build stuff gather resources study blueprints but you can't take your stuff / knowledge to a different server if you choose a different one you will have to start from zero.If you are new to Rust I suggest you to start on a less populated server preferably a friendly or noob server so you won't get killed in the first 5 minutes. What am I talking about? You will probably get killed in the first few minutes but that's Rust for you. The best is to find some buddies to play the game with alone it's really hard especially if you have to stand up against 3 4 bandits raiding your house and loosing all your stuff after gathering it four hours can be really painful trust me.After many hours of gameplay I have finally found a server where most of the people are friendly we have a village and events from time to time and the best times are when there are bandits on the server and everybody works together to protect our land. The game itself is not very complicated the basic gameplay can be exhausted after 15 20 hours but the fun starts when you find a good community with cool people.The game is still in early access so a lot of things will change. I keep checking the developer's blog and they are basically rebuilding the game so the next Rust is coming and it's going to be ever better. Can't wait.,Rust

2014-06-10,1,1,157,True,Recommended,I really enjoy this game but do have some complaints. I have 40+ hours on this game but definetely didn't enjoy the all. Some problems i had are noob killers. New players stand out so it seems that guys with alot of items simply murder them because they can. Another issue is you cant remove building pieces that you placed. I also feel they need to add more weapons and limit how tall you can build your house because those huge skyscrappers bother me. Now for the good stuff. Once you get started and aren't struggling every minute to survive this game i EXTREMELY fun and quite addicting. It's also great once you start a group. Once in a group you can feel confident and take on enemy groups. (NOTE dont get too confident) The rush of running from groups of enemies firing at you with assault rifles or evading groups of wild animals through the mountains is like no other. Considering Rust is $20USD I would say if you like FPS or survival games pick this game up.,Rust

2016-06-30,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,I'll be honest... I loved this game when I first bought it. I enjoyed basically everything the game had to offer.... Mostly. You get to build and gather craft and hunt explore and advance. But at some point all of that gets taken away from you over and over again. I can only explain the frustration to others of how much it sucks to have your hard work taken away forcing you to start over. And then having it taken again. And then again. AND AGAIN. (I think you see the pattern) It wouldnt be such a problem if it wasnt this way on every server But it either is Or it's deserted. But lets say you do advance by some miracle. Miraculously surviving the onslaught. You get the best weapons The best armor recources and house you could want. Now what? Will you meaninglessly collect more build more or re explore? Oh How about this. This is a good one. Kill all the naked's you ever see ever just because you can it makes you feel good And because it's funny. )No but really Unless your goal is strictly to kill naked cavemen (or cavewomen) who dont have anything but a rock and a stick or to have the same done to you I just cannot recommend this game.,Rust

Personally I hope that the future updates will improve the game's player interactions in any way possible perhaps allowing us to take prisoners add an interesting enemy for players to unite against and many other things.,Rust

2014-07-09,0,0,397,True,Recommended,Generally I really like survival based games. I've enjoyed watching Rust develop over the last few months and lately their newest additions have really impressed. If you enjoy building and doing your best to survive in a post apocolyptic situation I would definitely reccomend this game.PVE players please currently purchase this title with caution. If you can find a PVE well administrated server you're golden to have a good time however the PVP servers or the PVP players trolling PVE servers can be quite frustrating. Overall this game will be better when private servers are more accessable and affordable.EDIT Updating this post since the newer additions to Rust have been made playable. I have to say that the way they have revamped this game is absolutely beautiful. While it still has a long way to go in development stages you can really see this game start to shine as of late. I love a lot of the new features the graphics are gorgeous and housing/shelter is so much easier/nicer to build!,Rust

2014-04-21,0,0,285,True,Not Recommended,In its current state I cannot recommend this game. The community in the game is already full of people who are terrifically well off on servers with any kind of population. The play area is very large but sadly still not big enough is actively playable in the games current form. Its a constant flow of farm up stuff to get somewhere oh damn its late im tired. Get on the next day or heaven forbid take a day off and two days later you login. All your stuff is gone because one of the 5 people on the server who have nothing better to do have blown your door out and taken all your stuff. The game should be free right now to try with limited servers but thats just my opnion. Neat idea its just too early to be really fun.,Rust

2016-06-21,0,0,233,False,Recommended,I love this game. So many things about this game are great.Gameplay is a lot of fun. It can be tedious at times to get resources and materials but overall once you get set up it's really not an issue anymore.Making bases is pretty creative and you have to find all sorts of ways to keep your base from being easy to raid. Many bases end up with like every room in a 1x1 area has doors just to make the raiders waste more resources to get to the good loot.Raiding other bases is the really fun part though. You spend most of your time surviving and gathering resources so you can survive better but when you really don't need to worry about survival anymore you worry about keeping trust bonds and alliances with other groups in your area (Great way to meet new people). If those trust bonds you feel aren't worthy enough to keep or you feel like betraying them you just blow their walls sky high greet them with an Assault Rifle and blow them to the ing moon.Devs are good with keeping the game updated and glitches and bugs are ironed pretty quickly. I've seen better in other games but Facepunch isn't lacking when it comes to keeping the game good.Performance isn't much of an issue if you have a mid range gaming pc. I have a Radeon 270x and can run this game at 30fps on max graphics so I'm not complaining about the performance.BEAUTIFUL game btw.Roadmaps are realistic and can be achieved. They might be behind sometimes but they catch up very quickly.All in all game is amazing and I 100% recommend it.GG Facepunch.,Rust

How about you buy it and give it a try for yourself? P,Rust
2014-06-06,0,0,54,True,Recommended,This game has a good outcome considering it is still in an Alpha state the playability makes it more fun to play with friends or the friendly community that allows a more entertaining experience. However there are people who tend to go around kill random new players around which may ruin the experience for others. Nevertheless it makes a good gameplay and the concept of survival makes it much more challenging for other players considering it is a PvP server where the populated servers would usually have a lot of bloodshed.,Rust
2016-09-24,1,1,317,True,Recommended,Rust is hard but fun.This game is catered to players looking to grind meet friends establish themselves and ultimately survive in an unforgiving world. There is a lurning curve for new players but once this is overcome the game mechanics feel just right. So get the game get a few friends and grind it out until you have supremacy against most other people in the server (then I guess you can kind of be a and be toxic)WARNING Toxic players are high especially in bigger servers. If you are new get a few friends and start on a fairly smaller server.,Rust

2016-01-10,0,0,1151,True,Recommended,Saying that Rust is as fun as it is has updates and is arguably cheap. For the price it is one of the highest quality games in my library. Rust is the kind of game that if you allow it to it will consume all of your time and you'll quickly find out that your hooked and only play Rust when you get on Steam. Atleast that's how it has always been for me however great that may seem I have always reached a point where i've played the game so much in a certain period that I lose complete interest in the game and have to move away from it and explore other options.

2014-11-22,0,0,216,True,Recommended,"Worth ItIf you've got friends that will play the game with you I don't think there's a better place to put your $20 (at the time). Having played more than 150 hours of the Legacy Build (The one seen in the ""First Day Trailer"" at the time of this review) it was a super welcome addition to see a full referbishment of the game's overall look and building mechanics It's a real piece of eye candy. The game is super easy to get into and should have you hooked after you're first night without a shelter. The crafting is made easy with large text and simple to navigate catergories and most of the items that you need to get yourself started with aren't incredibly hard to scout ingredients for.Player interaction is a bit of a grey area because in the end it mostly comes down to kill or be killed. While it's very rare that you'll encounter a stranger that either legitimatly wants to help you out by giving you some food or tools it's not impossible and for the times that you do encounter a crazed murderer who can't be bargained with it's relatively straight foward to deal with them as long as you've established yourself and play your moves right.Raiding or being raided can you give the biggest rush you've probably ever got out of a game when you've got a couple bolt action rifles (incredibly hard to come across in Legacy) on the line. It's common for me to be unable to get control of my mouse during a heated raid with friends because of how much I'm shaking IRL.Yes the game can make you feel like a pile of dirt when you've got your valuables in transit and a rookie comes and surprises you with the perfect shotgun he found but it's got a sort of lingering appeal that makes you want to do it all again.Overall it comes down to who you're gonna play the game with as it can lose some of the appeal that I just talked about if you're playing alone. Find some friends that are keen to play and you should be set for a couple 4AM late nighters. Definetly recommended.",Rust

Ahhhhh Rust A survival game that doesn't need Zombies Mutants Cannibals (Or any combination of the three for that matter) to leave you scared beyond reason. It truly encompasses what it means to be in the ""Survival"" genre. An outside threat shouldn't be necessary to make you wary. Starving in a forest through the black of night with wolves bears and other players all out to kill you and rip the blood caked rock from your mits should be more than enough to keep the adrenaline flowing. If you've played Rust before you've most likely experienced many a situation similar to the afformentioned horror. If not you now have a pretty basic understanding of the game. I would like to take this take to inform you of the evil that awaits you beyond the ""Play"" button.

The crafting funtion needs a little work but the idealogy behind your creations is pretty much limitless from Pacman buildings to towering skyscrapers 80 floors high! You build as YOU see fit!Although the game itself is at present only about 10% finished I would wager it has more playability than most completed games out there and I am eager to see how well this developes into potentially one of the best games on Steam to date.,Rust

2017-02-05,0,0,54,False,Recommended,The game is ridiculously hard to start sometimes on populated servers but the community suprisingly isn't full of jerks only some people are very nice and help you get started. If somebody doesn't help you you're in for a hard start to the game avoiding all people with guns trying to get resources without getting shot. Sure there are bears and wolves but though your biggest help is other humans your worst enemy is humans as well. This game is for very hardcore players and that is what I like about it. WARNING I do NOT recommend getting this game if you have an older computer. It is a great game don't get me wrong but it is VERY resource demanding and will run at around 10 fps on the lowest graphics for bad computers. Once again though if you DO have a computer this game can run well on then I very much recommend it.,Rust

2015-06-19,0,0,37,True,Recommended,While a work in progress and Early Access is always frustratingly slow (for us consumers) Rust shows a true potential as a game about true anarchy in realistic environments. Let me say that I hate playing PVP so I can't judge the game on that. But the PVE elements of hunting building and soon farming are absolutely brilliant. Also one of the big draws for me for this game was the practical and nonexploitative use of player nudity even with the new WIP female character. Total respect for having human bodies being what they are a vehicle for the soul. (That and a reliable food source apparently Dx ),Rust

The crafting and base building is ok (stolen from fortnite) but other than that there is nothing to do apart from go on raids (world of s term i merely call it a stroll myself) to the same few locations again and again for the same limited items that currently inhabit this game. ""Remove Zombies Remove Zombies Remove Zombies Remove Zombies"" holy now there is absolutly NOTHING to do whats wrong with the zombies the only joy i actually got from this game was sneaking into one of these rad infested areas looking for loot dressed in a potato sack with my pet rock named eric and my pistol and a couple of rounds and then cautiously searching the buildings whilst looking out for and dealing with zombies whilst exploring it added a real sense of survival as the zombies were rather relentless and killed you quick. You could say ""thats what other players are for a sense of danger"" and your somewhat right but when you successfully defend yourself from a zombie horde and stand victorious over your fallen enemies they then dont start abusing you over the public chat system or shoot you the instant you spawn into the game with only your underwear and your pet rock. Other people are the real problem with video games all this online always connected to some other sod this could have been an excellent survival game but all its starting to come accross as is just counter strike with base building.",Rust

2017-02-16,0,0,398,True,Not Recommended,"Addictive and engaging at first but the community will get on your nerves fast.Building your first house crafting your first set of gear and exploring the area for the first time feels great. The initial steps are rewarding and fun but after a while you'll realize that you can't escape the fact that this is a PVP open world game. In terms of success you get out exactly what you put in. And the average Rust player is putting more in than you. If you're picking up Rust just to play casually you will get steamrolled by groups of people whose only source of enjoyment is in annoying other players.I have a hard time connecting with anyone in game. I don't know if it's kids or just people who aren't the brightest but you could even be giving stuff away and people would still try to kill you with a rock right after spawning in. The chat is a nonstop stream of slurs and posturing (e.g. ""i just killed two geared f****ts with bow headshots kill yourself n****r""). I don't care what language people use but it's symptomatic of a very immature playerbase.The two observable goals of Rust are 1) Prove that you're the best and 2) Make sure no one else is having fun. Two people once spent at least half an hour clicking on the wall of my hut. The chest I had inside was worth less than the 50 metal pickaxes they consumed breaking in. On another occasion someone waited at my doorway staring at their screen for 20 min until I came back from collecting resources. They didn't even end up getting anything but it didn't matter. The real prize is undoing other people's progress. Clans will have people taking shifts so that they can raid people as they go offline and not get raided themselves which makes casual play impossible.You might think I don't recommend this game because of the toxic community. In part this is true but ultimately I just didn't find a worthwhile goal to keep me playing.",Rust

People who like Survival games People who like online games People who like raiding other people's bases People who like epic gunfights People who like gathering resources and building bases People who play ark I don't recommend Rust for... People who dont like gunfights/fps People who dont like ark People who dont like gathering resources and building bases People who dont like losing stuff/bases (when offline) People who dont like the system with all the servers People who dont like to play with other people Rust Long Review What is Rust? Rust is a survival game where you find resources and craft guns build bases and kill other players. The game is only multiplayerand works with a system that uses servers (like ark). Everyone can make one of these server (you can also make a private one for you and your friends). The game also includes animals random buildings to explore AI vechiles to take down and grab the loot from and ofcourse the other players Why did i buy it? Its a great game to play with loads of friends and very time consuming i really enjy games where i can put 100+ hours in and still play with the same excitement as when i started playing. i would really recommend the game if you have some friends that can buy it too its deffenitly not expensive for this type of game Whats the goal of the game? Build a base make guns and kill everybody then you can capture their items or base and use the items that you find to raid the next one. At first it might look repetitive but its always fun to explore new bases and find new loot! How does this game stand out? first The players. You can meet so many new players that eventualy become your friends. as example at my favourite server where i buyed vip at that server and meeted 4 people we started to skype together and joined the same clan now after 50+ hours with that people their almost my best friends ) How are the graphics the music and the world?The graphics are very good and its nice to run around in the game there are a lot of biomes to explore and every biome has diffrent cave's buildings and other cool stuff the music is a little dowpoint... let me put it this way there's almost no music. Whats bad about it? The music is bad the lag can sometimes be annoying but that depends on the server you are playing on. How are the devs/community?/b They're fantastic like i said its fun to meat new people in the game. there are a lot of people who are glad to help you )and the devs constantly add new content and make the game greater! How about mods/workshop content? you can buy some pretty nice skins in the steam market there are no other workshop things. Is it worth the price? Yep i cant recommend the game more its just so good!

2017-08-24,0,0,1047,True,Recommended,"Let me start off by saying this game is amazing hands down.I clearly have a ton of hours on this game and for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one. After I started mechanic school along with my full time job I realized I had less time to play so I started playing modded servers with slightly increased gather rates so that I could still enjoy the game to the fullest but spend less time. Unfortunately servers wipe every week or every other week or if you are on a very unpopular server maybe even a month. I say unpopular for the month wipe servers because the game dies every single wipe usually about a week in that is why the weekly wiped servers are by far the most popular and most played. If you don't have at least 2 4 hours (depending on your luck/skill) to play consecutively then do not buy this game. When you log off your character goes to sleep on the ground and you are basically free loot. You MUST build a base upon starting on a new server or fresh wipe. This games main problem is how time consuming it is to be able to have fun (IMO) I'm honestly not sure how they would even fix that without completely changing the game so I'm not complaining about it I'm just forewarning anyone on the fence about buying this game If you do not have a solid chunk of time to dedicate to this game on a daily basis you shouldn't buy this game. If you have 4 6 hours straight of each day you need to occupy Look no further you found the perfect game. On a side not for anyone that is going to buy this game It is competitive and cut throat if you think you're going to join a server and find help then think again. You will spawn in naked with a rock and see someone with a gun and a huge base and think ""awesome this guy can probably help me out and give me some starter quot WRONG! He is going to waste 40 bullets on you for some unknown reason just so you can re spawn naked with a rock to repeat the same process in front of some other s base.all in all 10/10",Rust

It's the most fun Sandbox Survival game on the market (in my opinion) But the game has many flaws.The game is heavily unoptimized The game tends to become more playable with steady FPS with each update (generally every week or so)There is a ton of content to Rust and more and more content comes with each update. The community behind the game tends to be pretty awesome most of the time as well. The community is so creative as well. The game comes with Steam workshop support + mod support/Plugin support for servers. Sadly Facepunch (the studio behind Rust) Doesn't give out server keys Meaning you can't create your own dedicated server. You have to rent servers. If you're a fan of the Open world Sandbox survival genre Rust is a must. The studio behind the game updates it every week or two and releases plogs on the FacePunch Dev Diary. Warning If you don't have a high end rig You may suffer from Frame drops and lag.,Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,65,True,Recommended,"What can I say about this game that people already haven't?I suppose I should start by saying that this game is hard. Really hard at least for newcomers looking for a new survival game to play. This is by no means a ""realistic Minecraft"" in any way. Don't expect to be able to get far in this game fast by going solo or even with just 1 other friend to help you. As much potential as this game has I find it hard to play it without getting extremely frustrated by the fact no matter what you try to obtain to build a life for yourself in this game it can all be taken away with one well placed shot from a player more equipped than you (This is all based of PVP servers).I understand that that's the point of this game that it gives you the option to choose whatever path you take in this game whether that be good or bad but that's also the one of the game's flaws that can't really be changed since you run the risk of restricting the player to begin with. Unless you're just starting out 9 times out of 10 you'll just be gunning down every person that you stumble across. You kill them so that already sets them back in terms of items that they had on them and unless they had a spawn point and a decent base with extra supplies built up that means they start back from square one all over again. And even if they had a base built up I'm sure it would've taken some. if not a lot of those supplies to make whatever they had in the first place anyway. Killing other players off when you get the chance only gets you benefits in the long run.This is an Alpha though so I guess I really shouldn't be saying too much in terms of flaws this game might have since there is already bound to be SOME. I guess my only other question is ""How can they fix a part of the game that should give you free will to decide without restricting the player?"" I'm eager to see if they can come up with one.As for actually recommending this I would definitely do so but just remember one thing. This game IS NOT for the casual player. If you really want to play this game and get things fast play it with about 3 5 other friends if you can.Strength in numbers.",Rust

2016-04-24,0,0,630,True,Recommended,Rust... A game that I've put many many hours into &amp will do in the future but I like to leave it for a while for more stuff to be added.This game was hit hard when it came out for the first time &amp I hated it but when I came back to see the new and improved version of Rust it was great! The developers really listened to the community &amp that shows they do want to make a good game. They are also good because they update the game every 2 weeks so there will always be something new.There is a downside if you are an admin on a server then you probably come across people that call you admin abuser when you kill them or destroy their base but you ve collected everything the same as they have. This can get annoying for some people and does ruin the fun but sometimes when you see people really complain about it can be a right laugh so really don t let those people bring you down.Once you ve done everything and then the server wipes it can be a killer for you to start again but it can also be good but I do find it gets boring once I ve done everything they have and that s why I normally wait a couple of months before coming back to it as then there is more to offer.This is probably a top game that I like to play with other people and it s really good when you have a big group as people like to challenge you by attacking your base &amp always fun to find out who done it.My Pros Building Easy and fast to learn which is very good to have Combat With more weapons and guns in the game there is a big range that you can use to kill animals and other people so all good fun. Encounters Sometimes you make friends &amp other times you make enemies mostly enemies. Visuals The game looks very good and they keep improving.My Cons Kids But sometimes that can be funny. Replay Value Can get boring if you ve done everything before and just waiting on updates.This is a perfect game to play with your mates and work together to try &amp build an upbreakable base &amp become the tops ones in a server but be careful who you make an enemy as it could bite you in the butt.8/10,Rust

2016-12-22,0,0,153,True,Recommended,"I would glady recommend this game as long as you can deal with being hunted down as a naked child with nothing but a stone versus 2 guys wearing coffee cans street signs and weilding jury rigged ak 47's. I Understand the kill or be killed untrusting to everyone parts of the game its a survival game however theres a difference between killing to just survive and killing because ""Dude you're so bad thanks for the rock you noob piece of crap go get a job your parents dont love you."" The only reason why I have not given this a thumbs down is because the gameplay and the luck of finding a click to roam with and feel safe. Some of these guys have become true friends. But to stray back to before feeling safe going onto a server and being asked to slave for supplies to feel safe and being hunted down with a bounty placed on you as a naked if you deny the request is really really screwed up. I feel like this game just simply brings out the worst in people and it just goes too far it needs to be different somehow facepunch wouldn't want their game to be full of such horrible people...Find friends make friends somehow grin and bear the insults and rash behavior for the first day of gameplay i think you win.Other than that I recommend this game.",Rust

If youve played a game where everytime you die you spawn naked with your hanging out then i would say then there is one other simlar to this. Rust is a very fun challengeing game. One of the biggest challenges is is finding a person who wont turn around and shoot you murder you with a hatchet or smash your face with a rock. The game transforms you into a brutal killing machine atleast it did to me. 10/10 would bang,Rust
2014-04-01,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Interesting game with a lot of potential. The only real issue I found is it is near possible starting out on a populated server.

2017-06-25,0,0,217,True,Recommended,This game has elements of greatness and elements of terribleness. Overrall I think it's good. I *think*. I'm not quite sure because there are so many negatives. For example the game doesn't even work for some I had to download a mod that would let me launch it. Also the Easy Anti Cheat is horrible and bans random people and sometimes crashes your game. But at the core of this game is something amazing. The engine itself it good the look of the game is vastly better than a game like Ark Survival Evolved. If I had one huge complaint it would be to add more. More items because at the end of the day there's too much grind and not enough reward. You would have to grind for hundreds of hours to have a base made of the best material which is fine but there's not enough to put in that base. If there were just more things to do and to make I would say it's a great game. It's like Vanilla Minecraft. It's fun but you finish it quickly. Add more stuff.,Rust

2014-02-21,0,0,93,True,Recommended,"Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch the developer that brought you Garry's Mod. It is currently in very early alpha and in its present state there is a crafting system in place that allows you to build bases weapons armour and explosives similar to Minecraft but there is also the tense pvp/survival elements will have taken their inspiration from DayZ. Being that it is in Alpha there are of lot of game balancing issues that are being addressed such as the ease of obtaining C4 and its ability to swiftly take apart peoples bases.After running around for the whole day in game you slowly gather resources such as food ore and wood and slowly piece together something you can call home. Depending on which server you chose this can take a fair amount of time and having this all blown up in less than 10 minutes can be immensely frustrating especially on larger building that can take many hours by multiple players to build up.So for many the prospect of having all your hopes and dreams go up in ticking explosions of death has led them to leave the game until it's further in its development cycle with many asking for C4 to be removed altogether.While understandable the threat of losing everything adds an element to the game that keeps you on your toes as well as forcing you to get better. Don't like being raided all the time? Build better structures! Don't like being shot at? Craft guns team up with others be friendly (at your own risk) and learn to shoot back!One thing you need to know is that you cannot trust anyone countless times I've encountered other players who have a ""shoot on sight"" policy but active communication can prevent this and a bit of wit charm or having a tactical advantage (you already have them in your iron sights or a friend does) can lead to fantastic interactions amongst players with each encounter being difficult to predict. It's this uncertainty that makes the game exciting some people are honourable they won't kill you if you're a noob and don't seem like a threat. Others see you as target practice and that everyone is competition for resources and has the potential to raid you if allowed to build up the defences. Then there are the final type of player although they're not really players in my eyes. The hackers and Admin abusers. These lot have a detrimental effect on the game and can literally destroy everything in seconds. It takes no skill or real effort and stems from a person s desire to be malicious and vindictive. The recent Cheatpunch and VAC bans have removed a lot but with each new patch comes potentially exploitable data and so hackers are removed in waves rather than instant bans. As the game progresses these problems will be ironed out so if you're put off then I would recommend waiting a little bit until the development cycle progresses. Gameplay has minor bugs and there are a lot of placeholders such as every animal dropping chicken fillets or red bears and wolves carrying flares and blueprints. Stability is good there is only rare frame skips and seem to be more affected by server lag as opposed to the actual game engine. There is also clipping in places and some of the shadow textures is a little off but the overall the game runs well and should only get better.Combat at present feels pretty good melee actually feels like you're smacking them with a rock and gunplay is simple but effective with the hunting bow and shotgun feeling particularly satisfying.Despite these problems I would recommend Rust even more so if you have friends or are good at making them. It's a harsh world out there even more so in Rust. Time should be spent looking for a server that fits your play style and you may need to go through a few before you find a community that fits your tastes.Rust is like so many other open games in that the amount of enjoyment you'll get from it is up to you. There isn't a linear path or a story as such and it's left to the player s imagination and interactions with others to make this game. If you can stomach the initial onslaught spawn kills rage speak from squeaky kids and griefing then perhaps you'll find a good bunch of people and you can change how your server plays and build a community that thrives. Alternatively you can play as the silent hermit naked stone in hand with nothing to lose and not a hope in hell of surviving for long.",Rust

Or robs your house etc. The game itself is a great feel but it's the people that you run into that will ultimately make or break the game for you I have over 39 hours played and i have not once yet managed to sleep in my own house once without it getting blown up broken into or raided completely. I still enjoy the game but be aware ""If you're so mad that you lost all your stuff then maybe you should get your 20$ back"" Is a common saying used by the thick skulled ruffian raiders of many of the servers. Be prepared to hide Hunt and survive by the skin of your teeth because it's neither the rad bears nor the rad wolves that are dangerous It's the people.",Rust

2016-08-26,1,1,769,True,Recommended,Rust..... The game has had its ups and downs in development and you can choose to enjoy or whine about those ups and downs. Ive enjoyed them and when I havnt I take a break from Rust and let the devs figure it out. I love it and it has continued to be my favorite game of all time and I cherish it with my heart. The devs do listen to the community but overal it is their game and they can do what they want with it. Im not gonna list all the ups and downs cause most of the other reviews on here will but all im going to say is as long as the game is in early access the game will never be perfect but all it can do is improve. Not everyone will like this game it doesnt hold your hand through it all but if you can learn it and not scream at the devs when they jack up youll make it.

2017-06-23,0,0,379,True,Recommended,Rust is a really immersive game and one can have a whole heap of fun with it especially once you start meeting some people around the servers mind you there can be toxic times but for the most part servers are good at keeping the hate chilled at least to a degree but in the end just remember hey it's rust. That's the excitement of the game if you ask me that you truly have to T'rust' the people you decide to partner up with because at any moment they can steal from you rob you while you sleep kill you do just about anything not to mention that if you logg off your body just sleeps where you are making base building vital. So teaming up is a great idea if you get a good group of people or have friends who play. It's a blast try it out 3,Rust

2017-08-31,0,0,673,True,Recommended,"As someone with over 250 hours I can attest to Rust being an amazing game. However it does have flaws the game is designed for big groups and ""Clans"" emmerge which tend to dominate most servers praying on smaller groups of 2 or 3. Also sometimes no matter how good you are you get fed a plate of t and there isnt anything you can do about it. I would also recommend that anyone interested in doing the game for Youtube steer clear because content is often very hard to find. It is however a great game to stream. The PvP aspect of the game is done very well and has a crazy intense feel to it. The PvE aspect Is however not very challenging when you get to a point in the game were wolvers and bears are no longer a challenge but the helicopter would destory you if you challenged it. The game is also getting increasingly hard to run so if you have a weak computer I wouldnt recommend buying. The game also often has a grinding aspect and if you dont have any patience for that once again steer clear. Dev team is active updating the game every week which adds new things and helps keep the game fresh. Overall I would recommend you buy it but don't waste your 2 hour refund period because I might not work out.",Rust

2016-08-05,0,0,333,True,Not Recommended,What have you done!!This is so upsetting to see I only have two hundred hours but thats enough to see how the devs have totally destroyed this game. I must have put 150 of these hours in before the xp update when the game was playable enjoyable and fun. The devs have implamented a system that has destroyed what could have been one of the best games ever...The XP system. I am a full time worker and find my enjoyment of playing games in the evening i ran with a squad i killed noobs i had fun. Now i come home from work there is clans level 35+ burning and blowing everything in sight. This game is nothing any more the survival element has been taken away and replaced with a grind element. People dont even care for bases any more because they just get raided from the minute you build them instead you have clans fully geared with every weapon in the game just destroying everyone and everything. While it takes me 3 hours to get a metal pick axe....i mean come on. All in all this was one of the greatest if not the greatest ever PC game i played now its become awful. In its current state i would say dont buy it. Unless of course you have 12 hours a day to commit. check out Ark Wurm Xsyon all survival/crafting games that do what they promise and games where the DEVS have not totally ed the game!!Rant Over!,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,233,True,Recommended,Rust is a very good game for being in the alpha stage. Similar to minecraft you start out with next to nothing and must gather materials to build a shelter and feed yourself. I have enjoyed minecraft so right off the bat this is what attracted me to Rust. The graphics are pretty basic 3D so even people who do not have top notch systems may enjoy this game. The crafting system is pretty simple and easy to learn. For people who need help there is already a Rust wiki with quite a lot of helpful information for people just starting out. The community isn't too bad either usually whatever server you go to you can find a few helpful or friendly players that are willing to help out new players. PvP makes this game shine quite a bit. While some servers don't have PvP for people who do not care for that sort of thing the servers with PvP allow for players to fight each other anywhere as well as raid each others houses and supplies. As this can be frustrating it also adds even more exciting for gamers who like a high risk high reward scenario. The fighting in this game is pretty standard of any first person shooter game. The only trouble I have had is a little issue with lag but nothing I can really complain about. The amount of detail put into this game is also pretty impressive. Having to make sure you don't starve or if you suffer a laceration making sure you bandage it so you don't bleed out. Those are just a few things that make this game impressive. As this is game is still in Alpha I'm excited to see what the future holds for this game.,Rust

2016-12-12,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,"This game used to be good. I loved it it made me feel in a game that I haven't in a long time and that's fear and paranoia. However when they released a brand new version with a new map graphics and items I just didn't enjoy it as much as I used to. At leased it gave you the option to go back to the original ""Legacy"" version. Then after a few years removed the Legacy version.I loved the Legacy version and it did many things better than the new version we have now. Me and many other people would agree. Sure it had some bugs and opimization issues but it was in alpha at the time. It was also simple but not too simple plus it had a haunting atmosphere that gives me chills to this day. Plus at the time a massively muliplayer survival game was new. Rust was made in the survival game craze when survival games were first coming to light. Being masively multiplayer gave Rust a certain feel of fear and paranoia that other games just could not replicate. The new version removes that atmosphere and just doesn't pack that punch.To be honest I never thought this game would be that sucessful legacy or no this game has flaws that drive people away. The fan base is also very toxic and the game could easily be classified as 'silly'. If you someone like me who prefers more realistic and serious games then this is definatly not for you.",Rust

Admittidley I have probably spent 100+ hours watching people like Ser Winter and Vertiigo play so I was already at a good start prior to actually playing the game myself. Anyway yes the game is definitely worth 15. You spawn (make sure on wipe day) hit some trees and rocks get a starter base down. Then resource for ages until you can finally make a proper base make said base. After you have reached this point is where it really gets fun. You can craft guns explosives turrets better armour etc. then go around and slaughter people (which for most people unfortunately means killing defenceless nakeds). Even before this point going round with spears bows swords or whatever is also great fun! The game is just sick okay? Buy it!,Rust

Very few games inspire me to take so many screen shots and even after all this time I still look forward to playing. The is a fantastic game. If you are on the fence at all rest assured this game is well worth the money. My favorite aspect of the game is the way it brings out the different personalities and even moods of the multiplayers. Some days I find myself playing kind and helpful when I've had a stressful day at work maybe not so much.

2016-01-30,0,0,713,True,Recommended,With hundreds of hours spent between Legacy and the reboot I can always go back to Rust when I'm looking for a fun time to build explore loot and shoot. With thousands of servers and even more variety between each server available there's always something available to suit your needs whether it's a vanilla server to slowly build your empire or a 500x gather to build a city in an hour.

2016-07-08,0,0,58,True,Recommended,In my experiences with rust i have found that this game is best enjoyed with freinds and can be an absolute blast to play. Dispite this a large portion of the community can completely ruin this game for fresh starters as they kill you for no reason and without any care. i do not have any problem with the game but instead with the overwhelming amount of griefers who do not care if you are freindly or not but will kill you anyway meaning that you just like i have many times wasted alot of time collecting recourses to be shot by someone who is fully decked out with everything you could imagine.,Rust
2016-06-16,0,0,722,True,Recommended,simply awesome the amount of effort put every week by devs and the gameplay content is amazing could be way better but it will obviously come ENJOYING EVERY SECOND OUT OF IT.P.s need to find creative solutions for the majority of players killing everything maybe put servers that have infamous levels like in hurtworld so if u kill a naked as a geared guy youll get bad effects etc.,Rust

However after the promise of 'weekly' updates it has come to the point where the updates are taking upwards of 3 weeks to put out some of which have only made the game ridiculously broken the addition of durability being the primary concern as you now use all of your contruction materials repairing tools another being that we are now unable as of the latest patch unable to lay house foundations.Maybe if the game improves I will recommend it but for now... No don't buy it speak with your wallet and make sure the devs realise how much they are ing up by being lazy with updates promising big new features without fixing glaring issues that the community has spoken out about and using the same excuse of ""sorry no updates this week"" or ""sorry we're late with the update"" each time they miss a deadline when they promised weekly patches...

2013-12-13,0,0,208,False,Recommended,There's not really any winning this game sometimes you're on top sometimes you're being fisted mostly the fisting part. It's a constant struggle whether you're playing solo or in a group. Sometimes you'll get screwed by your friends sometimes it's just some rando not willing to take the chance or just some s who've gotten tired of hunting the wildlife. Personally I fall into the second category. There's no telling whether or not a naked player is a helpless fresh spawn or just some naked dude with an assault rifle. Before the creation of safe zones your best option when encountering new players naked or not was nearly always to simply shoot them take their stuff and hope they don't hold a grudge. Sometimes you're the one dishing it out but most of the time you'll probably be on the receiving end. The trick to actually doing well in this game largely relies on having enough free time to take care of your base and your willingness to accept and plan for your inevitable sundry failures and recovering from them. If you can't do that you're going to have a bad time.,Rust

2017-05-06,0,0,29,True,Recommended,"After what I can only assume was a shipwreck I woke up on a desolated island. I was naked hungry thirsty and at an utter vulnarable situation against mother nature. So I ran into the woods while I could. firtst night I was squandered by a heavy rain. Each rain drop was piercing my naked body. I quickly gather some woods to build myself a shelter. ""ah it"" said me. I give up trying and compromise on surviving the wild by eating mushrooms. Day 2 a fully geared guy runs after me at the dawn shouting ""Waitaup "". ""I'm friendly you "" He shouted while running behinde me. ""I ed your mom wai!"". I was raised an orphan. I never knew my mother. This was my chance the chance to finally ask about my mother! So I halted and turned back. ""Well "" I said while gazing on my chaser being maulded to death by a bear. Alas he died. he could have been my father. I picked up his gears after the bear was gone. A map A shotgun a armour a key and some foods. I use the map to navigate my way to his place believing I could have found traces of my mother. After a day of walking I finally get to his hut. A large sign was by his door written on it ""ISIS headquaters"" and below it ""May Allah enlargen your quot . As it seemed the chaser was a devout muslim. Before knocking and going into his house I checked the time to be sure he wasn't occupide with his prayers. Time clear. I could knock. As I tried to knock I accidentally opened the door. I had the key after all. I get inside his hut and all I see is sets of large furnaces with all of them being labelled with a boared ""Fuel the furnace with a jew"". How humble. I go furthur into the digs of his house and find his bedroom. The name of the bed was ""Bin Laden's bed"". Thereby I knew that the chaser was indeed Bin Laden. I waited in the hut for ten minutes twenty minutes an hour and hour and a half. The moment I had given up hope he showed up. He moved into his hut not knowing that I was there too.

2017-08-27,0,0,696,False,Recommended,Rust is a game that can really get your heart pumping whether it's a regular bow fight or running into 5 guys with full armor sets and AKs. Never in my life have I come across a game like this that can do that. You easily find your self binging and grinding this game like a good Netflix series. You'll be going from one stone node to the next and before you know it you'll be building a huge base filled with loot surviving using any means necessary and having tons of laughs along the way. It's such an expansive game that always has room for improvement. Rust is arguably THE best survival game on the market right now and even though there are always a few bugs that you come across along the way it's still a blast to play. For being only $20 it is extremely worth the buy.,Rust

2014-04-17,0,0,43,False,Recommended,Independent British company Facepunch Studios has developed a network game Rust based on the Source engine which became famous due to the modification of Garry's Mod. The game was influenced by such projects as Stalker Minecraft and DayZ. The first version became an analogue of DayZ which Facepunch Studios decided to create because of the unreliability of the original. With further development of Rust hunting for animals crafting booking and other useful opportunities appeared.During the game process it is necessary to engage in the extraction of various resources animal skins food boards. The game has a starter set of items and the rest of the things can be created from the mined items or obtained from other players. For example to extract meat you need to kill the animal and to get the boards you need to use an ax or stone to beat the tree.The user must constantly struggle with various difficulties low temperatures hunger attack of people and wild animals radiation. The game has a flexible system for creating items of clothing buildings weapons. Such a system is called kraft or crafting it is quite similar to the games of 7 Days to Die and Minecraft.,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,At first the game is fun even with all of the issues that come with playing a game in Alpha but the fun soon begins to go downhill pretty quick. The biggest hurdle in this game and the biggest reason why it shouldn't even be for sale is the fact that hackers run rampant in the game making it pretty much difficult for any new player to get started as the hackers simply farm new players for their inventeory and each time you are forced to star back with absolutely nothing. It is a great idea for a game and one that has some major potential but in its current state it is a complete waste of time.,Rust

2016-01-30,0,0,462,True,Recommended,Rust is that kind of game that either you love or hate it.The idea of the game and graphics are great. Lots of new staff and an active development process that is still on alpha stage.Just some stuff is feeling like non completely done Only the big groups have a clear advantage because you need to farm a lot of resources when you start playing. Blueprints and learning new stuff is essential if you want to be somebody in your server. Again if you play solo the average time forget about it because others groups of players with maybe somebody always online going further will be more in an advantage position as you and will get to have the necesary resources in order to raid your base.Like it though because I still have hope for a game like this,Rust

This was survival of the fittest.I batter a giant stone with my little stone. Mining it for a while I observe the horizon seeing clear sky Iceburgs snowy mountains. A world for the taking. I go on to batter a tree with my little stone to collect some wood. I craft myself an axe and swim to the main continent. I explore looking to find some form of furnace to smelt my ore I mined. Instead of finding a furnace I find another naked human being. He was alive and chased me with a spear and axe. I ran for my life as he viciously tried to hunt me down. I end up in an abandoned rail staton and I see a ladder to a roof. I climb he nearly got me but I escaped for the moment at least I thought. He wouldn't dare to climb as he knew I would've killed him if he tried to climb up the ladder to the roof of this demolished structure. ""HA! That's right!""

Rust is my favorite game in my steam library if not my favorite game played ever. I would consider Rust a second life for the typical gamer. By that I mean when you get really into Rust it will be on your mind at least half the time you're doing other Seriously If you've never been lost in deep thought while making a poop and you want to buy Rust. Some pros and cons I can think of off the top of my head Pros Looks beautiful. I consider Rust one of the prettiest games in my library. Even legacy has its charm IMO (a lot of people think it looks to dark/emo) Decent optimization. One of the most important things about games. Facepunch does it fairly well (at least you're not getting ARK lag) not exceptional but they're getting there. Cheap... Considering the content and lifetime of Rust I would consider the $20 stipend pocket change. Addicting. heroin Pass me the Rust. Rust isn't a game you're going to be forcing yourself to play. Diverse. Like building? Shooting? Melee? Socializing (eew)? Rust has something for everyone. Easy to have fun. DO NOT CONFUSE WITH EASY TO BE GOOD AT. Some of the funnest times I've had in Rust have been seconds after spawning on a server for the first time with nothing to cover my micro a rock in my hand.Cons Hackers. If experimental Rust hadn't usurped legacy as the preferred of the two we could bet that the game would still be overrun with hackers. I'm not saying there are no hackers there are just a lot less. Unpredictable community. Some might say toxic I however prefer 'unpredictable'. I actually love the Rust community as is that said I know people who don't play the game because they get instantly killed by players claiming to be friendly. Expensive. But earlier you said it was cheap what heresy! To be clear I consider $20 cheap for what Rust is now. Back in the days of legacy it was kind of a rip off. That's right Facepunch you dun just got called out. All in all the most fun you'll ever have in Rust let alone any game is when you're with friends. Whether they are covering your six in an adrenaline pumping firefight or singing a song about getting man butt around a campfire friends make Rust as fun as it is. I'll end this review with a shoutout to some of the best people I've ever met whether they be personal friends of mine or other players whom I shared memories with.To Mista and Farty two of my best friends IRL ya'll have been with me since the beginning. To Fireheart one time you said something so memorable about Rust that I turned it into a playlist on Spotify. In the past day we've had four days worth of adventure.To Liam I don't care if you're a redcoat you make memories like a yank.To The old legacy crew It's been ages since our fateful night of murder and yes everyone can hear you Software.To The Gary's Town group I'll admit I wasn't the best tenant but you guys were the best landlords.To The New Rust crew whether it be defending the pub or charging across fields we've had our share of fun and fury.To Everyone I've off you all are the majority congrats? I'm sincerely sorry but that's the game.,Rust

2017-06-25,0,0,1019,True,Recommended,Thinking of rust you would think that it would be lke minecraft 2.0... Rust is an in depth game with loads of different playing styles ypu can go from getting 0.5 times loot to 100000 times these time 100000 servers also give you explosives and guns when you spawn in.Vanilla servers are where you can play the game how it was meant to be this is 10 20 wood a hit and 8 stone a hit this usualy takes ages to build yourself up a base. Rust is not a long term game if you really think about it does start to get boring when you get a few more hours than me.Rust is a game where you can colaborate with friends and build the best base in the server or you can build seperatly and do friendly raids where you see design floors in your base and how easy it is to get to your loot room ect. In rust you can create clans and work togather and build an army and strive on any server build massive bases be a charity resterant shop and a slave. This just about summs up Rust hope this tells you a bit more about it thanks.Overall I would rate rust a 4/10 because of its glitches and toxic community.,Rust

2016-02-17,0,0,491,False,Recommended,"As of writing this review I have 130.4 hours in game 93.7 of which has been played in the last two weeks. So yes I am new to Rust but as you can tell from how much I've played I fell deep for this godamn game. I didn't like DayZ because I never felt connected with my character I didn't care for the ing massive map that only has stuff in 10% of it and the lack of animals and other players made it feel very spaced out. H1Z1 I have 178 hours in at the time of this review and I'll say that this game takes the survival game cake a thousand times over. It is NOT a better zombie game Rust doesn't allow you to race in a car as well but this game has a much more balanced gun system and bringing a bow to a gunfight the bowman can actually win. The base building is like nothing I have ever seen your character sleeps while you are offline so you can be killed by bears wolves and other players so having a base is actually important and quite easy to make a giant base unlike H1Z1. Rust if you are playing survival will make your heart rip apart losing your newly found pick axe and road sign kilt hurt just as bad as losing and AK and a full set of armor. When the verge of death becomes imminent your heart beats in your chest and you get nervous you don't want to lose what you spent hours collecting and no other survival game has made me feel that way so fast and with such intensity.Buy this game. Support Garry and team who are making Rust they update constantly and push new content out sometimes on the daily. Don't read any other review because I am telling you right now the ""risk"" you have in your mind right now doesn't need to exist. This game is worth every penny if not more.(average minimum wage in my state 7.25 so inorder for this game to be worth spending money on I want to play more hours than I paid for it. Say a 60 dollar game needs to be enjoying for more than 8 hours inorder for me to be considered worth it. In Rust I have 130.4 hours that means 945.4 dollars if I worked every hour I sank into this game. Which means yeah I didn't get that money but I did get a wonderful feel for such a ing ride.TL DR Bring friends bears suck buy the godamn game play on community servers.",Rust

2015-10-29,3,1,214,False,Recommended,"Rust is a MASSIVE open world game with plenty to do and is quite realalistic. You start out completly naked (literally) with only a rock and a torch and from there you can build homes/bases raid teamup gather materials and if you can survive the other players long enough even end up creating guns and take over some of the well know ""landmarks"" such as the dome and light house which exists on every server. I believe this game is an amazing social experiment as well kinda shows how humans would go about if we all just randomly landed somewhere with nothing whatsoever. My only complaint would be that there should be an option for singleplayer. There are many servers out there with little to no players that you could go on to get a similar effect but these servers are still wiped on occasion and sometimes you just want to play RUST without having to worry about losing your base. Another thing to keep in mind is that this game is absolutely gorgeous...if you have the specs for it. It is still an early access game so you do have to keep in mind the optimization on this game is not very good (the reason why they suggest a GTX 980 in their recommended system requirements). I run RUST on a EVGA GTX 970 FTW and with the recent updates I have noticed an improvement in my framerates which normally average at about 57 66 FPS much better than the 30 40 FPS I was normally getting before. I highly suggest this game for anyone who likes FPS and open world games as it combines both genre's perfectly D",Rust

Theres a variety of different ways that you can play rust including being a down right murderer to a simple explorer hunter or even a slave lord. It much more fun when you play with friends but it is still fine playing alone just dont expect to live for too long. I suggest playing Modded servers with TP (At this point in time) especially when with friends so you can meet up faster. All in all its a great game.Edit I still stand behind my review however as I have seen the game age I cannot say I have the same enthusiasm for the game that I once had.

Multiply is by 1000 carry the 10 and you still wont reach the amount of rage this game inticapats"" (RHINOcrunch)This game is recomended to anyone with a decent PC mine isnt very good but I still enjoy to play it even if i get killed because of lag or my game freezes. With 20$ you're buying a game that will not satosfy your survival thirst but it will make your PVP side overflow and its building system is amazing. ""If you can think it you can build it"" (Bill Nye not really)Crafting is great very balenced not much to say about it. THE DEVS! My god they are the very best weekly updates (2 weeks) and they add alot of content not just little bug fixes like other game developers do. They listen to the community and are willing to fix things that seem small for example people were complaining about the grass because it dropped FPS but Garry N. was a bit slow to it didnt believe it dropped FPS. Next update BOOM! You can lower grass quality. Of course its not the most ""realistic"" game but MANY people enjoy it even my good ol Uncle Rhino said he has over 1000 hours and still finds people who are better smarter than him and gives him reason to improve and find new things to do. In conclusion this game is just a blast to play a need to play if you get this game it will be worth at least a try again it takes alot of patience and some practice to the PVP system since the guns act alot like real ones in which moving side to side makes it alot harder to hit someone and the recoil on them is hard to control.

2014-04-02,1,1,3,True,Not Recommended,Lets see how do i describe Rust... Ah i know... BORING. This is Rust for those of you who haven't played. You run around aimlessly looking and hoping to god you find a bolder wood pile to mine materials off of. Then by the some shear luck you haven't starved to death by getting what you need to build your home and a fire to cook some food (providing you some how got lucky enough to even find some thing to kill to start with for food) you then start to slowly cradt bigger and better things. OH wait no you got killed by a mutated wolf who are every where and you cant kill unless you have crafted a much much better wepon. So back to the begining for you. So after 10 more tries of trying to get back to having a house because you starved to death because you couldn't find any food or materials to do any thing with and you just wasted hours of your life doing nothing. you start you journey to try and craft new and better stuff again . OH wait you got killed by another player back to running around aimlessly for hours on end and starving to death.This game SUCKS. i wish i could get a full refund. i cant believe i payed $20 so i could run around with my thumb up my rear for hours on end not accomplishing any thing because the games spawn ratio on the things you might need are so horrendous. Dont buy it. I should have never listend to my friend onb this one. I should make him pay me $20 for trying to coninnve me to buy this Trash.,Rust

2017-10-24,0,0,3656,False,Recommended,So after 3.5k hours I'll update the review I did after 2k hours.Rust improves all the time and has come a long way from what it was as both a PVP and survival game its good but challenging... if you are ready for a survival &amp PVP challenge I'd say try this game just beware that part of that survival is encountering other players you can decide how many players you want to encounter by selecting either a high or low population server but either way you'll come across both good and bad experiences... some may try and kill you on sight to take your shiz others might want to talk and be friendly. Prepare for either possibility )I've only played rust for about 2 3 year now but a lot has been added to the game in this time and I haven't checked everything out yet. I will say the game is easier with a friend many people play in groups and it is a very challenging game to play on your own... I spent most of my game hours solo and I enjoy it but it's not easy. Anyways I'd recommend this game if you have time to kill I play on a weak PC and GT 730 and it runs.,Rust

2014-10-23,0,0,1720,False,Recommended,"I really like Rust. Since Minecraft came onto the scene there has been an ever progressing attempt to find the perfect match between graphics gameplay and the open world experience within the surivival game. I've played most of these kinds of games including DayZ and 7 Days to Die.Rust is the definitive title for the crafting survival genre and ultimately in my opinion the pinnacle of the search to create a better survival game. (no I don't count DayZ survival game I see it more as a survival simulator and also at the top of its class).Rust has satiated my desire for survival games enough that I am not interested in others. ARK is good if you want the aspect of animal taming and husbandry.Rust combines the crafting aspects of games like it with the pvp elements of DayZ that make it a fun relatively fast paced race to the top.This game has beautiful scenery without sporting the latest graphics and the experimental version improves on that even more. It's building system is intuitive and ""realistic"". PvP is terrifying and satisfying at the same time. Players can play how they want whether that means recreating civilization with your friends joining bandit camps with strangers fighting off those damned koreans or living as a hermit on the edge of society.This game is not for everyone. Not everyone can appreciate the glowing light of the master torch or the naked form of the new guy who just spawned.If you're up in the air about this game go watch some youtube videos. If you can finish a video without going ""I must see more"" or ""I gotta have this game"" then maybe just wait till it goes on sale or a friend pities you and gifts it.",Rust

2017-01-08,0,0,1471,False,Not Recommended,As rust is right now it is bad. The devs have horrible priorities they focus on nerfing wepons and making it harder and harder to play solo. At this state I find it borderline impossible to be solo. Component system is trash and legacy was even better than it is now. They add horrible skins that make no sense! who wants a watermelon as a rock? I would only recommend this game if it changes. honestly they need to get their priorities straight for this game to be good again. If you have friends its a great game but if you don't then is a horrible mess of playing for hours and then having a group of 5 come to your house and blow it up. The community is the most toxic I have ever seen. If you like farming for HOURS and then losing it when you go to bed then its a great game if not I would just wait. If any devs are seeing this PLEASE go back to xp or bp it was so better than now or at least make it easy to get salvage tools again.I have played this game since legacy and i can tell you that you encounter people that are very toxic but you will eventually find a good teammate and that can make the game very enjoyable. You still will be offline raided by a group twice the size of yours though.,Rust

There is the occasional hacker or person using a glitch to their advantage but that doesn't stop the game from being good. After a while it may get a bit repetitive but to avoid that always try new things. Try new base designs new combat layouts and strategies etc. It can get a bit annoying at times dying a lot as a noob but you can soon get used to it.

There will be glitches as with all games. You will get raided. You will lose everything. You will rebuild. You will get raided again. You will rebuild again. You will lose everything again.

Since I played rust in legacy the game has had many changes some good some bad. There has been many bugs and discussions on what the best system was so what the people at facepunch has made in my opinion is great it has the things we loved about the blueprint system and now the things we love in the component system. It combines the good gameplay of the blueprint system and the great mechanics of the component system. If there is any new players to rust out there I would suggest getting this game as long as face punch keeps going in the right direction. Keep making us have those funny moments rust.,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,231,True,Recommended,This game is extremely difficult to reccomend for a lot of reasons. It's lack of content is mildly excusable due to the fact that it's still in Alpha however it has major repurcussions throughout most of the other gripes I have with the game. Nevertheless I do enjoy Rust and for the sake of giving Rust a fighting chance I'll cover pros first.First and foremost Rust has a lot of potential to it which is why I chose to reccomend the game. According to the Steam page this game is likely to change dramatically however whatever direction they choose to take Rust seems like it has some serious value to it. The freedom of crafting and building your own structures maintains a pleasant element of variety and the buildings being server dependant allow a different experience between each server. Unfortunately Rust has a long way to go before it can be valued as a reasonable purchase and any purchase in its current state is a gamble. I reccomend it because I feel that the game has taken off to a point where progression to a full fledged fully fleshed out game is imminent.In sharp contrast the game does reek of cons and many of them stem from either the community or the outright lack of content. Progression in Rust is fast and later in the game assuming you survive long enough it rapidly becomes a grind fest to gather wood metal and sulfur to further expand your fort or build weapons and explosives to attack other players (who likely have already gathered these materials for you). Because gathering necessary materials such as food and tools becomes so easy so quickly the game naturally drives you towards killing and raiding other players not out of necessity but out of boredom. The PVE elements of Rust are virtually non existant a mere hour or two into the game as any hostile NPCs such as bears wolves and zombies are easlity taken care of by a shotgun blast and conventional weapons can be found quite literally everywhere. Furthermore this abundance of weapons and ammo often leads to players having weapons but lacking materials such as food causing them to have no choice but to simply kill other players on sight because they need the materials. This vicious cycle often leads to Rust being an outright deathmatch at the game doesn't just lack an incentive not to kill other players it gives encouragement. There's nothing to be gained by sparing other players aside from a better reputation and the loot often outweight the risk and often times you can be killed simply because the player who killed you had nothing better to do aside from chopping hundreds of wood piles.Cons considdered I still reccomend picking up Rust perhaps at a later date. The game has a great potential but it doesn't warrant a $20 purchase unless you thoroughly enjoy a survival/PVP experience with a fast system of progression. The game needs work.,Rust

2016-06-30,1,2,678,True,Recommended,Everyone talks about Rust having a terrible community.This is simply untrue I don't think I've found a game that rivals the amount of long lasting friendships I have made while playing this game.Yes you'll encounter some people that will kill you on sight. But the people that you do meet and speak to quickly become trusted friends. Probably down to the basic human nature of banding together to survive and forming lasting bonds because of it.,Rust

2014-01-27,1,2,48,True,Recommended,For an alpha this game has so much potential! At the moment you kill a pig and obtain chicken breast.. Which is strange but everyone loves chicken! If you have 2 or more friends that want this game it's a must have. Sure finding a good spot to live can be tedious but once you do find a good spot it's fun to work your way up the ladder of defensive techniques making a bow with some arrows felt awesome from using just a rock. Play around experiment and have fun! )A suggestion for extra content... Fishing.. Make the rod find some feathers from birds and cast out your fly fishing rod!,Rust
2014-01-26,0,0,72,True,Not Recommended,Imagine walking 6 hours across a boring grass filled campus to find your friends. You finally meet up with them only to turn around and be shot in the face. Everything you worked on in the process is gone and you have to do it again. This game is filled with so many nerds/hackers/ s that the entire point of the game is ruined. Admins have almighty tools that can up anyone and anything they choose and the huge amount of hackers have those tools also. If you are even lucky enough to live an entire day expect all of your stuff to be gone when you re login. Raids are almost impossible to avoid and if you get raided once all of your stuff you have worked on for X hours is instantly gone. The unbalanced and impossible to aim guns don't help the game either. You can walk up behind a person and point blank shoot them in the head and have the shot not register then have him turn around and shoot you once and you die. If you join a fresh server then your odds of surviving are very highly increased. You can find weapons and ammo and get suited up in about a day. After that you will have nothing to do and kill fresh spawns yourself. Thus the circle of s is complete. Basically the game is broken and the only small chance you have to even live is to join a fresh server and find a gun immediatly. Don't buy. You will be wasting so much time.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,1108,True,Not Recommended,"I want a refund!This game have potential if you look away from all the glitches the constant movement bugs where you get dragged back the major gameplay freezes / lags and the horrible oh SO horrible community.Though most of this is to be expected with an alpha the antihack / anticheat has seemingly not been fully implemented yet and you'll for most of the time be finding yourself face to face with an unstoppable 9 year old that found hacks on youtube.Speedhacks jumphacks and ESPtools (location tools) are very commonly used by hackers and there might be others that I don't know.At this point you might think ""This wont affect me"" ""We got admins on our servers"" etc. Private servers may have admins and they might advertize ""no hackers"". Keep in mind though since the antihack tools are this limited finding the actual hacker among a community of players on the server is as hard as a needle in a heystack even for an admin. Admins are not magic people chosen with psychic powers to find cheaters and for the most part they will show up too late or ban the wrong player.I thought the hackers wouldn't affect me that much so I went on a public server. Never..ever...ever go on a public server. There's no admins which means even if you got the hackers name and got video proof all you can do is send a report on their userprofile and hope for the best and my best guess is as long as they only got a few complaints nobody will look into it anyway.Yesterday me and a buddy got to my house and were getting ready to raid someones base. We were standing there all psyched up and had made ourselves an explosive charge each. For those unfamiliar with the game an explosive charge can take down walls and this is a really expensive thing to make.We leave my house and just as we head out suicide. We get back suicide again and again and again.A hacker went ahead and kept on suiciding us to take our items and even if they dont target us spesifically everyone in the general area will die from ""suicide"".This keeps happening from hackers who seemingly doesn't even want anything from you you just die over and over and over again.I cannot stress this enough this is the first game that's made me feel cheated after buying it. Do not make the same mistake I did don't buy this game.",Rust
2014-01-20,0,0,90,True,Recommended,This game makes you feel like you NEED to survive at all cost if you have a house already but if you're naked with a rock you won't mind dying so much that's why there's are alot of caveman like players running around trying to kill you. I'd say there's a 20% friendly and 80% SOS (shoot on sight) players in the game. It gets very frustating when you work so hard and then lose everything you worked for because of some who wanted your loot. For a survival game it is very fun the sound is very good game mechanics are a little wonky but it's in alpha so idc. I hear alot of people complaning about hackers but i've never encountered one so i think it depends on the server you are playing on. What i love the most about this game is the sounds it haves like footsteps gun shoots plane right above you behind you left and right everything. I've excaped some trouble some encounters just by running behind some rocks/mountains and just wait to hear their footsteps pass through and it feels so movie like it's amazing and very fun. 9/10 For a survival game IMO.,Rust

2014-03-02,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Rust!Rust is said to be like a cross between minecraft and skyrim. In ways it is you can craft things and the world is big like skyrim.But it is allot differnt from both.When you start the game don't be quick to judge the game. It is a really slow starting game. You might even die 10 times before you even get anywhere.*Tips* I would say go on a lightly populated server to save you dieing all the time. Also it is an idea to watch some youtube videos.This way you get more of an idea for the game.I played DayZ this game is way better. And its still only in betta.The graphics are nice. The gameplay is smooth and the viewdistence of the game is awsome. And the hit box on weapons is accurate.A difficult thing untill you get use to it is aiming the bow.Im not sure of all the things you can and might be able to craft but at the moment the game is really looking promising.Would highly reccomend.,Rust

2015-05-26,0,0,1527,True,Recommended,was (and still is) an amazing game. my pc used to run this game at a good 60fps but after a recent update rust has been causing constant crashes and terrible performance going from 60fps down to 10fps 15fps at the max.because of this i have had to stop playing this game. i would definately reccomend this game if you have a high end pc with an nvidia gpu. mid to low end pc with amd then you can forget about it. i understand rust is still in early access but i have never seen such poor performance on a game that used to offer good performance but since gone down hill lately.,Rust
2014-04-23,0,0,385,True,Not Recommended,Rust seems to be the douchbag game of the year if you are a you are most likly playing this game. The game is in an early alpha state a state where the creators like to whine and make excuses for the lack of updates. This game has a nice Fanboy base too so be prepaired to be attacked and berated is you dont say nice things or praise this game and instead decide to give your honest opinion on your experiance of Rust. Now with that said Rust has a lot to offer and can be a great game. I have over 300 hours in this game and can see its potential. It can be very addictive and mindlessly numbing to go out gather reseources and build a home for yourself. If you plan to play this game do so with 3 5 friends or more if you have them... because at some point and time another group is gonna want to mess with you and take your stuff... they wont do it when your on but rather late at night when they can raid with little fear of death. That also brings me to another factor of the game that needs addressing Hackers and exploits both seem to be rampant on most servers. If you are an admin or server owner expect people to and cry about abuse if you play the game as well and seem to to do well. You will also need a thinck skin to play the game as I said it is a game for douches who have nothing better to do than to talk crap and grief others so be prepaired for that. Also never ever trust anyone in the game unless they are a friend of yours.. because every deal is a dirty backstab waiting to happen everyone is out to kill you just for the giggles in doing it.. remember this game is for the douches of the world.I am waiting for the updates and content but at this time I dont recommend this game maybe in a years time if they get some stuff done and start to live up to its potential I can then recommend it. But if you want to just run around gathering resources ad try to build a base for yourself or just want to be an asshat and grief players then by all means get the game because that is about all there is to do right now.,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,352,True,Recommended,This game is perfect. I love the simplicity of it. It's still in alpha so bugs are expected. I have not seen any bugs so far except for server lag. Yes they have minor things to adjust like how someone else holds a rock like a pistol or how you can only get Raw Chicken Breasts no matter what animal you kill. I love this game. I hope they keep the simplicity of it but add a lot more features. I give this game a 10/10 because even though it's in alpha it's still one of the most enjoyable games on Steam. I was hesitant on buying it for $20 while it's still in alpha but it was worth every penny. You can do so much already. You can craft bows weapons and even walls to build houses. You can choose to hunt and gather food while your friends scavenge for supplies. You can get a team or survive solo against other players zombies and wildlife. The first few in game days are pretty difficult. My problem was that I had no idea how to find stone but I found someone that was able to help. This game is worth it. Every penny. GET IT.,Rust

You can expect to put in a lot of hours into building your base and storing loot only to log in later to find it all gone.

2016-10-09,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,This game is tribalism to the extreme. If you ever wondered what is what like to be a prehistoric man (with modern weapons buildings and other gadgets) then this is for you. If you are the blue shirt clan chances are you're going to have to blow the brains out of everyone who isn't wearing a blue shirt. 95% of interactions you will have with other human beings will result in your death their death or both.Rust is a game that is truly ahead of it's time in many regards. It's the only game I've ever played that consistently and frequently gave me goose bumps and made my heart race. It's the only game I've ever played that has made me feel genuine fear has made me feel genuine cameraderie between me and my partners has allowed me to feel anger remorse guilt accomplishment and many others. Rust is ahead of it's time because you are so pulled into the game. It's amazing.However the feeling you feel most is dread. Unless you have a large tight knit clan you will be killed you will be raided and you will be humilitated. The game is a ton of fun but it is also an enormous irritation. This is a true survival game. You will be killed by wildlife the elements and most frequently of all other players. There is nothing you can do to prevent this. At some point and more than likely several dozen points you will lose everything. You will inevitably lose hours of hard work to some guy who just wanted to kill you and destroy all of your things for his entertainment. I have had my house stolen from me yes my house innumerable times.Here is my warning. This game is incredibly fun but it is also the most irritating game I have ever played in my entire life. Think long and hard before you get this game. It is not easy to play. There are no holds barred. You will be killed. You will rage quit. You will lose hours of your time and gain nothing. If you think you can bare all of that it is also one of the most entertaining games I have ever played.,Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,732,True,Recommended,Simple fun and east to learn. Rust has elements from various genres and combines them all so very well in a DayZ ish type survival game. After you learn the ropes and learn what it'll take to survive and such as building a home defending it learning higher tier weapons and armor etc you'll learn what Rust is about PvP raiding. There are many ways to surprise your enemy and take all that he has. Or you can go the route of friendly and settle in a community.,Rust

2016-02-29,0,0,1057,True,Recommended,Great game I totally love the crafting/building side of it.The gathering of matrials for building can be tedious and slow also frustrating if you die or get killed from the buggy wolves and bears and the poisonous player base.The game can be played solo if your careful as others have stated build small in hidden areas. Best played with friends to watch your back as everyone targets new spawns. A few tips for new players 1. Trust no one in game.2. Dont believe a word anyone tells you in game they could be trying to trick you into revealing your base or showing yourself for a kill.3. unless your confident your base is hard to raid dont run directly to it take as roundabout route and watch your back.4. Expect to die/get killed a lot and to loose everyhting you carry.5. If you get frustrated or are easily annoyed then this games not for you.last but not least have fun.,Rust

2014-01-01,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Excellent game.The idea of this is similar to DayZ style games you need to collect things to survive as well as deal with other players around you these players may be friendly or hostile. You need to build a shelter with a sleeping bag in it to store your things and respawn to a familiar place when you die. These shelters can be as big or small as you like. The game is best played with friends so you can defend from hostile players gather supplies raid areas etc as a group.The game mechanics are great and the ideas are great and when its all working it plays great. But over the last few weeks french hackers have been lauching constant DDOS attacks on all public servers. These are incredibly annying causing the game to be unplayable for 30 seconds a minute per attack. These are being worked on and a patch went out last night that seems to have blocked the attacks. Along with the above issue my only complaints with the game is that the menu's are incredibly buggy if I enter the menu while playing to adjust the (very few) avalible settings that you can acess without the command line I will be stuck in the menu for at least 30 seconds leaving me open to hostile players zombies and wolves. The game also crashes more than I would like (once every few hours). These issues are to be expected of an Alpha though.I love this game and I heartily reccomend it.,Rust

Looting their bodies and all their storage boxes and hightailing it back to your base. Mental.,Rust
2014-02-09,0,0,45,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic sadly it is better than many 'complete' games. This is what a sandbox game should be survival crafting resource gathering and running around naked with a rock from a guy with an M4 who has no reason whatsoever to kill you. This game is lacking in a few departments lack of enemies (only current are wildlife and bandits) less than modern graphics (which is completely okay with me considering I can barely run the game on low settings anyway). There are tons of irritating bugs like with the most recent update hitting a rock can kill you (guess they're one of the other enemies?lol). You will find yourself spending alot of time searching for resources places to build your humble abode away from prying eyes a nd of course exploring. Currently there is no real goal to the game nor do I expect there to be other than surviving most of everything to explore is next to the road (only one road relatively small map takes one game day to travel it all with stops for looting) and there isn't to much to explore to begin with. The game seems to reward people who have no life and play all day every day considering if you log off your body usually remains there for other players to kill and loot. I'm not to fond of this feature but understand why it was implemented. This is one of my favorite games at the moment and even though it can be slow paced at times and repetitive It is still enjoyable when you're not getting shot by someone who has way better gear than you for no reason (or killed by mining stone). The community in this game is USUALLY friendly i've encountered more friendlies than bandits on small servers (meaning a max of 15 players) This game is worth the 20$ I spent on it which is incredible since it's still in alpha.,Rust
2013-12-24,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Well I will be honest and say at first I was not to sure to buy this game. Early access scares me at times I've mad a fair few wrong decisions in the past. Rust from what I understood was a Dayz clone which shouldnt be held against it. I wasnt to sure how well this game will do in terms of keeping myself intrested.As I am writing this I believe i have nearly spent 7 10 hours in game on a single medium populated server (which i suggest finding one to start off learn the basics etc). At first I found it annoying I wasnt to sure what to do (no in game help but its in Alpha so i didnt expect any different) I spent alot of time hitting a stone against the large rock formations hoping to get the stone resources I needed to create axes and so on. However once you start to find your feet with the game you are up and running. I enjoyed the survival element of the game at first I stayed away from anything that moved even the wild boar. Once i got used to the wild life zombies and half naked people running around just like myself i started to really enjoy the game. Once you arm yourself with either a bow or a pistol it is time to run for those radioactive buildings and find some taste loot. On top of looking for loot by either killing zombies or searching through randomly spawned boxes a real neat feature that is in the current build is supply drops. From my understanding every hour or so a plane will fly over the map and drop several boxes of loot. This is very enjoyable more than I thought. The rush to beat other people to the drop to then meet face to face with another person brings a fair few challenges. However great.Lastly the player building. At first I wasnt to sure how this would go I wasnt to sure how important a 'house' was in terms of game play. After playing for several hours it comes apparnt that it is needed hell its your base of operations your fort your life line. So when it comes down to creating a structure to keep the enemy at bay I wasnt to sure how well this feature will be implimented. Again this is Alpha so I knew it wasnt going to be polished and very basic but saying that I was amazed at how well it works. Yes it is basic this is no Sims house creation but at its current build it has everything you need plus more.I will edit this over the Xmas period if I have more time to play the game. I will recommend this game to anyone as I have had a blast with it. I do hope updates and added features come into the game soon. I look forward to see how Rust holds up in terms of development with such games as Dayz but one thing is for sure this game has great promise. I wish the Devs all the luck with this game this could be a gem.,Rust
2013-12-19,0,0,822,True,Recommended,Good,Rust
2013-12-21,0,0,81,True,Recommended,The key to winning in this game is to be completely cold hearted and patient. Moving in the dark is your best chance to aquire resources without being killed. Trust no one at all reguardless what they say. This game is a complete dog eat dog scenario. When you log out your character stays in the game so be sure to have a nice house to keep him safe. Since your house can be raided at any time even when your away. This is litterily the hardest survival game currently out However...Rust since release has gone through a complete overhaul of the old engine. This in turn has dramatically delayed the progression of the official release and has caused a flood of bugs that have made this game pretty unstable. Yet another example of developers getting too much money from alpha builds and deciding to stick it to the community. I recommend waiting a good year before even thinking about buying this game.,Rust

Spawn collect resources make stuff build base raid bases kill newmans its at the same time easy and hard. Get an ally you can trust 2 people together makes this game fun. Join a clan if you must but small efficient teams can easily take out clans for a variety of reasons. Build multiple bases add traps for the lols trust few kill often. Watch videos to learn tips and tricks loot cargo drops and kill the heli asap. Collect wood and stone until you want to stop playing because there is never enough wood or stone to keep out a keen adversary raid until you have enough High Quality metal to armour a base do not put windows in until above third level of walls...... watch out for the bears and wolves.,Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,54,True,Not Recommended,This game can be seperated in to 5 steps.These steps are from the beginingStep 1. Freshspawn farming When you first spawn in to the game you got nothing else than your rock some bandages and torch. You will need to set a base of operations in well hidden location and hope that noone will find it before you can fortify it to be safe enough to store goods. You will hit tons of wood piles and rocks with your rock to get enough stuff to make your first base. Process that is slowed by other players that will shoot you in hopes of getting your precious rock and some wood that you might have despite the fact that you just spawned.Step 2. Building the base and blueprint farmingOnce you have eonugh resources to build up your base and get a metal door for your hut so that not every noob in the region can raid your resources. This is the point when you will craft your bow and go farm some bears and wolfs covered in perioid and run through radiated towns in hopes of finding good loot boxes with blueprints or weapons. Your main goal at this point is to get research kits blueprins and weapons. And again the process is slowed a lot by your friendly neighbors with guns who want to kill you just for the sake of killing.Step 3. Gearing up and fortificationsAfter you find good weapons and make sure you can craft more of them(Really important! You will lose your weapons but you will never lose the knowledge how to make them!). You will need to make tons of ammo kevlars and guns and fortify your base better with some spikes or making a new metal base whatever floats your boat. Step 4. Raiding and killing .. and meeting the hackersYou have come a long way and it is now your time to hunt some newb meat and get easy materials from them. Or craft some explosive charges and go raid someones base. It is time for some pvp action. Sadly this is also the point where you will most likely start meeting a lot of hackers. More ballsy ones will be using stuff like speedhacks high jumps and flying. More subtle once will use nospreads and aimbots. The game is absolutely riddled with hackers.Step 5. Losing it allEventualy will come the time when your base is raided and you lose it all. Doesnt matter if it was by legit door bombing or by hackers. You are at point zero again and must start anew. Only good thing is that you still have all your blueprints. And if you had the foresight to hide some stuff and/or make a secondary base you might still have some gear up your sleeves.In the end this game is just massive grind and farm fest with occasional shootouts and ton of hackers running around. If you like grinding building and farming while your stuff are perioidicaly raided and destroyed. This is a game for you.,Rust
2014-06-27,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Even though this game is in Alpha i dislike it intently not the best game for a friend and you. its IMPOSSIBLE to find them! it also sucks cause everyone you see kills you and overtime you get annoyed and angered cause tehy are a ton better than you yet you have no clue how to do it! This game needs some sort of tutorial or idk a way to make your own map so you and your friends can play without being murder every 5 seconds. alsop the amount of nasty launguage and the conversations are just astounding!

2014-01-24,0,0,280,True,Recommended,Chest our neighbor from down the road warned us of the incoming invasion. As they ran by his house the admin had told him that he had 7 people coming. Seven! I thought there was no way it was going to be more than 4. Tobit kept tabs on the parameter keeping an eye out for our first sighting. Meanwhile me and Dream began preping in our houses. Chest had made his way to the gate. The raiders opened fire on Chest but Dream came out and retrieved him hiding him away in the house. Now we're all posted up in our houses. Two of them blow through our forward gate and move behind a shack for cover. We start trading fire from our houses for a while but eventually all 7 raiders rush to Dream's house and quickly blow in the 1st floor. Bad move. Of all our houses Dream's is the most akin to a labyrinth. Over the next 2 hours they clawed their way through Dream's house. Tobit sniped through windows until the bandits put barriers in front of the windows after a couple close calls. I tried to sneak behind them but I got lost in Dream's house and spotted. After I was gunned down I respawned in my house grabbed my spare m4 and headed to my roof to fire at them through some of the windows on my side of Dream's house. During one of the bandit rushes on the rooms Chest gets picked off but Dream manages to slip deeper into his house. The raid goes on for so long several members of the raid begin to complain and want to just leave despite not looting anything of value. When we caught wind that they might be leaving Tobit set up right outside of Dream's house. They were out of c4 and sick of using grenades so they finally began funneling out of the house. It was pitch black as they left and they weren't expecting a sudden hail of shotgun rounds from Tobit.When the dust cleared 3 bodies laid at the bottom of dream's house (1 from the spike walls 2 from Tobit's gunfire). 3 in the house (Me Chest and a raider who had commited suicide). We made out really well and are now finished up a new metal building for us to all hold up in during huge raids again. This game is awesome.,Rust

The zombies were so fun and people were complianing that they should add them back. Thid made me question the developers on weather they were really doing what the people wanted. But because i still just recently bought the game i continued to play and enjoy is. I started off with my friend and we didnt know any of the controls. It was hilarious having naked sex parties and jumping into the ocean for fun. Then we kearned a bit more and we started destroying everyone. About 3 months after i bought the game i heard that they were redoing rust and this new experimental thing kept popping up. I started getting mad. I paid $20 for Rust. Not Rust Experimental. Im talking about the good old rust. The one where there were so many glitches that it made the game fun. Now rust is a joke. I refuse to play the new rust because it is SUPR slow you die nearly instantly and the graphics are They dont even look real. Its just plain out dumb to mr that the developers wasted their time to make a game where half pf the rust community doesnt like. I love the old rust and continue to play it. But the number of hackers is driving me away. That is the nly problem with the old rust. It has an overabundance of hackers and you can barely get anything done becaue you wither get killed by massive groups or killed by hackers. I want to try the new rust but it has made a terrible impression on me so far. Hopefully the devs can see that the ""new and improved"" is a joke and a major mistake.",Rust

2016-07-31,0,0,970,True,Not Recommended,This game had a randomness to it that was charming. It was a rags to riches story sometimes. Playing day one on the old BP system and getting a rocket and a rocket launcher gave you options. Now getting to a weapon or armorded doors is a fantasy that casual players only see in their dreams or hallucinations because there is no way a for them to get them in the first two weeks. (Unless they have nothing else to do with 20 30 plus hours between wipe cycles)(Yes once you level up you will have to grind to level again if and when it wipes) The new xp system rewards soul crushing farming and makes the game feel like a second job.If you would have asked me to support this game pre xp patch I would gladly have done so. The old bp system kept the game random so you had a different game experience every wipe. Did it have its problems? Yes. But was changing the the randomness that was unique to this a bad idea? Yes. TLDR If you like to grind endlessly and pay to have a second job then this game is for you. If you are a casual player that does not want to grind like you are playing an MMORPG then I would not recommend this to you.,Rust

2015-02-22,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,Rust has potential to be an amazing game. The crafting and building mechanics are excellent build a modest log cabin or hilltop castle with gun ports and code locked doors. Hunt animals for cloth meat bone and fat (used as fuel). The fact that there are friendly and unfriendly players is what really makes the game. Running around gathering resources finding rare loot and sprinting back to your newly built house is intense because at any point a player hunter could burst out of the woods and chase you down. It is these moments these random encounters that get your heart racing and coming back for more.Unfortunately there are too many hackers. I got Rust about a week ago right after a fresh server wipe all buildings characters and acquired blueprints are erased. This means everyone starts at square 1. Some buddies and i hopped on a server post wipe and built a decent castle. We all died several times during the construction of our base no problem that's what Rust is about survival. You mine hunt build defend die learn from your mistakes rinse and repeat.I log on this morning to scope out the Rust world my castle is looted. I inspect every brick no damage. I check all code lock doors no damage and no entry. How did it get raided you ask? Hackers used a third party progam (still available check youtube for a video) to fly into my castle and bypass my doors. until the hacks are gone i see no point in playing.Had i logged on and seen our castle destroyed it would mean we were raided with c4 which is cool as hell and part of the game. No qualms about true raiders seiging houses and castles without raiders there is no eminent danger and no andrenline rush. But knowing our castle was compromised because of cheaters? Sigh why would i play until the cheaters are gone?Because of the rampant cheaters flying around using map hacks door hacks and other cheats currently I would not recommend Rust. I am however excited to play when the final version is released and the cheats are (hopefully) removed from the game.,Rust

2016-10-21,1,2,224,True,Not Recommended,The concept is great... but how old is this thing? 3 years? And still in alpha... what a shame.They started it over about a year ago but some VERY VERY annoying bugs are still there such as Items falling under the ground. Mobs inside rocks (or sometimes even under the ground). This is annoying especially when you get killed by an invisible bear.Also cheaters. Yeah let's talk about cheaters The game was made with unity so its code is written in C# which means you can easily understand the way it works. So of course it doesn't require much time to write let's say a simple wallhack. And because garry is a terrible coder who likes to make fun of its clients and who's only interested in your wallet he bought a virus called Easy Anti Cheat (certainly very cheap).Why virus? Well... the way it works is simple it randomly takes screenshots of your game (+ the steam overlay private chat with your friends) and uploads it (you can see some public screenshots at eac dot krond dot org). Wow! Amazing! The thing is it doesn't even work! I've heard many complains about cheaters but never really believed these until one day I came back home joined the server and saw my storage room empty. How did they get in? They blew up a SINGLE metal wall the one that leads to this storage room.... so yea wallhack.If you plan to play on a private server with friends you trust (and who are unlikely to use cheats) then go for it. Otherwise well... prepare for unforseen consequences.,Rust

It is at this exact point where hackers ruin everything. They go for the most powerful influence on the server and they kill him everytime he leaves his house everytime he logs on basically. This game is NOT ready to be released AT ALL due to hackers on every single server. I have not encountered one server where I haven't been bothered over and over again by low lifes who download a cheat engine and ruin everything. It may seem fun for a while but the irritation and the frustration eventually overrule the fun you get out of it. I quit because of this it's just not worth playing anymore. Sometimes I would be inspired and think ""wow wouldn't it be cool to have a huge base and rule the town?"" Well I end up doing just that.

Fun for all but don't forget to censor the nudity.,Rust

2017-09-08,0,0,283,True,Recommended,"I have a mixed feeling about this game but Rust is an okay game. The community bad just like the Counter Strike Global Offensive community but that's necessarily all that I can find wrong with it other than the rest of my Cons I have down. I'll go over a list of pros and cons in my own opinion.PROs The type of guns we can use (could use more but what is in the game is good enough) Blueprints and building Graphics are good but the constant random lag every once in a while made me lower them The idea of clans ""Open world"" (except not open world but big maps An okay survival type genre of a game Modded servers (better than vanilla in my opinion depending on what server it is).CONS Early Access (the game is never going to exit early access) Downed system (You never know if the person who shoots you down is going to help you back up or pick you back up then just kill you again so it's a failed system to me) Lag every once in a while at random (either my server or my internet acting up though.) Server maps reset work is never saved so that brings me to being bored of playing the game a lot. Community is horrible except for on some servers due to the fact that people who play CS GO come to the Rust community.Also if you're new to the game I recommend a lower populated server below 75. That brings the most fun in my opinion so you don't die every second in a 200 300 player server. I'll recommend the game but just stay away from big servers for new players unless you have at least 5 friends with you and some of you are good at the game.",Rust

Hope you take this in consideration. Im not going to recomend thi game until you fix that.,Rust
2014-05-02,0,0,105,True,Recommended,*I have to re write the review due to it sucking a lot*Rust. Yeah you know that one game where chicken is everything. Yeah. It's actually a pretty good game. People have complained of being spawn killed and killed and killed and killed. But there are some servers that the community makes and official servers that allow it so that players can have no means of killing you. Unless if you're a sleeper then someone could kill you from then. (I don't know how people do the sleeper thing so don't ask) This game is simple for the most part and it keeps you wanting to play it until well you get mauled by a radiated bear and done with it. Anyways as I said the survival is pretty simple. You just need a fire a house and that's it for the first day. And some food. On the non PvP servers the players are pretty nice because they're most likley victims of constantly being spawn camped and just want to help the new players. A couple of things that could meet improvement in this game 1 Player's hunger and animal spawnPretty self explanitory if you played Rust. But if you haven't well here you go. When you spawn in Rust you have pretty low hunger that goes down pretty fast. And to top that off you're most likley not going to spawn with some animals. Probably a bear or a wolf is the closest thing you could get as food. If you kill it with a rock that is. 2 AirdropsAirdrops are pretty good for the most part. But I'm only speaking for the PvP included servers. Most of them have a 'frequent airdrops' mod on it so it'll make planes fly by more than usual. The planes usually have things such as guns guns and guns. On the PvP included servers imagine how that'll be. Ten airdrops a day including a gun for everyone to kill each other. That's a problem if you ask me.3 LagI really don't know if it's my graphics card that isn't good or my internet connecting to other server that sucks or maybe both. Even if you're on a close by server (East coast for example) you could still get into a lot of lag and glitches. I'm not saying that you won't be able to move due to lag I'm just saying that every once in a while there's unnecassary lag. I know it happens to all games but Rust has a bit more than most games.That's pretty all of the things I think that need improvement. The good things about Rust is basicly well everything else. The players are generaly nice on most servers the survival aspects are pretty good for the three basic things RADs Hunger and Health. If I were to rate this game I would give it a 7/10. It's a pretty good time waster and it makes you want to play the game more. I really like this game but if the improvements are met I would give it a higher rating. I hope this helps.,Rust
2014-07-04,0,0,99,True,Recommended,This game is definitly worth checking out. You can have alot of fun if you find the right servers for your taste.

2014-08-19,0,0,33,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game with lots of great potential. I like the game setup and the crafting. It is a very addicting game. The problem comes with the hackers. There are so many it makes this game unplayable. You can't play for more than a few minutes without seeing people jump higher than 40 feet in the air others who can't get attacked by animals others who run five times faster than they should be able to. It's annoying and completely kills the game in the pvp servers (where you can kill other players). I would accept a few maybe but it's getting to the point where if you don't cheat you can't survive. Complete crap. Until they fix the bugs and potential hacks it's not worth spending hours building up a residence and getting things together just to get blown away by some dork who's hacked the crap out of the game.,Rust

Admins if they can be found refeuse to do anything about hack noclipping flying etc. Even when I offered them evidence of this and offered to show them the base and screenshots I was brushed off and completly ingored. And if you are looking for a decent group to learn from or play with forget about it its a 1 in 100 chance.

2015-12-24,0,0,2007,True,Recommended,This game is multiplayer. It's incredible how many people seem to forget that while playing. Rust is the first and only survival game I've ever played. It was hard at first adjusting to the new gameplay along with the glitches I had to learn through but now it's one of my most played games. I've made a ton of friends and haven't been this entertained by a game like this for years. You have to either have friends to play with or be prepared to play at a disadvantage. But one of the best things about this game is that even if you start out solo you can make friends and alliances and as long as you dedicate time to the game you'll do just fine. Hackers are still a bit of a problem though just about any game will have hackers. And if you rage or get salty easily or have issues with losing things this may not be the game for you. One of the most difficult things to get used to is when you die unless you can get back to your body and loot it then your is gone. You learn by losing you learn by being killed and getting raided and glitches killing you. The best way you're gonna learn is by mistake so get ready for some infuriating moments just remember it's still in alpha. Though one thing this game does really well is player interaction. While a lot of people will run around and just kill people or just farm and hide in base don't be surprised if a group of nakeds run up to you and start screaming for their gods to smite the armored one. Or if you're trying to raid a base and the defenders end up being able to do nothing but throw grenades out the window and chant for the greak Helk to save them. The player interaction in this game is unlike any other game I've ever played it's amazing to see how people react to others in relaxed and extreme circumstances. If you can play a game without raging at every loss and learn to adapt then I absolutely reccomend this game.,Rust
2015-12-28,0,0,344,True,Recommended,"So lets weigh the pros and cons Rust is a game that has a really responsive Dev group Facepunch studios. They update the game bi weekly and show future progress and ideas on their blog as well as concept art. The creators really do enjoy the idea of this game and try to show how they really want it to be playable and enjoyable for all. The ingame UI is very well designed and the feel of the enviroments is always getting better with each passing update. The theme is wonderful and the design/style of homemade hobo type weapons is so cool. On the con side of things my main concern is that there is not real way right now to ""harness"" the community. Sometimes youll meet genuinely nice people who actually enjoy playing the game and working together if this happens the game will be quite fun. But that is rare usually youll find s and sadists who have elaborate plans to make you feel like when they finally kill you. The game devs have been trying to make it so people will try to work together but nothing so far has helped. Without something to draw people together currently the game becomes a like hunger games. People kill on sight just because they can trust me even if you surrender or pose no threat you will be killed. People would rather rush weapons and kill the unarmed and naked then work together and become advanced.TL DRYou should support Facepunch Studios they are great the game is great and the idea is great and i can see the game getting better in the future. But right now the community is cancerous and filled with people who use the game as an excuse to torture and bully others with no repercussions.",Rust

2016-04-28,0,0,273,True,Recommended,Personally I love the game with all its constant updates procedural maps crafting and building. This game is what a survival game should be. Start with nothing and build your way to the top. Though the player base is about %90 12 year olds who decide that there only way to enjoy the game is to watch you suffer as they repetidly shoot your naked body to pieces. This said Rust has one of THE most TOXIC communities out there.Base building is fun though there are still a few placement bugs but that can be understood as it is still in early access. Joining up with your firends is one of the best things to do in the game theres nothing like building a huge base together and then watch as it is dstroyed in front of your on eyes by yet another bunch of savage kids who think that this game is only for ing people over.I would definately recommend this game to anyone who wants a great survival game. With all this said I HAVE NEVER met a community so TOXIC and savavge. If u see someone nice dont kill them. create a community that you want not have.,Rust
2016-04-27,0,0,68,True,Not Recommended,I played this game when it was initially added to EAG. It was fun but it needed work. So here I am some time later at least a year later because the game has been getting some new content released (via playthroughs) and it sparked my reinterested to see what had changed.I found out a female model was added thats great. I was initially confused that I wasn't offerred a chance to choose my gender on spawn. Turns out I ended up being a female so I went ahead and just continued on playing under the assumption that it was a random spawn thing.A few hours later and many respawns later I come to learn from another player that its tied to your Steam ID and THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. I know some people don't mind playing female characters or whatever but I'm not one of those people. It ruins my immersion regardless of how little people claim it effects the gameplay. As I have now become aware of how it works and the sheer stupidity of it as a mechanic I'm going to be pursuing a refund on this purchase. Its absolutely ridiculous to me that they would force this decision upon people and they don't appear to be concerned about changing their course of action.Games these days SHOULD NOT be gender locked ever. Black Desert Online was partially bad BECAUSE so much of the classes were gender locked and I refused to play it for this reason as well. This game has somehow taken it a step further by FORCING a gender upon you based on something outside of your control and giving you absolutely no ability to change it.Therefore I'm not going to recommended this game any longer. I wanted to get a few of my friends interested in purchasing it and giving it a go with all the new gameplay/mechanics but that will no longer be happening.I sincerely hope the developers take the time to truly think over how irrational of a decision this was and will revert the change or offer some way to swap or I can't image myself trusting any of their game decisions in the future.,Rust

2014-01-16,0,0,131,True,Not Recommended,"First I want to say that there is some what potential to this game.But the lack of care by the developers make it a really S***ty game. There are so many random hackers that you will encounter just being on the server. No matter where you are as long as there is a hacker in the same ""town"" or ""forest"" you will be instantly dead. It says you killed yourself but it is actually the hacker.Another issue if you play on any of the non PvE servers you will be killed on sight regardless of being online or offline. When you go offline your character's ""body"" drops on the floor and is open to be killed by other players. So lets say you play on PvP and you decide to log off cause you have a life and better s**t to do than to play this s***ty game. Even if you decide to barricade yourself in a nice warm house you are open for the world for other players to come r*pe your sleeping body and take all your possessions.Also the respawn rate of minerals and animals (and the rest of materials) are really slow that essentially you are f**ked. No maps or any form of directions in game also will kill you. You make a house? Yeah Good Luck trying to find that (the only way is either you run around the entire map for couple hours to try to find it without dying or if you somehow manage to get a sleeping back to spawn in your house after death (there is a cooldown time on how often you can rez at your house).Essentially I was right to think of not buying it and if it was possible to get a refund I would totally do it. Don't trust your friends who tell you to play this game they are just doing it cause they know its a s***ty game but they just want to dupe you too and/or just are stupid enough to believe that having other people on with them would make it better.",Rust

Then we had enough and marched over to their hideout that had been rebuilt by themselves we had asked them to come out slowly one man started telling us to back off and leave the area we had to refuse and we would stay put after arguing with this man we had fallen into a trap they had been hiding in the nearby mountains with assult rifles leaving that one guy as bait for us after one comrade fell it all transformed into a frenzy of killing from their base to the mountains bullets were everywhere. After a long and tense firefight it had all ended we had ended them once and for all. We went back to base to celebrate and eat chicken throughout the night. Sadly i had never kept in contact with them never to be found again.Amazing game creative and fun can't wait until they add more into it. 10/10,Rust

2016-06-18,1,2,87,True,Recommended,Product received for free. As survival games go Rust is pretty standard. Open world exploration base building PvP and PvE with other worldly dangers to worry about. There are some pretty neat features in Rust however that make the game stand out from some other entries in the genre.First of all I'm going to discuss how difficult Rust can be. Often and especially on official servers other people will be geared up and most people practice a kill on sight attitude regardless of your danger to them. In a game like this where you spawn with absolutely nothing getting shot at like that can be painful.Second I'm going to talk about the performance. It's difficult for me to run the game (Core2 Quad GTX660) on low settings but my friends (with a 970 and another with 970 SLI) have no trouble and hit 60+ FPS in all areas. It helps to turn down render distances and turning down settings dependent on location (outdoors indoors etc.) can help as there are multiple levels of quality for different areas of video settings.Third will be some gameplay. I think where Rust differs from other survival games is a) the interesting character generation b) the recipe discovery and c) the atmosphere. Ahh character generation. If you've already played Rust you've probably realized that you spawn completely naked. I believe it's censored by default but what fun is that? ) The character is generated in a way that you are given a gender and based on that gender you are generated that gender's genitalia and the sizes are pretty much randomized. So yes you can compare virtual with your friends. Recipe discovery is pretty interesting in Rust. If you've ever played H1Z1 you probably know that you discover recipes by throwing random junk into a discovery window and hope that you can make what you were hoping to discover. Rust on the other hand is a little bit different. You find fragments of blueprints on the map and combine them into larger blueprints to in turn discover recipes. The atmosphere of Rust is really unique. A lot of games have obvious backgrounds. Once again using H1Z1 you can tell what happened the H1Z1 virus came up and killed 99.99% of people and they became zombies. With Rust however it's confusing. It takes place in an apocalyptic stage of course but you can tell it's modern due to the presence of nuclear reactors and firearms. Speaking of firearms they lend to the atmosphere. They're mostly makeshift with parts from household items attached to build the body of the various guns in the game. It gives the game a vibe like Mad Max. Another thing there are airdrops from big C 130 type planes and even map wide attacks via Blackhawk helicopters. Why this occurs nobody can say for sure but it's eerie that these machines operate in the apocalypse like that. Overall Rust is a somewhat different experience from other survival games expecially open world ones. It's not particularly expensive and it has a great developer working on it. There are updates almost every week including updates inspired by community wants and needs. The game's unique atmosphere endless playability and this great community developer connection make it a great buy.,Rust
2014-01-14,0,0,191,True,Recommended,I've had some friends try to discourage me on buying this game but i recently bought it and to my surprise it's actually pretty fun. Sure there are some minor server lags but this is Early Access so i don't expect it to be perfect. There are some ideas i have that i'm going to post to the suggestions webpage that i believe will make the gameplay a bit better but all in all it's actually pretty fun. Sure you may die and lose your items but if you can get in with a good group it won't take you long at all to get your items back. I got killed by a dark zombie in the game wasn't able to get back and pick my stuff up in time. I was on the server with a friend that knows quite a bit of what he's doing on Rust and it wasn't long till i was back up and going. So atm i give it a 7/10 for an Early Access 7/10 is pretty damned good!,Rust

I've read a lot of DayZ comparrisons but in it's current state (and after playing both) I would consider that a rather degrading notion. The Rust Early Alpha is by no means anywhere near complete. Even the developer said it was merely 10% done but by Gabe if this is 10% of the final product I can assure you it is worth getting. So...

I'll still give this game a thumbs up though it has a decent community which is growing. And the bugs are being worked on. )Edit Fullscreen problem is now fixed. Thanks Devs! ),Rust

2016-04-30,0,0,201,True,Not Recommended,can be a little fun if you can get going just cause you can troll nakeds all day long. but beggining 10+ hours can be infuriatingly frustrating me and two other friends tried out a number of servers all the stories we the same you will spawn as a naked with a rock and begin to gether resources only to be repeatedly killed on sight by people with AK's rifles or snipers. you WILL be killed for NO REASON OVER AND OVER SO GET USED TO IT! people will camp in thier snper towers and gun you down at first sight! most will not even bother to loot you. although there were several times we were able to meet up (which usually takes about 20 30 minutes of looking given you dont get killed) only to be killed after we link up by someone else. 6 hours 4 servers and a few ruined base building attempts later we got incredibly lucky able to reclaim a base that was basically just missing a door. it was looking good for once untill some s with a semi rifles and metal armor waited outside our door for us to open it and then one shot my friend then proceded to run in the base and kill us all bows dont fare well against a bunch of semi's. if that wasnt enough they proceded to throw C4 all over the place and blow everything to hell just for our 2000 wood and stone and around 500 metal fragments. like anyone else we tried restarting but we were just thrown into the cycle of be killed on sight maybe meet up with the group only to be killed again and then do it all over again! personally i would NOT recommend this game no anyone unless you like dieing over and over and eventually getting advanced enough to where you can run around and kill nakeds all day! as for me and my gang we wish we could get our 20$ back. games are supposed to be fun not endless subjection to people who just love exerting power over other people because they have a gun and you dont.,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,330,True,Recommended,"Ah rust what can i say about you? Besides the fact that its an amazing open world game even though its still in alpha. My favorite thing to do on a PvE server is to ya know build a community of other players and work together to help fresh spawns and hunt. I don't play PvP that much but when i do you can mostly find me building my house somewhere where no one will think to look and defending from raiders when they do find me. Now to talk a little about PvE. As a fresh spawn in rust you are put out in the middle of nowhere with your trusty rock torch and a couple of bandages to patch yourself up. The first thing that i think to do is to find split rad town and see if anybody is living nearby (bear in mind this is PvE). Afterwards just to gather some wood and metal ore get a furnace going and set up a small ""hermit hut."" As for the PvP. My first thought is ""get as far away from this area as possible"" if i spawn near split rad or hangar. Most people in my experience build near those 2 spots. So i usually run way the hell off the map or go way up high on a mountain range or something. Before being shot at multiple times from all directions i can get a few wood piles and rocks but as soon as i hear (or most of the times get hit) by a bullet i haul and don't look back. At least until i have a gun i *try* to defend myself against the normal 2v1 me being the 1. All in all i would give this game an 8/10. Not because it doesn't deserve a 10/10 i just want to see where the devs go with it. Hopefully it doesn't turn into one of those horrid games no one likes. And they bring back zombies.",Rust
2015-06-08,0,0,245,True,Recommended,Personally I love this game. I have given it only 8/10 for several reasons though which I will list below. There is a huge learning curve that accompanies this game for the first hour or so you may be completely confused on how to play but that is the same with most games. If you do figure out how to get started quickly it can take you maybe 30 minutes to get well established with a house etc. This game is very dependent on a number of factors including server friends and overall attitude. Some servers that you get on in the game have more hackers than others as indicated below. It is sometimes a challenge to find a server with good staffing and admins but once you do this problem is almost non existent. If you continue to have issues with it do some research to find a good server and try to befriend an admin or two so you know when they are on. This game is also very heavily group based. If you find yourself a good set of friends to play with it deters a lot of people from attacking you as well as making starting off easier. Try to find some people to play with and your game play will increase tenfold. I also put attitude here because you have to be okay with dying. If you have a problem with that it's not the game for you. People try to kill you. That's it. The game is kill or be killed or hide long enough to get settled. If you cannot get started easily try to find a friend or two to play with and it makes dying not as unbearable. Also the friendlier you are to others the friendlier they will be back to you (usually) with this in mind you can make allies and trade with others but it all depends on what your mindset in game is.,Rust

2017-07-11,2,2,208,True,Recommended,Rust is in early access since... a long time ago. Though it deserves appreciations as much (maybe even more) than any survival game.As a personal note of appreciation which I'll try to explain below I've been given this game by a friend and haven't been disappointed. At all.First of all Rust is a game where you HAVE to survive. The idea is to get and craft easy stuff then sort of upgrade it.You literally spawn naked with a rock and torch and... got no idea about what you do the first time (and usually more than just the first time).Pros you have all liberties and decide what you do always the world's space is only limited by the number of servers you play on leaving the game equals going to sleep the craft mechanics and the graphics are realistic seriously Cons long time players are really annoying you usually get killed from far by a guy with a rifle when the server has lots of players a bad graphic card lets you play the game but may make your gaming experience bad sleeping bags EVERYWHERE ConclusionEven in early access for Rust paying full price is worth playing full time.Just find how to play best on a full server ? ... or on an empty server ?,Rust

2014-02-10,1,2,49,True,Not Recommended,Extremely heavy on your graphics even though the graphics aren't that much. Lest you have a beast of a computer you'll likely have to fiddle with the console menu. Now the multiplayer suffers the same problem of Day Z where everyone'll just shoot you dead imediately even if you have nothing but a rock and you'll have to start aaaall over again and count your lucky stars if you as much as get a hatchet before someone shoots you again. It takes WAY too much effort to start over seeing how easily you can be killed (armour seems about as useful as paper machè) and there's no reason for people who all ready have power not to kill everyone else making it more of a class difference than the appharteid. So I really really can't recomend this game at all.,Rust

2016-03-01,0,0,1661,True,Recommended,Rust This review comes from a mature 25 year old who's already engaged into the real world dealing with $$h0l3$ con artists and backstabers please if you have not experience any of those yet Rust may not be sutable for you. This game is true hardcare decption based on pure b*!!$h!t. If you're use to playing online games i must tell you this is nothing like the games you've played. First you start of with a Stone trying to make it in a large sized island Using this rock you can then go gather resources like wood stone ores etc. When night falls you otta be inside because for those who already play this game they are pretty fully equiped and youre probably not as every new player spawns naked with a stone and torch. The game concept is nice similar to those you'd see on minecraft just a bit more realism and perks guns and other cool stuff.If you're a parent reading this for your child i would not advise this game as it can cause sever anger issues Alot of kids on this Game often rage when their base or house is broken into robbed or even destroyed this causes alot of conflict and regular issues. The name of the game is RUST please know its meaning $$h0l3$ RAGERS CON ARTIST.Sure there's gonna be some nice people here but you gotta be careful not everyone is your friend or foe. Overal game rating 8/10Building $h!t is pretty cool the gun fight is almost as great with the devs constant updating and reviewing their crappy work you get a pretty good experience.

On large servers everyone will hunt you for the small amount of weak supplies that you spent hours collecting due to barren areas with incredibly low amounts of resource spawns. This game is in alpha for a reason it's far from finished and is just too difficult to play unless you have friends to join you on every session. That being said if you have friends who own it/plan on buying it band together and watch each others' backs. If you don't have friends to play this with wait until full release of this game to even consider it.The recommendation is for players who play in groups only. Not recommended for solo players.,Rust

2013-12-31,0,0,147,True,Recommended,This game being in alpha currently makes me wonder what it will be like when it's been fully developed. The survival aspect is probably one of the best I've experienced since DayZ Mod and Minecraft. In fact It is DayZ and Minecraft combined into one game with a hint of Garry's Mod (of course since it's from the same designer and developer). If you got a few friends interested in Survival RPG games consider buying this. After all this game does require cooperation and teamwork to be successful.,Rust

The sheer joy of building your first house lighting your first fire or if you don't get that far your first salmonella poisoning is indescribable. DayZ crossed with Minecraft is how this game is described and it hits the target. The joy of crafting the fear of footsteps in the dark. Finally a game that's actually scary.

2015-04-09,1,3,1534,True,Recommended,Old rust was the best game. It has been the only game where i have acually enjoyed playing many hours and it is the only game that doesnt bore me. As many players who have invested alot of time into legacy know that legacy is the best rust for pvp. Although new rust is good the PVP is not fun and thats why legacy is the game it is and why its so good. Now that legacy is dying out it is sad that garry isnt updating legacy The only reason why legacy died is because of hackers and the poor anti cheat that Garry didnt update. there is no need for a new rust they are just rebuilding old rust into the new one so why didnt they just make a new anti cheat and everyone would be happy. When legacy was taken down many people complained but now its back up mabye garry will relise that many people still love the old rust and HOPEFULLY start updating it again,Rust

Be a freeloader team with your friends and just take stuff they make you.This game has so many possibilites and the base building is really fun.

2015-05-02,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,I just want to say first off that this games is good seems like a load of fun when I first saw it. But I'm not here to tell you how great the game is. I'm here just to say the problems that the causes game no theres no major glitches or lags like the second you start playing the game it freezes or when you try to walk the frame is still or any hackers no I'm just telling of how difficult the game is. If the games is suppose to be this difficult then forgive me I didn't get the memo so starting of why the game is difficult is the size of the map. The map is really large for instance I've played on a couple of maps with say 100 people I did not even see 1 palyer out of the 100. Now the main cause of all the problems that I have in this game is really because of how big the map is. So that brings me to my next problem of the game... resources. The resources it's not like say Regin of Kings where you don't have to look far just to get something to upgrade or craft something. The amount of resources what I mean by resources is minerals and food are extremly hard to find when you first start off in the game all you get is a rock and torch which now with a new update your equipment has a health bar which means that after a sertern periode of time it will break and you won't be able to make a new one now the problem with all this is that all you see is trees plain fields mountains and more mountains. But when get more into the game you see that it's impossible to find the resources to make for instance to make a hatchet you need stone but as much as you try to explore you never find the resources to make it. All your left off is some wood that you gathered and you have a food and water bar well like any other games that bar starts to decrease slowly and once that bar is at zero you start to slowly die. So what I'm trying to get out here is that the resources are impossible to find and once if your lucky enough you find a resource you wil proably meet your end from starvation dehydration or you get killed by an other player. Or one last thing that might lose your chance on getting the resources you need is the rock that your given at the begnning get destroyed from being used too much. Now brings me to my third problem which is the food and water. When you first start off you get a little tiny but bearable amount of food and water in the food and thirst bars. But now comes the probelm like the resources discussed in the top the animals that are in the game are way too little for the size of the map and there are no fruits. I have played the game and through my experince which is not that much I have only seen three too four animals. one being a deer and the other being a wild hog. Well lets just say I was not able to kill the deer but the hog was easy. Now in Rust the only easy weapon you can get is a wooden spear by collecting wood but with out getting any more resources to craft other weapons the wooden spear is the only weapon your going to have. So that means your going to have to kill a deer in the game which is alot faster then you are with your wooden spear which clearly once you have seen one in experince you need a weapon that shoots long range. Now to get al ong range weapon you need to find specific types of resources which are the ones that are impossible to find. Next comes water to keep this one short and sweet I'll just say you not able to drink water in your begnning stage of Rust. Now there is of curse a way to get water but it is unknown the me. So like I saud before the chances of you finding these sort of resources might be too late.,Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I have played for about 3 hours straight and yes it does take awhile to find friends and find supplies but it is all worth it. This games use of survival mechanics (despite getting chicken from a deer) is great. As the game progresses i hope to see more items better AI and smoother gameplay. But just for being in alpha this game is great and i would strongly recommend it to all my friends.EDIT Everything about my previous review still stands for players who are new to the game. Yes it is fun but becomes quickly boring w/ the lack of attention the developers of this game put forward. I have lacked to find any new items or any new gameplay mechanics that could make this game more fresh. i would say their is still some sources of creativity with friends and I would still reccomend this game to anyone who has a lot of friends to play with.,Rust
2014-02-07,0,0,60,True,Recommended,You wake up with naught but a rock. You quickly realize that everyone around you is in competition and may form fellowships to better control resources and supplies. Resources and supplies that you need. Some may pity you most will hit you with a very large rock if they have run out of ammunition.This is a game where it is actually less conspicuous to be running around naked.The concept of bitter survival with and against other humans is well done especially for a game this early in development.,Rust

2016-08-17,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Rust is an extremely fun game to play together with friends. Playing it alone is one of the most cruel experiences you will ever feel but if you're into that kind of thing don't my words of caution stop you.The game really succeeds in delivering that feeling of isolation and helplessness making it almost unbearable playing solo (mostly because of other better equipped players with their better equipped friends). In the few days that I have played I have had to start over multiple times however once you stabilize a bit and make yourself a good safe home the game feels a lot more satisfying.From what I understand the graphics got improved recently and the animations are quite good for an early access game. The devs seem to be updating it very regularly so there is no fear of it getting stuck in alpha. Also the music is really amazing and adds a lot to the whole experience.,Rust

My review of the current Rust version is down below.)This game is a lot of fun especially when playing with friends and not just on an empty server.BUT THOSE MOTHERF***ING RAD BEARS. I SWEAR I WLL CRAFT A REVOLVER AND SLOWLY SHOOT YOU TO DEATH FROM A LEDGE. YOU WILL DIE SLOWLY. PIECE OF BEAR S**T. Rust has really come a long way since it began. I haven't played it much since the alpha but I can safely say that it looks better feels better and sounds better. And with the addition of certain elements that make gameplay more fun especially the base building and grinding element it's probably worth picking up now.5/10Alright we're done here.,Rust

2016-04-17,0,0,2668,True,Recommended,This game has come along way during my 1160 hours of gametime. Of course it has its ups and downs the same as any other game. I would highly reccomend playing with a small group of friends (2 5). Can be very tedius when you first start depending on the server type you play. I would highly reccomend not playing on one of the official servers as there are plenty of hackers there and no active admins. However some commuity servers are amazing. EX Bloodbane(Active Admin map wipes two times a week.) Rustafied(Active Admin One Week MAp Wipe Cycle.) or modded servers such as the most popular one DEADLAUGH. You will run into huge clans that dominate roof campers that all they do is snipe friendly and not friendly people. Overall a great game and will definatley rack up another couple thousand hours. 10/10,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,1191,True,Recommended,"I had spawned for my first time in the world of Rust I struggled to get started but finally managed to get enough resources for a stable home and a weapon. I asked a few friends to join me on my adventure because I had no idea what I was doing after following the road for a bit we had managed to group together and I brought them back to my place (a small shack with a fire sleeping bag and furnace.) Over the next few days we had started to build an empire we traded with new spawns and in exchange for 100 wood we would give them 9mm ammo or 556 ammo of their choice. After feeling safe and getting comfy in our new home I felt like nothing could stop us we were living it. Well changed fast in Rust. When I logged back in my friend had told me that we got raided he said he captured a screenshot of the assualt. The screenshot captured 10 men running in a field towards our base in full kevlar. When I returned to my humble home I was shocked at the stairwell leading to my roof and the walls missing inside of my home. I typed in chat that day that I would get them I would kill them. I got a response it read ""k"". Since I will leave out all of the details we had a couple more run ins with these bandits turns out we weren't the only ones. There was about 3 4 different groups that joined us. Sitting at home in my newely crafted base I heard a *tick* *tick* *tick*. "" me"" I whispered then quickly typed to my alliance. So I knew it would take them awhile to get here I called out to my friends we had to hold our ground. having about 3 sets of kevlar and 100 556 ammo all together we got out our weapons and fought. Before we knew it we were pinned downed inside of our own home with our 2 explosive charges in the back protecting them. At one point I sat there looking at the barricade the only thing that held them from us. Watching my teamates friends get gunned down through the sides of the barricade I was fed up with this We were nice guys sure we had done some at one point but no man wants to do those things I had to kill. These bastards did it for fun not because they were forced to no no no because they wanted to. In that moment I knew I was not going to lose my base to some s. I got my hatchet out and broke down the barricade we came rushing out shooting all of them we lost some men and so did they we blocked their exit so with the loot we got from them we fought harder. Killing all of those bastards our backup arrived after the battle our home littered with backpacks. I felt like it was real like I fought for something I was moved. Never let anybody no matter what gear they have take anything from you also be nice to others and somebody will have your back in those situations. After the battle I captured a moment a moment of celebration a moment that is rust. This http //prntscr.com/2md7eo Thank you all for listening 10/10 game.",Rust

2014-03-04,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Why do you not own this yet?,Rust
2018-02-05,0,0,295,True,Recommended,"I totally recommend this game to you but... Not really recommended to raging players and I m gonna tell you why.Rust is a realistic survival game. You have the official servers the community servers and the modded servers but I will only talk about the official cause they are the ""normal"" servers. You start with a naked character just with a rock and a torch. Every item in the game has limited use in this case a bar telling you how much you can use it. BUt you need to watch that carefully cause sometime it will break. In this game you can mine hunt and kill other players. Yes I should have mentioned this in the beginning but this game is ONLY in multiplayer. And there is a bad part in there. If you are new to this game be very careful if you start in the middle of the servers timing. Because every 2 weeks (I think but no sure) The servers restart so everyone has a chance to start over withou being killed by other OP players already with full armor pistol or aks etc. So the bad thing here is the number of players. Cause the servers have different slots. The minium I think it s 25 players and maxium I think it s 300 or 350 not so sure. That means that the bad topic is the number of players you are playing with because 90% of Rust players will kill you with no mercy! Seriously it s so hard to make a team with other people. Some can accept but There are like 80% of people that betraid you in a team. And I think no one likes to be backstabbed that way. Anyway if you want to survive in this game I totally recommend you to go with one or more friends cause more people you get more easy to kill the others. But there are bad things to. You re gonna need to SHARE. And as more friends you play with more ressources you have to share so harder for you to survive. You also have a health bar a food bar and a water bar. The food and water are SO difficult to find it s really stupid. Most of the water you re gonna find in salty water (water of the ocean) so I would recommend you to go to lakes and craft a bottle ASAP to keep water with you. But so survive in this game you need to be super lucky in where you spawn cause seriously you have NO idea of the map s size. The food I will recommend you to llok for is mushrooms that normally give you 5 water 5 health and 25 food. Coll huh? And you re lucky that they are common. You could actually kill other players and eat their skin but that would make you a cannibal. And one of those takes out 30 of water which kinda sucks. If you find animals... forget. All the animals in this game attack you. Besides they are super rare. You could find like 2 animals in a range of 2 killometres...(not kidding). If you are a starter just grab your rock and find for wood asap. You can find trees or some wood in the ground. The thing that I most hate in this game is when you are really good equipped and somehow someone kills you. Reminding that if you die you lose... EVERYTHING you have! EVERYTHING! In the game you can also get airdrops that contain really good stacks and monuments around the whole map. Hope this was usefull. Be aware of the dangers and try to survive for long as you can! Good luck!",Rust
2016-08-18,1,1,245,True,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game to anyone who is going to play it solo or with a small group of friends. because you will and trust me when i say this YOU WILL get ed over by a bigger clan or just a group of guys with guns who dont give a weather or not your a naked fresh spawn. You will die. Join a clan if you are going to play this game but with out one rust is no longer playable for us solo and small group player..great move facepunch giving boosts to clans and on the soloers. make base farm some stuff to enforce base meet some random shotgun shmuck and tell him im friendly practically begging him not to kill me shoots me destroys my twig base10/10 game.,Rust

So all i can say is fix the game and then I'll give a review which i think the game really should have.,Rust
2018-07-08,1,1,318,False,Not Recommended,Extremely boring after you get your base set up if you even can. With all the 12 year olds running around screaming in your ear and the dudes that camp the spawn and kill you right away its not worth it. The concept itself is great but unless you play with a group of 10 others or you play on a very very low pop server you wont get anywhere. I've been with a group of 10 and solo'd and both get extremely boring after about 4 hours. Would not recommend to anyone at all. Also even with a 1300$ pc my fps drops to 40. So the game is just terrible.,Rust

2016-07-17,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Rust Hobbes Was RightHave you ever wondered if Thomas Hobbes' philosophies still hold merit in the modern day and age?Do you long to see what life would be like without the firm hand of the state?Do you fancy yourself a good person? An enlightened and upstanding human being that cares for their fellows?Then wait no longer for I give you Rust! The post apocolyptic misery simulator that shows us just how much we need society to keep our animal instincts in line. Your day begins as follows You walk up naked and alone and in between 9 30 minutes you'll be dead having accomplished nothing at all. In all likelihood you'll have been killed by the animals that walkaround on two legs(this is a grave insult to animals since they are nowhere near as barbaric as people). You'll then respawn to repeat the process! This game has recieved Satan's approval as a subsitute for hell.Worse still is that the game teaches us something that we should distrust the people around us and kill them for no better reason than they could kill us. Yes this is proof positive that we truly flawed and pathetic creatures for even in a game do we revert back to animal natures. Thank you Rust for teaching me how much I truly do value the bootheel of the state on my throat for it keeps me safe from all the other monsters that live around me and who would kill me if the constraints of society were lifted from them.If you too want to experience this existential awakening and be butchered(virtually) by your fellow human beings then buy this game now!Misery awaits you too!This message approved by Thomas Hobbes.,Rust

2017-06-10,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,This game is definetly not a game you want to play when you want to have a good time. Its not made for beginners at all. The moment you spawn there are like 4 other guys trying to kill you with rocks. They even have the time to follow you like 10 mins to get nothing out of it. If you made it out of the beach and start gathering crafting material just forget it waste of time getting killed 10 out of 10. Average lifetime is 3mins. Youre running around trying to find your mates. Killed by suddenly appearing wildlife creatures out of nowhere or people with bows/crossbows or even guns. The moment you can effort to build a base is rare. When you finally made one you can sit in there like hours because people are just waiting for you to come out and steal your key. Fun fact I've never seen people actually leaving their houses or getting into their houses but in the moment they do they're suddenly fully equipped. I don't really get the mechanics of the game but I never saw people really farming stuff they suddenly have it. For me Rust isn't a survival game at all. Its pure PVP and mostly cancer. Wasted 20 .Guys don't spend your money on this Game. There are much better games.,Rust

2014-03-01,0,0,222,True,Recommended,This game is a very cruel game of survival. It is very well crafted with an amazing customization value of being able to create structures and place them wherever you want on the map. The concept of everything corroding after time of inactivity prevents massive clutter to popular servers so unlike most mmo games with building the most popular areas are not crammed full of things created months ago remaining an eyesore. The most dangerous things on this game is yourself and other players. I commonly would die of fall damage jumping off things that I shouldn't have and being ambushed and murdered by other players. I mean murdered. Players are cruel and unmerciful on the game rust as the game is designed to be. Nothing is permanent. True loyalty is priceless and you may find truely amazing individuals that you can trust. Rust was a very good experience that also came with much anger and greif. Come with friends.. it makes a difference.,Rust
2014-03-02,0,0,3,True,Recommended,"So far i have been killed on sight by anyone equiped from a Rifle to a Pistol to a Bow to even a Rock. I had no clue getting killed by a Rock would be so shamefull... Over all i still have yet to craft a single thing ( beside a campfire) because i get murdered by people with out hesitation. Dont try to yell out ""Friendly!"" cause they might backstab you later on down the road. Only time a guy was friendly to me was when he letted me in his Small House closed the door then told me to ""take off the pants"" (when i didnt have any pant on) and then he butchered me with is hatchet. Overall the game is ok (i guess). i cant really judge seeing how i have yet to even build a small house. If anything i recommend getting friends to play with you. My whole 1 hour of gameplay consits of getting chased by groups of people yelling at you to take your pants off.

Exactly one year ago (summer of 2015) this game was amazing the community was great. It was the best game around people were friendly and everyhting was harder for big groups instead of being hard for fresh spawns. Old rust made it easy to start out and hard to be a roof camping .

Like other reviewers has mentioned the community is extremely toxic people killing you on sight doesn't matter if you're obviously a fresh spawn people are cursing over the chat/when they're killing you.Adding to the fact that the game is packed with hackers it makes the game really dull because these hackers has already gotten the C4s and AKs they will just blow up any houses they see along the way even if its just a little hut and these are all on official servers. It makes the whole game pretty pointless after a few days.I do enjoy the game the building the farming and seeing your tiny little house evolve into a mini castle being friendly and guiding new players on the beach giving them tools. These are all the good sides of the game but every once in a while these toxic players crashes everything calling out racial slurs targeting a certain country's players calling players C*NT and all sorts its like the most horrible people you can meet on the internet plays this game.I recommend the game but this is definitely not a game to play on a long term basis it's easy to get frustrated and sad in the game it's only fun if you go in and just spend a short couple of hours. Buy it when it's on sale instead.,Rust
2014-01-07,0,0,120,True,Recommended,I would defo recommend this game its fun and thrilling at the same time the self satisfactions of building your own base and defending it is amazing sometimes the game can loose its sense of fun but it will soon come back if anyone wants a cheapish game that is being updated constantly then i would recommend rust it has its problems but they will soon be fixed.,Rust

Basically your in a world with other players and you have to gather resources to build a house so you can protect yourself from zombies and other players you will also be able to craft more rare stuff later in the game such as guns and armour as you exlplorer.I would rate this game 8/10 but since its in alpha its probally gonna change. but definetly worth buying,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,99,True,Recommended,Sure is a great game even for an alpha. Graphics are good gameplay is simple and the crafting system is annoying. Basicaly this game is damn cool. But dont buy it yet. It gets updated not so often and the alpha is about 10% of the full game. But if you want to buy early access then prepare yourself for it gets boring in 10 hours of gameplay. And dont play this alone play it with your friends. But if you dont have friends then just use voice chat. Most people are douches but some are less douches!,Rust

That isn't that bad and it's understandable why people want to kill you even in early stage. Best way to play is that you find 2 4 friends and go to fresly wiped server and start to build up together.It's fun game that gives good adrenaline rushes when batteling with other players.I'd defenitly buy it again if i had to.,Rust

2016-03-01,0,0,1091,True,Not Recommended,This is by far the best game I have ever played in the survival world. BUT t( _ t) f you facepunchI will never recommend this game to anybody because facepunch is only in it for your money. Once you paid for the game they will give you little to no support. And will purposly ignore your probleme instead of working on it if its a difficult one. This game will be in alpha for ever because of that. Been unable to play for 2 week and send a ticket on first day with detail explanation of the bug i was running into. At first they said sorry its not our fault its a bug cause by unity. Sent a other message and Orkel basicly ask me stupid question so about things that I had clearly explain in my email. At that point I realize i was talking to someone with little to no knowledge in this type of thing so asked to speak to a different Customer support. I was answer by Holmzy who ask me to send him a few of my PC files and try to delete HKEY and tell him what happend. I was happy. That looked like real tech support. I was wrong... Its been 2 weeks since I sent them my pc files. He is ignoring all my emails. Sent about 10 in 14 days. Decided to test a theory thats on many forum. They only in it for the money. I then made a new email and sent a ticket in title. ( I just put 100$ in steam how can I buy skin. ) First of all this is not even a tech support question... yet I got a immediate answer from them on the same day.FacePunch you win.

2017-01-15,0,0,2504,True,Recommended,Amazing game and it keeps getting better. Don't listen to what people say about rust being bad because it simply isn't true. The only thing I don't like is the player base. I know it isn't really fixable and I don't blame Gary for this at all but people just kill new spawns for the sake of killing and don't expect people to be nice to you when u first join. It will take u 5 to 6 tries of dying and respawning before u find someone who isn't an and helps you get of of the first stage. Totally worth the buy!!! 10/10,Rust

I have to say that the dev's take some chances on the game with the new blueprint system but i appreacite the fact that they release an update every thursday and consistency try to make the game better. I can say that I do get bored sometimes but the bordem only started after 1000+ hours. I have to say that this is the best game I have ever played. You can do whatever you want whenever you want. Whether you like PVP building farming meeting people having random interactions with other people YOU WILL LOVE THE GAME.

2015-10-15,0,0,1325,True,Recommended,Well Rust was one of the worse survival games before. But since last year it regained so much popularity and has been improved quite notably. I would recommend it now because of Facepunch's dedication to it it's amazing connection to the players the updates that come out being sometimes revolucionary and really the gameplay that you have. It sure has a lot more to develope in but it's a quite funny version that it is currently in.

2016-02-16,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,so i bought rust in the sale... i really wish i had not ( played on a few servers here and there and from the minute i spawned people were killing me (fair enough getting killed and what not) not one to complain but when its everytime you spawn it gets old quickly managed to meet a few guys who built me a small base which is great but everytime i walk a few metres away from my base i get sniped. Any and every patch of land has buildings on it mostly towers where im sure a majority of the actual people on the server sit and just shoot at everything including fresh spawns. Again im not getting salty but when its everytime you spawn it gets frustrating. bare in mind i now spawn random and even at that within 30 40 seconds some dude has a gun and is trying to shoot me when i blatantly have a rock anyway. games not bad if you have good amount of hours to invest in it but from my experience its spawn kill simulator 2016 10/10 would die repeatedly again,Rust

2014-03-02,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,This game would be great fun if it wasnt for the rediculous state of the game (even for an alpha). The game has some fun building interacting with people scavenging ect. Within a couple hours I was raiding and thought this was cool. However no matter what server you play on some one always comes around one shotting every one through walls. They then walk right through the walls and loot everything. It does not matter if you play on an officaial server community or modded. The game is riddled with hackers explioters and griefers. For a zombie co op builder I prefer 7 days to die and for zombie survivial I would rather play Dazy or Arma 3 Breaking point mod.,Rust

But the fact that you can build twig anywhere you want just ruins the purpose of tool cupboards.Solo players and small clans wont have a chance to last a day in it. All you get is people building anywhere they want on your base with twigs and blasting through it with c4 and rockets.

2014-01-25,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,I had to restart a game 3 times because hackers kept showing up and destroying everything. Not that you need a structure for hackers to ruin the game. there are also people who hack their guns to automatically 1 hit kill you just by looking at you.

2017-11-27,1,1,112,True,Recommended,It's a really enjoyable experience when all of your friends make fun of you for being a noob and not understanding game mechanics... then all of a sudden you surprise them and make their jaws hit the floor when you put your 900+ hours of Rainbow Six Siege experience to use and completely wipe an entire enemy squad by yourself...,Rust
2016-09-03,0,0,1216,True,Recommended,Product received for free. So this is my third iteration of this review on 11/16/2017. Since I have heavily been into Rust again I figure I may as well give a new update.This game is not for everyone. I know this because I have introduced a lot of friends to the game and they have all stopped playing almost immediately. It is high stress you will lose a lot if not everything constantly. Like any job (which this game feels like at times) you will need to take lots of lumps to grow. Once you get past the lumps (after say about 200 300 hours worth of lumps gulp) you should be fine. You will find friends whom have suffered the same abuse as you all equally as off looking to raid the talking squeakers off the server. I have over a thousand hours in the game and some of the best people I've ever played with in video games I've met playing Rust. While most of the time it feels like a grind some of the moments in Rust are well worth it. Online raiding someone (which happens few and far in between) generates some of the most adrenaline in any game I've ever played. Fending off counter raiders while simultaneously shooting the people you're raiding is an experience and a half. Some people get that same kind of high when they offline and finally reach that precious loot room and some people groan when they realize they wasted 20 rockets to find a crate full of Improvised Balaclavas. Either way there is some way you will have an enjoyable moment in this game. I've played a few survival games obviously not to the degree of Rust but they all don't feel as polished or open as Rust does. Using the ALT key to look left or right certainly helps with your increased paranoia and is a feature I wish were implemented in every video game. To me that is one major defining feature of Rust that separates it from other genres. Not to mention the flexibility you have in creating your bases. There's rugs bear rugs included lamps chairs pretty much a ton of things if you're into the whole role playing thing. A few things like box placement and other items needs a bit cleaned up but otherwise they've made it way more intuitive to build lately.Now despite the mostly positive review there are drawbacks. For one weapon mechanics have definitely taken a step backwards. About six months ago they decided to start reworking weapon mechanics. Rust was definitely one of the more challenging games to get aiming right but I felt after about 3 5 months I got it right. I mastered the semi auto and slaying smaller zergs was one of my favorite reasons for playing the game. However they ditched this system in favor of a more noob spray and pray friendly system. Instead of being that guy who could control his AK and knock people off easily from 100M or more you'll now get randomly headshot by someone who has no idea what they're doing from the same distance 5 shot bursting. Pistols have way too much recoil now (the P2 is almost useless now) and well..just make it a point to get an AK. Almost every other gun outside of the LR and Bolt aren't really going to top an AK. I'm definitely disappointed in the direction they've went with guns to the point where I PVP significantly less but it's not enough to cause me to stop playing the game. With that being said I hope they at least make it a little harder for those guys that hold mouse 1 and get instaheadshots in the future.The pacing is also slowed down drastically with the revitalization of the BP system. Unless you are playing on a server that rarely wipes BPs (or never does) prepare to grind hard to find components. This can be seen as a good thing for about...the first 2 wipes. Then that large clan will have every BP while you probably have about 1/5th. So for 3 weeks they essentially just have to farm and find components to completely wipe everything out. And if you play on a server that wipes BPs fairly frequently...well. You're going to be grinding and finding BPs a lot. There really isn't a big advantage for either but for me I prefer the monthly BP wipes so you can at least have a couple wipes of having quick startups even if you have to prepare your for an offline beating.Anyways while this game certainly can be really stressful at times I would recommend it for anyone wanting to get into something new and different. I have thousands of hours in Counter Strike among others and was looking for a change of pace when I was introduced to Rust. Since then it has been my primary game. I absolutely recommend starting off in an empty ish server where you can learn to build bases and farm components free of worry. Then move to 20 30 people servers or solo duo trio servers eventually till you get good enough (or find enough friends) to play on the big boy servers. All in all if this game is too hard or you think it sucks you're probably just a beta male anyways.,Rust

2018-08-10,0,0,1085,False,Recommended,After nearly a thousand hours i feel like i can give my 2 cents For the genre this is by far the best game of its type (co op online survival) it blows all other games out of the water when you start playing there is a HUGE learning curve and you will get rekt time after time after time again however this is apart of the adventure that is rust and together with your friend (i recommend only playing with atleast 1 other person or you will get REKT) you will eventually set up a base and run around killing everyone and farming rescources untill you eventually have enough to raid (the end game) from there on you pretty much raid as many bases as you can using the loot to upgrade your base and create enemies that will eventually plot to and will raid you back this game has seriosuly created some amazing moments with my friends and has easily been the funniest/ action pact/ stressfull game ever there is nothing more intense then co ordinating with your friends how to defend your base with the patronising sound of c4 imminantly about to blow in the door at which your aiming 7 aks at this is truely one of my favourite games of all time and if you havnt already buy it now! and dont be dismayyed by the failure you will encounter at first!,Rust

2014-04-25,0,0,32,True,Recommended,"Rust is the ultimate love child of DayZ the TV show ""Naked and Afraid"" and of course Minecraft. The pixelated worlds and mobs are replaced by a lush woodland scenery viciously mutated animals zombies and griefing players. Your character is plopped into the world butt naked with nothing but a rock and a medical supply kit. From there on out it's your job to survive which is a lot harder than it sounds. You must collect wood and stone build a shelter hunt for your food and gather supplies and guns in order to survive. Once you've finished that checklist it's time to fight off other players who are trying to steal your When you die if you haven't crafted a sleeping bag and placed it inside your house you will start from scratch with nothing in your inventory butt naked again. If you did have a sleeping bag placed you will re spawn at your home with an empty on body inventory. Your stored items are saved at home in storage boxes. Rust is an amazing game for killing time or pretending to be like Bear Grills. You can beat the of of people with a rock and try to survive the ""after effects"" of a massive nuclear war. I rate Rust 9.5/10 even in the earliest stage alpha it's an amazing game.",Rust
2014-04-26,0,0,8,True,Recommended,As an early access game Rust has a ton of potential but in the same vein many things going for it serve as a detriment. Pros Build complex constructs from materials in the world around you seriously complex entire fortresses can be made with fortifications like locked doors and spiked barricades. Large number of craftable items and discoverable blue prints to further expand your crafting list. Modify weapons with craftable attachments to make them even more powerful.Cons The game world isn't evenly distributed. Some areas of the game have plenty of resources and others are completely barren of anything of even relative interest. I spent alot of hours simply wandering around simply trying to find resources other than trees/wood. Food is very scare and you'll end up dying of starvation if you don't happen to spawn in the proper area There is no map of anykind. Though this can ve viewed as a virtue for the sake of immersion having some way to navigate this vast empty landscape other than the sun would be helpful. I mentioned before that you can craft massive structures in this game which is cool but since there is no offline mode (another con) you have to share crafting space with various other users 100+ on official servers. This combined with the fact that resources are only available in CERTAIN AREAS of the play area everybody tends to build their constructs in the same area this makes the place crowded after awhile and frame rate drops WILL occour in these congestied areas. And since vital resources only spawn in certain areas there is very little incentive for a player to leave that area end game resources take several hours to get to even after building a shelter and crafting the best weapon and armor you can. (explained below) Since this game is online only if a newcomer comes to play they are doomed. Theres no real defense against veteran players so the majority of time you play the game it will simply be running or hiding away from players who have end game gear. Even if you build a shelter and a locked door quickly that locked door can be blown down with enough force and all the materials and items you spent hours crafting can be stolen. With that said I would say there is a severe lack of balance and counter play. The combat system is pretty lack luster you can hit opponents with melee even when they arn't visibly within range and vice versa There is no strategy to fighting besides clicking rappidly and moving around and hoping you get your opponent before they get you. End game is pretty lack luster after you get all the top tier weapons all theres left to do is gun down other players so it basically just turns into DayZ without zombies. Conclusion I like the game but it has alot of work to do before it becomes competent and an experience everyone and anyone can enjoy.,Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,442,True,Recommended,"This is relevant to the game as it is on 1/19/2014. It's very rough but it is fun BUT do not say a word in chat...ever. Look at wiki or ask a friend. The hackers are rampant. I have learned that if you don't talk they can't target you for suicide hacks. I think they can also teleport to you and then there are aimbots that will insta kill you with one bullet (which is basically impossible at range).So if you buy this now don't speak it sucks because you want to help new players but only use voice chat.Updated 2/6/14 That suicide glitch is gone so it's safe to talk in global chat now. Cheaters are still rampant but not as bad as before. The ""official"" servers are a 100% joke as they have no admins so they are filled with cheaters. My suggestion is to play on a modded server running Rust++ or Oxide with active admins. Even with active admins admin abuse is a problem so you have to find a good server. If you can find the right server with the right admins and the right players the game is amazing even lacking so much. I also suggest starting on a server with 50 or less players at peak times. Trying to get a start on a server with even 75+ people can lead to you dying a ton. Don't just think that all people killing nakeds are jerks either because at around 100 players there is a subset of people who will pretend to be noobs and run around naked with M4s and shotguns. At this point anyone who gets close to you has to die. Your biggest defense on a populated server is to give people a WIDE passage and don't look at them after you've spotted them. If you keep staring at people they get nervous and shoot.",Rust

So i followed them in the dark to their base came back with a few friends and raided the place. Russians got raided my friends base. I relocated their new base and raided it again. Russians got off once more and again the ""i z ur mothza"" threats at midnight found place. Very scare much tense. Even though i hate those Russians i couldn't live without them on the server. They make things tense and make me feel like i have enemies to look out for in order to survive. Unfortunatly after i found their third new base and raided it again they moved to another server. I feel lonely now even though i'm on the server with 2 friends and 2 other guys who are friendly.

2016-12-26,0,0,481,True,Recommended,Rust is making gaming history. This game has been in Early Access for quite some time and is at the top of steam charts for good reason. Constent Updates from Facepunch have really made a difference in the quality of this title. They are truly dedicated to bringing this survival game to life. I just recently tried this again and I am very excited as what this has become. This is my favorite game now. At such a low price this is a title that all computers can run and all pc owners should haveHow will you Survive?Rust gives us the nearly impossible task to survive. This beautiful brutal world is litered with valuble resources and only you can determine your fate. Building a shelter is no easy task and once you have encountered your first neighbor killed them you might just survive long enough to stave off your hunger and thirst before that gets you. Stay solo in the shadows and gather resources undetected team up with some buddies and stand tall to defend your base. Gather a raiding party and take all the loot. Anyone who plays survial games need only play this. The possiblites are endles and every part of playing this game is great. FacePunch shows true dedication and skill to keep a game this old alive and interesting. Thank you Facepunch!,Rust
2014-02-11,1,1,32,True,Recommended,I expected alot of early spawn kills and stuff but here's what happened I logged on to a server that said no PVP so I thought that was a good starting place immediatley to find that my settings were to high and needed to reload the game to adjust. After doing so I got onto a different server and attacked trees with my rock. I heard footsteps and turned around to see a guy in full kevlar body armor and he had an assault rifle. He told me to leave because it was his groups area so I went in the direction he told me to go. After doing that I encountered another guy with the same gear and he turned out to be a member of the same group. He told me to run through the radiated city and if I survived then he would let me live. I managed to so he gave me some things and then he invited me to his house. I went with him and he gave me the same gear they had and a pistol. We added eachother on skype and I ended up in their group.9/10 Extremely high potential in this alpha,Rust

2013-12-29,0,0,176,True,Recommended,"RECOMMEND X 1000. Even in its alpha release this is still a 60$ value game. And it's only 20 and only going to get better. I'll chunk this review into sections of gameplay and be as honest as possible.Things you need to know before I describe early game The game's resources are respawning node based. If you find 4 rocks and 4 wood piles in an area after you loot them all they'll come back in that area. The wandering nomad style doesn't do that well in rust there's a lot of empty landscape with no nodes. However all the spawning locations are near well off areas. The game is ""Find an area with decent resources and settle down"" focused. Explore once you're on your feet.Early game You start with nothing and the very early game is kind of gimmicky. Hunger is a factor and the only source of food in the game is killing animals. The animals fight back and like I said you don't start very well equipped to fight them. One animal does give more than enough food to set you up for mid game and if you find a pig (doesn't fight back) you're on easy street. If the pig you find is a near a bear though....eh? The current solution to this is an exploit that I honestly hope they keep around. Once you get enough wood to build a shelter (you can either hit trees or search for wood piles that give 100 wood in 6 seconds and then expire) you can stand in the doorway and animals will treat you as inside and not attack you allowing you to safely kill hostile ones. Kind of a trade 50 wood for safety against animals and easy food mechanic I like it.Mid game Once you're not going to die to starvation mid game is all about building up and teching. You start crafting better tools move out of your shelter into the very well done house building system get a furnace and workbench made and all of a sudden the materials you get from mining rocks can be turned into guns. Neat! With guns it's pretty easy to start looting the zombie guarded and irradiated cities and you start looting research kits and rarer gear. Research kits can be consumed to teach you how to craft an item in your inventory basically you loot rare and learn how to craft it forever. There's a LOT of items you don't know how to craft at the start.End game Dog eat dog. End game is all about building huge fortresses storing your most important items and taking your ""less important"" guns and food out to kill other players. Terrorize an area of the map killing all the nearby players and looting their houses until everyone you don't want around leaves. And then claim that as your own. Build a huge wooden shaped house in the middle to show your dominance who gives a you've got 15 wood pile nodes all to yourself now.It's in alpha The next content patch when I'm writing this review is talking about adding wrecked vehicles you have to fix up similar to DayZ. The game has the same maker as Garry's Mod and there is noone i trust more for sandbox content. Even the other aspects of the game it's suffered DDoS attacks the day before I write this review and look at how down to earth this post to the community is http //playrust.com/ulink ddos attacks/. I've never felt less fed with empty to buy time in my life. That was posted on 12/27 and on 12/28 Garry worked with the company and now the DDOS is gone. Hot damn.This is getting pretty ing long so SUMMARY The game is rediculously fun solo or with friends is 20$ is only going to have more and more content added there's no developer I trust more to make a fun alpha into the best game out there and be completely down to earth and NOT A LAZY PIECE OF with addressing and fixing issues.",Rust

Being still in alpha they do have some issues. The network library gets smashed on by DDoS attacks making the game unplayable. Once that issue is resolved I imagine the game should remain playable enjoyable and a very solid game for the future. Also buying the game at $20 to get forever access is not a bad way to start.

2017-01-01,0,0,183,True,Recommended,I've noticed to many negative reviews that doesn't even really include any opinion about the game itself. Community is not something the developers can fix the community is everyone who plays you can't make a review that's based only on that. Especially make it a negative one.,Rust
2018-07-21,2,1,2,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I'm honestly so glad I got gifted this game for free because I actually considered paying money out of my own account that I was saving up for a house rent for. Boy was I lucky.I'll try to keep my cool here but from the 2 hours I've played I personally cannot stand this game. At all.I've only played 2 hours in this game. It is extremely impossible to progress in this game because of the absolutely nasty and toxic community of the game. Servers FULL of spawnkillers and trolls that have nothing better to do but repeatedly spawnkill newly respawned players on the beach. Your character has a hunger bar but there are almost NO animals to kill for their meat to cook. I get it it s supposed to be an intense survival experience but give the player the chance to even get to grips with the basics.The game might have good graphics but it is abysmally optimized. I have an 8GB RAM MSI laptop but still I feel like the screen is tearing everytime I make a single step forward in this game (and people complain that ARK is awfully optimized but you easily get 60FPS on a lower end laptop on the game by simply changing a few graphics settings). Also if you want to join a server be prepared to have a lot of time on your hands as you will have to wait for a legendary time to join a server. It took me HALF AN HOUR to join my first Rust game.You know I m sure Rust is probably a well designed game if you took away these disadvantages but for me they really make me not enjoy the game at all or even want to carry on with this game. I recommend there should be a single player mode for the causal player to get to grips with all the basics. If I bought this game instead of getting it gifted I would think I definitely did not get value for money whatsoever and would have demanded a refund ASAP.,Rust
2017-09-14,0,0,1306,True,Recommended,"So.... this is it huh? Rust Well I don't usually write reviews but rust is such a unique title that everyone should experience to the fullest. My overall aim for this review is to persuade the person saying ""Hey is rust even that good of a game."" *glances at release date* ʘ ʘ""Um.. what the actual F***!"" That was me initial reaction too in all seriousness! I did not expect a game from 2013 to be so FUN! The aspect of survival and communication to building bases and raiding is the wonders that make the game so relevant today! The replayability is amazing and what people don't understand about the title before they buy it (no prior knowledge) is that you play on player hosted / official servers that have a wipe shedule meaning every thursday official servers will reset and everyone starts with a torch and a rock fighting to be the first one with a base. To servers that wipe rarely and have less players but a good way to learn the mechanics of the game and get an in depth feel of what to do and what NOT to do.I have 910+ hours in this crazy game and I don't regret ANYTHING! It is my favorite game today and if you might not be interested please leave a comment and maybe give it a thumbs up anyways because I am going to direct you to a couple of games I enjoy other than this title. Such as WOW Arma III CS GO PUBG H1Z1 Kotk Fortnite Rocket League and that's pretty much it.GOOD LUCK!",Rust

The graphics are beautiful. I rate it 9/10. The gameplay is difficult and very time consuming so if you like that stuff get this game. 8/10 The game takes alot of skill and practice and I don't suggest playing it alone. The thing that ruins this game isn't the gameplay or anything facepunch can change it's the ing community. I ing hate it so much if you're going to get this game anyway don't be friendly and don't feel bad if you kill someone and they say they're friendly if someone says they're friendly throw your ing spear into their head because it's a bait.

I then decided to learn basics and give the game a proper try.I spent about 20hours learning and playing on different servers (noob friendly vanilla modded...) etc etc Sadly no matter how hard i tried to enjoy the game i just realised its the most rage inducing game ever. Make any progress and get shot down by a geared guy for example be peacefull with someone but then get shot in the back for no reason even though you just spawned and have absolutely nothing. Server chat constantly filled with swearing and threats.Save yourself the hassle and dont play this game it will only waste your time and frustrate you.,Rust

2015-06-03,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,This game shows promise and protential but as of this time in an early access stage I would recommend holding out. I was really looking forward to experiencing Rust after seeing various youtube clips and hearing recommendations. However upon purchasing I was met by huge FPS issues receving around 8 9 on the lowest settings I could achieve. My PC should be more than adequate to play this game yet fps issues persist. I researched into the fault (Highlighting the problem amoung various gamers) and also tryed different techniques to try get around it but unfortunatly recieving no luck. The game being in early access seems mostly to be updated with new mechanics craftables etc. However as of this point optimising the game to run more smoothly seems to be getting neglected.,Rust

2014-01-24,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I have been debating on whether to buy Rust or DayZ for a few weeks now. I've read through many pro/con discussions regarding Rust vs. DayZ. Where DayZ seems more zombie centric Rust has more of the survival/scavenging/crafting aspect that I find more entertaining. I bought it last night zoned in started hitting things with my rock to collect materials. Collected a bunch of wood like almost 400 logs. Then I started hitting rocks to get stones I pounded on those boulders for a long time nothing happened. That's when I realized that I had to find nodes and not just the mountain rocks. By this time I was already down to 800 on my food so I set off to find critters to kill and eat. I'd like to say my first life in Rust didn't end with me wandering around dying from starvation but I'd be lying. Rust is unforgiving and mistakes early on can lead to an agonizing death.Next life I zone in and I'm instantly attacked by both a wolf and a zombie. Dead. Sometimes it's not the choices you make but the choices you're handed that decide your fate.Next life I wander around and find some friendlies who give me clothes a bow food cloth and tons of starter stuff. Awesome I'm not starving have a shelter and starting to carve out a life for myself when I'm out hunting and I'm attacked from behind by a zombie. Dead again.I respawn and try to get back to my corpse so I can pick up my newly acquired loot I'm totally lost but finally manage to get to a landmark that I recognize. I'm near starving when I get to my backpack when yeah that zombie that killed me is still nearby and he eats my naked cold newb self.Next life I give up on the backpack. Back with my rock in hand I get my logs and my stones build myself a shack and campfire inside but I'm still hungry. I set out trying to sneak up on pigs and deer manage to get a couple whacks at a deer but it runs too close to what I think is a bear. I let it go and focus on the piggy. Here piggy piggy piggy. I flail wildly trying to land a blow on the pig but I keep missing. It's getting dark. I'm down to 600 food hungry and cold. But finally after about five minutes of chasing that little bugger a very satisfying wet thwack of my hatchet hits paydirt! I start butchering the pig getting animal fat chicken breast (?) and cloth glorious cloth! I make it back to my shack fumble with trying to get the food on the campfire accidentally eating raw chicken and getting poisoned. Throwing up food down to under 200 now as I get it on the fire. Not only am I starving but I'm poisoned and losing health. Health hits 65 waiting. Throw up some more health at 50. I'm watching the fire waiting for it to be done I'm starving I need it I need it to survive when... it's cooked! Oh the glorious pixels of cooked chicken breast harvested from a pig that I ran down and killed with a hatchet! A hatchet that I made! I munched down on it watching my health and hunger start to climb. I could almost taste it and the glorious satisfaction of bringing myself back from the brink of starvation was so rewarding. I ate enough to fill my health and food completely sitting next to my fire during the night cozy listening to footsteps outside and gunfire in the distance. I would not be dying today. I was going to make it to tomorrow.At sunrise I'm up. I had enough cloth to make a bow and enough stones/wood to make some arrows. I made quick work of the deer that eluded me yesterday harvesting food logs and minerals at ever opportunity. I didn't venture far from my campsite both in fear of losing my way back to camp and running into undesirables. I made clothes a sleeping bag some fuel and cooked up a mess of chicken and built a storage bin in my shack to hold my inventory just in case I wander out and get killed I'll still have a stockpile out there I can find.Eventually I found some friendlies again who gave me some supplies more cloth some blueprints nothing too far up the food chain but things I could eventually use when I decide to go on the offensive against the zombies. But nothing in game was as satisfying as surviving that first night making that first kill and setting myself up with a sustainable campsite.Other bonus is I'm on a PVE server which is awesome for learning the game. Everyone is friendly so you don't have to worry about griefers shotgunning your naked self while you've only got a rock.,Rust

2015-11-16,1,1,1248,True,Recommended,This game is everything you could ask for. The only reason people complain about lag is they dont realize that its still in development and try to run it on max settings. Your machine gets 80+fps at max settings on (insert newest game here)? Great but you will have to run at lower settings for rust. Every week played (since zombies in legacy) i have seen improvments and after 1 100 hours of playing i can honestly say i still enjoy it.

2014-01-13,0,0,217,True,Not Recommended,Game consists of you spawning somewhere Then getting shot or beaten to death by other players and or hackers. PVE servers are no fun since the building mechanics are so limited and buggy.Ok.. So respawn. Die almost instantly to players with guns rocks and hackers.Wait let me try again 3 minutes in i found some wood. Then got shot in the head by players and hackers flying around.This goes on in all official servers. Private servers are the same thing except the admin and all his buddies are now getting everything for free and useing you all as target practice.Dont get me wrong i love sandbox and pvp games But after you get spawn killed 72 times in 14 minutes on every server then the game crashes because its in alpha... Not my style.You cannot create your own free local server or play any single player to explore it your stuck with hackers or modded admin abusers. All the ingredients for a good soup but its occupied by diced s and bullsh*t. Dont support this.,Rust

I've tried building a base by myself a couple times and it is very challenging. Another aspect to be aware of is the people. Not many people you encounter on Rust are not friendly... at all.

2018-03-05,0,0,2473,False,Recommended,I have almost 1850 hours into this game so I can't make a claim i don't like it. I have seen it transform from something great to a failure and back to a good game again. Would i pay full retail for it? Absolutely not. But i am cheap and do not like to pay full price for many if any games. The graphics have really come along well most of the game play has improved(save for the way barrels are placed now. sorry i liked the old way when i started of areas not just up roads). Anyway it is a good game for PVP and PVE alike. I run a server and the addons are superb for the most part. You can make the game what you want it to be. I haven't played a strictly PvP server in quite some time so cannot make too much of a review on those. The builder and Pve servers i play on are decent though for the most part. I would like to see some kind of sanctioned quest line or something introduced. Steam achievements are ok i guess and unofficial servers can set up extra content with some effort but it would be nice to give people something to do other than gank you for a rock and 100 twigs. Overall though I have to say I do like the game for it's simplicity of play and the fact that much of it is what you make of it. I bought this back in 2015 on a recommendation and for the most part don't regret it. I only paid $4.99 for it on a deal though lol. I would not pay the new retail price for it if i had to get it again. There are tons of games with more depth for less cash. But having said that it is a good game with many facets to it. It is all what you make of it. You like brutal PvP then there are servers for you. You like to just build gather and survive there are also servers for that. It is what it is. Either you will become addicted or you will get buyers remorse and flame it on a review. If you are a in PvP though it is not for you. Crybabies are not welcome nor coddled. you will be harrassed until you leave. Take the spear in the head get naked again and move on. It's just a game.. Oh and i will click recommend but not for this price. WAIT FOR A SALE.......................,Rust

2018-03-06,1,1,2,False,Not Recommended,This game sucks. From the long loading times... 10 to 15 minutes even with a decent GPU CPU and 16GB of RAM. To the the insta spawn deaths on the beach. Then the more experienced players just follow you around and steal your hard work / earned stuff after killing you. However calling them players is actually an insult to all games. As this is not a game. It's more of a real world noob pillaging simulator.The narrow window of opportunity to get good at this game is a microcosm of real world barrier to entry in big business of any kind. There are too many strong players in ALL the servers now to get any chance to learn and grow in the game.Steam won't refund you. Be forewarned.,Rust

2016-08-18,0,0,104,True,Not Recommended,"To begin with in this review I'd like to say that this game definitely uses ""Early Access"" as an excuse for good reviews... Not going to happen. This game has been up for 3 years and it's disgusting to see the lack of content that it has.This game has the content that I always wanted in a survival game but not the content that a survival game needs. Let me elaborate on this.It allows you to draw on maps write signs with your own mouse typing them on the keyboard and send notes to other players. You can't simply delete an object in an instant any building mistakes will cost you. You can repair your weapons instead of going straight to making new ones.Despite all of these features which are rarely seen in your average survival games they do not include the basics. For example the logic to this game is so dumb. Last I recall deers are not made of chicken. And I don't remember Wooden Spikes hurting you when you're hitting it with a long melee weapon like a spear even if you're as far away as you can be from it. But it's not all just logic right? No it's not. But what's the first thing you should do in a survival game? Find food and water. In this game that is too easy. And the fact that Food refills your water as well? Please there's no survival to it.The only survival I know in this game is surviving from the attack chopper every once in a while or raiding/defending from other people.Do I enjoy it?Sometimes. I love the whole concept of the game. I enjoy trying to survive and build a base with walls and putting up signs writing notes. I like the leveling system and what not. However they NEED to improve. They've pretty much gone back and forth on this. This game NEEDs more content.Would I recommend it?Definitely not. This is a one time playthrough game. You'll rack up 50 hours and begin the get bored of it. I hope that one day this game will change my mind but I have a feeling that'll be in roughly 9 years time.I would recommend that you check out it out every so often until you feel like it has made some progress to the point where you believe it has enough content for your liking. As of now this game is not worth the price. I'd pay 3 for this kind of game.My rating 3/10 Needs more survival content.",Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,125,True,Recommended,The screenshots on the store page don't do the game much credit honestly. If you wish to see for yourself why this fairly pricey game is so fun without paying yet I'd recommend checking some Let's Play's on YouTube. I was skeptical at first as well but checking some video's did help me make the choice and I found out why this game is so much fun. What sets this game apart from other games is how relentless it is and not due to the game itself but more because of the players who play it. A fellow player can either be a friend but more likely an enemy. It's a game of trust and outsmarting those who you do not trust. Death does not mean the end it's the stuff you gather that helps you survive and you must hide them well spread them out if necessary. Once you get the hang of it you'll find yourself gathering Blue Prints to make new items and eventually you'll be trying to make the most inpenetrable fortress of Wood and Metal. Or maybe you prefer more thrill and raid other bases.This game is still in Alpha and yet so much fun already word has it the map is also only a part of what it'll become this would be cool. Last but not least the game already brought up 7.5 Million Dollars so hopefully the creators will have enough motivation to turn this game from an Early Access into a finished product.,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,327,True,Recommended,Take the crafting and building of Minecraft and mix it together with the cutthroat open world gameplay of DayZ and you get something that is even more fresh and entertaining. Unless you fortify a home or find an excellent hiding location you're just as likely to die while you sleep (log off and flop down on the ground) as you are while traversing the world.Excellent. I can't wait to see what will become of the game when it is totally finished.,Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,133,True,Recommended,This game is great before the censorship update i used to be greeted by men with nothing but their At first i thought it would make things awkward if i ever had to converse with these naked cavemen. I felt that maintaining a conversation was almost too much to bear. Then overnight i had a dream about these naked men i realised i too was naked for i cannot see my body. It wasn't until another player told me my was out too that i started to understand that this is what we must do to survive. And survive i did by any cost.Great game must buy.,Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,88,True,Recommended,"This game is a very specific sort of awesome. First two stories from my introductory minutes of the game I spawn in the middle of a field with nothing but a rock a torch and a half empty stomach. In the distance I see a pig this is actually quite unusual and lucky. I run up to it it runs away. I follow it ultimately crouching crawling and encircling it. I am the hunter primal death incarnate I will have meat. I am no more then five feet away when suddenly it runs. Have I scared it? No there is a bear behind me. It eats me. RESPAWNNo pig in site I wander around for a bit. Suddenly someone approaches. We keep our distance and chat briefly. Upon learning I am new to the game he offers me some food. He throws it on the ground and steps back. I approach and look down to pick up the food.He bludgeons me on the head with a rock. Dead.Make no mistake this game is hard unfair unforgiving and unbalanced.It's also the most FUN I've had with a game in a long time.I spent my first night huddled around a fire. I could see about 10 feet into the world the rest was darkness full of noise. Was it leaves in the wind a wolf (that I can't fight off) or someone with a gun (that I also can't fight off)? I didn't know but what I DID know is that it wasn't a scripted level approved ""random encounter"" that I could fight off It was either the leaves or death.It turned out to be nothing and I spent the whole night cowering in fear of the darkness just like a real cave man might.If you want what I think of as ""sim city with zombies"" there are a TON of games out there for you. If you want something unlike anything you've ever played before keep an open mind and jump on in to Rust.",Rust
2014-01-23,0,0,121,True,Recommended,Even though it is still on Alpha the concept seems more like a minecraft meets unreal tournament.Its rather cool how you can take advantage of the sandbox system to creat impressive imaginative and even beautifull structures.I wouldn't say the game is worth 20 euros more like 10. But still good fun especially if you are with friends.,Rust
2014-01-25,0,0,51,True,Recommended,"In an era that mixes the hunter/gather society and the modern era there is much to do in Rust. When you take your first breath on the island of Rust opening up your eyes you are met with a rock in which you have the urge to name Wilson. You look around born into this world with nobody else so you take it that you too must be family of this rock that it was this rock that gave you life that you are a rock and you must be as naked as the rock you're holding. You eventually figure out that you can swing the rock and decide to see what happens if you swing it at a bear. Not good. As you find out Wilson isn't strong enough. You become nearly dead. Bleeding. Suddenly you hear a high piercing noise ring through the air into the bear's skull. It's dead. You turn around and get a glimps of an object who can stand on two legs covered in what looks like bear fur. It's obviously not a rock and doesn't hold a rock like you do. Instead it looks like he is holding a black stick a black and shiny stick with a hole at the tip and funny things sticking out of it. The strange object vocalizes saying something you can understand ""Nice d1ck f 66ot!""The last thing you hear was the same sound you heard before the collapse of the bear. You're dead. You're p15sed. You must learn how to build a shiny black stick such as that object's. You must get your revenge.",Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,692,True,Recommended,A great game it is addictive and you can have a great time with it. The developers really wants you to play once a day. Other people raid you unless you have a very secure base. If you are not in the server for a while your base will decay which basically means that it will disappear it's good and bad because it saves server performance but it also forces you to play once everyday basically.The game suffers from hacking and glitching at the moment but we all know that this is an early alpha and we are a part of the process. The developers knows what they are doing so my faith in them is full. If you have alot of spare time in your life and feel that this will be a good game for you then go for it i totally recommend it. Please don't mix this game with dayz.. It's the same genre as dayz but the community is completely different. People will shoot you all the time and saying that you are friendly doesn't work often. I'm saying this because most people whine about getting shot all the time. My point of the game is just take it or leave it! And please.. don't play alone because you are most likely going to have a bad time. It's a teamplay game and surviving solo is very hard!So to summarize i recommend this game. If you have some time to kill do it with this game!,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,628,False,Recommended,What can I say about rust besides it being one of the most exhilarating experiences I have ever had the frustration level and potential for salt is extremely high. Starting out the learning curve almost feels endless and making mistakes while other players are looking to take advantage of every situation possible can lead to a rage filled cycle of naked farming for hours dying to a geared player and losing all progress. Starting in a server or near the wipe date is a MUST. It allows you to feel the brief period of time (about 2 days max after wipe) where the entire server is farming/building instead of trolling/raiding. When joining a server late being taken on by established clans while still extremely under geared is almost an impossible feat. The community itself in game is toxic and to not be trusted for the most part. Rust revolves around it being a dog eat dog world and the community itself really reflects the mindset. Trust no one and be prepared for the backstabs. With that comes a double edge sword Once I found my group of people or a clan that I was welcomed into I really found a tight knit rust family. That constantly had players on and knowledgeable people to ask. Unfortunately the game can be horribly rough for solo players and would not recommend until extremely familiar with building tricks and layouts. In a nutshell Rust can be a very rewarding and exciting experience. Hearing people off in the distance while mining and hiding in a bush while the attack party walks by looking for you has made me shake more times than I can count. Even blowing open a wall to find yourself in some one else's defended loot room looking at hour's worth of work can be quite exhilarating but its a give and take. With the rush of thievery comes the disappoint of logging on to see your own house has been devastated while logged out. Pros Exciting Trolly Epic Clan Exp. Great base building Cons Trolly Hard Learning Curve Toxic community until you have found friends Salt &amp Rage potential,Rust
2015-06-01,0,0,609,True,Recommended,Good game very robust controls and pretty easy to learn. The community is pretty bad on this game though they will help you via chat but when you meet someone in person it's just KOS (Kill on sight) every time and without second thoughts they will kill you even if all you have is a stone and they have full gear. The game needs some more improvement for sure such as the raiding. Raiding is far too easy and you can't have anything to defend your base for you while you're gone or no notifications to tell you that your base is getting raided and all your loot is going to be disappeared by the time you get back to your base. Without a few friends on this game it is going to be very very difficult. I had to make some friends along the way to make a good base where we are able to defend and stuff. The game could be better and allow a system to benefit those who are allowing fresh spawns to do their thing without being killing constantly. You should be able to have some sort or automated turret or pets or something to defend your home while you're offline. But all this can be done in the final product I suppose.,Rust

We are the only ones who rule the server but we get killed by hackers only not big group beacuse with kill the potato a$$ clans playing in their moms basement. After you roast this nerds you get offline raided beacuse they are to scared to lose their precious loot. And then when you join and notice you have been offlane raided and ask them why they offline raaided you they always answer beacuse they are on 24/7 and their answer are we want more loot too store in our base and never leave with. IIt is to scary for the clans to go out with aks when they have 20 of them so they always leave their base with semi rifles. I once got offline raided even tho i had only bows but we killed they caln 10000000000000000000 times and they were so saolty they raided us each wipe for one entire month cuz they gay lol.

2016-03-20,1,1,2480,True,Recommended,This game covers a wide range of play from super aggressive official servers to more laid back modded servers. Can you run into s on all servers? Yes. Will you run into s on all servers? Probably but there are some good ones out there with good Admins who keep abuse down to a minimum. Rust can be fun. You can solo play or bring along your friends. Don't care for the server you're on? Go join another. Are there bugs? Of course it's an Alpha game. But the devs are working on it constantly. (though I wish they were working faster on keeping the bears and wolves OUT of my house lol! Live/die and learn!) All in all once you find your fit among all the different types of servers you will enjoy the challenge of Rust.Edit After the latest update I have to negate my thumbs up. I recommend NOT playing until they get the serious flaws of newest update fixed/changed.,Rust

2014-02-09,1,1,294,True,Recommended,Rust is one of those games where if you like building and playing alone then don't get it. I have a large group of people. My whole base i armored and it can easily be destroyed over night when your asleep. Basically im saying don't be surprised when you get on and your base is destroyed. The community is also kind at some points and then some are jerks so watch out for that. The game though without all of that I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 because the game has a great building mechanic and crafting is simple. There are animals and players to kill and some animals attack you. Overall though play the game its worth the money and I think you will like the game.*UPDATE* Don't forget that along the way you will meet people who are worse than you and will claim your hacking. Just remember that your better and those people who brag and think they own that random server you just joined make sure to destroy every inch of that base so you can show them who truely owns the server and when they say that was our backup base go look for the other base only realizing they don't have one except for that small wooden shack with a chest and a furnace that they called a base. When its all said and done talk to them in chat and make them realize they should just refund the game because they don't have on no one. Well thats my story that happened this week. It was pretty fun. But no seriously es up. Thats how this game is played.,Rust

Every encounter every area is a grand new experience which is only heightened by your friends and the community which you're embarking into.

2015-08-12,1,1,798,True,Recommended,Welcome to a land of grass Rust is a great game and also a basic still updating game.In my opinion you should definitly buy rust.It is a multiplayer open survival game.crafting shelter to survive the animals that will attack you if you get to close up.kill red animals to get gear/loot.I would rate this game a 10/10 straight up because mostly about the survival and the online features to this amazing game...I definitly think that you should all buy this game...If you have any kind of freind boy or girl it does not matter make sure to let them know about this should review and mostly about this amazing game.goodbye,Rust
2015-08-23,0,0,289,True,Not Recommended,For right now as of this moment i cant play on my 4G Macbook Pro at all. It crashes and its a late 2011 Model im getting a 8GB Upgrade to possibly solve this issue and help gameplay not only here but other high CPU and Ram Consumption games. DO NOT GET RUST UNLESS U HAVE A REALLY GOOD PC. I dont use my PC Very often but it is also a 2011 PC And i get like 12 FPS On it. These past 2 updates have abosolutly killed my Gaming Experiance for Rust. If you have a Nicly Built Computer THEN GET IT! its a beautiful amazing game. It just takes alot to play it (Fairly Well) I know a few Freinds who have the Brand new Mac Desk Tops and these are 2 500 3 500$ Computers very well built and can only get up to 50 FPS. I mean thats enjoyable to play but if these updates continue to Lower the FPS Rust wont be very enjoyable. That was one of the many things Rust had that others didnt you could littlery play it on a Computer. Anyways Thank you and hope this helped you out.,Rust

Perma death and a very deadly gaming environment make this game one of the greatest of the Early Access survival games out there.

2017-05-14,0,0,1473,True,Not Recommended,Rust used to be a very fun and addictive game but the devs made a lot of bad choices They removed bp system and introduced a bad exp systemThey made front and back door sides take the same damage (almost zero that is) from tools so base building was dumbed down to honeycombed cubes where the side you entered didnt matter cause you cant melee a badly placed door anymore.Javelin aiming animation changed to an idiotic one where you cant aim so they went from ok to useless focus shifted on the 'pro' guns (bolt AK semi auto pistol)Access to bolt rifles and AKs got easier so when a server wiped everybody had a bolt on day 2 so everybody just camps rooftops with a bolt.The only positive change made these last few months is in the fps optimization which made the fps double for me.All in all i loved this game but i cant recommend it anymore.At least not at this state.,Rust

They are just people that get mad because they farmed resources for hours and got rekt. There are some people on this game that like to play like they're in Fairyland where everyone is friendly and lives together in a beautiful little kingdom. When I see a guy in Rust 9 times out of 10 I'll shoot them because I know if I didn't they'd probably do the same to me. Also it's quite funny to shoot people in Rust with the noises and stuff. But that's just my way of playing. Rust is a mean game and that's the way it is and a hell of a lot of people like it for that reason. If you don't then don't write a negative review because of it.

I have met alot of people with weapons that are naked just to seem innocent.The game gets updated every thursday and the developers care about what the players think.If you are new i would recomend looking at some streamers or youtubers to learn the basics since the start can be really hard.If u like the game but dont like the kill on sight concept there is always servers with rules and mods that may fit you since everyone can host a server and not only the devs.,Rust

(Also $13.34 CAD on Cheap Fun and easy to runCONS Animals can run through walls Bears are OP and will kill you in seconds if your not armed Water is a pain to swim through Lots of grinding Sleeping bags take 5 min to respawn you Hard to find servers for late game(Most servers wipe every monday) Lots of toxic players(Lots of KOS and Griefing) Pitch black at night(Torch doesn't help that much) VERY hard to find stone But when you do you find alot 90% of raids are when you are offline Not much melee Weapons Helicopters.....

2014-02-08,0,0,940,True,Recommended,"Игра затянула меня еще на открытой альфе хоть и лагала безбожно (частично из за слабого ноута). В общем суть проста тебя выкидывают в открытый мир с одним лишь камнем двумя бинтами и факелом. Камнем надо пилить деревья на дрова и долбить камни на руду (только одиноко стоящие круглые камни респавнящиеся рандомно по карте я же не одупляя этого 3 минуты долбил скалу). Из деревьев делаем простенькую халупу с ящиком для награбленного и идем добывать еду иначе скоро окочуримся. Камень меняем на каменный топор. В альфе пока есть медведи волки олени и кабаны. Чтобы не парится и гонять кабана бейте волка и после перевяжитесь бинтом. Просто мясо есть нельзя или обблюешься надо жарить его на костре Из больших камней добываем собственно камни медную руду и железную руду чтобы плавить руду необходима специальная каменная печь дабы избежать непоняток с ней в нее тоже надо запихивать дрова. Железная руда лежит в основе всех дальнейших ништяков далее строим верстак чтобы клепать огнестрел и патроны к нему. Кстати не забудьте сшить одежду она дает бонусы к защите от разных типов урона. Вскоре вам покажется что вы уже слепили все что только можно а вот х""й. В особо опасных радиоактивных зонах с зомбями лежит самый вкусный лут от антирадиационных костюмов модулей и карабинов до собственно чертежей к ним. Чертежи хороши тем что их стоит выучить раз и потом хоть миллион раз вас убьют вы все равно при достаточном количестве ресурсов соберете то что выучили. В ощем могу сказать что для альфы игра очень даже ничего купить стоит но конечно приготовьтесь к бесконечным патчам и обновам (дотерам не привыкать). Из плюсов это все плюсы DayZ и майнкрафта вместе взятых из минусов невозможность сносить свои дома из за чего карта всегда нагромождена квадратными хижинами что несколько раздражает надеюсь исправят. Ну и типичные минусы альфы присутствуют. Желаю удачи ребятам из facepunch а вам приятной игры.",Rust

2016-04-27,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,It be really neat if there's a singleplayer mode for this game. Because the game it self is pretty difficult with it's wild animals radiation and the helicopter that shoots you down every now and then. That's if you wear clothes and or equip a gun. Not to mention when playing an ordinary server it's even five times more difficult. Dip shooting you from miles away people raiding your house when you're gone and Hackers which I've never experienced one. But a lot of people have. In conclusion this game seriously needs a singleplayer mode. It's still a pretty fun game even with friends. But I just don't see the point of spending 10 hours on gathering resources and building your house and suddenly it has been taken away from you. I just what a singleplayer mode that's all I'm asking for. Please.,Rust

The game mechanics are good if a little unbalanced and ""wonky"" at times.But this is where the real ugly comes in. Rust is as you know an early access game and it has been since it's release in almost 2 AND A HALF YEARS AGO! It has been 2 and a half years and the game is still stuck in ALPHA! Here you have a game that has been in an alpha stage of development while at the same time being accessible to the public for 2 and a half years that is absolutely unacceptable. This quickly ties in to my second problem with the game the perfect unbalance of player progression. Rust is survival game in which you start with nothing and need to build your way up so you'll be spending hours on end gathering resources to make your base and acquire weaponry. But the problem is that there are other players. And this makes for 2 thing 1 Rust solo is absolutely unplayble as you will definitely run into groups more often than not and lose everything you have resource gathering will take an obscene amount of time and there is no way you will manage to defend your base properly from again groups of players.2 Rust in it's current state is simply a deathmatch with a survival and crafting gimick implimented.I have tried several times to get back into Rust and enjoy myself but I just can't seem to be able to anymore.I definitely don't recommend you buy Rust in it's current state or ever for what it's worth.",Rust

I've spent hundreds of hours on this game with my friend and we always go back to it no matter what.One thing we're starting to see quite clear on is how the game has been updated very slowly the game is rarely updating the NEEDED updates.Cons Slow on needed updates.First loading screen is very VERY slow. (You have to do this every time you load into a server for the first time since the client as been open.)Frames are poor.Certain bugs they never seem to fix. Even if I spam on reddit about the problems. (past experience and present.)The games been out for like 4 years and I'm still yet to see many HIGHLY requested things.But that being said overall I do enjoy this game and do recommend it but bare in mind your prayers may not be answered for at least a few months with bugs/things you want to see. (They hinted cars a year ago and we're still yet to even see transport.)So yeah. 8/10 would be a 10/10 if they weren't slow/uninterested with community requested items/updates.Edit Game hasn't been fixed for 7 months for Mac users so don't buy if you will be playing on Mac.,Rust
2015-09-10,2,1,1263,True,Recommended,"Rust is a cruel game like trying to wank 2 minutes after you have already climaxedI find it really hard to put into words how much I enjoy this game. My first experience was terrifying. I woke up naked and alone on a beach only to be chased for five minutes by a naked man with a machete until he cut me down. My next attempt at survival went slightly more smoothly. I sucessfully made a shanty! Ensuring my little hovel was adequately protected I logged off with a confident mind. I logged in the next day to play and once again awoke naked and alone on the beach. My beautiful home had been destroyed and I had been murdered in my sleep. I began to detest the other players. I lived in fear. Cold and naked. I HATED the ""raiders"". I didn't understand why they wouldn't let me live my life. Over the next couple of weeks I struggled to survive living in the fringe of society. I studied the collapsed ruins of once great bases and forts. I searched feverishly for blueprints. I stalked other players learning to sneak around unnoticed. I watched. The server performed it's monthly wipe leaving me with the blueprints to success. Using the knoweldge I gained from exploring raided forts I was able to build myself a fortress ensuring that I did not make the same mistakes as the ill fated survivalists of the past wipe. I farmed for what felt like days. I created weapons. I murderd anyone who DARED to settle within range of my sniper tower. I ruled my kingdom with an iron fist. I have become what I hated.",Rust

2016-02-15,0,0,846,True,Recommended,Well what a game this is. I think this game is very fun and rewarding but only if you put the hours in and have a group of friends to play with. This is not a game you can reach the top in if you do not have lots of time for the game and lots of friends. Also be prepared for the reality of these sorts of games were if you die you will lose many hours of work. Maybe even days or weeks of work. If we compare it to a game like DayZ yes you die but you only lose gear and your location which you can get back in a couple of hours but in Rust you could be raided while you are not even on and find all your stuff gone. On the good side though the game is fun and has a real sense of progression which makes it worth the money. The graphics are good and it is very atmospheric especially at night. Overall i would recommend this game but be prepared for lots of frustration and setbacks in particular if you are playing alone or if you dont have ample time for the game.,Rust

2017-03-12,0,0,152,True,Not Recommended,The game is unstable broken mess. When trying to load onto a server the game freezes up my entire computer and the only way to fix it is to cut the power and restart it the games feels more like a virus then an actual game not to mention when you actually get into a server (if your entire computer has not crashed already) don't even try to change any graphical settings changing those also causes the game to not respond and crash. Don't even get me started on the loading times graphically the game is most certainly not very pretty and as far as map size goes its not very big so why is it that the load times are longer than that of GTA 5.Used to have fun with this game but it seems with each new update it just performs worse and worse until it atempts to murder your computer.,Rust

2014-04-25,0,0,280,True,Recommended,"Rust is by far the best game I have ever played alpha or not. Of course there's a few things to be fixed but once again it's in ALPHA. This game is loads of fun and I can play for hours on end without getting bored simply because there is Always something to do. This game is not for those people who are too kind Rust will destroy you. Though the instructions never say anything about killing everyone that's typically your 1st option. However making alliances proves just as useful. I would highly reccomend playing on Community servers at this point in time because hackers are an issue but can be banned from Commmunity servers.I MUST STRESS that you trust nobody in Rust. The only people you can trust are those who you can inflict damge on in real life and still be weary of them too. Your ally can turn on you very quickly if given the opportunity. Rust has successfully changed the motto to ""Keep your friends close your enemies closer and your Rust friends closest of all."" Sleep with one eye open folks. Best game ever.",Rust

2014-04-17,0,0,460,True,Recommended,Okay usually I don't write reviews as I honestly just play the game and have very little patience or time to do this but I think rust desperately needs an unbiased review. So here it is This game is AMAZING as an alpha one of the best damn games I've played the biggest problem are the hackers which you have to expect given this games release was only about 5 months ago. For those of you who want to fix this the best thing you can do at the moment is pay for your own server and only invite your friends. It's expensive but if you want a hack free environment it's really all you can do at the moment. Now as for the game itself YOU MUST BUY THIS NOW! Support Garry and his team! Buying this game will go towards helping develop this game and fixing it's few but heart wrenching flaws. So do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY! Does it need anti cheat software? Of course! But it's just an ALPHA! So those of you complaining that it needs anti hack software must understand it's no different than when it's less appealing but commercially sucessful counter part Minecraft was first released. When Notch released Minecraft it had a crazy amount of bugs but now it's paved the way for awesome games such as this to exist. Okay so now that that's out of the way let's talk about the gameplay.You start out with a rock! That's right an ordinary rock and must build a shelter or else believe me... you won't survive. This shelter doesn't last however as someone can just get on once you've gone to sleep kill you and take everything you worked for. Location and structure of your buildings are EVERYTHING! Being raided sucks but when you've gotten used to the fast paced world of rust it's not that bad. Blueprints teach you everything you need to know when you first start out you'll have hardly any tools weapons or resources but that all changes when you grind for hours to create an awesome assortment of the finest items you can expect in a post apocalyptic world.Battles are sometimes exhausting but fun running through the woods to escape your predators gives this game a touch of reality that you would expect from this altogether depressing setting. Gathering friends to wage a war against other bands of enemies and looting their goods is not uncommon in this game and if you are playing solo chances are you'll want to make friends pretty quickly. Airdrops are sent in from the sky by the administrators of servers to help balance the world but beware solo players! You can expect to be shot at for attempting to pick these up. So as for the pros Amazing building sim intelligently executed CoD like gunfights!And the flaws Desperately needs anti cheat software! Needs better records of who is taking advantage of this.This game has given me my life back! Not really but as far as games go a one time fee of 20 dollars? You have to buy this. Buy it now!,Rust
2015-03-01,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This game is a work in progress. They had to restart but I stayed with it. It runs like trash sometimes and I can't explain why the old version runs fine 60 75 fps on 1920x1080 Fantastic but the new one doesn't run as well. It's sad too because a lot of people on low end computers want to play both but can't. I have a computer that has a quad core and a 4gb video card but no can't run it without constant framerate drops. All the performance aside OMG. This game is so funny.

I'll forgive the game for that. I think the one thing that just sucks the most is knowing that someone just kills you while you are offline. The feeling of losing everything you worked hard for is such a downer. This is not what I play games for. I play games the way they are meant to be played for fun and I am not getting that from this. The toxicity of the community ruins this game. All it takes is a few bad apples to spoil the bunch. Unfortunately for online gaming in general bad apples are commonplace. All you need is ONE person to bust through a wall (they have all the time in the world while you are offline) kill everyone while they are prone and can't fight back loot everything and vandalize everything you worked for.This sinking feeling sucks. Save yourself from this experience and do not buy and play this game. I do not care about the developer's vision of ""a very realistic game"" because this is NOT a fun feeling.",Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"I've been playing this game on and off for quite a long time. I personally enjoy the game but only sometimes. This is because the core gameplay is very simple and yet very rewarding and satisfying. However progression in the game is a complete mess. As farming for blueprints can be the most agonizing thing known to man. But when you do git gud the game starts to get bland. I've personally never really enjoyed pvp in survival games so when you become all geared up pvp is the only thing left to do. Pvp consists of 90% gankers and 10% newbies with no equipment. I personally try to avoid confrontation of any sorts. This however has limited me to playing very nomadic like (roaming constantly). This means that I'm never really able to properly gear up and build a large base of my own and I usually have to rely on shoddy wooden buildings for shelter. This of course leds to many deaths by either bears or freshspawns. Even though I personally find Rust difficult to have ""fun"" with I can still find it interesting to play. And as a result I find my self coming back to it even after swearing to never touch it again.I do recomend this game but only if you have a large group of people to play with unless you don't mind getting killed unfairly and having to constantly run about naked for hours on end.&lt 3",Rust

I spent most of the early hours of this game running through radiated areas completely naked with nothing but a few fire sticks and my trusty rock named Wilson.The aim of the game is to not get rust on any of your metal items. The easy part about this is that WIlson is made of stone so you're practically unstoppable. You spend a large portion of the game cutting down trees and killing animals because f**k greenpeace. Eventually you build a house out of twigs mud and tears only to have it blown to bits by a**hats with C4. When you leave the game you do not actually leave you simply go into an induced coma where you dream of real life only to wake up back in the land of rust where some 12 year old has kicked down your door violated your comatosed body and taken you for everything you have. The moral of the game is to always sign a prenup. 3/10 would more than likely not dine again IGN,Rust

2017-02-16,1,1,85,True,Not Recommended,I got Rust after reading about it and I wanted to see if it was as much a sociopathic experience as I had been led to believe. Oh it was.The fact is Rust is typical of games like 'Day Z' and other 'Open World Survival Games' that have promoted early access and have yet to establish groundwork evolving between server wipes. There is a great deal of Rust which focuses on resoruce gathering and that stuff but it really boils down to your ability to find a group (preferrably large) and then murder the hell out of anyone else during raids. Yep you learn how to build etc but it doesn't matter You cannot go it alone in Rust for very long and even your allies will eventually either get fed up and quit or you will. There are good things about Rust I said it was familiar to Day Z but I think it takes those elements and builds in more survival and on one level it forces you to cooperate in situations you wouldn't want to. Rust's receipe system is okay I've seen better but Rust handles it well. Combat is attrocious and cheating remains a big issue. Aimbot city at some points reminding me of the aborted APB launch on how many people at one time or another use aimbots or a few other cheats. This is the biggest issue It's never about survival or combat and neither matter when you're dealing with the uncertainty of what you do and people whose only goal is to eat you....which actually happens with surprising frequency.So until Rust is fully supported and released I can't really recommend it. I like a lot of the ideas about it but I get frustrated with the combat system the survival mechanic and the cheating in it. You're better off with something else but hey that's my opinion,Rust

On the way I came across a small group of naked men who didn't notice me. They seemed to be speaking another language. I shot and killed one of them and the men screamed and began attacking me with rocks and wooden hatchets. With their primal weapons against mine I mowed them down with my assault rifle. Their damage was next to nothing thanks to my fantastic armor. Rocks and naked bodies flew all over the place. I continued on got some candy bars and stuff and headed back to base.

They totally ruined the game when the made the leap to the new engine. Rust legacy was nothing to be amazed by but was much better than the game now. Legacy had balanced PVP a simple base building system and was just overall better than todays version. Now PVP is horrid taking forever to kill someone and having major balanceing issues. Base building is fine very simple but fun for a little. The community is again horrid everyone shooting on sight and raiding your bases. Simply put the game in its current state is not worth playing 5/10,Rust

What's more it's not really an immersive survival experience. Animals are usually no where to be found players won't leave you alone. Maybe this was just my personal experience so don't take this review as 100 percent the reason you should/should not buy the game.,Rust

2015-12-28,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Takes 10 minutes to load to main menu assuming it didn't crash to desktop before then. Takes another 20 30 minutes to load a server assuming the game didn't crash when I picked a server. Then if I'm lucky enough to actually get into a game the game crashes my computer entirely when I open the menu to check keybinds. The game also completely refuses to load to main menu at all in windowed mode.This is completely unacceptable especially since I'm not running a toaster. I'm not throwing this trash on my SSD to make it load slightly quicker because the load times shouldn't be this long to begin with. The framerate was choppy as hell despite running it on fastest settings and it looked terrible on all settings. Instant refund after it crashed my computer.

Game is really fun if you play on EU/NA servers Asian Servers are pretty much dead having only 1 2 players in each server(who I guess are the admins of those servers).The only thing I don't like about the game is it has become literally impossible for solo/duo players to survive in this game(now earlier it was not that hard to survive in solo) and build a good base as the game has become really grinding and it is literally impossible for a single player to keep up with the demands of keeping a good base up.,Rust

The game is still in Early Access yes but the game does not fail to entertain me and suprise me with new things no matter how long I play it I always find myself in different situations and if very fun situations. You can either choose to go regular survival with no PVP or add a little bit a fun and play some PVP where the fun never really ends. The grind of the game is pretty hard unless you are looking to go the easy way and join a server with easy ways to get stuff but in general the grind is fun and with friends its even more fun. Making a base getting everything ready going out to raid and then getting raided in return is actually satisfying even if you do lose a couple of battles it is still a very enjoyable game and I will continue to play it.The game keeps getting better and better and the developers do not look like they are in any shape to slow down.,Rust

2014-07-05,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Welcome to Rust. A game were everywhere you look BAM! man holding a rock flailing in the wind like a branch off of a tree. Assuming you don't bash his skull in and make a nice skin tuxedo out of him you may greet him. He will respond by bashing your skull in with his rock. Now he has two rocks. You respawn. You want revenge. You may decide to play it safe and run away from other players. Or you could be Leroy Jenkins and smack people with your rock. Hunt a pig and question the logic on why it gives you chicken breast instead of bacon or anything else that pigs give you. You will also make some nice clothes to hide you flailing branch like Or maybe you want your victim(s) to stare blankly at you dong while you bash thier skulls in. Maybe you'll cut down a tree with a rock and find some other rocks to make a sweet hachet. Now you're ready to deal some damage. Then you realise you've spent an hour or two deciding how you're going to do this. Rust is a thinkers game But at the same time you can just bash people's faces in with a rock. Weither you decide if you want to be a supreme overlord of the world and then flee from a wolf or a bear or a ZOMBIE BEAR! just try to get by living far away from civilisation or just wandering the land stopping when you need to or you could be the pillaging of the server and just kill everything in sight. Play it how you want kill everything or a peaceful person who helps others until the people getting helped realise they can chase you and kill you unless you are smart and drop it all and leave. In all seriousness Rust is a great game missing a few features that will be added soon like more weapons and armor a craftable map that shows you where you are and a icon system to let you know where you're house could be or towns. 10/10 would play again.,Rust

The developers are working hard on bringing new content and patches asap and for a game in alpha it is well worth the buy even now. I would give rust a 9/10 but thats just my personal opinion enjoy the game and happy hunting ) (update) The game has progressed a lot since first we saw and now it is a very rewarding pvp game nothing feels better than killing a full team of bandits who have been harrasing you and your friends for days and it feels even better defeating them and blowing into their base and stealing all their hard earned (Most likely stolen) gear.,Rust

Therefore if you want to give it a proper shot you must choose from one of those community servers ruled by players who might ban you after hours of playing with no reason at all or just don't handle hackers properly.On the other hand the gameplay itself has got the strongest potential in years and if you like to craft items build bases and outposts make friends or enemies (which is greatly improved by nicely done proximity voice chat) raid bases and infiltrating houses with a rock get massacred by nakeds with rocks while some guy passes you by with Enrique Iglesias singing trough his voice chat on... than there is no other game more fitting this yet ""unknown"" style.",Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,140,True,Recommended,If you can get in a decent server that suits your needs and steer away from the official servers then I think this game is definitely worth the 20 bucks. Its pretty exhilerating once you get enough loot and weapons to comfortably wander the map with good defense. But on the other hand in the official servers you will constantly be dealing with Modders and Hackers doing all sorts of different things to gain advantage over everyone else whether or not its flying or suicide hacks. Its not new user friendly game as everyone with a gun will shoot you because they dont trust you which means dont trust anyone with weapons. It also helps alot to have a mic as well. A mic in any game helps actually but for this game it is even more crucial. I give it even though it is in alpha a 4/5 stars. Not a must have but with recent patches and the updates this game should be able to compete with DayZ during the final release as long as the developers listen to the community and fix things accordingly.,Rust

I upgraded to a full house with a metal door and thought I was ontop of the world until two of my nieghboors who had shouted at me ""Im friendly Im friendly"" which are words you will learn to never trust in rust shot me and blew my metal door open with explosive charges.I releized then I would need a bigger house in a more secluded area and starting at square one again like I had never even played the game before I convinced six of my friends to get the game. Within three days we had a seven story house full of guns and ammunition only to be hacked three sepereate times now. Our house still stands the hackers just take everything inside. So hopefully when the hackers are banned we can continue living in our large house daily fighting our nieghboors and killing people just trying to get a metal hatchet of their own.

Within the first 3 hours of the wipe a clan finished their main building (huge sniper tower) and took down a helicopter using Assault Rifles and Bolt Actions. A few minutes after they raided 3 solo bases (including mine) next to them with flamethrowers grenade and even some c4.The fact that clans can get guns ammo and explosives within the 3rd hour and raid/discourage solo players is not ok...And now that the crossbow is basically worse than the bow while defending and that xp stays over wipes this game is next to impossible for anyone not in a clan.(I still recommend it becuase I believe it will be fixed and there are some options other than survival.,Rust

2016-08-19,0,0,210,True,Recommended,Similar to the TV show 'Lost' after playing Rust for a while it's clear the developers have no idea what the final iteration of the game will look like. First the blueprint system was removed and was replaced by the XP system then it was put back in again alongside the XP. There are frequent tweaks here and there new items and places to explore.On the one hand you could say the devs are listening to the players and changing the game accordingly on the other you could question whether or not they have a clue about where Rust is going and what it'll finally look like. The game is still in Alpha and that doesn't look like changing any time soon. There are some performance issues I have a GTX 970 and experience the most horrendous frame rate drops from time to time.Despite all these issues though Rust is a brilliant game. It's raw terrifying exhilarating frustrating and down right annoying all at the same time. The community at times can be awful think ten year olds who kill on sight when you've just started. But if you find a good server get a friend or two you will have an enormous amount of fun.,Rust

2016-08-17,0,0,246,True,Not Recommended,Bad google translate for developers I strongly commend and recommend this game but I would like to draw the attention of developers at a very important problem so this review is red. Rust and without the help of a very demanding applications in which so many elements that they require strong computer rendering. I am the owner of the i7 processor and GTX 980ti and it would seem to me to complain that?But the problem is that Rust works exclusively in windowed mode. Yes you heard right only windowed mode. You say yes no I play in full screen the author you stoned! But alas no Rust just run in windowed mode to full screen without border. You ever tried to play CS GO in windowed mode? FPS drops below the mouse becomes unmanageable and kill someone becomes very problematic. All because Windows does not allocate enough resources to the computer windowed mode and furthermore in the case enters the vertical sync. What it is? It is built on Windows technology that adjusts the number of frames transmitted image at the frequency of your monitor. For most people the monitors operate on a frequency of 60hz. Some believe that 60 Hz is equal to 60fps 120fps some what but not the essence the main thing that Windows is cutting staff. Mouse becomes unmanageable and the rotation of the camera in the game is waiting for frame synchronization so even if the game you 300fps it looks only at 60fps and disable vertical sync window for the application is not possible!Computer Resources in windowed mode go nowhere the processor and graphics card are burning hellfire developers are trying to optimize the game released patches to improve FPS but the whole thing in windowed mode. I do not know if they forgot about the full screen mode or they all monitors at 144hz but the fact is that the game could work much more efficiently in full screen mode. For this reason I gave up the game yet I can not kill anyone I do not have a monitor at 144hz. I hate to look at the brake chambers during rotation. On my top end PC is no difference minimum graphics settings are in the game or maximum the game still looks Vries and she always 60fps. Friezes way when you're skirmish with someone and for a split second the camera freezes too terribly enraged.Developers! Very I beg you do the normal full screen mode! I do not want to buy an expensive monitor 144hz me and my monitor like.,Rust

2016-08-02,0,0,122,True,Recommended,Ignore most of the bad reviews. A lot of them are complaints how they get raided or the xp/level system. Summery of this game is building up a base and raiding other bases. Simple. If you get upset you got raided maybe this game isn't meant for your.The game is server base with a strong community of servers. Don't like taking forever to gather resources and leveling up? Play a modded server that increases the Xp and resource gain. There is no need to complain about taking forever to level up with all these options. With that being said I never played this game when it was real early in the release. I never played when you had to locate blueprints to unlock for crafting items. So I wouldn't know the difference for unlocking items. But I don't see an issue Because again if you have an issue with taking forever to level up grind to unlock items. You can join servers that offer x3+ xp gain. To conclude rust is an fantastic game to play with other players wether it be becoming allies or making enemies. Yes being a solo player can be a bit difficult when there are other players on a server that are teaming up. But aye that's a life of a spicy boi.My overall rating of this game is 8.5/10 10/10 if you play with friends.,Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,173,True,Recommended,Even though this game is reviewed as positive dont be fooled. This game is full of wonderful mechanics graphics gameplay and Items. However the Community is the only issue with this game. I recommend this game to anyone thinking of getting it for the reason being that its massivly updated its nothing short of a masterpiece in survival games. As you can see i have a bit of hours put into this game and alot of that was fun times playing with friends. But as a big tip too new players. Find an empty server to start on and enjoy all the game has to offer first. Nobody on this game will help you or be nice to your face. Even if you just have a rock they will kill you. I spent about 2 hours testing different servers for peoples reactioons. In every server i tested i would be killed by some random person in 5 minute intervals. So please dont look at this and dismiss the game buy the game play it on an empty server once your good join a populated one with a friend and be prepared to die a lot. These people are masters at killing at this point. So dont be suprised if you die as much as i did. Besides all that this game has many amazing features to prevent you from getting bored and many things to do its hard but its a survival game so thats how its suppose to be. Play it and you will see its amazing gameplay and replay value. But again dont be suprised if you die A LOT.,Rust

2016-06-20,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"A pathetic ""game"" that hardly meets adequate standards of any of it's many genres. The first thing you will notice after buying this game is that you must wait an excruciating amount of time before experiencing the beautiful amazing title screen who's beauty definitely justifies the 5 minute wait and makes you facepalm and say ""Wow that is a completely reasonable amount of time to wait for many paragraphs of text involving the game over a diarrhea coloured background. Now I can join any random server to start from scratch again even though I have 400 hours spent on other servers (about an hour on each one ) but they are constantly being wiped so none of my information is saved. But I enjoy spending ALL my time scavenging a wasteland swarming with redneck gun owners who will go out of their way to shoot a naked defensless new beginner."" After the titles screen there's yet another 5 10 minute wait to join servers. The game's only have decent feature is the music but still... Meh. Also the ""open inventory"" hotkey by default is fkn tab. Feck you rust. I don't understand how anybody finds enjoyment in this rubbish game is it because they like to stare at wangs? I'm sure it is.

2018-08-13,0,0,602,False,Not Recommended,"this game used to be amazing before workbenches became a thing since it meant that a solo player could atleast have a chance to slowly work his way up without the need for joining a clan but after the devs added them in this game the thought of playing solo is unthinkable . the game has just become a game of who can have the most people in thier clan.let me explain why. so before workbenches as long as you had the ingrediants for a recipe you could craft that item which allowed players to not be as vulnerable when they just spawned etc but after the update workbenches became necessary to progress through the game and unlock the ability to craft certain recipes which wouldnt be a problem if you didnt need so much scrap to just to craft the workbenches and unlock the recipes which by the way take forever to find and collect. This update not only made it so much more tedious just to be able to make a base weapons and tools but it also caused players and clans who already have those crafting recipes to have an absolutley monumental advantage. So to combat with this most players now are forced to join a clan or play with thier buddies since playing solo is basicly just pointless since you'll always either get your base raided because you won't be able to gather enough scrap or stone to upgrade thew walls of the base or you'll just be flat out killed by a group of players with ak47's.I'm guessing by now you are thinking "" lol wut a nub can't just kill that group of players"" but it is much harder than you think because a bow and arrow is the only ranged weapon you can make without a workbench and it can take 3 hits just to kill a player with no armor with a bow which means no matter how good your aim is there is no way you can handle those many players with such powerful weapons.it's a shame really how far down the drain this game has gone since that update.and that's not even it. Did I ever mention the hackers? Because they are EVERYWHERE especialy the official servers because there is never any moderators there. Which makes this game a breeding ground for hackers and script kiddies.Combine that with an absolutely revolting fanbase of manchildren and 8 year olds who do nothing but spam the N word in chat and scream at maximum volume into thier microphones when you encounter them than you have yourself a game that ( untill the devs rebalence the gameplay) belongs in the toiletbowl.

Graphics are already amazing and a major graphics update is coming in the next week or two. The weekly updates from the developers are great and you can tell they are really listening to the community of players/testers. Even more additions to the complexity of the game are coming and I couldn't be more excited. Definitely recommend that you try this out especially at a steal of a price (US$20.00).,Rust

Now sadly every time I try to play it I am roleplay by some weird nerdy kid and murdered for being a woman or locked in a dungeon in someones base and may not play. It is because of this sadly that I stopped playing the game. I was happy with a black man because I am neither racist nor sexist but the my character being turned female without my control has made the gameplay entirely unenjoyable for me and I will never purchase a game created by the same company.,Rust

2017-08-13,0,0,349,True,Not Recommended,Back in June 2014 is when I first purchased and devoted my life to the legacy version known as Rust (Alpha).I may not have as many hours as some others who have posted here but let me tell you why.I loved the Legacy version of this game it ran fine on my old 'gaming laptop' with 8gb of ram and a 720m fine with 60fps most of the time and little to NO drops at all. When Legacy stopped being updated and they moved to the 'new and improved' version of rust I was sceptical but optimistic. Turns out the newer version of rust didn't run on my old reliable laptop and so I stopped playing for a few months until it was better optimized. Skip forward 3 4 months and it still didn't run above 30(ish) fps. I then played it again for a few days just to get a feel for the new version and when I found my lack of fps a struggle when fighting I opted to quit rust until I had a better computer. Skip another 2 3 months and I had just finished a custom computer with a gtx 770 i5 4690k and 16gb ram.Beauty I thought I'll be able to run rust easy with this and they'll have optimized it more in the time I've been gone!Wrong. Even my new computer struggled to run rust at a steady framerate. I tweaked the settings and barely managed to get my fps to hover around 60. Which was fine I put a fair few hours into rust during this period was active on mainly one server and actively waited for wipe day and updates like a kid on Christmas. But it seemed with every new feature implemented the devs drew further away from optimizing their game.And although there was always talk about performance increases and fixes in devblogs I never saw an immediate improvement in the game's performance a game that has been in early access for over 3 years and has seen no 'massive' improvements in optimization. Which is one of the core features that simply turns me off rust everytime I try to get back into it.Which is why I cannot recommend this game. EVen now with a GTX 1070 there is constant stuttering during gunfights massive lag spikes for no reason at all and random drops that make it nearly impossible to play this game sometimes. And I just cannot understand why they insist on adding paid cosmetics into a game that has barely had any massive performance enhances since it's change to the new version.I have not played rust for a long time and I doubt I will until some sort of progression is added and stability gets a major overhaul. Unfortunately that's just how it is with early access games but I look forward to playing rust when it is optimized and I feel the same excitement I felt during Legacy.,Rust

2017-10-26,0,0,226,True,Not Recommended,i love this games idea. the concept is great the base building and crafting are amazing it becomes to easy to survive to quickly though and becomes more of a pvp/steal everything thats not nailed down quest quickly. this combined with a toxic community of people ruins all of the positive. the frustration of trying to play a game and dieing repeatidly after spawning is like a Groundhog Day movie from hell. playing solo is near impossible at this point and if you do happen to get established you log back in and your dead and all your is stolen. there is no reward for socializing and no reprucussions for killing anyone and everyone in your path and with guns ammo and explosives so easy to get even with the new bp system again youare screwed for not being in a group. since there is no social aspect and people are satly and kill on sight because that is the mentality of the game at this point all of the solo players that could potentially come together ultimatly cant because out of the 50 social interactions they have had most likly none have had a positive outcome. i stay the optimist and hope for this game in the future but your main advertisement is youtubers and even most of them have went to KOS because of bad social interactions. but it is because of this i cannot recommend this game to my friends and i love to play it and talk about it but most of my friends think i am a glutton for punishmnet because all i have ever had is negative outcomes every time i have tried to play and they refuse to play it with me because of that so i stay the solo player and hence have a extremly hard time i will keep checking back on this game and keep watching content to see if things get better and the bp system has increased servers length of life but until there are consequences for acting like an a**hat then i regretfully cant reccomend it. i hope and pray i can change this in the future but until some changes happen i cannot,Rust

2014-11-25,0,0,19,True,Recommended,First off until the actual game is playable play Legacy. And second its a great game I can get everything i would need lose it all to raiders then set off for vengeance without even being sad that I lost all my stuff. Great relaxing game with action packed moments at times. (also looking for someone to team up with),Rust
2015-01-31,1,1,235,True,Recommended,"I ve played this game since Legacy (shortly after it came to steam) and i am still playing it.Some reviewers have said that the ""new"" rust has lost what appealed to the players in the old rust and i agree. HOWEVER they have focused a lot on bringing the ""new"" rust closer to what it was and they are doing just that with weekly updates.The Dev team is very dedicated and skilled and although they receive some critisism for not listening to their players i have to say i am glad that they are careful about what to implement and what not to implement. If you look at the suggestions coming from players there is about 20 game breaking suggestions for every good suggestion.The fault the devs did when they made the ""new"" rust was that instead on focusing on developing the game up to the same point as the ""old"" rust was they focused on adding new things instead resulting in a game that you easily got tired of. But they have fixed it now and i can frankly say that i have more fun on new rust now than i ever did on the old rust. And the best part? Its getting better every week.Some might be wondering why they made a new rust instead of sticking to the old one well i will answer that with a short as possible answer without getting too far into the details.Legacy rust had an old graphics engine and that meant that it had its limits when it came to what could be done and what couldn t be done by the developers. It also got very laggy on big servers with lots of players and building objects. There was also the problem with the fact that when the game would be ""finished"" the graphics would be outdated and the game dead shortly after. So the devs decided to ""move"" the game over to a brand new graphics engine called Unity which opened up a lot of new opportunities and possibilites. The servers can now support 500+ players instead of 32. You can have 500 000+ objects compared to 2000+ on old rust. The graphics are out of this world compared to the old version building system is better gathering system is better. Every single thing is better or being improved for the better.And that is why i give rust a 10/10 not because its a perfect game far from it. But because the Devs do whats necessary to make the game into what it should be and continuously keep working to improve and add to the game aswell as cleaning up bugs and whatnot.Pros Very good game Stable and very playable 100s of hours of fun (value for your money) Infinite possibilities Fun game to play with friends good fighting system good graphics Being improved on a weekly basis Devs are blogging 2 times a week about whats being done to the game and in the rust community. (google rust dev blog)Cons Crappy community Lots of russians and most people will kill you on sight. Finding a good partner ingame is hard and will take time. But its all worth it in the end. People will betray you once you turn your back. This game teaches you one thing NEVER TRUST ANYONE. If you give people a chance to raid you they will. the ""new"" version of rust is very playable and can give you hundreds of hours of fun but it is still far from complete expect bugs and funny situations. The game has a rather steep learning curve but it is not hard to learn it by yourself or with a friend. That feeling you get when you come back from a gathering trip only to be killed right outside your front door by a guy who has been waiting for you in hiding for the last hour or so. IT WILL HAPPEN so be careful.again 10/10 would recommend to everyone even my mother in law.",Rust

2015-01-31,1,2,669,True,Recommended,Rust Legacy is what I will be talking on. If I could describe it then I would say that it is the equivavant of smoking crystal meth whilst huffing paint. During the summer holidays I played for two weeks with a friend. On the third week I met a new friend and that is where it got bad. We met other people and because it was six weeks morning to night 24/7 we formed relation ships that shaped the next 3 weeks and a bit after the holidays. It got to the point where my friend I had known for a year turned on me for someone we had known for a week. Relationships broke relationships were made new people came to the server in groups and ed us over and making us not trust eachother hackers made us doubt our friends and it was just a genuine emotional fest. In the end where it was like the end of a ing battlefield no one was left together people were split the server had closed and I had not spoken to my friend or the new one i met for over 5 months. I quit most games I played with my old friend and attempted to pass my exams as I did not want to fail. After another month when I failed my exams anyway I came back to my friend. We talked about the rust legacy and how it was the 6 weeks that had morphed life as we know it. Now as stupidly camp as this sounds I miss the rust. But yea 10/10 Would do RUST LEGACY crystal meth and huff paint again.,Rust

2017-06-01,0,0,437,True,Recommended,Rust is an amazing game with its own unique gameplay! The graphical details are outstanding! Considering this is only an Early Access game it truly is unbelievable. The DEVS are hard working and try their very best to release new patches each week to improve the expierence for the players. The team have been creating a product that is bug free and as optimized as it can be in the alpha stage. For only $20.00 it's a steal.Its a game that you SHOULD buy if you're into the survival genre. Of course like any other survival game people will raid you and take everything you've worked towards. If you're new to the game it will happen a lot more frequently due to the base designs you build. Each base is unique and can be broken into in multiple different ways. The more experienced builder you are less chance you will be raided. Servers do get wiped to keep performance at high standards. I do only have a small amount of time played on RUST but any update the DEVS release affects the community and does not put anyone at a advantage or disadvantage each player is able to access the same things. (It all comes down to skill.) They release content they feel is ready each week although their sole focus is on optimization and debugging.You really do get what you're paying for.,Rust

2013-12-24,0,0,75,True,Recommended,Alright...it's been over a year since Rust came to early access. It used to have a ton of players (still does but like 40k less players than a year ago). The reason for the lack of players is because well..Facepunch decided to majorly overhaul Rust with an experimental build. While the older version (which can still be played) got left to rot.Here we are a year later. There's the Legacy version (Rust 1.0) and then there's just Rust. Which is the majorly overhauled version. There's a procedarily generated map waaaaayyyyy better graphics and the game runs smoother. Now if you haven't touched Rust since Legacy then there will be a huge learning curve for you. It's literally a whole new game but it's still a ton of fun to play. (I'll add more at some point in time but the final verdict will remain a 9/10),Rust

After playing on this server for the first time we started to notice the admin of this server abusing players. He continued to bully people in the game chat and kicked/ban anyone who said anything in reply to his malicious comments. This server offers in game rewards for people who rate his server which is ranked 48.

Please take into consideration when purchasing this game that you will run into trash talkers and abusive admins. Please whatever you do do NOT join that server i posted. My friend was banned for being a so called ""Whiny Baby."" If you enjoy survival games this is definately a fun game but the game devs don't give you an option to report servers for abuse. So far ive been looking for an hour and haven't found a way to report that server. I decided to write a review hoping someone will take action since our opinions didn't matter to Rust Servers.net who harassed us for posting in their forums about the situation. They did not offer any soultions to the reports of abuse. Rust Server.net was very unprofessional with dealing with our complaint about the server they host on their site. Do not try to complain to them or rate the servers on their site. The admin will delete your comments if they show any negative talk about the server you are complaining about. They only let people comment who enjoy the server. Server List.net is a terrible site. They are rude and do not like complaints sent to them. Over 20 people were banned today for disagreeing with the admin abuse and malicious comments. I am complaining on here now for the simple fact there is no where else to complain about the game and it's servers.",Rust

One of the bastard bandits actually agreed and they both stood next to each other and pulled hatchets out. Before I could ask them to holster their hatchets they both smashed me in the face and started shooting me again. After about two minutes of running about like a ing retard one of them actually shot me through my torso.

2016-06-02,0,0,196,False,Not Recommended,This game has been in early access for an extremely long time and while it has changed an awful lot in that time it is still an extremely buggy game with leaks and often unplayable due to a large array of crashes.I have given up waiting for this game to become stable and I am tired of reading conversations amoung players time and time again about how it isn't working. Here are the most recently things my community said about Rust in a very short conversation 'it wouldn t connect' 'mine crashes whilst loading a lot' 'Stable rust?! Now that s a trick' 'all of a sudden I got random crashes while in game' 'crashes while loading as it becomes unresponsive' 'weird hard crashes in game though'.Only one person I know plays it regularly and the rest check it out occasionally and always come back with the same feedback. I've played it for many hours and I get the appeal I do. But enough is enough I will not blindly love a game because the premise is good or because of brief moments of gold with friends. They made those moments not the game.It also has and increasing hacker problem the community is largely toxic and the game is SO unbalanced it makes mid/late game progression impossible without having an army behind you that literally have no life outside of the game and play around the clock.If you get it for free fair play but don't pay for it.Rust a rage inducing 2/10.,Rust

2017-06-17,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,"A truly remarkable but in no way unique addition to the survival/builder genre that took hold in the eyes of gamers ever since Minecraft came into existence. For many people they desired something more realistic more hardcore and even no they search for it. To say this is the desired game is a lie. I like this game and I want to like this game more than I do but ultimately this game has been in early access for 4 years. FOUR YEARS the developers have been updating it and that's great except like many many early access games it is and will likely forever remain an early access game. What this means is that the developers IE facepunch get to be lazy SOBs who leave game breaking bugs in the game while adding content at a snail's pace. Will most of these problems be fixed? the likelyhood is no because 4 years on the bugs are still there. The game is very entertaining the gunplay is impressive and the things you can do with the building system in the game is equally impressive but sadly you simply cannot be successful by yourself in this game and dont' expect to get anywhere on your own. The game is ridiculously pitted against new players without so much as a tutorial to aid you in figuring anything out. There is no Singleplayer and multiplayer is either modded or extremely large servers where most players have already build dozens of large bases next to each other. The likelyhood of you spawning next to (or inside as I once experienced) a player base is extremely high on populated servers. It's the community and the glitches that ultimately kill this game for me as well as features in the game that actively penalize victims in situations making it virtually impossble to defend a base if you get killed before you can react. The problem ultimately is the community is possibly the worst and most cancerous group of underaged plebians you will ever experience in a game far worse than anything you'd see on facepunch's other notorious game Garry's Mod a game I have sunk more than 1500 hours into. AI animals do a ridiculous amount of damage a wolf can kill a player not in armor in 2 3 hits. AI animals run faster than you making it impossible for you to escape as well. They have an extremely large aggro range as well and tend to camp your body so it is impossible to get your gear back. Also if you die you might as well count all your gear as a loss because you will never get back to your body in time to get it before it despawns. Bodies despawn in 5 minutes and the average timer on a sleeping bag to respawn is 5 minutes. All of these frankly stupid features ultimately work against you and defeat the purpose of having your gear drop for any reason other than people get to jeer you call you various racial slurs loot your body naked and carry on their way while you wait to respawn for another 4 minutes. Or you could spawn randomly which always will put you at the opposite side of the map from where you died and often puts you in the same place if you die next to the random spawn. I experienced being spawncamped murdered and looted by the same man 27 times in a row each time the man taking the time to yell racial slurs at me and wait for me to respawn. My ""random"" spawn put me in the same place and he shot me and yelled at me and waited for me to spawn again. This continued until he ran out of ammunition and decided to leave. There are no such thing as ""good"" admins on this game. I have yet to experience an admin that banned users for abusive offensive or disruptive behavior. I have yet to see anyone punished for ridiculous actions not limited to camping bases and spawns just to ruin other people's experiences. However if you can get past all that maybe find yourself a secluded place to make your base and manage to make something you might have a short time of fun before a player inevitably raids you while your offline. Either that or the server will reset and you will lose all your gear and have to start over. 4/10 the game needs serious work done to it to make it more enjoyable for anyone who isn't a troll specifically anyone who wants to play with any sence of dignity or decency. Game breaking bugs frequent crashes random disconnects a bug that crashes the game by editing video settings broken OP wilflife you cannot possibly beat without top tier weapons. Possibly the literal worst most toxic community any video game has ever seen that actively works against new players. Forever in early access lazy devs not finishing their game after 4 years. Limited content limited weapons the presence of microtransactions for skins in a early access game. I want to love you Rust but in your current state that's impossible.",Rust

2014-01-22,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,"I regret picking this game up. There are basically three resources that I've come across. Rocks trees and animals. And each of these resources give out three or four different items. The idea of the game is to survive but so long as you don't get stuck in a zone with no animals at all like I did you can pretty much survive with utter ease the only real threat being other players. Once you get guns though other players tend to leave you alone. You've won the day! Now what to do with all your free time?I don't know talk in world chat maybe? It's hard to feel alone and desperate for survival when people can communicate across the world in order to trade/sell items call in for back up or just chat.Since I got bored of ""survival"" I tried to go the Minecraft route of just making things with my ultimate goal of making a bridge or tower to unreachable places in order to make a huge beacon fire... but I found that incredibly limiting given the tools I had. (The fact that I kept dying because I couldn't find animals for food and bed didn't help this either)I bought it and thus I'm stuck with it but I hope in a year or so maybe there will be something akin to role play servers with no world chat and increased difficulty to get guns or something to actually do.Edit Also... The inherent goal of ""survive"" really doesn't mean a whole lot when death isn't much more than an inconvenience. There aren't any consequences to death... and as it stands I don't even know how you could implement any.",Rust

My main suggestion is to buil a small base and get some sort of wepon anything and KILL ZOMBIES zombies drop the best sort of loot like Gun Blueprints so you can lern to make guns and metal to really make the guns. The main thing i would prefere about the game is if you could find guns in create and on zombies but i have only ever found BluePrints. and Finally BE CAREFUL when you go into radiated towns in the bottom right corner of the screen theres a Gui box which tells you your health ans stuff at the very bottom of that theres a thing that says ""Rads"" if it gets above 500 then you will start to loose health so whatch out!

2013-12-28,0,0,106,True,Recommended,Thoug currently playing in an early alpha phase this game isn't bad. The pve servers could use a bit more excitement in them maybe some form of objectives to reach for? I'm a gamer that likes to have a purpose in the game I'm playing. Tasks to achieve checkpoints to reach. It's a personal form of gratification that I'm playing the game correctly and making it worth my time. That being said I have a firm belief that this game will be at the top of it's genre once complete given how far the development has come ALREADY. It will be very interesting to see how far this game progresses. A few things I'm hoping the address Map system in place.(mini map of sorts) Navigation system. (compass) Clock/daylight tracker Team building/grouping/alliance building method.(Especially when building and using doors.) Basic cross hairs or aiming for the Bow.All of these things being more 'creature comforts' to gamers than NEEDED.

2015-06-09,1,1,8,True,Not Recommended,"Rust is an online PVP survival type game similar in a lot of ways to titles like 7 Days to Die or DayZ. The main difference in Rust is that unlike the other aforementioned survival games the only threat you'll face here is that of other players. Therein lies my problem with Rust the player community.I was gifted this game and spent about two hours trying to learn how to do stuff and get a feel for the game. I say try because the online community for this game was not helpful unless you count murdering you on sight as being helpful. When I asked for help in the chat I was ignored. I was later sent to a ""noob friendly"" server by somebody on the forums where I was again killed on sight then camped and spawn killed for an additional fifteen minutes before I quit out in frustration. This is after calling out the people killing me on said server who proceded to troll and taunt me and the admins who did nothing about it.In these types of survival games where your opponents are other people I understand that you can't and shouldn't trust people. It's the nature of the beast. But when you run into three people and all of them have machine guns and armor and you're just a naked dude with a rock then it's only fun for one group. Guess which one it is. In short if you're looking for a competivite PVP survival game then this may appeal to you assuming you can survive long enough to learn anything / gather the materials to last more than twenty minutes at a time. But if you don't want to spend your time doing the same things over and over again because of people with itchy trigger fingers spend your money elsewhere. I'm just glad I didn't spend any of my own money on this game. TL DR Version This game could very easily be called ""Sociopath Simulator"" because you will die over and over again not make any progress in learning the game or gearing up in it and generally be exposed to the worst kind of uncaring rude disrecpectful people the online community has to offer. 1/10. Wouldn't on this game if it was on fire. Even if I was R. Kelly.",Rust

There are TANKS and other warfare things............Idiots...Gathering for resources is quite a bit of fun until you end up being gangbanged by that 5+ team who thinks they can play the game just because their team is 5+ players and no one can beat them.The feeling you get the satisfaction when you finally get yourself a bow and some arrows and end up slaughtering the 5+ player team for bullying you.Cons This game is no longer survival game.This game is pure PvP and the biggest team usually is the one who dominates the server.,Rust

2015-05-31,0,0,153,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you. I've been playing this game since the old version and i can tell you that this game is super fun. If you like survival games you should buy it.,Rust

2015-07-05,1,1,147,True,Recommended,Just about hitting my 100th hour. I never played legacy but I have seen a bunch of gameplay. Graphis are amazing but are hard to run. I have a 780ti OC 16 GB of ram and a i7 377k OC to 4.0 GHZ and I play the game on max. I average about 60 70 frames but in the most recent update it has droped to about 40 50. As well are there are MASSIVE lag spikes that hit randomly for me and my friends. We have played on many diffrent server so it wasn't one server. The game is fun but I do recemend playing modded servers. With higher gather rates and instacraft I don't have to spend an hour getting wood just to make a shack house just to get raided a day later. Another thing is they have weekly updates which is amazing. but garry and his crew don't seem to listen to the community. I mean they sometimes do but when ladders were added more then 50% of the community did not want them. They were never removed though... Anyways I recommend this game if you have a beastly gaming PC and don't mind spending the time and effort to maybe just get raided and lose it all.,Rust
2017-08-17,0,0,92,True,Recommended,OK so there's a lot of toxic reviews of this game that aren't fair. Yes the official servers are pretty much impossble to start on now a days but theres always the modded servers which are a blast for 20 bucks I think it's a great purchase sure there's offline raiding and yeah that sucks when you spent all day grinding but part of the fun is trying to combat that and make a good base and well git gud. Simply put this game is a 9/10 for the price. There are some bugs and a few annoying updates but atleast its a different experience every 3 6 months.,Rust

2016-04-16,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Decided to try Rust after owning it for ages.I don't understand it's like ARK but buggier and less pretty without dinosaurs or a real environment threat.It should be called 'tribes' 'people' or something equally boring as it's just people killing each other but only after haven't spent lots of time pointlessly gathering resources to do nothing with other than sit in a hut and kill other people so you can . . . well . . I don't know.I killed a few people because they killed me took me ages to find them and now I don't know why we killed each other or what we got out of it or why I just wasted all that time lol.They say the point is to survive but you die when you log out and the only threat is other people I don't feel compelled to survive and if you don't feel compelled to play the game then it fails.Also why is the water still so glitchy? has this not been in development for ages now?,Rust

2014-05-10,0,0,168,True,Recommended,Rust is more than just survival its a way of life. I might have spent over 100 hours on this game but i'm sure only a dozen hours proves to anyone that this game is phenomenal. At the current position it's it (an early alpha) people have made this game one of the most popular on Steam currently. The community of the game is of course very mixed many are very friendly and easy to get along with although there are some terrible people who take advantage of those who have less resources than them. In future updates i expect there to be more of a balance within the community. I dont know how this will be done but if they create this game this quickly they can do anything.Of course there are several pros and cons for this game as listed below Pros Addictive Good for people who want to play a game with other friends Fairly frequent updates Very popular Easy to play all dayCons Updates even if done frequently are often let downs with only minor adjustments Very mixed community Only an alphaEither way i'm sure most people that buy the game will be 100% satisfied with the game and is totally worth the money.Happy Surviving!Fusion.,Rust

It reminds me of ark which I also play but in rust you don't really have stuff handed to you an example is in ark there's trees food and places to bui everywhere. In rust you gotta search and hut for food while running the risk of being attacked by helicopters. In rust you have to choose a place to build wisely or you'll be attacked within minutes.

2018-04-17,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,Good idea bad implementation. As soon as you join the game chances are you'll be killed by some guy with a rifle or shotgun within 15 minutes. And god forbid you try to build a house. People will literally shoot through your walls (assuming its wood b/c you're a beginner) and literally burn your house down before you're even done.

The intensity of battle the stress of being attacked the pain of dieing and the joy of killing somebody and getting stuff! Gathering resources and u turn around...SHOTGUN BLAST.... and you start over again. This game will make you have trust issues. Get stuff from strangers turn around get killed but some people u can trust. I mostly like this game cuz its a mix of stress stratedgy survival and creativity. This game is not ment for kids cuz of rage but they do find ways around it witch does get annoying. Either way I would 100% recomend this game to anybody thinking about buying it.,Rust

(Hitting at something has never been harder.)There are trees everywhere but consider yourself lucky if you see metal sulfur stone source.

I really did enjoy the game for the time that I played with about 12 of my syndicate members but we ran out of things to do.

You log out for 1 hour because you fell asleep in your chair you wake up your house got bombed with c4 and all your shi*t is gone you start over and have to get out of the starting area again you die you die you die you die. If I hadn't had 2 friends helping me I probably wouldn't even had been able to build that house... Some people complain about lag bug if you join a server dedicated to your continent you should be ok.

There is no sense that anything you will do is permanent / semi permanent so what's stopping anyone from destroying your stuff? or the other way around.

(servers ran by people normally have active admins to ban people) Therefore people are abusing the clinet in many ways. HACKS is the biggest example. Other huge problem is the severs can be forced to crash. (this is an OLD SCHOOL CONNECTION GLITCH) I joined a sever not knowing it was active with cheaters. A group of friends and I were raiding the biggest teams base on the server while they were offline. No sight of them at all. All of a sudden the server goes do due to too many people trying to log into the server. (its a 200 man server and only around 60 people were on) So the server goes down. takes an hour or so to reset. (ONCE BACK IN I WAS THE FIRST ONTO THE SERVER) I'm back in the enemy base (alone while my sleeping mates try to log back in) All of a sudden here comes the MAIN cheater running in guns blazing (within 30 secons of server being back up) HE HAD NO IDEA WE WERE IN THERE.... GHOSTED THE SERVER CRASHING IT THEN COUNTERING OUR RAID WHILE EVERYONE LOGS BACK IN!? (THIS IS AN OLD SCHOOL CONNECTION GLITCH THAT CHEATHERS HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS!) It is nearly impossible to prove who did in beyound being in the middle of the action. (due to online proxys the company cant ban the IP or USER doing it since it's not there real IP) THE RUST COMMUNITY HAS A NAME FOR THE GHOSTING GLITCH! They all it DDOSing.... (so the biggest team on this server has gotten that way by cheating Crashing the server everytime they are about to lose something huge) ALSO REPORTING THE CHEATERS SEEMS TO BE A WASTE OF TIME!!! There are KNOWN cheaters on most servers.... Why doesnt this company deal with cheaters? Not sure. but IT MAKES AN EXTREMELY WELL BUILT AND FUN GAME..... HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,Rust

2017-11-10,0,0,245,True,Not Recommended,This game is run by people who play too much. Most servers wipe weekly if not biweekly and with doing this makes casually playing the game impossible. It could be day one and by the time you're up to the crossbow someone is shotgun camping your door. The game isn't bad it's just not for everyone. It doesn't deserve a negative review and it doesn't deserve a positive review. The postitives are that the game updates regularly and if you can find the people who aren't s they make for pretty good friends. It's a very risky game there are times where you lose everything but in the end you'll actually just lose everything next wipe.The game would be more fun if building was more of a part of it however META took hold of this game and almost every building looks the same and is done the same way.,Rust

2016-03-22,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,"This is a love/hate game. Before going into my review I'll say I'd rate this game a 5/10.. which makes it hard to recommend or not recommend. I am a casual solo gamer with bad connection. These aspects make it a bit difficult to enjoy the game but it can be fun. If you're in somewhat of a similar situation as myself I suggest searching for a PVE server so that it isn't so competitive and you can explore and build more freely. The less people on a server the ""safer"" you may be. This seems to be the best alternative to a ""single player"" experience that I've found. The game has a decent amount of bugs or things that make the surviving aspect of the game a bit hard sometimes. Aggressive animals can spawn in your base.. which makes me a bit paranoid just entering my base. They can also go up and down rock formations and such as if they weren't there.. this makes it difficult to kill animals or even avoid aggressive animals. There is an attack helicopter that patrols the map and will show you no mercy. Even if you are in a decent hiding spot outside of a base it will most likely kill you. I've tried hiding in thick bushes or behind a big tree and often it doesn't do anything..Using a mic is almost a necessity because typing in chat is usually too slow to communicate with other players who may be looking for someone to kill and loot. There are main locations that spawn random loot that is very useful. These areas depending on how populated the server is may be guarded by other players. Be cautious when exploring and don't be surprised if you get robbed or killed. I personally set a sleeping bag before getting too close to a ""town"" in case I die. Be aware that the community is often hostile. If you want to play this game you must be patient and expect to die many times.

2014-02-09,0,0,1221,False,Recommended,Rust is probably one of the best games you will ever play with friends granted that you know what you're doing and you have the time to commit to it. That's the review in short. Continuing on Rust requires lots of dedication both physically and mentally to obtain most of its worth with the game having a relatively steep learning curve and high skill ceiling which you can reach to after playing for a while in and with the deadly environments and blood thirsty dangers both automated and player controlled the game will provide you with. There will be times where the game absolutely pisses you off and times where you'll love it to bits. Playing the game for two hours and then quitting is simply not enough to decide your thoughts about this game.To play Rust you will need time. Lots and lots of time. Rust is probably best played when you're on some sort of break or holiday from your job college or school or any responsiblities you have as Rust just needs so much time though this is mostly the case if you're playing alone as a solo you will almost always benefit from playing Rust with friends. Tell your friends to get Rust. Tell your friends of friends to get Rust. Tell your friends' families to get Rust. Once you have all join a server and start bashing rocks and build a massive ing base. The higher your numbers the higher chance you have of survival and the faster progression of tools weaponry and state of living you will experience. Attempting to play the game solo is basically hardcore mode and I wouldn't recommend it unless you enjoy dying lots falling behind in progression compared to others and being reared by Rust's community. This leads the review onto Rust's community. As you've probably gathered from other reviews they're we get it. They kill on sight murder new spawns as a sport and then think they have the right to flame in voice chat afterwards with you knowing the fact that behind that screen they're simply either some pre teen that long stroke sprinted home from school sweat covered to play with their ten man zerg or some young adult that recently gathered their only ounce of confidence from insulting others in Rust. Absolute tards however there are gems within the said community. Sometimes you'll run into a few friendly people who'll want to talk help you out or even join you on your survival adventure. But most of the times people will try to kill you as the thought of looting your lifeless corpse for your long worked for gear is greater than the incentive to be a good guy. To combat this you can simply join their ranks. Kill everyone you see take no prisoners show no remorse become a bandit. Though don't be a about it be respectful.Once you know what you're doing in the harsh world of Rust you'll find that gun fights are amazingly adrenaline packed building bases from all the resources you gathered is satisfying and simply roaming and looting is both fun and adventerous. It will probably get you addicted.Rust unfortunately has many many negative reviews that I feel to some part are unjustified as people just apparently don't want to dig for a resolution and would instead slander the very hard working devs whom of which update the game with content and fixes monthly and care about the game oh so very much. You'll find that most of the reviews complain about server loading times how hard it is to play optimisation the time you need to dedicate and the community. Let this review set these things straight In terms of server loading times there is an easy solution. Browse for other servers. It sounds dumb but it's that simple. It would seem that people especially new players try to join official servers because they're official. Don't bother. They're typically the ones that have full server slots and are filled to the brim with players that are toxic. Official servers are not user friendly and are definitely a no go for new players. Even I have never joined an official server before. I would recommend looking at community servers within the community tab in the browser if you're looking for the vanilla Rust experience. This leads onto How hard the game is to play. It is indeed a very hard game to play but there are a few options that you can choose to help you get into the game. You could begin by joining a low population or empty community server to get into grips with the mechanics of this game without the nuisance of players trying to kill you. You could also join a 'creative' server which gives you unlimited resources and can be found in the modded servers tab in the browser to work on your base building skills. The Rust wiki and watching videos also helps. The optimisation sucks in this game but turning down your graphics can actually be advantageous to your survival as there will be less clutter and noise on your screen so it's easier to spot things out. However the point of this part is to tell you about the fullscreen launch command. Rust doesn't actually run in fullscreen but instead fullscreen borderless because backend reasons. You can however force Rust to run into fullscreen mode to boost your FPS and reduce input lag. This can be done by right clicking Rust in your Steam library and pressing 'properties' pressing 'set launch options' and copying &amp pasting ' window mode exclusive' into the prompt. WIth this command Rust is forced into fullscreen mode. Beware of alt + tabbing out of Rust though there is a chance it can crash because of something something Unity engine and your desktop will probably freeze. You can try and reach the task manager to kill the Rust process but once again it'll be pretty hard to do with a frozen desktop. Just don't alt tab out and you'll be fine Rust definitely requires lots of time to get the most out of it. If you don't have loads of time to play Rust you can choose to play on modded servers which can be found in the modded tab in the browser. From there you can find servers with increased gather rates along side other things. An upped gather rate essentially increases how many resources you would obtain normally by using a multiplier. This means that you will progress significantly faster and overall do stuff in the game sooner than you would in the vanilla game. You can't really change the community of this game but you can definitely dampen the toxicity of it. By choosing the right server with the right people the dickish force the community usually throws at you can be reduced.Once everything clicks for you in Rust it'll quickly become one of your favourite games ever.P.S. No Rust will not run on your Intel Pentium and for all the people with NASA computers complaining that Rust runs at 30 FPS at lowest settings you many wanna you know get your machine checked out.,Rust

First off outside of teaching you how to make a hatchet pickaxe and campfire there is no tutorial in the game. So if you want to do something you literally have to look it up. Then comes the issue with the servers. I have made huge steps on multiple occassions in building a base that I feel comfortable logging out in many hours in one setting just to get a base to that point only to try and log back in the next day and that server is no where to be found. I put all that work in only for that server to disappear. The game is in early access but if you can't even keep a server up then you shouldn't have put the game out.,Rust

However I found many paying gamers experiencing this issue without a fix. This makes the game impossible to play! Whenever a crash occurs you go to sleep until you come back online. During this time a bear boar or another player most likely will come along and kill you. Effectly negating the time you spent gathering resources. The overall playerbase is extremely negative heartless and ""repeating"" raiders. Surprisingly the offical servers are worse in terms of admins and player base compared to the community run servers. For the people who have this ""crashing nonstop"" bug Rust becomes impossible to play. All progress will be lost if you die without a base.

2016-11-26,0,0,466,True,Not Recommended,so let's start the review i started playing the game on a recommendation from my two of my friends recently and started playing on a kinda small server with them (usually around 20/200 are on at most whenever i log on) there's a pretty large clan that is pretty dominating on it we built a good base so were able to hold them off after they do a good chunk of damage when they attack. the building is fun and the game can be pretty enjoyable once you get things going. however when going to a larger server the people on are almost all toxic KOS is way too common and you'd get killed even if you're naked with nothing but the rock and torch. not saying everyones toxic just today i helped out a guy and he gave me so much good stuff in return. the balance of the game is pretty bad honestly with people already being fully armored and player hunting and securing supply drops in a clan within a day of a wipe you can build a base and then come on the next day to find that your dead bed gone and base grieved if your unlucky naked and with nothing left if you are. not sure how the xp system was or the BP system was but they sound a whole lot more balanced than how the game currently is. aside from that bears glitching throught your walls into your base and killing you has gotta be fixed cause that can get frustrating quick. the live die repeat within a 10 minute span cycle due to a bad community while it can't be completely removed is a big problem. At it's current state the game is good but can be better. solo players better steer clear of this game because unless you join a clan or have friends it's gonna take you alot longer than it's worth to actually just feel safe enough to log off even only for an hour or two or being afraid to leave your house at the mere sight of another player.im not not the best at reviewing but my current verdict on the game is that it's not worth it. the gameplay and constant player KOS mindset will make you feel that the game is getting stale quite quickly and from what i've found so far is that there are other games of the same genre on steam that can be just as enjoyable if not more for those who don't like how the game is so far or are discouraged from buying it due to the current state of it but are looking for a good way to enjoy a few hours without being frustrated or paranoid that something will happen when you're gone.p.s in case someone with with something like 6k hours (and i've met a few) comes and tells me that i don't know about how to enjoy it or you gotta sink a hundred more hours into it before getting good or something NO im not gonna do that. i like playing games to relax from the stress of the day or to stave off my boredom i'll be starting university soon and for the proffession im aiming for i won't have time nor the inclination to do that. this is a new account so and i tend to hop between consoles so while it may not show i've played alot of mmo's rpgs first person and third person games to pass the time and can honestly say i don't feel as much enjoyment or accomplishment playing this game compared to others. that is my honest opinion. i'll sink more hours in this game to try and change my opinion on it but unless there's a drastic change i don't think i'll be playing it once the end of the month hits.,Rust

2017-06-10,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,"This game is realistic fun and very time consuming. Hit a tree with a rock a rock with a rock evolve to doing the same thing with rocks tied to sticks! But do I reccomend this game? No. In game you'll probably get mowed down by some people who've been on that server for a while and have guns and crossbows. Or you'll get slapped to death by a rock or a bear as you go to the bathroom or your inventory. These are mechanics of the game designed to make the game more difficult and make acheivments feel better. I actually liked these features but will never experience them again. Why? Because the game started crashing during startup conveniently after I had more than two hours of gameplay (Steam's strangely short refund time) and would not let me fix it. You can check its files restart your computer spam the ""Play"" button until you lose feeling in your index finger but it will still crash.I would recommend not buying this item at least until the devs solve this issue (and remove the god forsaken twig update). Who knows maybe I'll be able to play it again too.",Rust
2017-02-11,1,1,13,True,Not Recommended,Seems fun if the community was not toxic. Kill on sight runs rampant on every server I played on. If you enjoy pain then this is your game. If you have a dozen friends that will all roam and just kill people then it will be fun. If you are trying to play a survival game this is not that game. It is PVP focused and does not offer much past that. I can't reccomend this game because of the toxic community. It was very few and far between that you came across someone that wasnt going to kill you instantly.,Rust
2017-05-24,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,People often pick on poorly optimized games.I don't since i feel as long as the game is fun then it don't matter.But how can you be developing a game since 2011 and it can't even run on even medium graphics on a nvidia 970?The game itself don't even look good and is really barebones when compared to what other survival games there are on the market it might have been on top back when it first came out but its fallen behind far behind.Ark Survival evolved is a good example a much more fleshed out crafting system runs much better (not perfect but 10x better than this) It offers a larger variety of animals and overal just looks and works better. This game is just a relic of the old days with nothing to it that makes it a worthy purchase considering the wide variety of other survival and PvP games you can pick up these days.It also don't make the game look better that its such a mess and have a crate/cosmetic microtransaction system.,Rust

2017-02-09,1,1,112,True,Not Recommended,I had the anti cheat installed since day 1 with no issue and was explained that a cheat was detected 2 weeks in. This is not true and makes me believe that this is a scam to get consumer to re purchase the product. I have had my Steam account for over 9 years without any cheating accusation and received one for this game within 2 weeks. I stream multiple games on Twitch so I have a few viewers that knows that there was no cheating ran for this game. This is ridiculous and I'm appalled at this company's business ethics. I wrote to FacePunch support and asked for an explanation the case was closed with no answer and leaves me out to dry. I realize that this is not a VAC ban and is only a game ban but this is a stain on my Steam account of 9+ years that is permanent. If you are going to try this game out I recommend opening a new Steam account.,Rust

2017-01-11,0,0,318,True,Recommended,I got somewhat 250 hours in this game and i just decided to write a review for it.Game has a lot of potential some of it hidden. Rust is better played in a group of 3 to 5 on a medium or big server with constant rivals at your doors and glitches on your back. It's been in early access for quite some time now but unlike other games this one actually has updates (weekly). Devs aren't afraid to change gameplay mechanics to see how it plays out in the end this is Early Access after all. So how's the game up close?Gameplay is simple in its basics. Just survive. Kill build (optionally tho you can even survive without a base) farm (a lot especially if you're alone) and do whatever you want. Currenly as of beginning of 2017 there is no end game content or any specific objective to do. Most people tend to raid once they have reached a certain level of development some just build the biggest and baddest base around and stay in it occasionally killing someone from their roof and most of the players are engaged in pvp content whether they want it or not. No one is protected from having his аss handed to him just because he made a wrong turn in the forest and walked up on a gang of 3 ruskies with ak's and full armor. This is why the game is best played in group that way you can have an actual objective in game to have fun together instead of just building a base or raiding someone.Graphics optimisation all of that are changing constantly and for some the game would be unplayable but that's only if you have a very old pc. Currenly i'd have about 40 fps on high on r9 270x and i5. But since it's early access and unity together means that there are a lot of bugs and nothing can save you if you suddenly freeze during a firefight. Happens occasionally.Sound eh it's alright. Music eh turned it off.Potential a lot if devs keep on updating as they are game will (probably... hopefully) leave ea with a lot of content and ready to conquer steam charts.,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I would wait for it to get cheaper. It's an okay game I think there's only one map.Edit 2/22/2015 the developers finally did something to the game. Still unplayable and lots of glitches.,Rust
2014-01-20,0,0,103,True,Recommended,It's a nice game but it's still in Alpha something you should keep in mind when buying and playing this game. It needs tweaking glitches need to be removed and personally the base building has to be improved and more functions to secure your base even more should be added. Zombies are going to be removed from the game and it would be a shame if they don't replace them with something compared to it as it's always nice to hunt zombies when you're bored. I'd suggest you buying this game if you're really into surviving teamplay or just hunting down people.,Rust

You dont rely on chance of getting loot like in DayZ for example.5) good graphics and sounds6) Realistic gameplay No zombies in this one. watch out for wild animals and players.You can die from starvation dehydration bleeding cold wildlife drowning bullet to the face helicopter to the face...and more...Swimming will make you wet and freeze you faster.7) Only EARLY ACCESS game that is worth getting out there devs release updates every week and are constantly working on improving the game.cons 1) unstable client (can crash every 5 to 60 minutes) which gets annoying after a while.2) buggy animals They can get stuck in a place and do nothing untill provoked.They can glide throught the terrain being unable to get hit by you.Bears will sneak up on you and stab you in the back when youre chopping some wood...3) The client isnt optimised very well. im getting about 50 80 fps with lowest settings on a dual core g3258 4.2ghz and 2gb Vram as well as 8gb RAM comparing it to ""mad Max"" for example which runs at 100 130 fps at lowest settings and looks 10x better.",Rust

2017-11-09,0,0,872,True,Recommended,Rust is a unique and interesting game. It encourages you to adventure adapt to neighbors and put in hard work and effort to acomplsih things. This is a great and very enjoyable game defenitely recommended super fun.Although players might be annoyed by offline raids to your base it also requires the defender to prepare more traps be more self cautious about your neighbors and larger groups and fortify your base. Another note is that Rust can be rather socially interactive so if you see a screaming kid then do not be alarmed unless he attacks you. Hope you have the best of your luck on your new journey through the Rust community. ),Rust

2014-01-06,0,0,208,True,Recommended,Rust is an open world survival game that runs on servers rather than multiplayer adding an interesting twist on the gameplay. It's a game that whilst many people complain of its lack of safety and its constant PvP disallowing you from any sort of steady and safe gameplay I believe that Rust is a game that really displays human instinct at it's purest. WHen faced with a situation where the other person has a gun and might either be trying to make peace or trying to kill you your instincts tend to give you the choices to react rather than your logical thinking making quite interesting and tense gameplay especially when every corner you turn could be your last depending on what you find around it. The game is by no means faced paced or action based although certain situations may require some fast thinking before you get shot for all of your items. The game primarily revolves around collecting resources to build a house to survive the various enemies in the open world and to defend yourself from any wandering players who may fancy an extra item or two in their backpack preying on the newer players. Form relationships and alliances with other players build a house together topossibly get backstabbed and stolen from later on! Hire somebody as a mercenary and loot radiation zones full of zombies together! Be a bandit and blow your way through other players' doors with explosive charges to get at their secret stash of guns and loot! Build and impregnable metal fortress in the center of a field commanding attention and respect from all! Or build your house far out of the resource zone in the barren plateau or high up in the mountains where nobody would ever find you! The possibilities are endless in the massive world of Rust.,Rust

AMAZING. you can start anew...,Rust
2016-01-20,1,2,158,True,Not Recommended,"As of today 1 20 16 with over 150+ hours I cannot endorse this game. I endorse the potential but the game itself is shallow and lacks any form of immersion or character.Rust is currently a player survival simulator. In the beginning of the game you will spend a great deal of time gathering materials by (1) using tools to gather them directly from nodes or (2) killing other players you find walking around and taking their stuff. After you finish gathering materials you will ultimately craft weapons to kill other players. That is the end game of Rust in its current state and honestly that has been the end game of Rust since its creation.GAMEPLAY CRAFTINGThe crafting system in Rust is shallow but effecient. It lacks any form of character to separate itself from other games such as Minecraft Reign of Kings 7 Days to Die or any other ""survival sim"" on the market currently. Objects require a minimum number of materials and you select what you want to craft from a list on the side of the screen. If you have it you can craft it. Materials are readily available throughout the randomly generated maps. Need fuel? Need wood? Need metal? Have no fear because material nodes have no fixed spawn points. You can literally live in a hole and never have to travel anywhere in particular to obtain special resources other than blueprints.The blueprint system Rust employs makes it a bit more involved which is a good thing. You go to monument/dungeon sites on the map such as an abandoned trainyard and collect actual blueprints or blueprint fragments which you then study to add craftable items to your crafting list. Blueprint fragments can be used to learn low level items or upgraded multiple times each time giving you a rarer blueprint opportunity. At first this is exciting as you lurk through abandoned buildings trying to learn new things to craft while you hear gunshots and people killing eachother around you (if you play on a populated server). After a few hours of gameplay constantly obtaining new blueprints you are done with this portion of the game. You will be able to craft gear that can effectively kill other players and that's what the game boils down to.GAMEPLAY PVPThere is no PVE in this game. Starving to death is not possible unless you intentionally avoid every opportunity thrown at you to not starve. You could die to a bear in the game but once you get even the basic revolver bears are a joke.Your life will be taken by other players and you will take their lives as well. Repeatedly. In its current state you do not need top tier firearms to kill other players who are wearing full armor. You could potentially end someones life with a bow even from the beginning of the game if your aim is alright. Put any firearm in the hands of a decent FPS player and the game quickly revolves around just landing your hits no matter what weapon you use. I have killed people with the waterpipe shotgun (basic weapone veryone can craft) while they used fully automatic rifles. And to be fair it is VERY EASY to obtain fully automatic rifles even on vanilla non modded servers. Just travel to a monument/dungeon while completely naked and open boxes. Eventually you will find the blueprint for the firearm itself. Bam. Done. Now you just get some metal from any rock on the map and craft a gun. Proceed to murder. Done with the game. GG.GAMEPLAY CONSTRUCTIONRust has moved away from cube building to fixed object construction. Minecraft for example uses cube construction. So does Reign of Kings. In Rust you lay down a foundation object which can only be placed at certain elevations and build adjacent to that elevation. It essentially tells the game what level is the ground floor or ""level 0"" on a plane. Keep in mind that foundations have to be a certain distance from the ground. It becomes extremely difficult to construct *meaningful* structures with this system. Because of that bases repeatedly look the same over and over and over. All of them are the same ugly flat pieces of planks/stone/sheet metal. You lay foundation select the wall option put walls up put whatever up and all of them are the same.At first you may be tempted to construct a building with separate rooms for all of your operations. This is stupid unless you don't care about losing your stuff. The only way to destroy a player made building that is protected by a toolbox (Rust's version of a protection block in Minecraft) is to use C4. This explosive might seem rare in the beginning but can be easily obtained by running naked to dungeons and hitting random boxes until you find the blueprints. Any building made out of wood can be destroyed by hand made tools. This automatically removes wood as a viable structure because anyone can break into your home. Stone requires C4 to be destroyed. But only 2 of them. If you only have 1 layer of walls anyone with the blueprint for C4 can just blow open a wall and take your stuff. This means everyone builds two types of structures TOWERS and HONEYCOMB bases. A tower is just...a bunch of levels going up with doors at every level. A honeycomb base just has door after door after door. Both of these attempt to force raiders to use all of their C4 before reaching any of the real loot.Think about that. The number one way to defend your base is to force the enemy to use waste all of their ammo. And it doesn't work. C4 is easy to craft for anyone who has an hour to gather materials. Let alone a group of people working together.IMMERSION Everything in Rust lacks character. The first time you walk through a trainyard or water treatment plant might seem amazing. But after an hour or two you quickly feel as though everything lacks a soul. It is hard to describe. Nothing feels valuable in the game itself. You cannot craft any objects which might feel like you belong to the world. Chairs tables bathrooms aesthetic objects etc. are almost non existant. You can craft a very limited number of clothing pieces (some of which you can now buy on the market for real life money by the way$$$!!!). You can craft placeable signs but why? All the ones I have seen are filled with bad drawings or just telling you to die in a fire. As of right now there is essentially no RP server and I do not see how you could even have one.PC REQUIREMENTS For some reason even fully tricket out computers can have problems running this game. If you have 4GB of RAM do not even bother trying to run it. I have played this with 4GB of RAM and with higher end PCs. Something is wrong when a game like Minecraft can give Rust a run for its money in the graphics department after downloading a texture pack. All while running far better. If you have a minimum requirement crap computer you should totally expect 5 10 minute loading screens with studder lag all over the place.OVERALL Rust sucks. I'd rather eat burnt toast. If you just want to run around the map looking to shoot another player who doesn't know you are there then sure buy the game. The combat is not particularly difficult to master for anyone who plays FPS games. If you are looking for something that has a soul and depth pass this up for another 2 years until they actually create a game with it.",Rust

I wake up and some one brains me with a rock.The game has a lot to it but you will not see the later stuff. I see bombers and helecopters and gun users but I know I will never get to that point. There is no punishment for being a so there is no reason to stop everyone else from doing anything. Even quiting the game does not make you immune to punishment. I logged out with a decent early game stuff and came back and was left with nothing. How am I supposed to care about a game and put in time and energy when there is no way to safely guard myself.Oh but there is I can get better stuff and create better forts but that could take hours of un interuped work and all it takes is one person with a rock to make sure that does not happen.There is potential to this game but without a way for me to get furhter than the stone age I don't care.,Rust

2016-01-01,0,0,2995,True,Not Recommended,"This game is very fun but is sadly unplayable thanks to the non exsistant anticheat that allows players to hack with ease and if they do get caught which almost never happens they just buy another account and go at it again. they keep adding pointless to the game that no one cares about like being able to finally up your base with pillars in only the middle of foundations that you have to bump into all the time if you want to keep your base from collapseing but they wont spend any time on something like anticheat so that you can actually play the game without wasting hours on your base just to get raided by people that can jumphack into your base and headshot your whole crew with a revolver. 11/29/16 garry continues to the game i looked on the market today and half my ""limited edition"" halloween items that were 30 or 40 dollars are now 16 because garry decided he wanted to add a trade up system that does nothing but players like me that were trying to save valuable items. also it doesnt even reward players for even making skins anymore. why would you put out halloween items that say limited time only then just later down the line make it so everyone can get them. garry you amaze me with how dumb your ideas are i am convinced you have your autistic son calling all the shots in the meetings of what to add next to the game.",Rust

It was buggy and needed so much work but i could say ""yea work in progress"" and i spent a ridiculous amount of time playing the game. I loved raiding being raided and running for air drops with awesome alliances and teams. I have to say it has been some time since then and i decided to revisit the game hoping to have some of my good old rust fun times. Hahaha was I misguided and naively hopeful! I ran the game to then have it crash at the loading screen three times! when i eventually loaded up a server I found it to be ridiculously jittery and unplayable so I went to change my settings in graphics and guess what...... it crashed again! After many attempts I have decided to give up on ever being able to play this game again. Maybe it's my graphics card maybe the game is just poorly optimized but there's no flipping way I'm going to sit here trying to get it to work. I am so disappointed as i really did believe this game to be so full of potential and promise only to find something worse than the starting product! Seriously it's pretty shocking there are other survival mmo games out there that are well worth the money. Do not buy this failure of a game.

2016-01-16,0,0,278,True,Not Recommended,This may be one of the most brutal games I have ever played. First ill talk about the game itself or the idea of the game the game is fun at first. As the game goes you work really hard to get the things you want like guns and stuff but its pretty well impossible to get them because every time you find one a few seconds later there is a group of guys well equipped that kill you for what you ask? For the possibility that you have something good on you witch they probably already have or better. Anyways after hours of playing this game maybe even days you may have something decent going or so you though you did until someone comes along and EASILY destroys your house and takes all your stuff using the overpowered C4 or rocket launchers and for what? Just to cause you misery so there you have to restart all over again... fun stuff. If that hasn t made you not like this game yet then maybe I should tell you that the servers all do a blueprint clear about every month so that means all the thing you thought where solid and couldn t be taken away from you is now magically gone including your house... if it already haven t been raided. Now onto the technical part of the game they have a TONE! of bugs and problems to work out and i understand that it may still be in alpha but that makes the price of the game really unjustified and overpriced the game at this point is maybe worth 5$. And lastly the people The people that play this game are real holes they will kill you for no good reason and will destroy everything you have for fun then as your dying you get to listen to them trash talk you.,Rust

Enough talking already lets get into why is so fun!1. ITS ON VALVEEX Yes now you would probably think its stupid but its not I mean Valve do post amazing games and it is very fun! I mean it should be Fun! ITS VALVE &lt 32. GRAPHICSEX Yeah the graphics in this game is so amazing! Its basically Real Life!3. MultiplayerEX The Multiplayer in this game is so fun you can have as many players as you want! depends on server level for example if it says 0/50 you can have 50 friends playing with you. I mean its VERY COOL. And you can teamup and try to survival in the wild!4. Real Life TacticsEx Rust is a game ment to make you happy and enjoy the game but it also gives you real life strats to the real life world!for example you would need a axe to cut down trees but do you know how to make one / craft one? Play rust now to find out its truely amazing and the game should be 100% downloadedNow there is alot of reason why you should download this game but i probably wont get to all of it but how about you download the game and you should find out and tell friends about it!Thank you for readingI also dont have the game sadly ( because I have no money sadly but I was hoping valve can give me one for free#PLEASEVALVE#RUSTISAMAZING!,Rust

2015-11-05,0,0,451,True,Recommended,One of the best purchases I've made on a game. It's still being updated and there is so much thought put into it. The people in the game arn't always the brightest (someone left a fully armored base unoccupied and there was a window open took all his stuff) but when you make a friend it can lead to many good things. Overall great gameplay and many good laughs. Only thing i feel should be changed is the blueprint fragments...it used to be better and i understand why they changed it. I simply dont like it they ould at least mix it so you can find a normal blueprint for something and also fragments. 10/10,Rust

2016-11-12,0,0,842,True,Recommended,Great Game!I recently baught rust with avrage hopes like one of them games that you play every now and then Im currently loving it!There are down sides. Solo players will have not as much fun as mabye someone in a team people will shoot you for funn even if you are a fresh spawn. You can trust nobody.Up sides. If you play with at least one more player its a garuntee you will get somewhere once you lern the basics. It has a great building system. pvp is fun but brutial if done right. There are many game modes thanks to modded servers. You fear death or being shot. Raiding Defending from a raid Getting sweet loot. Lerning.I hope this helped. NitramV1,Rust

Me and my hairless friend found a man called Sitsey who was Latvian we used his nationality in the process of our discrimination towards the gentleman. We called him ""Dity Latvian"" and we said we hoped his family were lined up in the streets and shot by Putin's firing squad. However Sitsey no good english and as a result of this disability he thought we were ""good comrades"". He said ""I like you British here is mp5"".

2018-01-10,0,0,274,True,Not Recommended,I really enjoyed the game until the new patch where they added a stupid degradation system where you have to fill cupboards to stop your base falling down overnight. It makes it a chore to just maintain your base let alone defend it from invaders. Seriously stupid idea and has ruined the game. I hope they patch it out soon or I can't see me playing it again. I would love to recommend it as its great...without the stupidity of the new upkeep.,Rust
2018-01-10,0,0,337,True,Not Recommended,For my first hundred hours I played on a community server learning the ropes. However I didn't like the 2 week blueprint wipe it had in place so I changed to official servers primarily UK2.To my great disappointment it kept on going offline over and over again for no estimated time. Developers are silent nobody knows for sure what is going on. The same is happening with other official servers like EU 1 2 3 or UK 1 2 3 likely some others too. This is apparently happening for some years now.While servers going offline is an entirely normal thing lack of communication and explanations of any sort from Facepunch is not and is saddening in the very least. As I write this UK2 spent 3 hours online and 54 hours offline in the past three days without any feedback whatsoever.The game itself is great but their server handling is extremely poor.,Rust

2015-07-18,0,0,1068,True,Recommended,Rust by far has the most potential of any game I have ever played. The evolving plotlines within this sandbox world are dynamic and real. This game will immerse you. It is worth every penny. That all having been said... these are some of the problems I have seen while playing Rust I hope the devs will focus on these soon.1. Hackers2. FPS drops during firefights3. Movement and actions reloading and using certain items can be unreliable at times.4. The grind... the vanilla game is a full time job wether your solo or in a large group. I spend more time wacking trees managing furnaces / quarries crafting gunpowder armor and weapons then I ever do actually playing. For those of you looking to buy this is an awesome game with a truly hardcore spirit. This game will teach you things about yourself.One more thing and it's important... this is the only early access title that hasnt burnt me. The devs are upfront and honest and puttting out content every week.,Rust

2017-08-11,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,So I started playing Rust because I thought it will be cool to raid other players bases fight them but when you make a house and you legs are out of the wall and you just get killed thanks to a stupid bug/glitch it's not fun.If you play on community servers or modded servers than yeah it's worth to try it but when you go on an official server and everyone is naked with a stupid rock in the hand and runs after you half of the map it's not really cool.5/10.,Rust

2014-08-02,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,This game is not that great. However it's one of those games that draws you in making you spend more time in it than you realise. At the time I thought that the bugs and terrible AI were acceptable because it was early access. The problem is these problems still persist months after release. After revisiting Rust after 2 months I expected big changes and wonderful new weapons and gameplay elements. Nope. The game was pretty much the same. If you wish to play with friends as a one of thing it's good for that. The spark doesn't last long because of lack of updates making the game feel repetitive.If the game went through good updates making new features I would recommend it the fact it's barely changed after months makes me not hopeful about the future of the game.,Rust

2017-03-19,0,0,580,True,Recommended,This game as of writing this review is still in Beta.But even though it is still in beta it is by far the most feature rich of any of the survival games.Performance is getting better with each update they do while the graphics are among the best of the survival games too.If you want to build pretty houses and cool stuff then go to private servers because on public servers you will either get raided the minute you log off or you'll be shot on sight just for mining rocks while naked.The servers are force wiped every month so keep that in mind.EDIT The game is taking a long time to get fully released however they are doing really good work with updates i just fear it may be too late and the playerbase will get bored before all the content is added thats just my speculation though.TL DR If you want a hardcore survival game where everyone shoots on sight then this is your best bet.,Rust

2014-08-24,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,There are so many probelsm with this game. the main one is trying to get into he game without it crashing on you. If by chance you can get into the original version you can finally start to play. So you try and gather some wood but just when you're about to get the last of the wood from the tree it crashes on you again. The Expiremental version handles it much better but there is no easy way to know if you're starving and I couldn't find an animal to eat. And stay away from the test levels because if you go in one you will probably spawn in some weird prison with others and if you get out you will be killed immediately. I was pumped to play this game but with so many crashes with no help I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone until it gets fixed.,Rust

2016-04-24,0,0,151,True,Not Recommended,Player base is god awful. Just stay away at all costs.I tried to get back into playing it after 6 months off (I quit playing back then for the same reason I'm going to uninstall it now) and after 4 hours I have been killed by a player more than 15 times. This isn't battle royale and I know it isn't a strictly PvE thing either but there is no reason to run around murdering everything in sight.,Rust

2013-12-26,0,0,167,True,Recommended,This game has potential it's got a good setting and mechanic. It takes on the concept of survival of the fittest or throught teamwork coupled with the mere fact that you can't trust anyone over the internet(and in the real world) and slaps it in your face.

2016-07-11,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,Bought this game almost 1 2 years ago. Up until now in my opinion the game has gotten worse. I'ver only managed to get a total of 9 hours of gameplay most of it was years ago when the game was much better optimized. Now it is just so badly optimized that it is unplayable. Furthermore the game is constantly evolving and not in a good way. It's like this game have personality disorders. From the beginning to now there were so many different variations that changes the way Rust is played. All in all I feel that I have wasted my money and Rust is a disorganized mess without a decent roadmap for the devs to follow.,Rust

While there are no objectives in the game I felt it was normal for me to ask of a well off guy to provide me with 'employment' I get him wood and stone in consideration of food and shelter tools to be provided and maintained by the employer.This employer can be a slave driver or a leader s/he can help you grow into making your own base or just leave you to fend yourself when there is a raid.Everything happens without any objective or guidance. You are in the game world like you are in the real world more vulnerable as there is no family or protection that a child usually recevies until he is eased into the real life. This is the beauty of the game.,Rust

2017-11-12,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"Rust a game that should be out of alpha by now is in my experience a terrible game.Let me tell you why.I joined an official server like normal. Started running around for wood finding it difficult to find trees (it being dark didn't help either but I could see silhouettes). I proceeded to use that wood to craft a camp fire. That's the first task list done.Then comes an even bigger problem. Now I need to find stone which is even harder to find. I found plenty of sulfur and metal but no stone.Then after dying 3 4 times to other players and 30 minutes of playing I finally find stone. Unfortunately at this point I stopped caring about the game.The pace was completely ruined and there was no enjoyment to be had.Not to mention how completely starved the server was.Trees were few and far between and stone was nowhere to be found. Oh and not a single animal was seen during my play session.While I was told it was only a few days from ""wipe day"" which is apparently where the servers reset making all progress on the server moot and frankly making anything done in the game pointless. I must admit all interest I may have had for this game is gone. It may have been a sour first impression but I did not find my time here enjoyable in the slightest.I'm sure ""end game"" is infinitely better but when the servers aren't set up to allow new players to get a foot in the door once the server has been going for some time then I'm unsure whether that'll ever be something I'll experience.In conclusion I would rate this game 1/10 simply due to there being no enjoyment to be had during my session with the game.",Rust
2016-12-26,1,1,1328,True,Recommended,Starting off at my number #1 issue is that if you are not in a clan of 2 3+ you will be raided unless you put in a lot of time in the week is you are playing on a weekly wipe cycle server. My #2 issue proformance I got this game around october of 2015 but I had a working laptop that was around 500 bucks and I only got 15 20 fps. Since then the game has had lots of updates but maybe only one to 2 proformance otimization updates per every 2 months. I am now buying a gaming computer that is valued at 900 dollars but I don't know if I want to put that much money into a game that I am still not very good at.,Rust

2014-08-16,2,1,142,True,Recommended,"This is a story of a man's first days in Rust.Day 1 I woke up to find myself in a place that I have never seen before. I found a man with clothes and a gun he told me to come with me or he'll shoot me. I didn't have much to loose but I followed anyway. He took me up a mountain and put me in a room I couldn't escape from until he came to give me food when I killed him with my rock. I took his stuff and walked down his hallway to get out of the house. The man came back and tried to shoot me but I was too fast for him and beat him with my rock for a second time. I found his bed and shot it until it disappeared. Under it I found a small bag with a better gun and bullets. I then broke out of the prison and used the wood I found in his base to make me a big house.Day 2 I was walking about when I saw a bear trying to kill a naked man so I ran over to help. My first 2 bullets killed the man and the bear was saved. But then the bear betayed me and tried to eat my leg so I shot it in the leg until it died. I used my rock to harvest chicken from the bear and I got enough cloth to make a sleeping bag and put it in my house. Day 3 I was in a town which give me loads of radiation posioning and I had an idea. I rounded up all the naked men near the town and got them to run around it until they died. One of them tried to kill me and was shouting into his mic ""I'm going to kill you "" I shot him in the knee and forced him to kill his friend who was running round the town looking for pills. After a minute he also died of radiation posioning. Day 3/4 I woke up during the middle of the night to a ticking noise coming from outside my house. Some people were blowing up my door! I grabed my m4 and put a flashlight on it and crept downstairs. When they got into my house I walked behind them as they each went into different rooms. The first one thought I was in his team before I caved in his skull with my hatchet. The second one was shooting my sleeping bag so I waited until he turned around before I shot him with my m4. The third one tried to call for help when he saw me. He only had a stone and some cloth armour so I took him prisoner. He kept telling me how his buddy's were gonna come kill me but I would shoot him with my bow if he didn't stop. I keep feeding him and making sure he dosen't die.110/100 Great game",Rust

2017-02-12,0,0,1024,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. After around an hour and a half of bad spawns scarce resources and short lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and upon the realization that neither of us were hostile we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot on sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course he comes around sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then to add even more of an insult he adds an apology at the end as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting half naked unprepared players. All in all though I do see a lot of potential in this game and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",Rust

2018-01-05,0,0,455,True,Recommended,"This game is awesome Rust can seem very hard for first time players but just hang on and you will get the jist of things. Im going to share my like and dislikes about Rust. LIKES Tons of different servers you get to choose your own pace such as modded servers community servers or just plain vanilla. Rust is very addicting if you like it the mechanics of this game pulled me in the second I layed my hands on the keyboard. ""Imagination is key"" Rust lets you use your imagination what I mean is your base can be themed you can have a fireplace with a rug in front of it a grill outside you can make a kitchen if you want maybe even a family room with a christmas tree. The point im making is rust gives you the simple freedoms of building your base the way you want you just got to work for it. Rust has absolutly amazing PVP if thats what your into some servers are dedicated to PVP Battle Royal. In Rust you have a varity of weapons. Tons of different types of guns traps and melee weapons ROCKET LAUNCHERS AS WELL! My favorite part of rust is the occasional raiding ill do once in a while just to get stuff without working for it. UPDATES Rust has been very clever on what to add in the game the past few months. FULL MOON I love rust added this night doesnt have to be dreadful. Before they added this I had to wait in my base during the night. I would even pull out my phone to pass the time.DISLIKES The Blueprint system is very clever rust made it so everyone doesn't have an advantage but in my opinion some of the item such as metal hatchets are a pain to get sometimes but you will most likey find a hatchet in a crate instead of finding the blueprint itself. I think the blueprint system should be only used for guns or explosives. LADDERS I think ladders should be put in the TC mechanics it's annoying seeing other peoples ladders on my base. HUNGER this is not a huge deal but I always find myself in need of food way to fast. I recently found out that people can access your research table and workbenches through walls rust needs to fix this.Overall Rust is my go to game",Rust

2014-04-24,0,0,105,True,Recommended,An amazing immersive game that I would recommend to anyone. When you spawn run immediately to a tree and chop as much wood as you can with your hand rock then mine some rock with the hand rock when you have 50 wood build a wooden shelter. Another 30 wood will get you a door. This is a basic guide to your first shelter in rust. Unless you have a bow or a gun stay away from other players (unless you know them) bears or wolves. With your hand rock hunt for some pigs or elks these are great sources of food and material to build a bow/sleeping bag. When you have enough fabric build a bow. With this bow you should be able to take on wolves (if you're brave then you can try taking on a bear) and other weak players. Until you build or find a gun stay away from other players who do have guns. 99.9% of the time they will be trolls and kill you on sight. Gather resources to build bigger safer houses raid buildings kill players and upgrade your technology to stay alive. Good luck buy rust.,Rust

2017-10-17,1,1,694,True,Recommended,As someone who has played since the early early days of rust legacy in 2013 I can tell you the game has had its ups and downs not only that buts its entirely different from its origional form and has been at the forefront of survival PvP development. Now days Rust is a hybrid of nearly everything it has been slowly improving and filling out the development until its completion. I am currently writing this review at the time of the Blueprint/ component update and I would like to say this is the best version of rust I have played in a long long time. But there are some drawbacks the game has been out for a long time so people treat it like science they know exactly what to go for and how to do it fast so building and raiding is a bit unforgiving. The community can be a bit toxic and there are the occasional hacker on servers (most if not all are community driven). Overall Rust is a fantastic game and id gave it a 8.5/10 for all its worth.,Rust

There's too many that simply love harrassing new players going out of their way to ruin your experience.

2016-12-20,1,1,11173,True,Not Recommended,"I've been playing Rust for about 3 years now I started with Legacy and now I'm on the current iteration. The game has a lot of potential however the creator of the game Garry Newman is an alcoholic and literally tells his playerbase to stop playing this game. It has been in Alpha forever with no Beta release in sight. You can spend money on skins though! The community is pretty toxic I have made a few friends along the way but the majority of players are the kind that get off on griefing others. Base sabotaging item despawning naked killing racist/homophobic trash talking and just general cancerous attitudes are prevalent. You have to be in a group to get anything done otherwise you will die from pvp or raiding. Solo players be ed as far as Garry is concerned. Animals they run through walls into boulders into your base and they can hit you from 15 feet away. They literally programmed the A.I. to detect when they are in a headshot crosshair and to move the opposite way. You can make a horse do the friggan two step with a bolt action rifle from a mile away. Bears and wolves somehow know to avoid running directly at you when you have a gun but if you are a naked with a spear they will maul you from out of nowhere. The game development is fragmented as hell with Garry and his team seemingly ignoring most players requests and releasing whatever the hell they feel is important at the time. Weekly Dev notes include a lot of ""we did this obscure computer programming to fix something that we ed up so that we can put something we know you don't want into the game a year from now"" and ""we know you won't like it but that's tough quot . I'm talking about skins and the component system which requires you to bang on barrels for hours. That is no exaggeration you can spend HOURS banging barrels just to find a scrap you need to make a certain weapon. I've had a lot of fun with Rust and I've always hoped it would keep improving I feel like I was the victim of a very long cruel joke.",Rust

Every time you die you loose everything in your inventory. O its so much fun when that happens considering it takes forever to make basic tools... If your lucky to get a building built to save your items good luck not loosing the key or being killed then having the key stollen. leading you to never be able to get back in you building again... Dev. need to put a lot more work into this game to make it a little more enjoyable without having to start basicly over every time you die regardless how far you get in the game... O and did i mention they clear all the maps either once a week or once a month so any progress that you may have made will be gone and your gonna half to start over again anyways!

Lets back up.You start the game with little skill a rock (mine and cut trees) and torch for night time. You skill up and build a base. At first it will be basic and yes it will be raided quick. Just dont put too much effort into a base until you can build metal doors and combination locks. At that point even as a solo player you can build a decent base that will put off most raiders. DO NOT put all your items in one base build more than one. Have a drop box in a bush away from your base with basic survival gear.Just a little though and a solo player can make this game great fun also start to learn how to build traps and incorporate traps and lures into your bases. Or just build a trap house )It is fun but be warned Rust is a hostile environment and you will find a lot of effort will be ruined by other players.

There'd be times that a friend and I would run to Power Plant in search of Pipe Shotguns and Revolvers but only find barricades and planter box BPs. The community blows major as well. You have too many whiny 12 year olds that found this game from Youtubers like Vertiigo or Ser Winter nothing against the Youtubers and people who will door camp you for hours on end. I understand that it's a part of the game but it is utterly annoying. Currently the servers seemed to be either under a DDOS attack or FacePunch has terrible servers. I went to US West 3 because US West 2 has been shutting down for hours randomly and it was quite irritating. As I join US West 3 the server shuts down and has still been down for 20+ minutes.Overall the game is an amazing game and definitly gets the blood pumping. In its current state though it isn't worth the 20$. You may be able to find some good community servers or modded servers but the vanilla experience is the way to go.,Rust

2016-06-25,0,0,1515,True,Recommended,This game is simply amazing however the hacking is getting a little out of hand.Mainly with the whole locator hacks and aim bots. But seriously Locator Hacks will be the cancer of this game.Also why can I not ride a horse yet? Or better yet a pig? Or a Chicken? Anything would do really...Another big issue is that a lot of people who play this game no life it and want 1 week or 2 week restarts and all the maps are 4000 instead of being 6000 8000.On 4000 with a 200 person server there is literally a base everywhere you walk and people just camp the loot spots.8000 was my preferred because you had space to build you won't walk to the closest hill and pass by 6 bases that's just ridiculous.All in all I've put a lot of time into this game and i do recommend it to people to play but something seriously needs to be done about the map sizes.,Rust

2016-05-06,1,2,23,True,Not Recommended,I hardly ever leave reviews so this means that I either really enjoyed Rust or really despised it.It's the latter sadly. I tried for a very long time to like this game but I can't force it. It's like a horrible on off relationship.Unlocking cool blueprints is fun server wiping and losing everything is not. When there's a cool update I try to join in the fun having to ignore abuse russian and russian abuse hurled at me. I try to avoid servers with hackers which usually results in me playing by myself. However the gender forcing update has turned me away from this game completely. This has nothing to do with sexism or misogyny. I just feel that choices like this belong in the hands of the players.In short I do not recommend this game there are beter places to spend your money if you want a survival game a decent community experience and the freedom to evolve your character as you wish.,Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,144,True,Recommended,this game is what you look for in a survival game. yet it is only still in an alpha. This game is a cross from dayz and minecraft a lot like how 7 days to die is except this is more of a dayz type of a game then a building aspect game. The game is worth the $20 since the amount of gameplay that you get out of playing it since you start to become emersed in the game as if you where surviving. as i say that this game aint for someone who just has time here and there if you are going to play this game you will want to have at least a week of spare time to play it to the fullest. this is like 3 5hours a night if not more if you are going all out. With new updates every week or so this game has new things in it for you to discover as you build and thrive. you also know there will be a lot more content to come as its being made by garry (the dude who made g mod) so always be expectiong more.

Played the game the first time when it was new on Steam quitted because of all the griefers and raids while being offline. The day before yesterday I reinstalled it to give it a new chance because there indeed some greater changes. Except of the performance which is still awful. And not to forget to mention the attack helicopter. It shoots equipped players (with three or more clothings and/or a ranged weapon) and attacks bases (to work against ""campers""). No equipment allowed? No base allowed? So what is the sense behind this game then?This game is just terrible I wish I could flag it somehow so people get a warning before buying it!Das Spiel ist grauenhaft. Für die lange Zeit die es nun schon in Entwicklung ist 20 Euro zu verlangen ist purer Wucher. Habe das Spiel erstmals gespielt als es noch neu auf Steam erschien gequittet wegen der ganzen Griefer und den Raids während man offline war. Vorgestern neu installiert um ihm eine zweite Chance zu geben da sich ja einiges daran getan hat. Außer der Performance die ist immernoch genauso grottig. Dazu nun die Neuerung des Attack Helikopters. Er schießt auf ausgerüstete Spieler und deren Basen. Wozu dann eine Bauen? Wozu looten?

2017-02-16,0,0,166,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Imagine Rust is DayZ but every other player is a bandit and you have a radar stuck to you This game is promising but the experience of being a new player is so painful that It makes me not want to learn how to play and that was while I was on a tiny 15 person max server. I would only recommend this game to a person who is willing to go through 150+ hours of torture to even be able to protect yourself.Base building is nice but PVP is where the really hits the fan Nobody in this game has any mercy or sense of decency at all to the point where 80% of the people on most servers are willing to camp at spawn beaches and snipe new players if given the chance. On top of that It's stupidly hard to kill or even defend yourself from a top tier experienced player (compared to how easy it is for you to be killed) you'll be dead before you can manage to fire your first arrow/ bullet which leads me to the topic of the hit reg. While looking at the game's engine from a purely observational view it's pretty good. Once it's being put to the test in a real game however that's when you see flaws. This may have just bene bad experiences but Every time I've gotten into a firefight with anyone the enemy has always twitched around faster than I could move my sights which could just be a sensitivity issue but I doubt it.,Rust

2015-05-19,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Género Es un juego de supervivencia donde empezás sin nada y tendrás que ir consiguiendo materiales para poder sobrevivir crafteando podrás construir una fortaleza armas cazar animales y enfrentarte a otros jugadores. Historia ( 1)Carece de historia. Gráficos (4/5)Calidad gráfica muy variable dependiendo de la versión del juego en las primeras era aceptable y se podía correr en una pc con recursos medios/bajos pero en las nuevas actualizaciones sólo se puede jugar en una pc de gama alta mejorando los gráficos pero no creo que justifique por la calidad final. Jugabilidad (4/5)Shooter en primera persona muy bien equilibrado y con diversidad de mapas diversos tipos de misiones y accesorios para el personaje/arma. Resumen (3/5)Lo jugué desde las primeras a las últimas versiones y desde la BETA y puedo decir que es un gran juego hay muchísimos servidores pero es un juego que puede cambiar de un momento a otro y hay que jugarlo con dos condiciones 1) Jugarlo con un team de amigos porque las 24hs van a atentar contra tu jugador que si muere pierde todo lo que tiene equipado.2) Dedicar muchas horas en recolección de items y equipado de tu casa porque también es muy facil sufrir un raideo y que en unos minutos te desarmen la fortaleza.Pese a que es un juego que recomiendo y me parece muy entretenido se termina volviendo un juego muy monótono y resulta aburrido en un momento.,Rust

It's a terrible version of Day Z/War Z with a terrible building feature attached to it. 3. Terrible community 4. No supervision5. Nothing to do6. game is choppy and full of lagIf you would like to read my rambling on these issues please keep reading. If not you got the point. There are only 3 ways to survive in the world. 1. Be one of the first ones to own the game (or be one of the first ones on a new server)2. Work together with a massive group of your friends (don't trust anybody else in rust)3. Hack I included the last part because hacking is all you see in the public servers. Hackers rarely get banned even if it was obviously hacking (example killing everybody in the world at once).Players must also be on several hours every day in order to not lose everything. Buildings will decay after 1 day and players will constantly attack your buildings. It's not a game worth spending an hour on why would I want to spend hours each day? Now let's talk about the community. It's TERRIBLE. It is far from a noob friendly environment. The servers are full of veteran players hunting down noobs cursing and harassment. Since these veterans are well ahead of most people in the game they go around using C4 on almost everything and will destroy your buildings everytime. There are no mods/admins to help you out and no matter what happens (harassment hacking) you're on your own. There is nothing to do in the game. The map stays constant (different servers don't have different maps). You can run around the whole island in about 20mins so you know it's a small map. This forces players to build close to one another and the limited resources instills an agressive nature in everybody. Rust prides itself on the ""building"" aspect but this just adds to the poor quality of the game. There is no elaborate building structure you can make. Resources are scarce and it takes too much to build anything. Players attack each other's structures so there's always pathching up to do. After the first few people on the server acquire C4 the server is done. The same people will control all the resources and there is no progress for everybody else. There is also no end game and once you build your structure that's all there is to it. The rate of decay is soo high that if you're away from the computer for more than 1 day you lose EVERYTHING.Lastly the game is just made poorly. The graphics are plain and look like something from the late 90s. The player motion is choppy and movement is unnatural. Melee fighting is not an option because it's so choppy shotguns or guns with high fire rate can only guarantee your opponents death. Well just don't buy it.",Rust

2016-01-15,0,0,1215,True,Recommended,"It was a late afternoon at the nuclear power plant... I was looking for gear in this seemingly abandoned area when I heard a distinctive sound of a chopper nearby. I quickly ran into one of the buildings thinking hopefully it wouldn't spot me and gun me down where I stood. I was on the second floor by the window when I heard a person screaming over their mic getting mowed down by the helocopter. I felt bad for them even though i knew they would probably kill me the second they knew of my existence... I thought he had died. A few minutes passed until I heard footsteps across the hall. He... Miraculously survived. My thinking was cut short when I realized he was running at me with a shotgun in his hands I screaming in the mic ""OH GOD PLEASE NO"" as I ran down the hallway getting shot once and losing more than half of my health... I found a crack in the building and hopped out of their getting the hell out with the chopper still above looking for prey whilst the man who tried to shoot me said"" Come back mien Fuhrer we must finish the third reich"" Knowing I would get ripped to shreds if I stayed out for longer I had to go into a building connected to the one with the crazed psychopath that tried to kill me. I ran to the second floor into a broken pipe system ran to the very end where I found a man with only a rock and torch. He greeted me nicely at which point I told him to shut the up because we were bieng hunted by a madman. He didn't take my advice of hiding still and moments after he walked out of the pipeline I hear ""SQUEAAAAL LIKE A PIIIG"" followed by a sound of a shotgun. It was the same monster as before! with only a little bit of health the day transsferred to nighttime within seconds. I could still hear footsteps outside but I was fairly positive he didnt know where I was... yet. In the end I decided that if I did die from jumping out of the small crack in this pipeline that was be a better death than that of this sadistic creep so I jumped and miraculously lived. With this accomplished I ran the hell outta the plant opening a small green crate on the way. There was an assault rifle in this box...

2015-12-20,3,1,149,True,Recommended,This game is fun at times but at other times it really pisses me off.The community is one of the worst for an online game and people just expect your gonna kill them so they fire at you or hit you over the head with a rock or hatchet That then drives you to think everyone is bad and then creates a chain reaction of people killing each other.I would recomend you play this with a friend as solo is frustrating and more time consuming.Im looking forward for future updates such as vehicles and other weapons and tools.Now if you dont mind me im off to bash some 12 year old over the head with a stone.,Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,65,True,Not Recommended,Well i heard lots of good things about this game So i decided to buy it and give it at try out People told me oh yeah its way better then Dayz standalone. Now let me tell you how much this game does not even compare closeley to Dayz. 1. I turned my graphics up to max settings on everything and the grass details were pathetic. You spawn with a rock 2 meds and a torch I found a building and thinking that i could easily break in cause you know a big boulder would be able to take down a simple wood wall but no that failed me misserably Then i found no tools around the map and learned you had to build everything Now how is this a post apocolyptic enviroment? No items can be found and you have to make everything your self Now it took me a couple minutes to figure out on how to get wood But then i figured it out i smashed a tree with my rock.. Now you are seriously telling me i can get usable lumber by smashing a rock on a tree? That is the most un realistic thing i have ever ecountered. If anyone tells you this game is better then dayz They are absolutley full of them selfs and should actualy play DayZ because even in its alpha stage the graphics are 10x better and is just more realistic then this naked man game. I do not recomend this game for anyone either then the little child that can put up with the horrific unrealistic interaction. Waste of money in my opinon.,Rust

2016-05-15,0,0,529,True,Recommended,"I enjoyed Rust for a time... Great game.... I played it WAY more than enough to justify what it costs. Maybe I'll play it again if it gets more interresting... The XP system sounds promising... I read the Dev Blog regularly to see if anything has been added to make me want to play it again.... The game got old for me after a few hundred hours of play... Lost interest in the game mechanics.... Too repetitiveBut the thing I like most about Rust is that it changes over time.... If you get sick of the game the way it is you stop playing for a while and when you pick it back up months later or longer and it feels like a new game with many new additions to explore... The constant and regular changes are what I like best about Rust and what I think adds some serious replay value...What I don't like about Rust is that Bullys rule... It's a dihck dominated game... The community of regular players mostly consists of people with severe unfriendly attitudes who take advantage of and pick on players much weaker than they are... There is a critical lack of players with cool great to play with attitudes (After writing this I read some of the other reviews and I agree with all of the ones describing the community as ""Toxic"".... It is VERY toxic azzwhole psychopaths reign supreme... It makes the game not so fun...

2015-12-21,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,The trailer makes Rust look like a PS2 game. The trailer oversells it.As soon as you install the game you will be asked to install third party system monitoring software a fact that is not mentioned anywhere in the Steam store page. If you agree to that you will be greeted by the Flash wrapper that surrounds the actual game. If you agree to use the flash wrapper you will be dropped into a world of mashed potatoes that very roughly reflects a post apocalyptic earth.This world of mashed potatoes doesn't have a tutorial documentation or even any action other than 'throw your rock away'. (Literally that is all you can do by default. There is a rock in your hands. You can throw it once. Then it has left your hands and no button of the mouse does anything anymore.) Yet it has microtransactions to purchase guns after you've already bought this game. They're good to go on microtransactions. Man there are so many microtransactions.There is an inventory screen ripped off of Minecraft at the bottom of the screen. However it is superfluous seeing as you can't pick up items.But there is a crafting system. You will be able to tell this by the sheer number of ten story tall swastikas that dot the landscape. (The $20 early access fee doesn't cover moderation it seems.) These swastikas are the only straight lines you'll find in the mashedpotatoverse.The only thing I can say in this game's favor is that it doesn't have audio chat.If you're looking for a beautiful survival game go preorder The Long Dark. In that game you can pick things up and use them two innovations that Rust is not quite ready to tackle yet.,Rust

2014-01-16,0,0,1108,False,Not Recommended,"The relaxed theme the charm and the simplicity has been beaten out of Rust Legacy. Now this sluggish and chaotic version looks good but is such a harsh experience in comparison that it's practically a different game.Bloated with so many things that the initial experience consists of rubbish like being prompted to wait for skins to download and being killed at spawn by animals and other players(if you didn't die before you even had control over your player) while trying to get to grips with a steep learning curve.Not being able to run Fraps and the Steam Overlay in the same launch is souring. The saying ""less is more"" seems to escape the devs where they could have spent these years making the game functional(as a program and in its mechanics) rather than say ""hey wouldn't X be a great idea!"" and now you need an SSD to have anywhere near proportionate loading times but remains fairly slow even on an SSD.Why add a chopper if it will blow up your base when nobody's even in it? Or when you can't even figure out why it shoots you as you try to hide from it. Why have a bear in the game for such a long time when it kills players through walls? Why add fatal temperatures and radiation when the distance of a few metres take you from warm to freezing or fine to fatally radiated?I've survived bleeding to death while underwater for a minute at 20hp while being shot and other times died because I was running through an open field and got radiated. Game mechanics like this are a mess and are being left in their current state rather than reverted to something workable until they're fully realised.In Legacy you could slap a building down anywhere(even late into the wipe) and produce some revolvers. But now to have even a slim chance you have to start as soon as a wipe hits otherwise you get flame raided straight away and it has to be close to barrels(weapon components) or you won't be able to even produce revolvers. And you'll need to build a tool cupboard quickly otherwise you can get griefed now much worse than what would happen in Legacy.You now have to build a code lock to lock your door which makes the game much more difficult starting out compared to the Legacy door which locked for you as soon as it was built. Anyone can steal your door even if you have a tool cupboard down. If you can't build a code lock(which takes metal) then you're stuck with a wooden key but you have to keep it on you to open the door. Maybe this mechanic isn't seen in other games because it's complete trash?As a solo player you can't have a base anymore. As soon as you die with your key on you someone can take it and steal your base. Even in a group someone has to stay inside the base to be a door opener which reduces the experience of one player to sitting there being bored. In Legacy you didn't have to worry about these things which I think makes this version of Rust an objectively bad game. How do you manage to get a code lock if the wooden keys you rely on until then are a failure of a mechanic? Why make bases so difficult to make yet so easy to raid?You'd think hiding in grass/behind rocks or skulking around at night could make things easier until you're in a stronger position(code lock + guns) but trying to be sneaky will get you killed by what seems to be an epidemic of wallhackers. If you want to report a cheater then you need to go through the unstable recaptcha system. Wallhack prevention seems to be stuck on the shoulders of server admins but surely with all the money in gaming a better system could have been implemented.Seeing at night is in itself a broken mechanic as one of my friends complained about not seeing anything while my other friend in the same moment next to us on different hardware/software could see clearly. Leaving base during the day can be a hazard as there's a chopper that goes around shooting players for no reason even spawnkilling them. The jump puzzlest are bad some being downwards(makes jumping not work half the time) and some cave ones are blocked by the rocks above you. I've done jumping competitions in Counter Strike for fun and still loath the Rust jumps.When I play the game more towards the balance of roleplay I won't be able to produce good weapons and even if you get a bow headshot someone can easily survive that. If I play the game more towards the balance of deathmatch meta(get in first build near components) I can amass guns which easily overpower other players but those mechanics are so out of balance that nobody joins a server after the first 12 hours of a wipe so what's the point of having guns on a dead server?Even the survival element of Rust which took its DNA from Gmod Stranded and DayZ mod has been squeezed out by the addition of poor mechanics. There's sentry guns and an AI tank and a chopper. The tank was supposed to help fix the game but left it feeling even more like a Battlefield title. They've shown the vehicles on the store page but the experience is actually closer to just getting killed by arrows while you're trying to make a bow...If you run out of torches and can't see just suicide to get one for free. Need animal fat? Suicide. Low on health/hunger/thirst? Just suicide. Don't like your random map spawn? Suicide. The survival theme loses its immersion by the mechanics pushing a deathmatch/suicide meta at every turn. After all these years of development surely the game should be welcoming streamlined optimized and intuitive by now. But instead among all the gripes I've left out it's a mess that only offers rewards to the experienced groups which control the high value areas of the map with dozens of guns with which they'll find worthless when they have nobody to shoot on their empty server the next day. The game caters solely to those competitive groups yet for some reason large clan bases were nerfed by ""upkeep"" so there's no playerbase this game now satisfies properly...It's a step up from Legacy in terms of graphics and combating flyhack cheats but otherwise it's a complete disaster. I've played it with friends but they had to be competent deathmatchers for us to get anything done. Even if you start on a trio server with 2 skilled friends as soon as it wipes and head to a quiet spot you'll still get attacked straight away.If you spend your time building then you'll get flame raided before you upgrade from wood. Many players are only interested in attacking what others build and not building themselves so why were they given the tools to attack so easily? Then the new community pushed the roleplayers out saying that the roleplayers weren't even playing the game anymore but still visited the forums to ""complain.""What Legacy had with easier starting and hard raiding Rust is now about difficult starts and easy raiding. It's no surprise that servers only last a matter of hours when Legacy offered an experience that would go on for days or weeks. The inclusion of roleplay items like signs makes no sense in such a competitive game. You might enjoy this strange deathmatch oriented version but what's to stop them changing the gameplay dramatically again to attract a completely different playerbase to buy copies and leave their old playerbase behind?",Rust

Oh and there is workbenches now wich are RIDICULOUSLY expensive. price components (sheetmetal) *facepalm*In case you guys at facepalm are too it should go like this &gt loot monuments/barrels&gt find blueprint (eventually)&gt have item permanetly unlocked (until next game update)&gt be able to craft item with RESOURCES you can FARM/PRODUCE without having to go to monuments ALL THE ING TIME&gt profit.Do this its what people loved the game for everything else is t.,Rust

2018-10-02,1,1,59,False,Not Recommended,This game is really annoying and just . One of those things being that i have to wait 15 min for a game to start!!. Then when im in the game i just get killed by people who already have fancy guns and ive tried to build a base and upgrade it but its so hard to find basic stuff like rock or making armour. Also its pretty time consuming and i understand why it would be because the map is pretty big but if ur gonna keep dying over and over its 0 fun to find new stuff to replace the ones you had. ive spent 3 days and im still just as bad as i started!! I locked the door. had stone walls but even that all my stuff were gone from my chests my friend had been killed and there was no way anyone would have gotten in because there was no holes in the wall and ive tested and the lock should have worked on strangers. The only times the game is fun is when you have a pickaxe and an axe and actually get stuff (which take like 1h to get a fricking axe and a picin some scenarios) but then the game is gonna laugh at you when 98% of the other players are gonna kill you. You'll end up losing your stuff and retry. Over and over. I could accept it the first 2 days but now im getting because i cant do anything to prevent it cant hide cant run cant fight back.,Rust

The amount of hackers on this game is outragous yes i know it is in the alpha stage but garry you have did it before it really shouldnt be that big of an issue to solve the hack issue i mean c'mon i killed a person and he was like that wasnt nice and after i killed him i died and it said you killed yourself you silly cod. Hackers that can kill people and make it seem like they killed themselfs is a big issue on rust servers atleast for me not to mention the countless people who speed hack and fly hack to kill you or get into your base. i will NOT be changing my recommendation until something is done with the pitaful amount of hackers that completely ruin the rust experience. So for all players wanting to buy this game i suggest you wait a little while...,Rust

There is nothing more satisfying than gunning down innocent players and claiming their rock as your own.

This game really aims for the realistic factor more then just a ""survival"" game. I would really reconmend this game. The one thing you have to understand is that it is in Alpha. Also you have to live with the fact that one moment you could have all the stuff in the world and be like the ""king"" of the server and you go to sleep in your ""secure"" house.

Since they ditched the old version the game is utter The lagg is something unsuportable. And the fact that there is no sandbox mode youre forced to play online on those laggy servers. The game freezes and locks up a lot of time. It was a good idea It has a lot of potential but the devs are not giving a flying about their customers. It's Alpha since late 2013. It made $46.5 million according to Wiki better games were made with less kha ching in less time. This piece of money printer will stay in Alpha even when Half Life 5 The Sequel will be considered boring. They'll just rewrite and rewrite the game from sketch 'till it prints the money.

2015-12-29,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,Rust is an open world multiplayer deathmatch game with base building resource gathering and survival management mechanics borrowed from games like Minecraft.As an early access game Rust is still struggling to find an identity even after shifting focus away and mostly removing it's formulaic PvE elements in favor of adversarial Player vs Player gameplay. The game balance is currently weighted heavily in favor of players who choose to participate in clan or large group play since it provides a massive and clear advantage over the slow grind that solo players or those playing in small groups experience. Unfortunately this has the side effect of encouraging players to bypass entire elements of the game's early and mid game progression. Joining a large group of players that have already established themselves and acquired the best gear allows new players the benefits of jumping effortlessly to the top of the food chain against other players. Playing solo or in a small group is a severe handicap and merely a lesson in tedium.I believe the concept and mechanics of this game would be more condusive to shorter periods of time between server resets (ie. 1 day 3 days or 1 week) in order to avoid large groups of players over fortifying servers against the possibility of small group or solo play. Depending on the server you will begin weeks if not months behind other players who quickly have the ability to erase hours of the tedious grinding required with little means of defending yourself.Accelerating the harvesting of resources building requirements and other massive time sinks would also greatly diminish the uninteresting early game progression so players do not feel forced in to joining a large team of players to avoid the danger of losing all of their progress.Understandably a game like this will never truly present a level playing field and the game presents an exciting concept to players despite the unclear direction of the game's development...However I can NOT recommend a game that unintentionally encourages new players to ignore or bypass a large portion of it's content and progression in order.to effortlessly gain an overwhelming advantage.,Rust
2016-01-04,1,2,535,True,Not Recommended,63 hours in playing i thought it was pretty good me and my friends play on Facepunch Hongkong server because that's the nearest one and the lowest ping. We worked our asses of to make a good base but our server is like a china vs korea simulator full of and hotheads who kill anyone in sight so after we successfully protected our base from one raider another 2 came with rocket launchers and destroyed everyting we worked for. I mean i don't know what to feel... I recommend this game for hardcore survival gamers but if you are looking for a fun time only try dota or cs go instead. It is very frustrating and at the end... when you've met all the cheaters item duplicators and speedhackers you will realize that this game will just up your time. Believe me.,Rust

2015-10-07,0,0,1350,True,Not Recommended,Rust is tons of fun. I really rather love this game. The problem is it's inundated with hackers and getting worse and worse in that respect all the time. Create a big base gather a lot of resources build yourself up into something worth noticing and 100% guarenteed you're going to be hack raided dry overnight. Being successful in this game without hacks requires hours of risk and hard work and until you get there it's basically just a repetitive manual labor sim. Once you get past that stage of the game things get really exciting but not when hackers who did none of the hard work go flying into your base and clean out your days of toil in an instant. It's happened to me and the people I've grouped with way too many times. If a hacker chooses to clean you out or worse aimbot camp your base instantly shooting everyone in the head who comes/goes your game is essentially over until they get bored/get full and move on. It's highly disheartening and there's really no recourse as after getting banned the hackers just buy the game again from Russia for 5 bucks and they're back.,Rust

2018-07-08,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"I read the reviews here on steam before purchasing the game and knew how cancerous the community can be but a mate and I decided to team up and give it a go anyway. We met some chill and helpful people but they were few and far between. DO NOT buy this game if you don't have a large group of friends to play with. You will constantly be ganked by players who may as well have a nuclear arsenal compared to your rock. Totally nude with your bird dangling in the wind with only a rock in your possession? GANKED. We managed to stay alive long enough to acquire enough resources to build a small base. Night time fell and we were surrounded our base demolished and ganked in the pitch black as we were trying to escape by players with nail guns. The game is unoptimized and runs like crap. I made it crash just by changing one of the audio settings on a $2500 gaming rig. I'm sure there would have been plenty more of them if I hadn't of uninstalled this turd from my computer. Unfortunately I can't refund a game just because the community is trash. For the love of god don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing it to ""just give it a go"" because you will regret it.Update My mate had friends who were well established on one Rust server. So I reinstalled the game and we built a base close to theirs. Things were going smooth we had fortified with rock walls had a ton of wooden chests with the items we had spent quite a few hours gathering but there was a weak point our wooden door with incredibly low durability. To get a metal door with a code you need a large amount of scrap. To get the metal door you need a furnace which also needs a large amount of scrap among other things which takes time to scavange and can be difficult to acquire. So what happened? Highly geared players used a flame thrower on our door while we were inside broke down the door then rushed us with machine guns and jacked everything. This is the problem with games like Rust and Ark. Experienced players who are well established and geared to the teeth can completely lock you out of the game. THIS GAME.",Rust

Awww sonofa well it don't matter anyhoo those 13 year old Mickey Mouse Club doods came back and told us they planned to break into our place as soon as we go offline to work/sleep cause their parents are crack heads and they are skipping school again... Thats ok the stupid bears they change the Zombies into aren't creepy or even hard to farm. Ill be back up and running in 6 hours and soons i sleep someone else will gank my crap and start their own base to get robbed another 6 hours later.Pretty much sums the game play. Whole playable area is far to small no more zombies no real pve aspect aside from building which is fine but don't go away with your family for a weekend cause all your crap will decay if you don't log in daily...I haven't seen an update in ages wasted my money Rust should be looking at 7 Days to Die on how to do things right.That is right 7DtD is a far superior game in most ways and I have seen more updates and good changes for it in the short time I have played then has come out with Rust and Dayz combined.,Rust

2015-06-15,0,0,56,True,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game...I mean really really.However after they took out the zombies and then removed the ""demolish"" feature from the hammer there was really no point to the game at all.On a PvE server you literally have no challenge whatsoever...the only ""enemies"" are the wolves and very random bear encounters other than that nothing. It takes forever to dehydrate or starve and there is no cold/hot factor or even stamina for that matter.On a PvP server you flat out just get owned. Start the world off butt naked and get mowed down by someone that has been building their character forever ya' rock versus machine gun...that's fair.Until they start updating the game and atleast start putting some enemies in the game I can't recommend it at the moment unless you just like to build stuff.Oh yeah a HUGE part that bothers me is that there is no mining in the game. You need rocks? See that big boulder over there or that mountain side teaming with rocks can't touch them. You can't mine off of everything you see not even close to it...you have to find these smaller round boulders to hack at...no gardening no dirt/sand/clay...just trees and the small round boulders.

2018-03-02,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,This game takes way too long to build or do anything with the new Work Bench system. The Work bench system combind with the BP system makes it so the game does not benefit solo players at all. Only way possible to bearly play the game solo is on a modded server x2 or x5 with no BP and even then is it extremely hard. The game is impossible to currently play on unmodded servers as you normally get killed by someone in a large group with an AK 5 minutes into the game. As you can see I have invested 500 hours into this game and nothing has come out of it since they updated the game for BP system and work bench system to only benefit large groups. I recently have this game 1 more chance last wipe last on the 01.03.18 and it still is impossible to play game game with the current system!,Rust

Don't waste your money.Gameplay If you are solo this game is not for you if you are group of 20 or less guys this game is not for you... you basically put hard work into building your base gathering materials and creating weapons for hours and hours just to have your base raided when you and your friends go to sleep in real life next time you log in you find your naked spawning near a lake with no resourses around just to die of starvation. You start out having a basic lot of blueprints already at your disposal you get to find more as you venture into random generated maps yeah all servers have a unique RNG map so everytime you join a different server you don't know where the resourses or farmable cities are located there is no minimap or gps to guide you around you can only hand draw your map but shame on you if you get killed it gets taken away and you have to start it all over you can't copy it.If you want your assets to last for a little longer you need players on your group of all time zones that way your base is always defended and I only say ""last for a little longer"" since servers get swiped on 2 different occasions 1. The server owner has time interval swipe policy 2. All the servers get forced to swipe because the game developers add or tweak something at least once a week.Also hackers are running rampant on the official servers.

Rust started out as a great concept but has turned out like a partnership between EA and One giant circle jerk consisting of the absolute worst humanity has to offer. The best that you can do is try and find a server that has no one on it and tinker around otherwise enjoy the format of Spawn naked (We arent' even going to get into that) then get killed by some with a shotgun and body armor.

2016-01-03,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,Horrible game! If you like getting getting killed over and over and over and over logging off and coming back to find yourself dead again with your shelter destroyed then this game is for you. Not to mention the closeted gay rascist little s who populate every server. If you like being around 12 year olds calling each other n&amp g%er and f%&amp got talking about their and what they want to do with them this is a great game. With signs posted all over the place using stupid slurs like n*gg*r island and city it's such a fun place to spend your time. If you spend your time carefully gathering and crafting and avoiding the griefers who shoot you in the back for no reason you can build yourself a nice little shelter and secure your stuff for the next time you want to log on and play. Ooops no you can't do that because every time you log back on you will be buck naked laying on a beach somewhere random and if you can find your way back to your shelter it will be empty.

2016-02-29,0,0,61,True,Not Recommended,This game is really fun to get to know the ropes and is immensely satisfying as you learn more build an awesome stone shelter and begin to actually find stability in the game. However if you don't have any friends to play with or make any friends in the server you are in it's pretty isolating and hard to work against the grain of much more experienced groups of players around many corners which won't hesitate to shoot you for no reason. It's frustrating to go on a solo run get a bunch of valuable resources and then get mauled by a bear who creeps up on you like a ninja. So maybe you get frustrated and quit for a while then you want to come back to your progress. Nah it's deteriorated or the server wiped got to relive all of that frustration again of rebuilding from the humble place of being naked on the beach with just a rock. I got my $20 of value out of this game I think because I just wanted to try it and I had a good time for the 20hrs I did play. However it has little allure to replay especially as a solo player.,Rust

The base had been blocked off with walls to prevent rebuilding and he removed everything. He also then proceeded to shoot some of us attacking the same base with god mode on.When a developer himself is willing to affect the gameplay of an entire server just to assist his friends you can tell that a the company that created the game is not yet mature enough for sale on the open market.In an additional note one of the DEVELOPER staff actually banned the user who raided his friends base for a short period of time and listed the reason as boring.,Rust

2017-11-10,2,2,980,True,Not Recommended,First off let me just say I have played this game some on another account so the hours in the game do not signify my skill level. Secondly this is a game for cucks. So here is the break down of pro's / con's.Pros Living more then 15 minutes.Cons Everyone in the game is a cuck The networking is not even 56k worthy. With a ping of 80 most other players can kill you from about 10 feet away with a mele weapon due to the extreme garbage net code implemented in this game that benifits the lagger. Non stop cussing in every server Players literally will you for your stuff and kill you then laugh about it. This leads to some of the lamest gameplay in any game ever made. Where someone will litearlly squat on you after killing you with their tiny exposed. The Animal AI is very linear and they also can melee you from 10+ feet away. You can't choose your sex in game. You can't modify your characters looks.In short buy this game only if you are a Cuck.,Rust

2017-11-22,0,0,1530,True,Not Recommended,I really liked playing the game. Clocked about 1200 hrs. Since the introduction of the components system with scrap the game is very slow to advance in unless you are in a (large) clan. Which makes the game really unfair. Shortly after a server wipe the balance is ok but after 3 to 4 days in vanilla servers the game is so unbalanced that there only remain a few dominating clans. When playing solo duo or irregular this game has become impossible to play (survive). The last 3 months I have not gotten any further than owning a waterpipe shotgun. This is no match for a 5 person clan with AK's running around. I've deinstalled the game with the intention not to return. As almost all Rust players I met online have done already. RIP Rust!,Rust

Life ""might not be resembling the game""I walked to a harbor. I found a melee weapon and a beanie then in the distance i saw a person.I hide behind a little wall but it already was too late he saw me and shot me I survived but then he came up to me and killed me with a cleaver.I was laying on the ground not dead mind you and said I was new and I don't get anything... he didn't react... he already walked off.2. Life ""might as well talk to people""so I found a couple of guys seemingly nice at first. they just were naked and raided an already pretty damaged house.I went up to them and asked if I can join them. one said sure if I can find something I can keep it.I found nothing they destroyed the box they where looting and went off... at least I thought.I turned around and saw a guy running up to me and hit me with a stone. I said ""hey stop that"" and he said ""oh sorry and walked back.. his friend though came up running and hit me with a speer ""you are not my friend !"" I said ""I didn't want to be his friend."" then I got killed.3. Life ""well.. I try again...""A big building. huge and well constructed. I walked up and said hello when a guy with a wolf mask came out shot me multiple times with a ... nail gun? I think? anyway that was my shortest life with only 24 seconds.4. life ""stand back!""this time I was more careful. I tried to find a spot where I could start building I built a little house and quickly got hungry. I went out to a Gas station and found a couple of good things to eat ! ... then there was a guy coming up to me... ""hey whats up""I only said ""hey please stand back""""whats the matter? don't like the people?""I swung my stone at him "" I said stay back""""hey don't be so violent""he got out a club and beat me to death with it... yeah.

Fighting raiding scavenging through rad towns various monuments building hunting and there's just so many things you can like about this game! The developers are also amazing they read and listen to their community's feedback do things that are better for the game. Of course not everything is perfect there are few things I don't like about the game one of them is that you really have to dedicate your time if you want to get or achieve something like get explosives good guns and that's going to be really hard if you don't have much time. Next thing large groups you'll meet them on almost every server and if you're a solo player or play in small groups which is by the way extremely hard it's going to be rough fighting against them and they also can get materials much easier and faster so they're going to be geared faster and now because of the new XP system which I like but I hate the fact that's it's really slow the large groups can level up much easier because of the XP share. But after all the game is only in the alpha state and considering that it's really an amazing game as it already has so much stuff and I'm sure the developers won't stop working and will make it a great game!So I really recommend buying this game especially if you have time and friends to play with!Oh and by the way there's many servers with various games like battle royale the walls and such so if you'll feel you wanna try something new give it a go.,Rust
2016-07-02,1,2,3337,True,Recommended,Best game i have ever played. If you cant kill people who try to kill you practice. Complain about no resource nodes? Make a map and search unexplored areas and mark them. Cant play solo? Find some ing people and play with them lol. I can make a base that is secure solo and know when to engage groups and not to engage groups. Playing solo is not impossible in any way in a sense it is liberating. Anyone complaining about the difficulty level or community obviously doesnt have the testicles for this game. Rust takes large and steel cut balls if you cant measure up go play minecraft. If you want the most intense incredible experience in a survival game with an unparalleled pvp exerience play this game.,Rust

2017-11-14,0,0,698,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game it can be toxic as players can do a lot of different things. Basically you can be and will likely be killed on site by at least 90% of the other players. Starting this game and being solo can be quite difficult I recommend learning with a friend to cover your six. Eventually make friends with other players whether they're neighbors or people from forums looking to team up. It is a survival game you have to survive and pvp is an element of that other people want the resources and weapons you have. It's great because when the world goes to this is exactly what would happen.,Rust

2016-12-20,0,0,2077,True,Not Recommended,The ak47 recoil needs to be like how it was in BP system. Right now almost any other gun in the game cant touch an AK. Its really overpowered and it closes the skill gap. What they are doing with the game now is they are opening the farm gap. What i mean by this is they are making it so that you have to farm for hours upon hours in order to get anything you want. One thing is in older rust you could get something like an AK or a rocket etc. out of a barrel. Now the best thing you can get out of a barrel is a spring or something that you can help use to craft an AK that you need to first get the BP for and the level 3 workbench. Not to mention the resources you need to farm. There is no more getting lucky and being excited that you found a rocket in a barrel. The game has been turned into a linear farm fest. You cant even try to chance research an item anymore you have to go farm for enough to get it garunteed. Solo in Rust now is ridiculously hard. In one wipe you have to farm 2000 scrap just to get workbenches. Then you have to farm scrap for any BPs that you might need. Remember that ak i was talking about? Thats gonna be another 750 scrap to research. And its the same amount for all other high tier items. I wish the developers would take a more pvp oriented approach to the game which made it so fun instead of making it a roleyplay simulator. Every week in the devblogs they focus on adding useless items and features while the core elements of the game suffer. Rust is not as fun as it used to be and anyone who has played the game as long i have would know that. Currently the developers are catering to the noobs in the games development. Rust's most experienced players with thousands of hours are abandoning the game at incredible speeds because of what they are doing to the game. And gary/helk saying that people with thousands of hours should stop playing the game isnt helping the experienced player base. What i think Facepunch needs to do to fix this is to start listening to players with thousands of hours. Honestly i have barely scratched the surface of all the problems rust has but these are the ones i encounter most frequently. The one thing that really bugs me and i think is the reason old players complain alot is because all the biggest problems in rust now are ones that werent always problems in older rust. Im not complaining because the game has always been bad. Im complaining because the game was the best game i ever played and it was ruined.,Rust
2016-09-18,0,0,661,True,Recommended,"Rust is a great game especially with friends. It's cruel and unforgiving. You will spend an hour or so gathering resources only to be shot dead by an attacker with gun. You'll need to make friends early on when you're still ""innocent "" as my friend Katojishifu Tokijikushikato said. After a while you'll stop saying I'm friendly and instead kill every naked on sight. Over time you and your friends will rise to the top of the food chain only to realize you've become what you hate a clan with AKs and full armour running around killing random naked and forcing them to start over.10/10 would grind for Waterpipe again.",Rust

2016-12-16,0,0,724,True,Recommended,In this game you play on an island where everybody is exposed and can kill or be killed by anyone at any time. There's no teams or guilds only spoken agreements between players through vocal proximity chat. The gimmick of Rust is that everything anybody has is up for grabs. This means that if you die your entire inventory guns clothes resources etc. can be taken by whoever killed you. Furthermore the houses you build can be busted into and even taken over by other players which in turn leaves you a fresh spawned man or women naked and with nothing but their trusty rock. This twist on open world quickly produces a sense of urgency and risk in the player spawning from a fear of loss of which makes the game both exhilarating and rewarding. Risk vs Reward is what Rust is all about it makes you think hard about every choice you make.Coincidentally this gimmick unintentionally provides an small insight on basic human behavior.Since everyone has the power to kill everyone else in Rust player interaction is incredibly stressful. This makes folks feel on edge constantly for fear of getting gunned down or back stabbed potentially leading to a loss of hours worth of work. Because the island is basically a giant open world PVP battleground and the backstabbing is so prevalent trust becomes a major facet of gameplay. Unfortunately because the majority of the player base is unashamedly tempted and shows no restraint or respect for their fellow player's hard work the game becomes a true exercise in endurance tolerance patience and ultimately survival. To that degree I'd say Gary is successful with Rust. But at the end of the day by some freak chance Rust to me has become a social experiment that shows you the true nature of human beings when provided opportunity with a lack of tangible consequence.Pros Building is fun and intuitive World is gorgeous Many different server types including Battle Royal and Role Play Gunplay is solid Audio and ambience are immersive Potentially hilarious player interaction (player personality dependent) Playing leads to lots of fun stories you can tell your friends Frequent Updates Active and communicative developers Procedural generation works greatCons Buggy Animals clip through walls which is scary when a bear all of a sudden starts beating on you through a boulder. This also makes it hard to chase critters you need for resources. Players have a tendency to view others as loot pinatas instead of fellow players Success seems to favor large groups. It's hard to get end game anything as a solo player or small (less than 5 person) group. Devs don't seem to have much of an idea on what they want the finished game to be. What they have works and works well but there seems to be some misdirection when it comes to a vision for the final product. They keep implementing massive overhauls to key progressions systems. They went from loot+resource dependent crafting to a leveing system ala Ark then to a component system and now they're retooling resourcing and rebalancing item crafting yet again for mid 2017.Massocists would enjoy this game or people good at shooters. It's a pretty harsh survival game.,Rust

2018-03-30,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,oming from many hours sunk into Rust I really tried to like this game. It offers so much opportunity to improve on other games in this genre but in the end you are much better off giving it more time to see if it will develop. As it stands right now it is not worth your time or money. PROS + The graphic style while a little cartoonish at first does work. It looks nice and objects stand out in gameplay.+ Emphasis on survival. You really can die of hunger and the elements if you do not take care of yourself.+ It is satisfying to build up your equipment. No blueprint BS just build and buff your stuff.CONS It is DEAD online. You need to enjoy working by yourself and getting your hat handed to you by the one or two quasi clans on the few servers that sport more than 3 people online at any time. This is a major problem that causes the other cons to spiral down even quicker. It lacks direction. The devs have abandoned V1 and now work on V2 which they call Experimental. Makes you think it is a beta version right? Well it sure is but it is the only one with anything new too. The Devs change course seemingly update to update on the game direction making major shifts. This has made the game have a continuous learning curve and rendered most online guides useless. More than anything this game really does not know what it wants to be when it grows up. It has begun borrowing from other games like Rust but sometimes without offering any new twist on the ideas. It lacks a community. Remember when I said it was dead? Most players have left until things settle down. No one is bothering to write guides etc. when everything changes in short order. Long time players are split between one group that wants it to be more and another that tells them to shut up and let the Devs work. The Devs have apparently said they have made the decision not to try to rebuild the player base at this time and work on the game mechanics instead. This is a terrible mistake and might really mean they do not know how to bring them back. It has meant that the two remaining camps are now just an echo chamber and it is hard for new ideas to emerge from the community which to me is one of the major benefits of early access.,Rust

My father said to me ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't ever put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 23 I have never touched a cigarette. I must say I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway.",Rust

2016-07-14,0,0,219,True,Recommended,Rust is not a game for the faint of heart. I deeply recommend it as long as you don't get too attached to things. The whole game is about starting with nothing and being able to return to that state at any time. Survive at any cost. Clans will kill you. Get friends. No friends? Hide. Learn to hide well. Just remember when you want to blow up your computer out of rage it's just a game.,Rust

2016-08-08,1,1,346,True,Recommended,Oh Rust what to say about rust. Other than the entire community being total s it is very fun. When sombody isn't greifing you're base or trying to chase you with a rock the game actuall proves to be quite emersive. I kinda think about it as 3D Minecraft because ur always chopping wood and mining those ore nodes so that you can build that monster base. Unfortunatly though through all of this fun of building the best base ever you log out than go to bed. The next morning you get on and join your server and to you're supprise you see that xXxSagginSwagin69xXx has killed you with a bear.prefab. Other than the completely rude and mean community that never wants to offer a helping hand Rust is a great game. I reccomend it to everybody that likes survival games and wants a little more out of them. If that community could grow up a little and not kill on sight it would make things even more interesting.,Rust

2014-01-12,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Once upon a time. There were three lost RUST players. Amoor LB and Bluekfc. They ventured throughout the woods past bears wolves and infected to get to their destination. What they thought was a small mountain but was Mt.Everest. Amoor and LB ventured from the highest point of the mountain and saw numerous supply drops come. Sidekick Bluekfc was on the sidelines to cheer them on as they went to seek a place to build shelter. Once they finally descended down from the other side of the mountain they went and searched the nearest hill for a place to stay. A mountain filled with lushes resources they settled upon the hill top where they can see anyone venturing through the land of RUST. They built there house with separate doors. They built what they needed and finally built the perfect home. Amoor and LB are now set for there adventures into the land of RUST with their trusty sidekick Bluekfc. This is the story of Amoor LB and Bluekfc as they walk into the land of the unknown.,Rust

2017-11-26,0,0,799,True,Recommended,The game is a rollercoaster of emotions all the time first second you're finding a gun in a lootbox the next you're being chased down by a chicken trying to kill you.. but at the end of the day I always find myself coming back to this game. It consumes your life and you constantly think about all the things you need to do when you get back on gathering resources going blueprint hunting etc. Just for the sweet taste of victory when you blow up the neighboring base and get all of their loot. Or the opposite happens and you rage quit until the next wipe.,Rust

2016-04-20,0,0,166,True,Recommended,"Rust. A game where naked people stone you to death. A game where horses and stags can run right up a vertical cliff and bears wolves chickens and boars run around in little circles. A game that has barely changed in 10 months. Where to begin?Pros Fun Community Support (Mods and the like) Steam Hemp has made getting tools and weapons SO much easier without having to chase a horse over 500m just to get cloth Game is great to play with friends Game is great to make friends depending on how you play and what servers you play on The game has a long life span especially for an alpha in ""early"" development.Cons Broken AI Game has barely changed in 10 months Game has been out since 2013 yet still claims to be an early access General Community Sucks Feet stick out of buildings STILL Storage boxes still stick out of buildings (Last time I tried) Physical Keys (in game keys) are broken in the sense that if you have more than one they both lose their key abilities and they become a waste of wood Vanilla resource gathering is horrible Paper maps act like keys in the sense that if you put more than 1 in your inventory they all break (lose their data) Devs add experimental things before they are finished (Too Hot 40* C in a desert. 0 to 40 instantly huh? Hyper realistic and it doesn't do anything gameplay wise. At least from what I can tell it doesn't hinder teleporting) ""Too Cold"" happens everywhere there isn't sand on the ground super annoying. I don't want to have to build and heat up a fire just because it looks a *little* chilly outside if that. On the snow this would make much more sense. Crouching down to mine nodes is annoying Mining recoil (screen looking up while chopping/mining) is really irritating. Maybe for certain tools like the salvaged ones it makes sense but for the full metal tools it makes no sense Forced Wipes. Why? It would be amazing if you had a Minecraft Launcher system in place where you can set up a server for any version and the launcher can launch Rust in any version Rust Launcher is not necessary. Put those graphical settings in game Loading Times are awful Optimization is horrible but it's getting better Graphics look like a dog's and are non existant at the lowest settings. It's like 1 large pixel with the same bland color over and over at those settings. Don't test it you'll be scarred for lifeI wish that the devs could give the building system a major overhaul. I'm talking near Halo Reach Forge World level building but all in a smooth easy to use and fitting to the game system. If you could custom fit pieces of wood and stone to areas it would make building incredible. Imagine the type of homes you could see instead of honeycomb here 2 doors there square here round there etc. If you're thinking about getting this game think about it some more. If you have friends who actively play the game talk with them. The game is much better with friends so if you have any to play with it's recommended. I recommend this game only to those who are truly interested in these types of games because that's just about all this game can appeal to really.Final score (IMO) 5/10The game definitely has its faults but they can be looked over if you play with friends. The game's still in development but it's being very slow at least in these past 10 months.",Rust

2018-01-02,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,Their is many things wrong about this game. One building is if you want to destroy a wall its essintially impossible and if you misplace an object oh well that object is gone. If you lost your keys from someone and you are trapped in your house with no resources welp you just have to break a wall to get out. Also the community is . I was about done with this game so i decided how about i give my house to someone if they did not kill me but no they just would rather kill someone who has nothing than go to a house with guns turrents chests full of loot and food. Also if you want to make a team that probably wont happen because 99% of the people their would kill you immediatly even if you have no loot at all. Its more of a deathmatch than a survival game. Also this game has been out for five ing years and its still alpha wtf. Oh and also if you dont want to play a deathmatch game and play a singleplayer rust well basically thats since the only enemys are bears and wolves which dont really harm you if you have a sleeping bag nearby. This game would be so good if people dont try to instantly kill you everytime you see them. When I play a survival game I want a game were people try to make friends and work together not just player on their computer killing eachother for absolutly no reason. Overall the game is great without the people and the building part but since the game is basically a multiplayer game its because of the community.,Rust

Although I'm not experienced with survival/crafting games I follow many YouTubers who are experienced and watched over 100+ hrs of playthroughs. So first things first I chop down my first tree to make a single paper which I will make it into a map. Then I proceed to chop 10 15 more trees to finaly come across a stone vein. I mine the surrounding stone veins aswell and then start looking for a nice cozy place to set up my first base. At that point I had around 6 7k wood and 8k stone which was more than enough for me to set up a 2x2x2 base with all the fancy window shutters and all. I was the happiest man on that server in the mornings I picked mushrooms and hunted. Through afternoon I mostly mined stone iron sulfur and refined them at night. On my 3rd in game day on the server I heard a really loud noise coming from the havens. As I look up I see a huge box deploying its 'chutes and falling. I do the math and realize that it just might land right on top of my house. So I get inside my house and wait for the box to drop. Then I start hearing footsteps followed by gunshots and screams of agony. As I look out from my window I see Hans equippinng ze flammenwerfer roasting anyone that gets in his way. The Box finally lands with a thump on my ceiling.

So far i have been banned from one server just for saying ""this server isnt like the name"" it was suppose to be noob friendly yet no one was friendly another server i left the admin kept switching it from day to night at least 30 times that i counted so i left that server C4 is way to easy to get for a few ppl on most servers players glitch the air drops to right in front of their house i left another because the last time we got raided the ppl who raided put spike walls wood walls barricades in front of the door so I couldnt get out. then they blocked off the top floor i had just almost completed the only way as as far as is to blow the wall up with c4 but it takes multiple charges to blow it up and i hadnt had any luck finding more then 1 c4 so i would have had to start bulding a whole new one starting from scratch so i switched servers again i joined a non craftable c4 server and so far it has been ok but thats not saying anything. all in all at the moment this game isnt really worth buying atm wait till it comes out officially. also if your an admins friend u can do whatever you want with no consequences also i left another server cause the chinese kept hacking that server so theirs that problem as well.

So the reason why i am giving a bad review is this the fact that each update i experienced is that it breaks the game more than make a stable patch i do appreciate the fact they tried to port it to a newer engine but it did not work out too well i just prefer they stop listning to the community on advice what would make the game ""better"" it just makes it worse mostly because majority of the community is well lets just say ""Bright"" in their own way the problem is the game is boring after a while even when you do play on your own it just gets really boring eventually you just go F this i'm falling asleep on this game the only thing is really interesting in this game is pvp but even that is boring because majority you will see someone trying to hide aimbot wall hack and eveninfinite health and radation it's pretty pathetic really.But you also need to know that when you get any performance issues not because your hardware is crap it simply put the game is not optimized and that is understandable because it early accesss i just see that the main issue with the game it self is all you do is kill animals and build a shelter and fall asleep due to boredom it be fun if *insert idea of my own* if the game had more veriety of stuff to do in this game but sadly there is nothing of the sort it mainly pvp but the npcs are stupid as well they can chace you all the way across the map till someone kills it just to kill you to get your ""ROCK"" to get their rocks off at the fact they killed someone who has nothing in a way i sense that the makers of this game is trying to figure out what to do with rust because they getting forums of lil kids saying they want the old rust back because it what they ""paid"" for and all honesty it's just stupidi ain't going to tell them how to make the game better and what would make it great because simply put it be my idea and they take all the credit for it simple as it is like this review this game is stalemate mode at the time being as far as i seen.Now for everyones favorite part THE COMMUNITY OH MY GOD MOM GET THE CAM GET THE CAM OH MY GAWD YOU PRO MLG YOU CAN HACK THIS GAME OH MUR HAWD AD HADG.........................yeah the intelligence is low in this community what you expect?I expected better but i guess the new generation makes me cringe for humanity's hope in survival they more likely to kill each other to show off their D prestiege and ego boost because lets face it they all been bullied before but they need to learn a valuable lesson they can learn to make friends but noo they decide to go I'm to pro for this and they go to school the next day to get alienated point being they try to be the biggest troll ever but they have not learn the lesson yet and will never properly troll the primary part is everyone is out to be the best sure simple riverly if like these tower folks GAWT ALL THESE RESOURCES LETS RAID IT AND CAUSE A WAR &lt That is what i approve some of you going right now I was elected to play not to read. But get this when you start in this game you more likely to find that soon as you wake up you gather enough just for a shelter just to realise you had a stalker with all decked out weapons going I'LL DUEL UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU And pretty much yeah you dead because once you do avoid that one you go up to the next level is this you end up get the shelter just to find you been raided for wood and sulpher thats it and then a third comes and uses a shot gun against your shack you tell them countless times you have no weapons or anything they come in and go you got owned noob I recall the community being ""bright"" but really i just leave rocks in a suggestive form that will make them go well i'll take it anyway wich will explain why they are anti social and insecure about them selfs point being everyone forgot what the game was and went DEATHMATCH instead of team work or shall i call it the bully simulator for people who can't grow up D So anyway the point being is this community is just a bunch of try hard kids that accuse you of hacking if you best them then the older generation are just braindead due to the infestation they got from rust and even then you more likely to work to gether with someone older if you can nurse their brain back to ""normal"" they will more likely to work with you than against you but sadly if they have a small ""Package"" as stated they try prove the D prestige but don't have it you are lucky to get a good intelligent player on this game sure everyone tries to troll but they don't get is it is very predictable and to the point that the players that try to have fun get bored really easily like me and just play other games and go.Well either R Tard simulator or Bully simulator i just bought i'll come back later when they have a stable build ""plays finished or unfinished games that have more than just killing each other in it"" simply put the community should just buy a death match game like unreal tournament i like to see how well they do in that but damn i bet they can't do multi tasking on controls and use glitches to avoid getting killed and when GTAV comes the kids be like OH MUR GURD I CANT RUN THIS NEGETIVE REVIEW IT WONT URN URN MUR LAPTOP SINGLE CORE NO GPU 2GB. Point in turn to avoid majority of kids and slack jaw retard sorry poor excuse of community of rust just get a gaming rig and play a very skilled game that requires high end pc as well as skill then they will go this sucks and go back to simple primitive rust. and yes ladies and gentlemen i have tried communicating with rust community the majority of it but i feel like my braincells committing suicide each reply i see calling people virgin nerds when they them selfs don't know what the peepee is for in short.TL DR devs don't know what to do with the game they want votes from a community that want to go backwards on progress and community is just yeah.......""SPECIAL""",Rust

2017-11-17,1,1,626,True,Not Recommended,Frankly this game is a complete waste of time. I got into it from watching some youtube videos about it. Seemed challenging. Building + Shooter. It is a really cool concept for a game. Unfortunately there is a tremendous amount of grinding involved to get anything(8 16 hours for basic tools weapons and a tiny base/room which will be raided and looted as soon as you log off) and all progress is lost in mere seconds. After 40 hours you may have a chance to use decent armor or even a good gun at which point you will turn a corner and instantly die and lose everything. The good guns are way too overpowered and everything else is just garbage. The game consists of two types of players The 14 year olds with 2000+ hours invested who run around in groups and instantly kill and steal and noobs who have nothing because they keep getting griefed by the 14 year olds. I've never played a game this grindy with zero sense of satisfaction. Maybe It's because I'm not an and I don't like to grief people. Take my advice and spend your time elsewhere. I only wish I had realized this sooner and I would be getting a refund.,Rust

People who have played the ""new rust"" a few months ago like me may have hated it now it is a completely different game. Actually like many other people I have my own awesome story.I was in the process of building my base and I have some very crude walls up that can be destroyed with a few hit of anything. That is when I hear footseps it is night time so I see the shadow of the guy outside. Suddenly he bursts inside with a spear I am waiting for him and attack him with my own spear. We trade blows and I get killed. Luckily I had put down a sleeping bag and as he is looting all my smelted metal from th furnace I respawn at it. Me being completeley naked now I come at him swinging with my trusty rock he take me down again but I am not dead. I am lying on the floor wounded with only a small chance of recovery and a large chance of death. Yet he never did finish me off and with a remaining 5/100 hp I attack him with my torch (I had dropped my rock) and to my reliefe he is finally dead I recover all my stuff and his too al while quickly securing my base and upgrading it in case he or someother people decided to pay me a visit. I have a few more stories like this to tell some coming from the same day however you probably ge the point. )I rate 9/10 for the reason that sometimes this game gets me really off with the morons who will KoS you.

2013-12-25,0,0,914,True,Recommended,At the time this review was written the game was in alpha so all technical hiccups aside this game is going places. EDIT 10/2/2015I have played this game (as vaguely stated above) since a very early release of it on steam. Even then it was solid. As of right now I would like to say a few things that makes this game stand out. 1. The Dev team. It is so relieving after scowering the webs for games to play to come back to this game. The Dev team not only CARES but seems to be extremely passionate dedicated and not to mention talented. Everything I have seen come out of this team has been gold. Anything that fell short was promptly removed and brought back with a much more apealing 2.0 version. They take the time to make things the way they should be and take NO t. It is teams like this that deserve the money they make off of their games. 2. The atmosphere. Just the general feeling of the game. It feels like you can play it either very laid back or binge. Now I will say that survival games tend to attract the type of crowd that doesn't appeal to everyone out there. Plainly stated most of you guys are total when you play the game. But it's the ones you run in to that ARE NOT that make the game 10x worth it. The community is decent as well. You can get a lot of support through the website if need be. 3. Attention to detail. The graphics in this for a $20 game are phenominal. It just looks nice. Most of your textures and such look fairly good and like I said before anything that falls short is brought back with a better version later. So looking back seeing how far this game has come I can see it being an amazing official release for the people over at Facepunch. When/if the game comes out of alpha it will attract an even larger following. I have confidence that these guys will bring to the table a type of survival game innovation that we haven't seen since the dawn of Minecraft.,Rust

I first played this game in 2014 and it was filled with hackers so Ieft it alone. I recently heard the hacking problem was fixed so I decided to give it another go. My time was spent dying over and over and over and over and over and over to players(almost always in groups of two or more) who were more established and had guns and other weapons. It was impossible for me by myself to go into any server and live successfully for more then 25 minutes. Not once was I killed by the environment (wolves bears etc.). Now i dont blame the players because given the chance humans are all worthless scummy pieces of garbage who enjoy watching others suffer and this genre of games is designed to bring that out in people.This game seems to feature a pretty awesome build side but I was unable to explore it.

2017-05-14,0,0,3334,False,Recommended,Rust is a survival game all about killing people farming resources and breaking your way into peoples bases. Food water and the environment aren't very hard to deal with. You can play the game however you choose to. You can kill others for what you need or grind for it yourself. There is a lot of grind in this game depending on how lucky you get. This game is much easier and more enjoyable for most people when you play with friends. If you play this game alone its basically playing it on hardmode. Don't expect people to be friendly just because they say they are.If you have hopes of playing on any server that has more than 10 people you need to learn how to use the weapons most importantly the bow.Every servers map is randomly generated so every new server you join there will be something new to explore.Cheaters do exist on this game. However they are only common on official servers (except for rustafied). Whatever you do don't play on those servers. The developers for this game are some of the best developers on the face of the earth. They update the game WEEKLY with new and fresh content. They seem to be truely passionate about this game.After 2000+ hours of gameplay I can say that this game is the best $20 I have ever spent. Not even a cheap hooker can give you this much fun.You will die and lose everything you worked for. But that just means you get to restart and have fun doing it all over again.,Rust

Im not a huge fan of alphas but i would say this one definatly has some promise.please do note that the community is full of immature bandits who love nothing more then to claim to be friendly and then kill you when you dont expect it. If you lived through early war z (infestation survivor stories) days then you will know exactly what im talking about. also people just tend to wait until your off the servers then raid your house and take all your stuff this is kinda neat at first but then 7th time that you have rebuilt and made your base super hard to get into and someone still takes your stuff it gets annoying. I honestly was a huge fan of this game when it started but the douchey comuninity has ruined it like every other promissing game (note to self man kind in its truest rawest form are a bunch of a holes who will kill you just for your torch) i have switched my recomendation from a yes to a no simply for the community more effort needs to be put into the game to force people work together before i will give it back its thumbs up.,Rust

With that hatchet you can then create a shed which turns into a cabin which turns into a mansion. Then you get greedy.

The ones who usually have the advantage are the ones who enter as early as possible when a wipe happens.The map is uneven in relation to resources you will not find cloth in snow areas unless you bring some from the other areas of the map.Entering water during night time will simply finish your character.All this game is is a spawn simulator with who can arrive on time first.,Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,59,True,Recommended,So I've had this game for like 2 days and i have 18+ hours on it already. In my opinion... If you got DayZ and didn't get to have much fun with it wether it be because of being killed by other players or by zombies before you could even get any weapon to protect yourself with. Rust has just been so much fun. Resources are normally around everywhere but it can take a while to find things like actual guns but I was lucky enough to run across someone else's things and picked up some guns and a lot of ammo. So I had a pretty good start. I eventually met up with my friends and we have a group of about 8 9 people and we've established ourselves a couple nice fortresses we've gone on some expeditions finding resources hunting people down going on search parties for air drops and the occasional negotiation with other players in the game. Overall this game can either be pretty fun or boring by yourself depending on how you like your games but with friends you just can't go wrong with this game. There's strength in numbers.I completely recommend this game to anyone who likes survival/exploration/building/first person shooters because this is everything jam packed into one and its great. 10/10 Would raid again.P.S. Forgot to put the little flaws that you will find here and there like the noclip bears that hack through small hills to maul your toes as well as me only trying out one server which is where my friends are so I'm pretty sure not every server will be as pleasant as ours but check out the server im in the admin is really nice and wants more people in!,Rust

2017-05-05,2,1,45,True,Not Recommended,Fun game BUT if you dont have friends dont bother playing this game. Playing it solo will make you want to go postal on someone getting gang by 3 people is great even better when they are 12 years old and ices the cake when they camp you over and over and call you all sorts of colorful names. Waste of 20$ for me hope it works out for other people.,Rust

His steam account is about as old as steam itself and has never been suspected of cheating once or vac banned ever. Payed for an unfinished game and then gets perma banned for no reason.

The Rust Legacy (Old Rust) Was good if you played it with other people but the New Rust is terrible.

2016-06-30,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Well here is a good lesson in Capitalism. The people with the most just go around killing your characters just as you're beginning to get anywhere in the game then they loot your corpse for all the items you spent the first hour collecting and you're right back at the start with nothing... A truly terrible game for anyone new. Going to request a refund.,Rust
2016-06-01,0,0,387,True,Recommended,Im going to be really honest with rust...Unless you have a tank PC DO NOT BUY IT you cannot run it otherwise BUY IT Edit Rust is a fantastic survival game which does require a fair amount of computing power to run in CPU and GPU terms .However it isn't too taxing an adequate gaming PC or even entry level could probably run this game. Personally even with a compelling bottleneck from the CPU I still manage anywhere from 40 100 with this game at maximum settings can even play it at 1440p and 3840 x 2160 above 30fps! For early access still (very controversial) I'd say it's not too badly optimized.The gameplay itself is unique in its own way. It gives its own twist on the survival genre and offers a vast PVP environment with a variety of unqie weapons some with advanced physics (the RPG). This makes the player need to adapt and learn a new skill to use particular weapons something which other games don't include. Furthermore the graphics in this game are not terrible. The textures are low resolution however the sky clouds and lighting effects are second to none. They're obviously not the best but they make this game look amazing! The rise of the purple / red sun before it has fully rose up is sublime! Overall Gameplay 9/10 Graphics 7/10 PVP 8/10,Rust

2017-11-23,0,0,264,True,Recommended,Look. Rust is far from perferct. Like most games it has it's flaws. The fact is though the devs are constantly working on this game and they really listen to the players. On top of that the community is varied and wild (often in the best kind of ways). This game brings freedom choice and a wildly good time especially if you have a couple of buddies to mess around with. It's even worth it to take a crack at creating your own server. Take it from me if you haven't played rust... grab some buddies or dive in solo and try this game. The only review that matters is your own.,Rust

2016-12-08,1,1,101,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun at first but then it's just a cycle of building raiding. and getting raided. They really don't do much in terms of game changing updates. They've upgraded visuals and they've added new guns constantly but it's the same game with the same cycle and after a few times of having to restart and do the same thing over and over it's not fun anymore. You can play this game for 10 hours and you would have experienced more than enough of what the game has to offer.

2016-08-23,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,At the time of writing this the game relies on EAC (EasyAntiCheat) which seems to be the cause of incompability issues with specific items of hardware. Upon starting the game and completing the initialisation of EAC seemingly random inputs started to happen making any interaction with either the game or any other program impossible until the launcher is force closed. If your hardware supports input macros you might want to check for issues with EAC before buying. Luckily there were other games in the bundle I got this with.,Rust

2014-01-27,0,0,59,True,Recommended,"All I can say great game. First off this game is basically a simulation of what it would be like if you were put out in the middle of nowhere. Except you have no clothes material or food. All you get is a rock. And add zombies just to make things interesting. Preferably I like to join smaller medium sized servers (15 20 people) just because the risk of dying from another player is low. In my first three runs at the game I was killed from falling off a cliff getting mauled by a wolf and eaten by a zombie. After that I learned to avoid these vicious natural disasters but soon I died from hunger as I could not catch a deer. However on my 5th try at the game I successful killed my first animal built a shelter and fire and began harvesting material at an exponential rate. Now many hours in the bears and wolfs run away from me. The zombies flee to the radiation zones to avoid me. And heights? Well they still killed me once more. But besides that I feel like a man of the wild. There was a day and age when I murdered anyone I saw on sight. But I soon realized that Rust was more than slaughtering your fellow mates. Instead of murdering them I helped them. I gave them wood shelter fire food. And behold they gave me stuff back too. In fact I got my first m4 from a guy that I met down the road. I lived peacefully in the mountains harvesting wood and metal to make my skytower. I had suffiicient food and fire to last for days. I had shotguns machine guns pistols axes and explosive charges all at the ready. Why? I feared a dreadful day would come and those in the wild would invade my home.And I was right.It was a calm afternoon when the attacks first took place. Out in the fields fifty or sixty yards from my front barricade a group of 3 men were roaming. I put out my fire too late. They had noticed the smoke and flames and ventured up to the guarding barrier. ""What do you want!?"" I yelled down to them overlooking them from the second story of my building. They did not respond. Instead they began climbing the rocks to the side of the barrier and within ten seconds they were over the wall. They ventured up to the wooden spikes that protruded outward and hurt anyone that touched them. ""Please go away!"" I told them but they insisted on moving foward. Against my knowledge one of them held an F1 Grenade and BOOM! my spiked barrier was done with. I did not hesitate to shoot. As soon as the second barrier was cleared I whipped out my m4 and blasted away. Like ants the three invaders scattered behind whatever they could find. They were out of sight. Unknowingly they snuck behind my house to the back enterance the only door in my house made of wood not metal. Luckily I was only on the second floor and heard them axing away at my door. I sprinted downstairs and took out my shotgun and perched myself right on the otherside of the door. E that is the button to open the door. As soon as I pushed E I fired my shotgun rounds. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! It only took four shots to kill the threesome. I quickly rebuilt the door out of metal and then went on the offensive.Their camp was only a few clicks south of my house and by late morning I had arrived. I had struck at the perfect time. It appeared as if the threesome were offline. With my superior pick axe I mowed down their front door. Like the grinch I stole everything they had to offer (most of it was stuff they had stolen from me). They had immense ammounts of metal and wood and gunpowder which would all eventually contribute to the war effort. As quickly as I had raided their house I was quicker to leave. Fleeing back to my house to make the nesscarry defenses. I knew they would come back. A few hours later around late afternoon the party game back to attack. I had not had the neccessary time nor resources to restablish my front barrier but I had managed to fix my spiked wall. Not having a grenade the three person party sought another way to the enterance of my house. Unable to find an alternate route they were forced to change there approach. Instead of going around the barrier why not go over? Behold they built a small ramp that they could get high enough to jump over the spikes. Because of the spike's nature the ramp and jump were a one way trip. Foolish boys I thought as they sprinted toward my front door. I would be able to quickly gun them down especially with the extra ammunition from the earlier raid. My predicitions were correct. My m4 tore down two of them relatively quickly and the third barely reached the door when I shot him in the head. Another successful battle. I went outside to harvest their goods and recover all resources from their dead bodies. Afterward I went back inside and fell asleep feeling rather safe tonight. Boy was I wrong.I had made a serious mistake. A tragic one too. How can a man be so stupid so that he forgets to lock his doors. Yes while I was offline for a bit the threesome came back to find a rather pleasant surprise. ALL THE DOORS TO MY HOUSE HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN! They called it the raid of the century taking everything I had to offer. My weapons gone. My wood and metal gone. My food gone. My rare armor gone. The next morning I nearly threw my computer out the window. But behold I may have lost the battle but not the war. And so I continued to play and rebuild all I knew and loved. That is where we are today. I seek revenge on the house that stole from mine. Wish me luck.",Rust

2018-02-23,0,0,2361,False,Recommended,"Rust. Where do I even begin. For being a ""3/10"" game according to some reviewers it is an incredible game.Rust is a survival based game where you do whatever it takes to make it to the top of the food chain. With that being said you need to be able to betray kill on sight go deep and everything inbetween. All skills can be brought to the table when it comes to playing Rust.Important things to note are that you need to stay resilient you can't be afraid to die and hit that respawn button to go out and try again you can be afraid to lose what you have if you don't use your guns or best loot you can't progress simple as that. With time comes experience and with experience comes skill. This is a very skill based game with a small mixture of luck. You need to have quick wits to make it to the top of your server.Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who asked about it. It is a great experience and I have enjoyed every single hour I've put into learning the game because no matter how much time you have you can always learn something new stay humble you never know what someone can teach you.",Rust

Existen varias formas de vida ademas de otros jugadores por el momento se pueden encontrar Zombies Lobos Osos Ciervos y Chanchos B.Este juego es uno de los pocos en los que vas a sentir adrenalina al ir a buscar recursos o simplemente al abandonar tu zona ya que nunca sabes quien puede estar rondando por ahi y peor si esta armado y listo para matarte o simplemente ayudarte.Tengo fe en que sigan habiendo mas updates mejorando algunos bugs y fallos que se pueden encontrar en cualquier juego de fase beta.9/10 porque hay pelados en bolas.,Rust

If you lucky enough to have the game running of high settings (not potato friendly) you have an quick opportunity to admire the scenery before sprinting towards the nearest woods or stockpile of some sort to start collecting resources.This hardcore survival game has began...This game will show you no mercy both in the PVE and the PVP.If you not being shot at or having your head smashed in with a rock then you will be attacked by bears boars and wolves.You will have to manage health hydartion and hunger. Don't freeze to death in the snowy mountains or dehydrate in the desert. And watch out for those cacti at night! they pop out of nowhere...There is no tutorial in this game so it requires persistence from you to learn the basic mechanics of the game to hunt eat and build to survive. You will have to learn the hard way unfortunately and it will take you many deaths to get there.But everytime you wake up on that beach or sleeping bag and you realise what went wrong you will continue to get better. Continue to play and you will reap the benefits of knowing how to play the game.You will get raided and killed many times from other players but this is part of the game and soon enough you will be raiding and killing someone else. More than likely you will enjoy it as much as they did.If you really want to improve your game you will be googling wiki'ing and watching many youtube videos to see how to get the most out of this game.Building your base doesn't have to mean a 2X2 with a wooden door. There are many ways to build awesome strong bases and coming up with new base designs to make it harder for raiders can be really fun. There are many resources for this.Playing with friends can bring a few new elements to the game that solo play can't. Soloing has it's place in the game but with friends you can boost each other during raides carry more explosives and rockets for the raides and walk out with more loot from the raides. Playing with friends can be very fun.Don't worry Lone Wolves solo play can also be great.So learn/research the basic mechanicsDevelop those survival skillsContinue to play and improveHelp other players that need help what goes around comes around in this gameHelp a naked out once in a while I'm sure they would appreciate itGood Luck and Have FunHighly recommended,Rust

2017-08-03,0,0,287,True,Not Recommended,This game would be enjoyable if end game wasn't reached in 2 hours by a huge clan who proceeds to run around the map and destroy anyone who is trying to progress. If you find having hours of work destroyed by a clan of 10 in a matter of minutes with no counter play (in most cases) fun then rust is the game for you. Even if you run into a team of people at a similar point in terms of gear if they have a lot more players than you you usually lose even if you're way better than them. At its current state it's fun for a little bit until you realise the repetitiveness of the game and how bigger clans will always win. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at this point unless you intend to play on servers with your friends or small community servers. Or maybe huge clan wars and no lifing is your cup of tea.,Rust

You need a team unless you have a whole day to waste gathering materials and hunting by yourself while praying to your hand rock that the person with the ""end game gear"" doesn't see you as a threat and put a bullet in your head or a blade to your throat.Rust has many features which make it one of the best games I have played with my friends especially in clan wars.

Hunger is one of the major survival elements where you can just beat someone you find either dead or asleep with a rock and eat them over a fire (literally) Legacy had it to where you had to brave the radioactive wasteland while hearing gunshots and explosions either nearby or far away looking through the ruins of older civilizations or through the loot buildings hoping to find something of use.Player interaction is one of the most terrifying things you can do in the game. Majority of the time it will end with bloodshed even if you aren't a legitimate threat to the person. I have been lucky enough to find and meet some people who were willing to help those weaker than them by giving them guns and other supplies. You should not try to ""Good Samaritan"" in this game by helping someone you see dying because the community in Rust is now just a bloodshed in a heartbeat. Even if you do get saved by a random person its just so he can pull either the false security or the bandit card when he helps you get good gear just so he gains more.Raids were made too easy with the stability and decay feature since random parts of your base will despawn/break if you want to focus your life on something other than a base that will fall apart due to decay.The helicopter was an aspect added to Rust to make the PVE system more balanced by having a REAL threat given to the players with the better gear since the heli would target them unless a ""lower tier"" attacked it. Normally the helicopter arriving would just be used as an ""easy pvp"" since it will fire rockets at buildings which would outbalance the raiding even more than it should be since people could blow up half your base with a heli and raid you when the event npc decides to leave them alone.The worst aspect of Rust is the community on most (not all) servers. Some people will help you out or offer you shelter for a while if you are lucky. The most common thing that happens when you join a server is someone will join and either hack and kill everyone or you just get hunted down the minute you join by a large tribe/clan. Most of the players will constantly live in fear of everyone that moves/lives. Most of the end tier people who own the huge clans will normally have a ""kill or be killed"" view on anything but themselves. The now normal version of Rust makes killing people who just joined worth it even more since they drop food (human flesh) and bone fragments which can be used to make armor.Rust has some of the better graphics I have seen from many games making a breathtaking sight before you get a bullet between the eyes or a feast thrown before you and your clan.Don't get this review I made wrong Rust is very fun to play it can be a great experience if you can join a good community server where its a balance of raiders and friendlies. I would have to say Rust isn't worth the money due to the genociding hackers and the overkill armies that just butcher people before they even blink.",Rust

2015-01-19,0,0,178,True,Not Recommended,"Right now Rust is a giant mess in my opinion. The interface (particularly when you try to favorite a server) is broken. The new ""Play Rust"" has some neat graphics but I would much rather have the old rust be the focus. I remember reading once that they wanted to start from scratch and eliminate a lot of extra code they threw in so that it things would be easier. I wish they would have just edited legacy rather than craft this new thing and that's mainly because to me the new interfaces items crafting capabilities and other edited features are confusing. The old Rust was straight to the point interface. Anyways even the old Rust has its clear issues. The game's been in alpha for over a year now and they don't have a hell of a lot to show for it. I'd prefer if Facepunch would be quiet about how many copies they've sold and how well they're doing. Focus on what matters here a little bit. I will not recommend this game to a single soul until it is 1. Playable2. Challenging (because of the game mechanics not bugs)3. Enjoyable4.Operable in AT LEAST most aspects. It is an alpha I get it.Until then if you're deadset on this game wait until the 4 aspects I just mentioned are parts of this game.

Go around and loot for good blueprints. Fight someone here and there. Then at the end of the week your base is gone then you start over.,Rust

2014-04-02,0,0,286,True,Recommended,"It's tough to rate up I'm going to but only with the understand that this game will change things later on (it could very easily do so). My first complaint is how unbalanced it is you play long enough get a gun you're automatically more powerful than everyone in existence well the one's that don't have guns anyway. My second complaint is the community horrible and terrible community there are a few good people but the bad ones massively and I mean massively outweigh the good. It's in alpha so unless you have a few dollars to throw away I would suggest waiting until it's more polished. But if you wanna toss some money at the game and help with development have a few friends maybe and don't mind how unbalanced it is and how the community can curently abuse the system to abuse new players then go for it. Now after all this you might ask why am I giving this a good rating? Well because all in all it's a great game communities bad games in alpha so it's not perfect but the caveman style art the graphics the unique touches the devs put into it the beautiful lighting all of that deserves a thumbs up. But remember just because I rated it up doesn't mean it's ready for purchase and it doesn't necessarily mean it isn't I'm going to leave that decision up to you based on the facts I provided you with.Edit On second thought not sure I can upvote this right now it'll probably change in the future when the games more developed. Reasons stated above.Update 1 Recently tested out the 'new' Rust. Still the same mostly graphics changed took a big step back because they needed to rebuild the game and honestly the ""rebuilt"" version runs far less for me than the original supposedly ""broken"" version. Ironically the broken version was the most stable imagine that? Anyway until this changes not recommended. Find another game until this one is playable trust me and you'll thank me later.Update 2 Game is still in some aspects. But to be entirely fair the game is a lot better. The devs clearly busted their on this and that's why I think it deserves my up vote and so I changed my vote from down to up. Good job devs!",Rust

2014-10-13,0,0,79,True,Recommended,"Such gathering much dongers so naked 10/10 good game. You spawn completely naked and only have a stone torches med kit. Sometimes you meet other players that tell you in voice chat that you got a nice and then they shoot you in the face. This will be one hell of a game. With all the upcoming new contents and features it'll sure be a masterpiece. Highly recommend for people who are searching for a survival game in the wilderness. You have a good friend or maybe 2 3 who would like this too? Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together it's much more fun. The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain but with friends you can easily build things up. If you are more the ""solo survivalist"" no problem! Search for a hidden place maybe behind some big or small mountains where it s unlikely that someone in the next days will come. Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house. Let s go hunting! First for animals then for humans. Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun. Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself!

2015-11-15,1,1,43,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is fantastic and includes constant updates by devs. The game offers many hours of gameplay and many exciting features. Unfortunately after the recent updates the game is WILDY too demanding in terms of hardware and is very poorly optimized. You can play GTA V pretty smoothly with a GTX 660 but this game is unbelievably laggy if you don't have at least a 980 and that just simply doesn't make sense. If they make a very strong effort to optimize the game it will be better but until they do I am not coming back to it.,Rust

But one day i wake up and find myself trapped in a metal box between my 2 doors. There were code locks on the doors that i never placed. I couldnt open my doors. Building privliges were revoked. Being on a modded server I was able to teleport out and walked for 20min back to my base only to see my friends and I town destroyed. They were killed and their bases demolished. But I was left alive with my base. I telported back into my base and broke down the door using only bone clubs. I find my stuff almost untouched. I search around my base. I find someone sleeping on the 2nd floor. His name was Toast. I looted him and killed him with his own Long Sword. His bed was named Hijacked Base. He kept me as a pet. He should have killed me in my sleep.10/10 would take it personal again,Rust

2016-10-01,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,This is not a good game. I'm going to get that out of the way at the start. I highly suggest against buying this game. I usually enjoy survival games but this one is not good. Pros * Survival game. I usually enjoy them. Cutting trees mining rocks building a house murdering animals.* Runs well. 70fps on high settings with GTX970 8gb Ram i5 4460 on a HDD.Cons * Awful community. I've been killed on sight while wearing nothing a couple minutes from my spawn maybe 3/4 spawns. I've had one person help me then I logged out and logged in an hour later to see I've lost everything.* Non existant balancing. You spawn in about 1/6th food and water and half health. This means a bow spear sword and machete will one shot you. You have no chance against somebody with any of these. If somebody has one and you don't you lose.* If you get down to low health (5 I think) you get wounded. You can't do anything. You're just stuck until someone heals you or kills you.* Cloth which you need a lot of in the early game is very difficult to find. You have to find marijuana plants which are pretty rare or kill animals. I didn't have pants until I had a decent sized house about 4 hours into playing.* There are no animals. I've killed 4 wolves 3 boars and a handful of deer in my 5 hours. That 5 hours was mostly spent hunting.* If you throw a spear and pick it up it doesn't go in your action bar. It goes in your inventory. This means you have to go into your inventory and move the spear to your action bar if you want to use it. Just annoying.* Voice chat is a bit odd. You have to hold it for a second before it starts picking up your voice. It always cuts off the beginning of what I say.Overall I give it a 3/10,Rust

You realize that is some of the only things people play rust for. Now after all these hours of playing and development has changed over the years. This is my final conclusion....Rust sucks. Not only does it fail to develope anything without some kind of complaint from the community such as nerfing and buffing. The blueprint system the xp system now were stuck with the component system which is absolutely horrible. Another complaint is how there is no stamina in the game how can i run infinently from a player trying to hit me with a mace is that really fair? Jumping about and having the so fit super agile body that you can jump around spin and run around a oppenent.

2016-05-18,0,0,161,True,Recommended,Surprisingly good!I bought this game with fairly low expectations All these new early access survival crafting PvP games seem buggy half finished and feature lagging. They were all the same games to me. The graphics are decent but so poorly optimized that even a good mid high end PC suffers massive FPS drops the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring after a few hours and combat is more or less off the table as glitches and lag makes it nearly impossible to enjoy.Even though the game has been out a few years now I recently began to hear positive things about Rust in particular and suddenly started seeing friends playing it. So why not give it a go to at least give the old preconceptions a solid test. Luckily Steam offers a full refund within two weeks of the purchase and as long as you haven't played the game for more than 2 hours so why the hell not try it out?Expecting to play it for two hours to then return it I booted it up found a somewhat random official server with a decent ping and then began to mess around with the graphics settings for an hour trying to optimize it as much as humanly possible. I then played it... And played... And played... And suddenly 6 hours had gone by eliminating my chance of a potential refund. Still with a hint of scepticism and a pinch of regret I then decided to find a proper server to start on for real (wasn't to happy about the one I initially found). I then stumbled upon a guy on the Steam forums who sought players for his new modded server. He seemed pretty cool and genuinely quite friendly so I gave it a go. Fast forward 2 5 weeks (and 92 hours of game time) I am now an admin on this server that has gone from 2 players to about 50 since I joined and I'm ing loving it! The game is fine and has somewhat busted my negative assumptions about it but what really keeps me going is the awesome community we have managed to establish. I log on for the gameplay but I stay for the social aspect. I only just started playing a few weeks ago I have no idea how the game was before then but NOW it runs smoothly on my 3 year old mid high end PC. Combat works not too laggy or glitchy. Gameplay is fairly varied and rewarding. The attention to detail is impressive considering the scale of the game. The game is generally quite intuitive (especially crafting and building) yet elaborate. And the developers seem active and occasionally adds some new features and/or bugfixes even within the short period of time I have played.I really like it. And granted my low expectations from the start I'm very pleasantly surprised about how good it actually is. I haven't really tried any other games that shares the same genres as this but one thing I can say is I definitely recommend Rust. 8/10,Rust

2016-05-19,1,1,375,True,Recommended,Great game. People that bi*tch about the community are just that bit*ches. Never played an official server. I swiftly found a server (MSS Noob Friendly) that was easy to make friends but still had action. You don't need your friends to play this game you can find them in game but be hesitant. It's updated very often bi weekly I think. Always adding new cool sh*it/better game play. Never played Rust Legacy and don't care guns are more fun anyway. Getting raided/dying sucks but thats the game. You can literally spend 3 hours gathering crap to start up a home and BAM wolf runs up and mauls your sorry butt. But don't let that lower morale once you get the hang of it you'll be slugging 5.56 ammo and lettin em bounce around in the bears/wolves heads. Building is very simple and satisfying. You can build your base how you want but you'll learn the hard way that you need to honeycomb that fuc*ker up. Not much to the inside of your base in terms of home decor besides paintings/signs but you need most of the room that isn't honeycomb for boxes anyways. (Look up noob videos)PVP is intense and very amusing. Fire fights can and will get INTENSE. Some players try to avoid PVP at all cost. When you die/are getting raided depending on how well you've got yourself going you will feel the heat. It's cool and realistic how you can hear gun fire from pretty far away depending on the type of weapon being fired. You'll know if someones knocking on your door with a MG42 that fuc*ker is loud. You know when someone is getting raided in your area because you WILL hear the explosives going off. Thats when its safe to assume somone is most likely getting r ped and or murdered and probably eaten. Playing on a server that wipes monthly worked well. I would go hard and if I got fu*cked or fuc*ked over I wait until next wipe to start fresh. No big deal. Overall have had fun with this game its really promising. I can see myself continuing to come back to it on and off in the future. It's a bang for the buck for sure.,Rust

2016-07-27,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"I've installed the game started it logged into first server looked around trying to figure out what to do...After a minute or so I've discovered how to open up inventory there I've found out that my character is butt naked female. This is so triggering to me as a snowflake kin this is to me like someone branding me with a branding iron.0/10 unplayable.Okay... I'll be serious I've had this in my library for some time now and I've finally decided to try it out. After I've logged into the game for the first time I've noticed something. The hand animation and model felt really weird and after couple minutes I've find out that my character is female so that might've been a reason for my brain putting it into uncanny valley or it was just the weird animation not sure... still makes it hard/weird/odd... to play this game for me.Why doesn't wooden hammer do any damage? I've accidentally hit my finger with hammer while gardening couple times in past and it does causes damage. Hitting something with wooden hammer should cause it damage. But in Rust it doesn't.Since the game doesn't provide any guide at the start I've went in with a minecraft ish mindset bashing trees with a rock worked bashing rocks with a rock worked but bashing animals with rock for food didn't worked too well and I got killed.Since I wasn't able to gather any food from plants and the hunger bar was getting too low I gave up on this.I don't know if it's my experience from other games or ""instinct"" but this game just didn't ticked with me.Outside of this I've found it odd that the game is having big frame rate drops at times for me on 1080p running at the ""Fantastic"" Graphics Quality settings since the actual graphics and physics don't seem to be that complex. I'm running i7 6700 with GTX 970 ( 1528MhZ) and 16GB of RAM. During those times the gpu usage just goes down and the cpu usage stays as it was when there weren't issues present so my guess is just a poor optimalization of loading new stuff in.",Rust
2016-07-26,0,0,476,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Rust.Absolutely fun! you get to claim your own little peice of land and build your own house/base. The new xp system is great. I think it needs improvment but i like it a lot more than i did the blueprint system that i got to play for a short while. When you start out with a rock and a torch naked on a beach I didn't know what to do. i was taught the basics and got comfortable with everything. my first pvp fight my heart was pounding in my chest. needless to say i lost but it was still a good experience. Fun game would recommend it highly.Some issues i've noticed. Decay can be really painfull.If you have all the time in the world to play the game you can become king of the hill. If not you get by as best you can.Team based game solo is tough.,Rust

Rust is constantly changing for the better devs actively listen to the community and they aren't afraid to try new things. It is early access the game will get broken we are play testing it and it gets fixed/new content is added to balance.

2016-08-03,0,0,91,True,Not Recommended,"I've bought this game however a few days before June the game stopped working. It'll hang on ""Receiving Data"" and you cannot load into a map at all. I'm already got a thread going on with multiple users experiencing the same thing. We've tried everything possible at our ends to fix this and we've even contacted the developers. However they do not care at all. They give us the same method to try but it does not work and when you reply to them explaining how their idea did not solve the problem they will not answer you anymore. This probably has been around for a very long time I've opened a ticket on the 2nd of June and a week later sometimes on the 9th they gave us this ""good for nothing"" solution. It's been 2 months and still haven't heard back from them. The game is unplayable and therefore I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone because once you pay there' s good chance you'll never be able to play eventually. I too was able to play for 2 weeks or so and then no more. It's a shame and really disgusting how these developers value their customers.

Rust all around is genuinly enjoyable and will give you some of the hardcore emotions a game could give you. If you cant stand blood rushing heart pumping palm sweating adrelelin this game is not for you. No other game has given me the feeling of stress in a situation as this one. You evantually will get good at it and the game will become more rewarding the more you progress. At the end of the day you are either a loser or a winner.

Others blowing up foundations.11) After all of the fighting their base falls to the ground.12) After all the fighting this was possibly the best revenge I have ever had in rust so far.But seriously get this game 9/10.Not 10/10 because of all the you will meet.,Rust

2017-08-17,1,1,96,True,Not Recommended,Don't buy it now if you got it a few years ago then you got it at the right time. Used to be a fun game to play with your friends or alone you could play a couple of hours a night have some fun and get some weapons and do some raids. Now by the time you have managed to make your first C4 your wife will have left you the dog will have died and that white pair of underwear you haven't changed in a week because you were out farming high quality metal ore 2 bits at a time are now stained so yellow/orange they could be confused with Donald Trump swimming in fanta. This is all fine if you're a vampire or something you have a millenia of time on this planet so whats a few hundred hours a month building houses to find a hacker has blown it up and destroyed everything you owned you can just start again no real dent in your life. Also how anyone can stand the loading times to get onto a server is beyond me. Just the other day I managed to plant pick and bake a potato in the time it took to get onto a server only for the game to crash as soon as I woke up. Anyway I guess I'd recommend it if you are a single unemployed vampire with a lifetiem supply of underwear and a love of potatoes. Otherwise go play something else.,Rust

2017-01-23,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Not worth buying this game. I got very disappointed.This game was on my wishlist. So when I got it I was pretty excited!I installed the game and launched it. This is when it starts getting bad.I launched the game and when it opened up it did to a menu not very friendly and wouldn't fill my screen (which I know it could be chosen before the game started but dammit the game should have an option to change resolution). But not a big deal.Still excited I connected to a server hoping to get some real fun. So I chose an official server. Thats when it got really bad. The game required a bunch of stuff (2252 to be exact) to connect to that server and after a while it only had 100 *sigh*. I disconnected and went on to another server. It was some kind of battle royale it was enjoyable but not very entertaining. Despite all of the performance issues I was having (all in minimium) and the eventual fps breaks I was having some fun but not even slightly entertaining. I quit that server and went on to another one (which would take me a slight eternity because the game takes forever to connect to a server).When I connected I saw it was a survival and thought to myself that I might enjoy myself now with this survival server. I ran into a bunch of houses without being able to open their doors and eventually ran into a dead guy looted him and he had nothing. Then I started running to try and find some supplies. That's when the game crashed for some reason *sigh*. That's when I got really,Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,22,True,Recommended,"It has been a really really long time since I played a game for ten hours straight juste because I was into it a lot. Although Rust is in alpha it already is highly playable and a lot of fun. Yes it does not forgive any mistake (like saying peacefully hello to an armed player D) but once you've learned how its world works and once you've make yourself a cosy place to peacefully think about your world domination plans it really gets on.The first time you break into a player's badly secured house to raid it (instead of actually being the poor victim) you can only enjoy it. Well until it's your turn to be chased !A bunch of fun especially when playing with a friend and rejoining somewhere on the map.It really has a huge potential to make a very entertaining but at the same time quite hard survival game.I just can't wait to see what further updates will bring to this game which is already playable with fun (the only thing is maybe a little emptyness but again this is only an alpha so it's rather impressive what we can already do !).A must have or a ""must have in the future"" if you're afraid of purchasing an early in development game.",Rust

2015-02-09,0,0,1954,True,Recommended,I LOVE LAMP........And RUST,Rust
2017-10-28,0,0,237,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I truly gave this game a solid chance.Gameplay wise Rust is incredibly fun. Updates feel meaningful and transformative making players excited when new content is released. Micro transactions only affect cosmetics. This game really ticks all the right boxes.Some of the best moments in rust come from the tension trapped in your shoddy little shack whilst people scramble outside trying to find a way in travelling home with an inventory full of resources jumping at every shaddow. This game lives and dies on the players immersion. Immersion is a core and key tennet in a survival game because obviously survival only matters if you care about the thing you're preserving i.e. the character. This is Rust's MAJOR mistake.Forcing me as a white man (AKA the scum of the earth) to play as a dainty little asian girl really does not instill in me a sense of self preservation. Every time i open the menu I see her and am reminded that it is not me hiding inside that shack it is not me vulnerable outside with an inventory full of resources...it's this asian girl. Suddenly I'm not so afraid suddenly im not so immersed.If the lack of character customisation was simply a consequence of this game being in early access then I could understand but the developers have expressly said that it was a design choice. Their reason? Because if a player goes on a rampage and kills people they dont want him to be able to change his model and re enter the world incognito. Fair enough. Almost a good answer. Of course it doesn't take a genius to ask the question ""Why can't we customise our character upon first launching the game then have that player model locked to our steam ID?"". It's not really rocket science is it?Really it's just lazy game design. Lazy programmers. ""Rust is not a game about identity. The objective in Rust is to survive."" Garry Newman. Well i can do that without your software. I 'survive' everyday. I survive everyday IRL so that I can continue to do fun things. So to what end do I survive in your game? If survival is the sole purpose of the game what gives that survival meaning? We play games so that we can simulate environments and scenarios that we cannot experience normally. The beauty of a simulation is that we can define and customise the parameters. Why take away choice? Why reduce the effectiveness of your simulation by arbritrarily limiting its potential parameters? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe immersion doesn't matter in a survival game. Maybe I'm the only person who thinks this is an issue. If you read IGN Gamespot or any other gaming journalists you will certainly be instilled with the sense that you are being unreasonable and are part of a small vocal minority. This is obviously a very effective political technique called 'spiral of silence' (worth a google). In a time where complaining about being a girl in a video game WILL be called sexist where complaining about being black WILL be called racist I'm not too surprised at the silence. The truth is I think it's a bigger deal to players than you may think. It's quite stupid to say (as Garry Newman did) ""We're more concerned with the opinions of people actually playing the game"". Surely the best thing for the game AND its players is a larger playerbase? If ALL the people currently playing aren't bothered by the forced gender and race (which is not at all the case) then surely they would not be bothered by the customisation either? But adding customisation would remove what is currently a huge barrier between the game and its potential market. By demanding people play without ""identity"" you're effectively telling roleplayers to go themselves. What sort of player is left after you remove roleplayers from a survival simulator? PVPers. That is the current state of rust. All the players want to do is kill each other. They don't care if they die they don't care if they have an awesome base they just want gun play. Which is stupid because there are better games for that. So there you go roleplayer player base declining because of lack of immersion PVP playerbase declining because there are better shooters out there(cough cough with character customisation).Rust Great game terrible developers dwindling player base. Not worth it.",Rust

2015-02-22,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,"Alright people I have a lot of reasons why I do not recommend this game but I will remind you right here A I did not want this game I wanted something to do with my clan mates that isn't just TF2 because I am sick of TF2.B I had this game bought for me and gifted to me by Lamb so I could play with said clan mates.So let's jump right into it shall we?1. I enjoy the creativity in this game. A lot of houses I made I ended up getting lost in because I made it so big.The things you can do in this game WILL sink a lot of hours however. If you do not have the time for a game that will more than likely generate 20+ hours you WILL NOT want to purchase a game like this.2. I hate the idea of Early Access. If I get banned from Steam for saying that I really don't care. I have 100 games but I will let ALL of that go to waste on this opinion that I have about Early Access. If your game aint finished and you don't have faith in your product GET SPONSORS! If you are just starting on your own two feet Take even more time and even try create a website for yourself advertise in places like Youtube Facebook and many other revenues if you cannot get on Steam.The reason why I hate Early Access so much is that it seems to promote buying a game before it is even finished. I HATE that idea. It gives off the vibe that ""I don't have enough faith in my game that a concept that has been done already I don't think I can pull it off as well as the game I am using my ideas for"". To me it gives off the vibe of ""Give me money before this game is out and I MAY or MAY NOT release it"". I want a sure thing. I want to buy full games and DEMAND refunds for them when they are bad. I don't want half a game. I don't want bite sized pieces. I want a game in its entirety. If you don't know what you are doing with the game and you are releasing it bits at a time I CANNOT trust you. Now let me remind you I had this game bought and gifted to me. I had no real interest in the game other than for something to play with my clan mates.3. Whether this game is Early Access or not they still haven't learned how to ""destroy structures properly"".Sometimes they glitch out and stay there and you cannot destroy them or do ANYTHING with it. Sometimes the wall or roof will glitch through the floor when it is being deleted and insane tearing will occur. I expect 2015's standard for games to AT LEAST be competent. Crysis 3 was out in 2013 (alas not on steam) but revolutionizes graphical fidelity balancing replayability and integrity. That was 2 years ago... (yeah it was a different kind of fps but it has guns in it like Rust so it's still a first person SOMETHING.) Has humanity not learned since then? Have people not observed and noted that ""2003's graphics are 2003 standards not 2015 standards? Perhaps I have too much faith in humanity then...4. A MAJOR issue a flaw of the game becomes the main reason why I refuse to play this game any further. Rust updates itself literally everyday. With tweaks patches major bug fixes additions sometimes stuff you never see. The ONE gripe I have is this. They refuse to stabilize their coding when it comes to generating maps.I spend nearly 10 hours on the clan server I am affiliated with on my house with containers sleeping bag food storage entrances and exits walls to rooftops windows to doors all the knick knacks and patty wacks you can think of I spend a fair while on it being OCPD and all manipulating the environment and surroundings around me destroying and rebuilding to get the perfect house done right.1 day of a patch was all it took for the coding of generating maps to change therefore it resets EVERY MAP KNOWN TO MAN THEREFORE ERASING ALL MY HARD WORK!This FRUSTRATES ME TO NO END! All that accumulated knowledge ideas planning structural integrity ALL OF IT gone down the public restroom in a matter of minutes of downloading an update. It has happened 5 times now and I refuse to support a game any longer that wipes people's progress at the drop of a hat.If you are an OCPD like me you will do the public a solid and NOT play this game. It drove me up the wall and it will to you too. I don't even think on official FULL release this game will even satisfy most people. Unlike others I had no trouble with hackers because I only played on the clan server group I am with so no worries there but when you break the creativity flow and freedom EVERY TIME YOU UPDATE my patience will wear thin and I will stop supporting your game and your bad practices. I will recommend that opinion to my friends as well.Do NOT buy this game. Not now not before and not in the near future. Do NOT buy early access games. You encourage developers to be lazy with their work and lazy with their customers. Do not support this game and its development when the developers say themselves and I quote ""Some things work some things don't. We haven't totally decided where the game is headed so things will change. Things will change a lot. We might even make changes that you think are wrong.""I'm sorry but when your idea of ""making things that you think are wrong"" are ""glitching pieces of wall floor and roof freaking out into the floor causing massive tearing"" and ""wiping your creations and maps out every update"" well you get no sympathy or support from me when your ""plans"" fall flat on their face because you had no idea what you were doing and executed it poorly.**Edited 19 Jan 2016** So looking at the store page again it's been a while since I played the game but now I can say for certain I do NOT support a game who does micro transactions while STILL in early access alpha.",Rust
2014-03-03,0,0,156,True,Recommended,The first thing you must know about this game is simply the fact it is in ALPHA. That means there is very little do do in Rust at the moment but what you can do is fun. You are playing with and in most cases against other players to survive and gather/horde as much materials or weapons in your base as possible with as many people as possible. Read what a game is about before buying it. You start off with nothing but a few bandages a rock and torches. You need to use your rock to gather a few stone and wood to make a stone hatchet before you start doing anything else. Once you have your stone hatchet your life is 300% easier as far as gathering materials you can now take on a single wolf by yourself with that hatchet to gather what food cloth and if your lucky animal fat you will need to start off with. You will need to use a few bandages but that is what they are there for right? I then recommend before doing anything finding a secluded area to build a wooden shelter and the materials needed to make a stone furnace a workbench to craft faster and a metal door. Make a campfire and cook some meat to eat then you simply need to make a bow and a few arrows to gather the rest of the cloth or animal fat and hope you can find the rest of your metal ore. You will need 80 100 metal ore 300 wood for planks and 30 40 wood for fuel in your furnace to make a single foundation wooden house with your much needed metal door. Wooden doors can be destroyed by axes while metal doors need 2 3 explosive charges or 11 13 F1 Grenades to break and can not be destroyed by anything other than explosives. Grenades roll down slopes so add foundation to your base to add a ramp as well. Base building is not all that hard you can figure it out. Resource piles are your friends. You will find 3 different kinds of rocks they will be in fields and once identified you will be able to pick them out no problem. Each rock gives more of a specific rock resource than other rocks but will contain all three in most cases. Next are piles of logs these will be your best friend each has 80ish wood in the pile. Much better than 1 2 wood at a time off a tree right? You will also notice in some areas an odd static like sound will play that sound means that area is effected by radiation. These areas are your second best friend you will be killing radiation animals and looting buildings or any crates you find for materials or more importantly blueprints. Rad animals drop most of what you need and ammo the crates will drop research kits and guns. Use a research kit by a workbench with anything you are unable to craft and you will be able to craft it afterwords hold shift and use it on another research kit to make one that has 3 uses. The rest I leave up to you the Rust Wiki will cover all item uses and what is currently available.Experimental In the Experimental version everything looks promising still easy to troll the community however. There are only bare basic features and visual updates on the Bolt Action Rifle Axe Rock Cloth Shirt Pickaxe and animal/player models. It may be my card but you can barely see players unless they are 5 feet in front of you otherwise you see chunks of the model and what they are carrying. Wood structures fall apart when they are destroyed as of now they are blue blocks. You can place walls without a foundation and before you can build it you lay down a plan that looks like the start of laying down dry wall. Afterwords you use a hammer on it to finish the structure. Other than that stones and furnaces look the same you need stone to build a few things no metal just yet so furnaces are just kind of there. You can swim but do not drown yet and they added thirst that you can not quench. Lastly they updated UI and landscape as well so far so good but there is barely anything to do besides KOS and build walls. You spawn with a bow four arrows 200 ammo for your Bolt Action Rifle a shirt one chicken a campfire and an Axe. You can build a Pickaxe Furnace bone knife wood foundation walls and pillars.,Rust

DayZ takes itself too seriously and I can't handle how much of a 'simulation' it tries to make itself out to be.Only thing Rust needs to focus on in the interim is banning those goddamn hackers.

2014-08-03,0,0,301,True,Not Recommended,Early access game showed a lot of promise but as of August 2014 has been overshadowed by other similar early access games which show more promise (7 days to die Landmark ...). Rust has delivered a constant stream of development updates and they continue to work on the game. So any money spent buying the game seems to yield improvements. At the current state however it's a lackluster building game with a boring grind of resource hunting. The crafting system is minimally developed. And at any time someone can shoot you blow up your house and take away all your many hours of resource hunting. I havent read the developers blog about the intentions of where this game is going but with the steady stream of improvements it has the potential of becoming awesome. I'm mixed on whether to recommend it or not but as is it's not enjoyable to play for any length of time.,Rust
2016-07-13,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Oh my this game is an adventure that's for sure.This is one of the few early access games that will see daylight. Ever since it hit early access it has continuously been worked on by the beautiful dev's of Facepunch Studios. This game started as a zombie survival game with radiation. Now zombies are out of the game and won't make a return radiation is only a mechanic in BR and they have recently added a xp system. The game has improved and will continue to do so. This game is a survival game where you face off animals and other players. It has a building system where you can create strong bases to hold your equipment and for a place of safety it has base raiding a recently introduced xp system and it is the best survival game on steam as of now. The xp system was added a few days ago and has its problems. However it is being worked on and they are continuing to add things to the game and balance things. Graphically this game is amazing but it is also taxing to run on even high end hardware. As a solo player this game can be quite infuriating at times since people will make large clans but in time you can gather xp and craft weapons and armor to get payback on the folks who kept killing you. This game has a big sense of progression. You start off with a rock and as you level up you end up with full sets of armor and a highly varied range of weapons. This game will give you some of the best gaming and social experiences you will ever have.TL DR It's highly worth it. You will get a lot of hours out of this game and the dev's consistently add new content to this game and listen to their fans. Please give it a shot. Convince your friends to get the game and play it together. It will be worth it.,Rust

2016-07-30,0,0,428,True,Not Recommended,At the moment with exp it is pretty much impossible to join a server that doesn't wipe exp when a normal wipe comes around. A group of 4 made a nice place on a day 1 wiped server but unfortunately we got steam rolled by another group because they had their exp. It is impossible when you're level 15 with crossbow against a group that has C4s and AKs and everything because they're simply high level.Not to mention the incredible grind you have to go through to even get to a revolver or bow. Why is bow on level 7? Are you supposed to just run around with your spear till then? Why? Not to mention now that they nerfed a crossbow a weapon that you could always kill everyone with if you were skilled enough you simply have nothing to defend with against high level players as everything on low tier is simply garbage against the higher tier weapons.Ultimately the exp system takes out most of the fun out of the game.,Rust

2016-07-01,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,There is no single Player to this game at all. I would not count that against this game if the community wasn't so toxic. Here is how my play session went. Spawned was killed immediately killed by another player who had also just spawned. (Killing a freshly spawned player gets you close to nothing.)Spawned again. Ran around looking for food for over 20 minutes. Found 1 mushroom which did little to help. Did not see a single animal to hunt and died of starvation.Spawned yet again. Finally found a chicken after being chased by another player for about 5 minutes. Killed chicken. Finally found some stone to make proper tools. Finally found a few deers and hunted them successfully. Made Pants cooked food moved on. That took roughly 45min to accomplish.20 minutes go by while looking a place to live away from players. Mining a rock. Out of nowhere a player takes shots at me. I run tell him I don't want any trouble. Guns me down anyway. Dead restart from scratch.If you are playing with friends then it is probably great. For people that tend to play by thereself most of the time like me should stay as far away from this game as possible. Even tho I got this game for 50% off I would still rather have my money back for the time being.,Rust

2014-07-08,0,0,146,True,Recommended,I am going to be completely honest with this review. After about 13 hours of gameplay I have decided this game is really well made. Considering it is still in alpha its a really fun game.It holds a lot of survival playstyles of people. For example if you like surviving in the wilderness without being desturbed by people Go to a pve server But if you want a challenge go to a PVP server and face all the enemies you come across. Killing people along with trying to build the most safe base. I would really recommend modded servers where you would get the most amount of items fast. Get rust its really worth it very in depth even with the guns. The game is so realistic so far and its only in alpha with so much more content to come..... In conclusion PLS DONT HACK.,Rust

2014-03-23,0,0,2180,True,Recommended,Amazing game. It's still beta so I can't wait to see what more comes out of it. Very time consuming however. Also you need atleast 1 2 other people playing with you to experience any fun seeing as playing alone will just get you robbed constantly. Survival is key and if you are someone who can't take losing all your work it might not be for you. However if you are a big risk taker and always like high stakes this is your game. PvP is incredibly fun and so exciting it will make you litterally shake and possibly even sweat. Airdrops add a whole new element drawing everyone out of their homes in hopes for rare materials.

2017-06-14,2,1,87,True,Not Recommended,You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villian.This agme is a slippery slope and there are very few people I know that remained at the top and I commend them. This game is pure evil it will warp you into a sick and twisted shell of a person you once were. It is a literal social experiment of a post apocolyptic area. Let me go into more detail. I started out rust like every othe beginner optomistic and enthusiastic. I worked hard gathered resources and had fun. Eventually when I met some other players I was excited and was killed on the spot and looted. Rinse and repeat a few more times you cant trust other people. I worked hard and built my base to only be raided every day and start from square one. Eventually the constant stress of making it to my body to get back my stuff the base raiding and the all around distrust of the players got to me. I too became a raider I would kill people on the spot and steal there stuff break into there bases and decieve beginners. This one time these new kids asked me to make them an ak47. They gave me the materials and let me into there house which was a big mistake. Once I made the ak47 and the ammo I proceeded to kill them all and take everything in there base and also destroying there respawn points and locking them out of their house. This is the kind of that happens in rust. Save yourself the time and dont become an evil person like me. Eventually I quit and now 8 months later I am back to normal.

2014-03-15,0,0,1247,True,Recommended,"Rust. Where do I begin with Rust. Well I've been addicted since I purchased the game although that might not be universal. When you begin playing Rust you find yourself naked on an enormous island with a rock a torch and two bandages. From there you have to brave the wilderness the smoldering irradiated remains of human society and other survivors. At the very start your objectives become little more than self preservation. The basic needs of food and shelter (and therefore cooked chicken. Everything tastes like chicken in Rust). Then you meet another person. Or if you're unlucky a group of 6 men wearing kevlar vests and carrying assault rifles. Although the game is a ""survival game"" where you need to gather food and other materials to survive it is really one about human interaction. Meeting another player is an experience that can be defined in many ways. It depends on the interaction. It can be really friggin' wierd. It can be violent exhilarating and unfortunate (being beaten to death with a rock is not pleasant). Or you can make a new friendly neighbor or a new teamate to base with. Losing loot that you invested a significant amount of time gathering due to raiders or bandits can be frustrating at first but it is eventually something you learn to cope with and recover from quickly. You learn how to get even. The building system is also fairly good despite the few oddities that exist (pillars are indestructable?). The irradiated towns provide the chance to find and learn to create higher tier gear. So far the game is looking pretty good in my opinion. 10/10. However I do recommend that you play with a group of friends. Not only does a group give you a greater edge against hostile players it also increases the hilarity that ensues within the game and is generally just more fun. EDIT The above review refers to the ""Legacy"" version of Rust which is still my prefered version at this point in time. Much do to the fact that it is the one I am most familar with. I prefer it for other reasons as well there are certain features that I enjoy that are not currently implemented or are not implemented in the same fashion in the current version of Rust. However the current version has its merits and there are many good things about it including it being much prettier and having procedural map generation. Both versions of the game are available to play with the purchase of Rust and both versions have many many servers full of players every day. Regardless of which Rust you think you will enjoy I highly recommend this game. Still a favorite &lt 3. 10/10",Rust

2014-01-02,0,0,6,True,Recommended,This is the most ridiculous game I have ever played!!! It's like DayZ minecraft and garry's mod had some crazy kinky sex and Rust popped out of the womb afterwards. What can I say It's got crafting base building shooting guns and PvP. It's only in Alpha but I can't wait to see what they add to it in the future and what direction they take it. Nothing compares to seeing a mob of crazy naked people running around in the forest surviving together! The Feeling of getting a gun for the first time is so impowering. You feel like a god! This game has got a lot of good concepts and I can't wait to see where it heads. Contrary to what people say. In my time playing it I have ran into many helpful players willing to help you and protect you from the crazy bandits out there. Time to survive in Rust.,Rust
2014-01-03,0,0,165,True,Recommended,I've played this game a lot over the 2013 winter holidays. As of writing this the game is still in an early Alpha build. Rust is an addicting game. There's a constant urge to gather/craft/horde resources to further progress your place in the world. Servers are persistent. Your base and all of its belonging are subject to raids 24/7. It s the closest thing to a PvP oriented Sandbox MMO since EVE A difficult comparison to draw considering Rust is an FPS game and not an MMO. However server can be as large as a few hundred simultaneous players and the player structures are persistent so in that sense Rust accomplishes the same feeling without actually being an MMO.Conditions are harsh. Just surviving the environment can be a difficult task and the first few hours of gameplay will be spent just learning to stave off hunger the cold and natural predators. Survival quickly shifts to the political nature of your neighbors. Do you trust no one and hope the rest of the world overlooks you? Or will you align yourself with a group for mutual protection? There is no right or wrong way to play. The choices you make very much impact the server you live on. The content in this game is purely from the interaction of players. In that regard the game is fully playable and enjoyable even in Alpha. Having said that there is much more to look forward to as the game evolves to extend depth in every mechanic that drives the gameplay. Improvements to gathering crafting maintaining items building defending researching I can only see this game getting even better over time.,Rust

Truly a diamond in the rough for sure. Looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future I know I'll be part of it.Edit July 1 2014I don't play the game as much as I use to now. Hopefully with the new rebuild that Garry and crew are working on I will be reinvegerated to conserve as many resources and build another house that will probably get raided. But all in good fun ).Edit Feburary 20 2018The game is released after years in development and after a two year hiatus I have picked it up again and I'm updating my review. Like I said earlier the game grew on its huge potential and provided a very unique experience. There are a lot of Survival/crafting/building games out there since 2013 but all of them fall to the might that is Rust.Rust is a polished game and a lot of people will condemn it for brining a ""unfinished game"" outta Early Access. I normally counter this argument by saying why would a developer put a finished game in Alpha?Anyways the game is polished and even better it feels balanced. I feel like a player and his 5 friends can still be on the same level as a group of 10 people because of the changes made. They improved map generation by putting in certain aspects of the game that forces players to roam and pvp more often (one of the early complaints in 2015 was there wasn't enough of this). They provided probably the best way to tech up in the game and it has end game. Raiding and roaming in Rust has never been better.Highly recommend this game.",Rust

2017-08-17,0,0,470,True,Not Recommended,"Honestly when I first got it I played it to hell and back and had a lot of fun! But it got to a point where I stopped playing because I overplayed (If you don't know what that is it's when you play a game so much to the point where you don't even want to play it anymore). So I stopped playing it for a couple of months until my friend told me to hop on it with him. Holy mother of god they ed this game up. They made the gun mechanics absolute It used to take skill to spray somebody. You used to need a decent understanding of how the guns worked. You used to not be able to spray and pray. Welp that isn't the case nowadays. An experienced player versing a complete nooby to the game has a 50/50 win lose chance. The game used to favor those who actually took the time to learn it without giving the new players so much of a disadvantage to where they wanted to stop playing but that has changed. The devs introduced an update that made it to where you can now build anything on anybodys land. Tool cupboards are placed down to give building privilage saying that anybody within a certain radius isn't allowed to build unless they get privilage. But now for some odd reason the devs made it to where you can build foundations stairs platforms and practically anything you want even when you don't have privilage. This makes it to where if there is a high wall in front of your base it is pretty much worthless since a noob can go get 500 wood come back and build over it. This is probably the worst thing that they could've done to the game. Now it's gotten to the point where you can hop onto a server play for about an hour and have a base and everything built have raidable tools and everything 4 hours later raid a ton of people go to sleep wake up the next day and your base is gone and you have been killed. Now you are back to where you started when you woke up last night. Rinse and repeat every day. So unless you want to stay up 24/7 protecting your base constantly there isnt even a point of coming back to that server the next day since all your hard work is probably gone. Now I know people are going to say ""well they just raided your base it's a part of the game"" and to that I say yes it is a part of the game but it shouldn't be that easy to do. I have a pretty decent computer. It's a CybertronPC Patriot with 64 gigs of ram an 8 core processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card (I know I have no life xD). But I still have trouble running it at anything above graphic level 3 out of 5 without having it frame studder frame drop or just run like all around. I wouldn't say it's ""poorly"" optimized but it should be better than it is for as long as the game has been out. So if you are playing on a gaming laptop I would probably pass on getting this game.All around it's become complete I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at least not in it's current state. So until the devs pull their heads out of their asses and get their together I would hold off on buying this game. Go spend that 20$ on candy at your local gas station because it'll be more rewarding than buying this game.",Rust

2015-03-05,0,0,387,True,Recommended,I think Rust is an amazing game. It's my favorite game so far I never had so much fun in my life playing a game. I am playing Rust for a long time now and I will still probably play it for a long time. I remember old Rust days when servers were full and number of total players on Rust was insane high. I was playing with many groups made a lot of friends and laugh a lot. It was really awesome.About the new Rust. I tried it and I can't really say I don't like it. It is really good looking and they are updating it every week so I think the new Rust will be amazing when it will be done but for now I prefer playing legacy Rust. In my opinion PvP is much better in legacy than in the new Rust also most known players that are good stayed on legacy.There is a lot of cheaters in legacy Rust but if you join the right server with active admins you shouldn't have problems with that. So far I didn't see any hackers on the new Rust and it looks really promising. I think that developers decision about not updating legacy Rust anymore is kinda a bad thing since it's really awesome but that's how it is.After all this game is really awesome legacy and new Rust. It is totaly worth to buy this game you won't regret it. So far it is the best game I ever played in my life. I would rate it with 9/10!,Rust

However he told me "" i has rock and i can rhape you "". At that moment I started panicking then I told him not to kill me or I wouldn't tell him where all my supplies were hidden. Then he was like ""ok show quick or i kill you "" . Then he kept spamming me to come while I tried to remember the location of my secondary house so I replied with "" OMG I CANT SEE YOU WHERE ARE YOU OMGG! "". Then I told him to follow me. I led him to my wood shelter opened the door and he quickly went inside to see what goodies awaited. Calmly shutting the door behind and letting him scream as he dies a slow death I went back to my mansion to enjoy a few more chicken breasts. 10/10.",Rust
2014-03-08,0,0,555,True,Recommended,"hmmm Rust where to start such a amazing game after playing 100+ hrs on it it still isnt boring sure it gets repetive but when it starts feeling repetive go to a different game then come back in about 30min and then it shouldnt be as boring but what i find myself doing a lot is starting on a new server every little while when i get bored on one server or get raided or just wanna have fun ). I have had so many good experiences like one time i raided a guy who had 1 wood door and then replaced it with a metal one so he couldnt get out and made him my prisoner and then i said to him ""are u hungry and would u like food if so what food do u want"" he then replied with ""charcoal"" for some reason so i gave him his request then he starved to death ( there goes my prisoner/buddy lol. but if u are looking at buying the game dont give up in the first couple of hours because someone killed u. If this happens then just join a less popular server or just keep playing till you get better trust me its not hard to pick up on how to play so i would give this game a 9/10 because this game can go alot further with the realism and i think when its out of alpha it will be amazing and would get a 20/10.

The New graphics that are comming in look insane and the gameplay of it is amazing. the only thing that lets this game down so much is the community. if your a solo player its going to be extremely hard to start off so you would probably want to get a friend or 2. theres alot of anoying people that can ruin the game but take away that and this game is the best out today,Rust

2014-07-05,0,0,232,True,Recommended,"The first hundred hours of Rust for me was pretty fun. It was a little bit of a learning experience for sure. When I first started I played with the ""I'm going to be friendly to everyone"" mentality only to find out that it will get you no where. In Rust it's hard to find a good alliance of people unless you bring in your own. There are a good variety of servers to choose from and I personally prefer the vanilla servers.When it comes to combat if you have little to no experience in FPS games on a keyboard and mouse set up you're gonna have a really rough time. When I came into Rust I had roughly 300 hours of keyboard and mouse FPS experience but it all dated back to years ago. Needless to say the first few firefights I lost. However there are items in the game to help with your aim such as a Holographic sight and a laser.In all for being my first ""Early Access"" game I really enjoyed the first hundred hours of Rust. However with the small amount of updates done to the game in the past few months I grew tired of the ""run around harvest scavenge kill"" the game had to offer and even more so when you'd put several days if not weeks of work into a server only for it to get wiped. To make matters worse Rust has had a very bad time fighting against people who ""hack"" or cheat so it's really ruined the experience for a lot of people. Some server admins literally spend a majority of their time teleporting to various people to see if they are hacking just so they can keep their server clear of people who desire to make the game a bad experience. This has also led to another negative aspect the process of banning someone for being too good.I've noticed that a lot of people in Rust hate to admit when they've been outplayed or outgunned. Some of these people who run in large groups will get so upset over a death that they'll claim that the person who just killed them is hacking. Admins sometimes being overwhelmed with ""admin duties"" will sometimes ban people if a large group of people claim a certain person is hacking. This leads to large groups accusing individuals of ""hacking"" just so that individual will get banned from the server even if the person wasn't hacking at all.All in all I would rate the game (in it's current state) a 7/10. There is still a lot of work to be done with Rust which will allow for a lot of room for improvement. The issue is how long will it take the developer to get these changes done and pushed out to the public. The major issue with Rust is the large amount of people who cheat. However if you find the right server usually those people don't stick around long.",Rust

2014-07-30,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Im begining to notice how people have been sending hate mail to Garry Newman about his games and half of the complaints ar just small things like how he makes the game or how people think that he doesnt do anything to the game to improve them. The point is that most people don't even know the effort that Garry and Facepunch Studios put into the game. They say that they're still working on it and some people still dont listen because they never know if its a big update that might take a long time. So if anyone out there that has been saying things about their games then play another game because their people too you know and they have feelings as well.,Rust

2014-09-01,0,0,1761,False,Recommended,My View of the game when I had 250 hours Rust is a wonderful Game for the Price of 20.00 USD. Things to consider when buying a game like Rust is it is still in the Alpha stages and gets a decent update once every month on the first Thursday of a month and smaller updated every following Thursday until the next month. Rust is very graphically appeasing meaning it is very graphically demanding because a lot of things within the game are not optimized at the given stage. If you are going to buy this game you have to be willing to put time into. Building a tiny base is not going to do as most likely you will get raided and have to restart. Also dont get offended when someone raids you it is part of the game. Killing on Site occurs on most servers and that is just a little taste to the game that should be going beta later 2016.Overall if your considering Rust its an amazing sandbox game that allows you and your friends to live in a ruthless world where your always on the brink of death.The game looks very nice but has some graphical issues.Must play with Friends solo play is not as fun as having guys to have your back.And if any questions on anything just go on Youtube. The game has been out for quite sometime now and there is tutorials for virtually everything.I hope you guys can appreciate this game as much as I do and have a wonderful time playing a brilliantly designed game.My view of the game now that i Have 1400 hours As stated priorly I believe Rust is a great game. I have given the time and devotion needed to truly understand what this game is about and assess the core factors that make Rust Rust. Rust has progresses a lot over the years starting from Legacy which was simplistic and fun to current Rust that just cant seem to get things right in the eyes of the community. New Rust has become over complicated and has seen many major changes throughout its lifetime. Some of these include The Blueprint system Considered to be Rusts High point due to the systems pure RNG basis making everything as equal as possible. But then the community complained and things got changed to the next generation.The Xp system Considered the worst version of rust. Although the XP system was somewhat fun it was very problematic and only rewarding to large groups. It also envolved dubious amounts of grinding and only attempted to please the ever so toxic Rust community but still was not good enough leading into the current and final system.The Component system The component system was Facepunchs way of finding the middle ground between the blueprint system everyone loved and the XP system everyone hated. Upon released everything seemed okay and the system seemed to be working well but what went wrong? The system has a key factor that nobody enjoys and that is the pure fact of grinding to obtain a feasable amount of components to do anything. This one factor has the communities dissaproval and the main reason why people cannot stand the game. I think its okay but could use readjustment. The Game Now It appears as Rust continues to make strides in becoming an ideal survival game it has major setbacks that can not be changed. The game has countless AI bugs that cause repeated heartaches to player and only annoy them taking away from the games over all value. The game also has a community that is very unbearable. In Rust Legacy Rust was still a heavily PVP based survival but it always seemed like people where having fun experiencing the game for what it was and not for what it could become unlike Rust now. In Rust the community is very unforgiving and do nothing but cause arguments start battles and even bully individuals whom are just trying to have a good time. If someone can over look the community then the next thing to look at is the mechanics of the game itself. As Rust has progressed and continues to progress it becomes more and more PVP (player vs player) driven. This I think takes away from the survival aspect of the game. The developers would rather tweak gunplay and add new weapons instead of building off of the games core principles turning rust into a hour consuming Call of Duty rather than a survival based game. Theres no point playing to build if your going to get steam rolled by other players who take advantage of the PVP counterpart incorperated into the game. Rust store description states The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Whatever it takes to survive.And surviving it has become but is it really what was envisioned for rust when it first came out? or has it become a product of a community that is never satisfied and for that keeps dragging the games quality down.I personally will continue to play Rust because Ive played since the start and will continue untils its finish. as for you that yours decision.,Rust

It has gotten harder but it's still enjoyable.But I've rage quit a lot. Not gonna lie. Early Access Review 2015 Fresh out of legacyThe game feels much more casual than it did originally. If you're a solo player it's as hardcore casual as can be. In groups you can go nuts probably. I solo. The improvments are most certainly showing and regular. There's quite a bit to the game now compared to 2015 made my hours go from 90 to over 300 since december 2016. It's fun as it is now with the updates coming out all the time.I look forward to how it will be when the servers never have to wipe from updates.Honest rating7/10I honestly mostly play for the maps now.

2014-01-13,1,2,101,True,Recommended,Day #116 I was wondering along the forest when I spotted another living person who simingly lived through the radiation. I approached him cautiously with my M4 aimed at his chest... I told him to turn around when he replied that he was friendly... This is the first friendly I have met in my 116 days in this hellish world... Together we have started to put together a makeshift shack to stay alive from the elements while we slowly start to expand our encampment... My buddy takes the night patrols while I sleep... and I take the day patrols while he gets some rest... Day #117 I awoke before the sun had risen over the peak... Me and my partner decided we had to get supplies to stay alive... So we did an unhumanly thing and shot other survivors at their encampments... We took their supplies and food... One was asleep and we decided to put him out of his misery.... Hopefully god forgives us for this hellish sin we have commited...Day #118 I awoke to all of my doors locked and I was unable to escape... I looked out my window which was now barred shut with metal rails... I coud see my partner dead and bloodied in the woods... I had no way out of my base... My only option was to take my own life... My 118th day marks my last in the apocalyptic world...,Rust

2014-04-30,0,0,404,True,Recommended,Rust has great potential to be a challenging but fun game. Heavily populated servers can be difficult to get started on but tend to be worth the effort so that you have others to play (team or kill) with after you're up and running. Don't trust anyone tends to be my motto. Naked's that shoot you in the face with a pipe shotgun full kevlar people that snipe your naked body from afar. I tend to only build 1x1's as the servers need to be wiped bi weekly (depending on decay and population). There are currently mutated animals in the place of where zombies use to be. This is only a place holder for the future mobs. Which we don't quite know what direction that will be. The new User Interface is scheduled to be released with the next update as well as the code rewrite. Both should help tremendously not necessarily right away but will be vital in the on going effort. I do however wish that the production team would marry the game's success with man power and effort on their end. I honestly feel like they know they don't have enough people and they don't care. That being said I have 0% knowledge of their inner workings number of employees and etc.Edit 11/25/2016The game has come a long way. The code is no longer split and that's a good thing. I have played an hour or so on the newest code and am enjoying where things are going.,Rust

Not only does Rust have a large open world to explore the game provides a good sense of danger that keeps the player on their feet at all times. If PvP isnt your scene then that's okay because the game provides custom servers with custom settings ranging from instacraft to PvE to no sleepers. Although the game is still in it's open alpha stage the content of the game seems very promising. The final version of this game should be amazing.,Rust

2013-12-12,0,0,108,True,Recommended,Very fun game if you like to collect resources improvise your weapons and fight over an airdrop from a carrier. Has it's moments of glory but waiting 500 seconds to craft stuff can get tedious if you are considering building a big base but it really pays off in the end with the added safety from other players. There's a bunch of high end gear you can get if you are paitent and live long enough to make a base of operations or risk it in the radiated industrial/military buildings where zombies/mutants of different difficulties protect some nice gear and blueprints. 4 hours in (note I played this game before Steam Release) I managed to make a small home with metal doors get food wood and ores. Also got a nice bow with 50 arrows a handcannon (improvised shotgun) and some armor. It's a good mix between Minecraft and DayZ I would say. Resource gathering crafting and eventually building your huge fort to hunting other animals and players and take their food gear and loot up until you have the very best items in the game.It is early access and it's going to screw you over here and there. The map will sometimes reset removing your buildings the game might crash a few times on you but if you can look past that it's a great experience. But if you get bored of games quickly I suggest you wait until it's released to have a more pleasant experience. If you're going into the world of Rust I also recommend checking out some tutorials for it. Diving into the game with no idea what to gather how to craft or even cook food it can get very frustating. Don't be afraid to look up a wiki or have a tutorial on your steam browser as you are playing. Fun times!,Rust

2016-03-22,0,0,1418,True,Not Recommended,Legacy is now COMPLETELY locked off from this game. Before you'd have to go through the trouble of switching what build you were on but now they've cut themselves off from their old build entirely. To older players and veterans of this game it's a shame. The newer game is alright for a bit of good fun but in my opinion is over saturated and lacks the simplicity that made legacy such a great competitive experience.It certainly isn't the worst use of 20$ however I do think that it lacks what originally made the game so compelling. Nowadays you're required to play on a group and good luck trying to take over a server that's already being dominated by another group. It just doesn't play out in a way that's fair and competetive to everyone and doesn't cater well to people new to a server. Granted rust never was about hand holding naked noobs however it used to atleast give you a chance to inflict some damage to your enemy. You don't get the same joy you used to from griefing and raiding enemy bases. However it still does get some things right. You're still going to be facing the same people on multiple occasions and you're still going to make enemys and forge alliances. There's a lot of hate and toxicity and it's absolutely wonderful if you're mature enough to handle it.All in all I'd give the new product a 5/10. It has fewer exploits and way less cheaters than Rust Legacy but it's lost most if not all of it's charm. Is it worth a buy? That depends entirely on you and what you're looking for in a video game. If you wanna just run around and play it as a social game you can totally do that. If you want to play fun minigames (which are usually better in games CS GO) you can do that too! If you want to get a group of friends and try to take over a freshly wiped server You can do that.. However don't expect to be able to just hop onto a vanilla server try to succeed and have a good time. I don't like the direction this game is headed so I will NOT reccommend this game. I hope Garry and his team can change my mind one day but I really doubt it.,Rust
2014-06-18,0,0,1064,True,Recommended,The devblog for Rust is probably the best devblog ever. The frequent and detailed as well as fun updates do everything they need to be. They're informative honest and do a good job of covering recent features as well as foreshadow future ones.As for the game istelf it's great for a work in progress. It can run like trash sometimes but it's fun nonetheless to run around naked with your friends while trying to take over a server for yourselves. Rust is good at making you fear other naked caveman that have almost nothing but still more than you. But it's still better with mods though despite being a great infinite source of fun for cheap in its own right.,Rust

2017-03-12,0,0,248,True,Recommended,"This is the first review I'll have written for a game I've purchased on Steam and most likely the only review I'll ever write for a game I've purchased from Steam. Before purchasing Rust I thought that due to my age (yes I'm aware of my Steam username and my profile picture!) I had outgrown video games. Then came Rust a game that although in its ""alpha stage"" of development is very playable enjoyable and addictive.Starting Rust you're spawned into the world with nothing but two rudimentary tools a rock and a torch. With the rock you're provided you can farm stone wood and other resources which you can then use to construct buildings and other objects that will aid you in protecting yourself (from the elements and from other players) and/or raiding enemies' bases. That is the basis of Rust farming resources to survive the environment (three biomes forest desert and tundra each with their negatives and positives) as well as for attacking/raiding other players and their bases.Although the emphasis is on resource collection and combat the game is much more nuanced than that especially if you're playing cooperatively/role playing with other players. For example in the first neighborhood I lived in comprised of friendly and cooperative players we moved in next to a player who was antisocial and aggressive. Every time we'd be in the vicinity of his base which was only several yards from our base he would ""KOS"" (Kill On Sight) us. Upon confronting him about his aggressiveness he countered with ""Rust is not a cooperative/role playing game. It's kill or be killed."" And you know what? He was right. Everyone plays Rust differently. There's no right or wrong way to play Rust. You'll have fun however you play. Which brings me to only complaint about this game the hackers.Hacking isn't commonplace in Rust (I could be wrong as I only play on official servers) in the sense that the majority of players you encounter will be hacking but given the sheer amount of time you will spend collecting resources building bases and everything else encountering a hacker and losing your prized firearm(s) resource(s) etc. it can be VERY FRUSTRATING dying to them. It's frustrating dying in a fair fight from which I've died MANY TIMES (I liken the number of times you'll playing this game to the number of times you'll die playing Dark Souls!) but you take solace in the fact that you were bested by someone who has out skilled you or maybe has thousands of hours in the game.The small number of hackers aside this game is definitely worth the price whether at full price or discounted. It's also assuring that the developer Facepunch Studios is heavily invested in their game and continuing to update it after all these years. One change that I noticed in a recent update was the sound of a blizzard in the tundra biome it really adds to the immersion of the game! Wonderful.

I do not regret my purchase.BUY THIS GAME!",Rust
2016-08-06,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,You can change game engine update game every week. But if you can't fix core mechanics... Bears still can run through trees and even get stuck in your home's wall (killing you eventually). Hit system is bugged and unsatisfying. This game had HUGE potential. But if developers will continue to move in current direction this game has no future at all.,Rust

2015-02-16,2,1,155,True,Recommended,It is,Rust
2015-02-23,1,1,48,True,Not Recommended,"Giving it a thumbs down since I hadn't reviewed when Legacy was still around. The new version's optimization issues and the requirements of a supercomputer to get any decent framerate and freezing stop basically kill any point of playing at all. I have the ""recommended"" specs for the game and I'm lucky to get more than 3 frames on any settings other than lowest everything.The concept of building up a base is fun but honestly the fact that half of the time all of your progress just gets reset by some d*ckwad who plays at 3 in the morning when no one's around to defend their bases makes the entire experience sub par at best. You can work hours to build up only to have it taken away 5 minutes after logging off. It's as if a game like Minecraft reset the world every time you closed the program.If you're in it for PvE then forget it. There's hardly any servers for it around and even when you find one ""PvE"" in this game is ""You're lucky to find one non player entity running around for an hour without stopping."" The entirety of your experience fighting in this game is going to be likely getting murdered by players better equipped than you a few minutes after you spawn.Game obviously has no single player which even in a game that is supposed to be multiplayer PvP is a huge turn off. Say I don't want to needlessly get murdered by nearly every player I come across? Nope go play a different game. Not to mention the sheer overload of hackers in multiplayer servers lately. You're lucky to be alive for more than an hour on some servers.tl dr Optimization sucks Frame and Freeze issues even on good computers even at low settings PvP is constituted by who's been in server longer and who's willing to stay up until you fall asleep to destroy everything you've worked for PvE pretty much doesn't exist No single player or local server option to avoid random killing and hackers to just play the gameDefinitely not worth the purchase in current state and from the recent updates the developers don't even seem to care anymore. I don't hold any hope for the future of the game and I consider it a toss of 20 dollars.",Rust

My entire computer procedes to violently vomit and even task manager stops working I close everything but rust and try again. To My suprise (Sarcasm) The same thing happens only I actually get in the server the game however went at 1 Frame per 25 seconds (I counted) until crashing both the game and my computer.

2015-02-01,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,DON'T BUY THIS GAME I thought i was getting into a game with SO much potencial SO many fun experiences but alas i find myself with this piece of crap. Aparently the trailers are from the OLD version. I tried at first legacy aka the old one and it was very fun even without any people. Hunting exploring getting weapons crafting and smelting learning etc. And then i tried the new one.First thing i see is that the servers dont show up on screen. I go and reload the servers and no response. Restart the game no response. So I come back 1 2 hours later and it worked. I log in and make a base build some stuff and the next day it's all gone. 10 times this happened to me until I found out about this stabilization system. So I had to look up how to make a proper house that wouldn't collapse on its own. Once I did that I was happy. Until the next day. When this UI UPDATE FREAKING RESETS THE SERVERS. Every week you lose your base to some ing update THAT DOESN'T EVEN CHANGE THE MAP OR SPAWNS ON ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM! Time and time again they find SOMEWAY to ruin the game. Blueprints basicly no landmarks OP airdrops etc. Just don't simply don't buy it. Not worth your time.,Rust
2014-01-31,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,"Hi! I'm new and *dead*....Hey guys how do I use this....*dead*Oh! Another starter person! Let us collaborate....*dead*And that's the FUN part of the game. You see Rust is a very brutal first person survival game. It's unforgiving and frankly it's not for people looking for a 'safe' form of entertainment. And that makes crafting your first gun VERY satisfying and landing a killshot with a bow extremely empowering. The problem is the human element. In particular the element of 'humans' (and I use this term loosely) who run servers. I am sure there are some fantastic server admins out there. Sadly the server I was on was not one of them but seems to conform to the norm of what is expected from this game.Upon waking up to a reset world (which happens) I set about spending 5 hours doing my thing. During this time I bumped into a player who was wondering near my home and when I asked him to move along (with a stone hatchet to the face) I was subjected to a vicious string of verbal abuse (not uncommon). Then I was informed that he was the server admin and he was going to find me and delete my house. I found that amusing.A little while later my new admin friend (again loose terminology applied) reset the server without warning because he was no longer the most advanced player on the map. I haven't been back since. The game is not of any value despite thier 'anti cheating' policy hacking and server admin abuse is so rampant that it's almost a game feature. In fact the beginner tutorial should read ""You wake up in a open world naked armed only with a rock and surrounded by vastly more powerful cheating buggers.""Just don't waste your money on this.",Rust

2015-10-17,0,0,373,True,Not Recommended,The game is just fine. Rust is a brilliant game with lots of promise. But from the second every toxic worthless Source fan heard the creator of Garry's Mod was making a new game they ran over and turned it into a wasteland of twits who have nothing better to do than for example sit on the beach killing new players using an AK 47. People who are new to the game (or even simply have one question) are pretty much always told to go themselves. Even if you do know how to play the game good luck staying alive for more than thirty minutes at a time and that's a stretch.TL DR Source gamers turned the game into a pile of a lot like DayZ.

Sure it could use some improvements but those improvements are likely on the roadmap and if they aren't then just contact the devs with your idea. They've done a great job implementing ideas from the community over on Reddit.Be warned though not everyone is nice. There is a lot of toxicity in the community but I can't blame that on the devs. I've only had the game for about a year now so I can't compare the current system to the older ones (besides components) but I think the developers are definitely going about this right.Good game I ditched CS GO for it.,Rust

Then you have these random passerbies if they shoot at you and they retaliate the ing chat is Then you have the ing cults that name themselves after real world places in Asia (Korea China Pakistan etc) and then the whole cult is salty and tries to butt everyone over by being a scumbag and doing the things mentioned above.

2014-03-19,0,0,120,True,Recommended,"Incredibly fun. It's an Alpha and still is among my top 10 games of all times! How?Well this game is so nice and super fun to play with friends. However there is MUCH to be done before this game is 100% playable and enjoyable for example 1. You can't leave without being worried to get raid because your character ""stays"" in game. Makes you unable to quit playing game to. And that decay thing is stuiped. I can't even go on vacation without my house decaying so when i return i got only pillars and foundations left of my house.2. To brake building stuff takes SOOOOOOOOOOO long time like 5 min for a stair with an hatchet. Also foundations and pillars are indestructible which makes even funnier for trolls to place them around you house so you can't expand or build anymore.3. Why can't you make own servers? I mean if i want to play alone with some friends so i don't have to worry about annoying admins or raiders and trolls shouldn't i be able to do that without paying an extra 30 ?4. Some animals (mostly bears) goes underground they can still hit you but you can't hit them no weapons or tools works for this run is the option. I've also seen animals (also mostly bears) spawning on the tops of the trees. You can shot them take thier loot but can't harvest the animal itself since it's stuck in the air...5. I found wepons with 5 6 wepon slots but there is only 4 wepon mods. Hopefully more weapon mods are in progress?As i said before i LOVE this game the stuff i took up is what i want for a change. I know it's just an Alpha but i would if they fix this stuff in future! )Buy this game at your risk it's addictive ( v )/10/10 peace!",Rust

You watch him pass you by heading towards a town. He is distracted killing zombies you see him get hit a few times hes pulling out a bandage! Now is your chance! Jump in there and beat him to death with a stone 2 or 3 hits might do it? You killed him sustaining only a petty amount of damage! You did it! Now you have a shotgun with a few shells.

2014-06-25,0,0,159,True,Not Recommended,"Okay hear me out. I like this game but there are huge flaws in it that have caused me to no longer play a lot. Rust is overall a great game but has the WORST community I have EVER seen and I also have to comment about the ongoing raiders and overflowing bandits. You can craft items you can build houses and the PvP in there is pretty nice as you can go around with your friends and clash against bandit clans or other groups. Its really sastifying to kill a group of bandits that have been terrorizing the local ""naked people"".The REAL problem of this game is the community and the house/sleeper system that I personally hate.About thrice I've been accused of being a hacker (In all fair honesty even though I've already confessed this to others I used to hack other games a long time ago but I've cleaned up my act because I just felt really bad for ruining the experiences of other players and it was just tired of coming on top with the use of hacks. Thus I quit hacking within 2 months into it and sucked it up to play legit.) by groups of 2 3 guys I killed legitimately who talk like they're in the thug life and can't spell for I even find myself being banned from high population servers just because one of the bandits I killed happened to be the ADMIN.YES THERE ARE ADMINS LIKE THAT. The worst part of the community can been experienced when you're naked guy in a world of over 100 people. You literally get killed every 10 15 minutes by overly high and mighty griefers who type ""LOL NOOB!"" and other vulgular things. Its not fun and it is absolutely sad to see such a high potential game plagued by a bunch stupid 10 year old kids with Fully loaded M4s and full Kevlar Armor who think they're the ultimate badass as they gun down unarmed naked fresh spawns.Its so bad I think fresh spawns die more in Rust than in DayZ Standalone.I find it extremely disheartening and disappointing to quit wake up in the morning and see that my guy was killed in his sleep (Disconnecting or exiting the game leaves your person in a ""sleep mode"" where they are vulernable to other survivors) and my entire house was raided. It really angers me to see my long worked house raided by a bunch of thieves whom I have no way of knowing their usernames.Imagine finishing your dream house get a ton of resources make weapons and get food medkits and stuff. Alright things are looking good so far. Then as you quit Rust about 2 hours later 2 5 guys come raid your house and kill you in your sleep. They take EVERYTHING you have worked hard for and destroy your precious bed so you can't spawn back. Oh they also hatchet'ed your storages and furniture.Back to square one. Have fun repeating this.Its obessive and tedious to constantly go on Rust to check if your house is okay. Trust me you eventually get REALLY attached to your stuff and home in Rust. You can get these feelings of intense paranoia of the safety of your chracter and doubt about your defenses to the point where it just nit picks your mind every 2 minutes. You can't even play another game without thinking about your Rust home and worry about the bastards who can raid your home.Hell I was SO worried one time about bandits raiding my home in a high population server I stayed up until 5 IN THE MORNING to make sure my DEFENSES was good. It might just be me but getting too attached to your home in Rust can really leave you in a mood in real life.While I partially hate how the game works most of it is great. It is fun to gather/craft stuff but just knowing that it could be stolen by 2 5 bandits who can potentially raid your house just makes it almost not worth trying to gather it.Either be on the entire night to look after your house or turn off Rust to leave your house and yourself sitting ducks to bloodthristy thieves. Either way its just really upsetting.In short Great game overall but has horrid community and can be addicting to an unhealthy scale. Because of this I just don't feel comfortable recommending this to anyone. Its still the alpha however so maybe things WILL change. But at the moment its just not really playable due to the griefers and 24/7 raiders.",Rust

I was really impressed with them been on this game since december 2015 and i can say i've never in my life been interested in a blog about content patches and fixes . Yes i do praise them because they deserve it ..The game is pretty simple but hard to master every time you log in will be different from boring farming to regular pvp to intense online raiding where the other guys are trying to defend their castle against c4 and rockets with ak's and thompsons to bows and spears ... man things can get desperate .You will rage at first but after the first 500 hours it gets easier its not a game meant for everyone everithing in this game is a fight for survival your spawn point has a cool down of 360s to 60s so dying has its price you either lose your base or just lose some of the stuff you had on you . But the reward ... oh my god ... there is no better feeling than destroying some big fkin castle with some of your friends and getting all their stuff while they are shouting and screaming over voice about how fat your mother is and how they fked her ... You wont even care about those guys once you get to their stuff ... man its like heaven to see a box full of weapons and explosives .

They start a new Rust because they werent happy with the direction of the old Rust(Rust Legacy for the purpose of this review/rant). So the new Rust comes along and guess what ... apart from the lack of wolves and bears that drop loot you have pretty much the same old Rust ie Rust legacy. What was the point then i ask ? What was the point behind the ""New"" Rust and all the changes ? Rust can be fun but also incredibly frustrating. If you don't fancy getting shot stabbed and hacked to bits for your rock then this game is not for you. It gets easier once youre established but its harder than ever to get established with the ""New"" Rust. Animals being very scarce and when you do get close to one it runs away. Fair enough its supposed to be hard but how the hell are you supposed to make a sleeping bag without cloth ? Ahhhh of course run around killing other players and stealing there stuff. Of course.

It's made up of retards who still think the legacy branch is being updated (this game hasn't had updates for months!!) crybabies who got killed in a survival game and can't quit bitching about it and blaming the developers and people complaining about the overrun of ""hackers"" which are probably legitimate players but managed to kill their victim in one shot from a far with a rifle.Rust legacy branch or current branch (imo legacy is better) is a good game and is definitely worth your money if you know you're not buying pre alpha games and expecting a bug free finished product like most people seem to think in the Steam Community. It's especially fun on legacy when you gather up some friends on a modded server that increases the pace of the game you round up all your resources and you start blasting motherfuckers who come on your turf.If you notice that your game runs like (particularly in the main branch) stop trying to run everything on ""fantastic"" settings with your shitty HP laptop and switch it down to ""fastest"" trust me it works.In short Rust is good if you know how to play it and you're fully aware it isn't a finished product.

2015-01-13,0,0,1035,True,Not Recommended,Rust legacy was the perfect game ever made. Unfortunately Garry s new vision has clouded his judgment. The new Rust lacks every positive aspect of the old game. It is just a sugar coated cleaned up b st rdization of the Rust brand. All Gary has to do to attain the title of best game creator ever is to do something (anything) about all the cheaters (everyone cheats) on legacy Rust. Gary scrap the new Rust realize your mistake and focus all of your time and attention towards fixing what works legacy Rust.This game was fun when it was legacy rust and probably would have been really fun if they kept adding content to legacy rust and fixed some of the memory issues. However Gary decided to go off and do something that made no sense with no real plan and ruined it completley. So don't buy it. If you do buy it you're pretty much just donating $20 to Garys Lamborghini fund because I have yet to see the millions of dollars in sales put back into making this game good.

I find there is too many guns armor and impossible to do anything unless you have the top guns and armor. If not then goodluck at getting nowhere.

2016-07-24,0,0,65,True,Recommended,Rust is a cool game. it is similar to H1Z1 Survival mode. Rust is more hard than H1Z1. It is realy hard game that you will die milions of times. What is cool about this game that they have Anti Cheat that ban people all the time. So hacking isn't a good idea in this game and this is what i like the most.I played this game with 200+ Ping with americans it the game has no lag. it is all fine. I recommend this game to people who like to play in survival games that take soo mutch time. What is bad in this game that if you get off the game your body will still inside the game so they can be killed while you are not online. So you need to make sure that you keep your charactar inside a safe base that is locked very well.What i most hate in this game that there are many kids and idiots who will annoy you and kill you everytime they see you for fun even if you told them that you are new in the game and you are trying to find out how to play this game Because people our bases like 3 times in 1 Day. we were moving from a base to another building everytime. So We found out that we need to make a very huge base that has milion of doors that you need one guy or two taking their hole time upgrading the base to the safest and the strongest upgrade to avoid kids from breaking your house easly.This game is cool.,Rust

2015-07-04,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,First things first I'm playing on Linux. Any persons interested in playing this one Linux or SteamOS with a future steam machine should run away now. The games concept is great but Facepunch needs to care more about it's users.I say that because almost every time I try to play a new game breaking bug has been introduced. Conveniently the worst bugs appear on Linux too likely due to a complete lack of testing (Garry has even admitted they don't test it on Linux).What has motivated me to write this review is a bug with the Unity engine. It was introduced around the 25th of June and causes keyboard input to allow only one press per key. I think everyone would agree that such a bug makes the game unplayable. Most would also probably say it should be a priority to fix this issue. Sadly Garry's response to such a bug was to say Linux is a second class citizen in his eyes. To add to that a fix for the issue is weeks off because they would rather wait for the Unity devs to solve it.For some perspective the Cities Skylines devs introduced the same bug with their last update a few days ago. They'd simply missed it in their quality assurance. Despite missing it the issue was fixed in a matter of hours after being reported so there's definitely a method to work around it. Yet the Rust devs are opting to render support for a whole operating system of users obsolete.TL DR Run if you use Linux or SteamOS. Facepunch and Garry don't care about you in the slightest.Update Over one year later. Still not recommended. Sure it looks prettier but little has changed. It's like they're stuck in a loop of adding things scraping what they added then re adding it in a different way. Doesn't help that the genre is massively over crowded either.,Rust

I'v been following this game since its start way back when i didn't have a gaming pc. After years of waiting i finally got a gaming laptop a few weeks ago. It can run pretty much anything at high or ultra settings. I even checked game debate to see if my rig can run it which it said it could on high settings. I splurged on steam and this was one of my top picks. Now a lot of youtubers and regular gamers have said that this game could run on pretty much any pc high end or low end. GREAT! right? Well see thats the problem It runs like a one legged dog. I mean what the heck!? I understand that it is STILL EARLY ACCESS but Day Z runs WAY better than this. Optimiztion is what they should be working on more than freakin' features in my opinion. Come on man!EDIT 9/30it actually was running on integrated graphics card i found out. fixed it getting decent fps but not like i would with the original rust.

2015-11-28,1,1,5,False,Not Recommended,**Looking at the steam store page for Rust now July 2018 it's hard to tell if any of my previous criticisms have been addressed or not. Go look an expert's review instead!***EDIT SINCE GAME CAME OUT OF EARLY ACCESS (FEB 10 2018) Looking at the 11th screenshot on Rust's store page should tell you more about this game than anyone can put into words.*(OLD REVIEW)A game that has been in development for two years or more should not be in Alpha still and worst yet at its price for this unpolished rock.My main gripe is that server loading is glitchy as hell on the new system even with low graphics resulting in crashes even though this computer can handle plently of gruntier games.If only people would stop supporting unoptimised infinate alpha/beta games that milk the customer until the game comes into a 'completed' phase where its barely any better than what it was before. I object to this continued treatment Steam wide.EDIT DECEMBER 2017 Still in alpha 2017! Maybe they should think about finishing the game instead of just accepting more purchases.

2014-02-17,0,0,15,True,Recommended,So it's a bit addictive but at the same time frustrating. Some players are very heplful but some will take you out at first sight for no reason other than to steal what you have. Sadly that's usually someone with more and better gear than you have. Then you re spawn with a rock torch and two bandages. And nothin' else. You'd best hope you had time to build a shelter and sleeping bag or bed.Super early Alpha but it's pretty fun despite the frustration of kill on sight players. Which always bugs me in a game that's not strictly a PVP first person shooter. I can see great things. As usual if you can get this on sale and like the survival/crafting genre then it's probably worthwhile.,Rust
2018-01-03,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,Fun game nice to be able to play with a large number of other players. However the contstant wipes of everything is pretty annoying. Most servers wipe (AKA delete everything and start over) every week. There are some that are monthly but that isn't guaranteed when there are forced wipes. I just bought the game and picked a server that was supposed to be good for a month only to find out that tommorow everything gets deleted across all servers in the entire game.So essentially everything you do in the game is completely pointless because in X days everything gets deleted and you have to start over from scratch.Accumulate several hours over the span of a week building up your base and such... then *WIPE* start over.

The animals are just walking around minding their own buisness everything is peaceful. A few minutes later you spot a road and start walking down it. You walk up to an abandoned town and find some pants and a package of anti radiation pills. Then you spot someone else. Someone clothed and has equipment. You walk up to him wondering if he can help you. He then takes his M4 and puts a bullet through your head.You wake up in the middle of a grassy field alone naked with nothing but a rock a couple of bandages and a torch. You now know not to approach anyone for your own safety. Then you kill an animal in order to get raw chicken from an animal that isn't a chicken. Delicious.

On more populated servers there is problem. With everyone killing you on sight you will never get enough. For those that been on the server for a long time they just get stronger and stronger giving you no chance to even build a base with enough defenses. You spawn walk around 10mins dead...5 mins dead....20 mins dead. This is partly due to the game being far to difficult.

2014-01-28,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,"It's a early alpha game not much to say. The ""What the developer says"" section tells nothing about what's going on. Basically in game you have two materials to build stuff with wood and steel that's it. The graphics are very muddy at best with trees clipping to see through things the creation system is unintuitive at best with only basic thing to make even with schematics it seems like I've seen it all. Playing this without a friend is simply dreadful while the community is a little bit better than Infestation's and DayZs you're still killed left and right until you find some real armor or any armor. Guns even things out as people aren't as willing to shoot a armed person after that it's basically a grind for more resources get to base build then stare down the occasional passerby. Overall the game needs a lot of work but as it's P2P at twenty dollars I'm going to judge it as is early access titles shouldn't be happening often unless it's in a open beta stage at best. If you want a minecrafty survival game you found it. Minecraft still has bugs so the jump shouldn't be too hard for people.

2017-02-01,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,Work hard to gather minerals without dying. Then work hard to build a base to start being able to have weapons and storage. Get raided base destroyed. Start over. Get rekt by clans non stop. Get shot on sight by just about everyone. No dangerous npcs except for bears and if you shoot at dogs and they are easy. Tiny towns stutter problems not even remotely realistic crafting. Basically if you want to play a game that is brutal to do anything and then once you do build something high enough to have enough stuff all to just have it wiped buy and play Rust.,Rust

This game is survival like no other. I also only recommend this to people who can deal with hackers. People speed hacking clipping through walls flying aimbots the list goes on.Rust has a major problem with hackers. I've reported several hackers only to reveal they were still on Rust.

2014-01-24,1,3,135,True,Recommended,I love how great this game is even if it is still in alpha. You make bases go out to craft resources go into a radiation town were you are next to guaranteed to get into a fight.... Awesome.Not only are you trying to survive but you also need to kill to survive... kill people..Even when you are at te stage where you think you wouldn't need to get resources you still do.Crafting C4 is tedius but fun because there is a massive reward for it at the end.This reward? Raiding bases getting their loot..The problem? Picking the right baseThe solution? Be smart.Great game even more fun with games here's in example of a raid on an empty base hope to see you on..http //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1C_uLJ7nZuM,Rust
2014-06-20,0,0,63,True,Recommended,"This game is one of the most promising multiplayer games I've ever seen. For starters its content is refreshing and while clearly similar in some aspects to other survival games it still has it's own original feel to it. At the time I'm writing this the game is still in alpha but holy it's incredible. There is no other game that makes my heart race like it does when I'm raiding someone's camp or someone is raiding mine. There is a brilliant balance between the punishment for death and reward for killing. Killing a new player gets you nothing. A rock. Literally a rock. But kill a player that's had some time to craft weapons and gather useful material and you can go from ""rocking"" trees for wood to having your own fortress defendable with an arsenal of weapons. Of course you don't have to kill anyone. You could work together with friends (which FYI is so much fun I actually bought a freind of mine the game so we could play together) and create some sort of team fortress or two. The game also does a great job of giving you a second chance in case of death so you don't just get frustrated and quit. Once you die if you respawn and return to the place you met your demise and assuming another player didn't kill you and get your stuff you can retrieve your crap and just continue playing where you left off. All in all this game is incredible and based on what I've seen on /r/playrust it looks like there is still a lot more to come. BUY THIS GAME.",Rust

Back then it was game...graphics animations even gamplay...pure (but i kinda enjoyed it).Then they decide they'll stop to update old rust and make new one from scratch.Everyone was excited about new Rust so was I. Game finally went in a good direction. I jumped in game now an then to see whats new...game looked gorgeus but sadly really badly optemised (still is unoptimised)...really Rust became a really good game that u would enjoy. Lately game went into deep again. Game is unbalanced (XP system) unoptimised (before month or so i would get 100 an more FPS now barely 50) broken animations (reloading...people would say u need to wait till animation finishes...I wait and there is still no bullets in my gun because of few seconds after real animation ended).And then you have beautiful toxic scumbagy Rust community full of 12 year olds. I mean if ur ok with things i listed up there go for it...ur probably 12 year old buying games with ur moms credit card (jk luv u)...but personaly i wouldn't waste my money onto this game not yet. )Edit last update fixed a optimisation thing a little bit.,Rust

2016-11-07,1,1,608,True,Not Recommended,EVERY server either has hackers or clans of 10 20 people who each dump 18 hours a day into rust and will out grind you every month. I have had countless hours of fun on rust. But if you aren't willing to play the game like it's shift work you won't succeed. I'm tired of lying to myself that rust will ever become anything than the most toxic game I think I have ever played. It is not remotely a survival game anymore. You will spawn into a server with already massively constructed bases with try hards playing tower defense shooting at you for fun. You and your peasant friends will have some fun fighting a bandit or hunting a deer and then everything you have will be destroyed by a clan. And most of the time these guys suck at pvp but when you have a bow going up against 12 of them blowing your base up it is impossible. It has always been that way and will always be that way. And the game will never come out of early access the bears still walk into your house after all of the content they have added. it will slowly die as people stop playing.

2014-01-29,0,0,90,True,Recommended,"This game is one of the most brutal PvP games I've ever had the chance to play. I played DayZ when it was starting and growing as an Arma2 mod and that was fine and dandy but this game takes the cake. The crafting system is more of what DayZ needs and with the plentiful expansions that will be coming in future weeks and months this game is shaping up to be the essence of an ""MMO"" survival game. The server size is just right for the size of the map guns feel rightly powerful for everything you go through to make them (or take them) and building a house in a game has never made me struggle to use supplies sparingly as much as Rust does.The one complaint I have currently is the amount of cheaters present in game but I can honestly say that those that I've had the displeasure of meeting and reporting (along with a gorup of reports from friends) haven't been seen again. Last thing play it with friends. Coax them into playing it with you none of you will regret it so long as you help each other out. The map is nowhere near as absurdly huge or barren as Chernarus in DayZ finding your friends won't be extremely difficult and there is definite strength in numbers. Watching a group of seven people in full armor chasing after you with bows and arrows pistols and rifles is probably a frightening sight as I've never been on the other side of it but it's better to be wielding the guns yeah?Overall great as far as Early Access goes some laggy rubberbanding that should be ironed out in the coming weeks but not a bad investment in the slightest.

2014-10-08,0,0,202,True,Not Recommended,"UPDATE I've played the most recent version of RUST as of 12/6/15. Here's an update of my impressions although I still don't recommend the game.Five of my friends and I logged into RUST this weekend starting on Friday. Since the last time I played we enjoyed some quality updates Better graphics and visuals The procedural maps are looking really good They added a cool sleeping bag mechanic where you can assign a sleeping bag to someone on your friend's list. This made it a lot easier to meet up which was a huge issue with the game. The constant lag seems to be mostly gone which is a HUGE plus because combat has been broken in this game since its inception. Some fun new items and mechanics that just add to the experience Wandering attack helicopters that put everyone on the defenseNow in spite of these improvements and additions the game still have one MAJOR flaw it is barely a game. I can only speak for my experiences but my latest was an exercise in futility. I had a rare weekend of nothing to do. So we took a chance on RUST again to check it out. My friends and I played nearly nonstop Friday and Saturday. We built a modest base reinforced it code locked it and did a decent job of defending it here and there. We didn't do much raiding and didn't even get to the point where we could make AK47s or any of the modern weapons or armor.Then Sunday rolls along. I'm up in the morning mining some rocks turning on the furnaces. There's only about 60 people on the server so the danger of being out was minimal. Then I switch it off so I can go to the grocery store and run some errands. Prior to this we mostly had at least one person online at any point. Within 3 hours of being out and returning we logged on to find that we were all dead and our sleeping bags were destroyed. Everything was gone back to square one. No epic fight. No combat gameplay. No competition. We had been killed by some basement dweller with over 3 700 hours logged in RUST. And that was it. Everyone was super discouraged and tired.The issue with RUST is that it doesn't incentivize competition. Instead it encourages the kind of behavior that is the antithesis of competitive gaming. It would be like Starcraft 2 championship taking place while the opponent was AFK. Sorry but raiding AFKs is not a game. If I'm going to lose my base I'd like to go down swinging not while I'm living my REAL life.To make this review more than just a criticism of the ineptitude of the developers I'll add this suggestion. Provide server hosts a new ruleset option one that provides invunlerability to bases doors and theft when the group or player who owns it is offline. To avoid players from exploiting this ruleset add limit to the invulnerability based on the last sustained login so that players can't build walls around vital resources drop a cupboard and then AFK forever with that account.Maybe there are smarter or more clever ways to handle AFK raiding. I would encourage them to focus on that and provide an option so that some servers could continue allowing the mouth breathers with no lives to dominate people trying to get a foothold and then ones where the adults can play and enjoy the rest of the gameplay.Until then RUST is still an avoid at all costs recommendation from me. That is unless you're unemployed live off government assistance have no real life responsibilites friends or interests...in that case RUST is the perfect game for you. 10/10. Neckbeards for life.OLD REVIEW Even with the improvements that come with the experimental version going live I can't recommend this game. It looks nicer now. They took out the modern weapons and added a procedurally generated map which are nice touches. They also modified and simplified the way building is done and it works well. Basically you can simply upgrade walls using materials you've gathered instead of having to rebuild entire structures with better materials.Unfortunately the one element that has made this game difficult to enjoy from day one is still present lag. Sure your connection to a server might show as 70 85ms but not everyone on the server falls into this latency range. There also seems to be a huge problem with rubberbanding. Considering Rust's mostly melee combat system this just ruins the game. Where a game like Chivarly can execute melee combat in a multiplayer setting Rust fails.Let's walk through a typical mostly unfun few hours of Rust.Imagine yourself putting hours into finding the perfect spot and building a modest base for melting down ore. This of course is after you already died 2 6 times trying to get started. You've upgraded your walls to at least level 5 maybe even level 6 on the interior. You've even crafted a regular Hatchet and Pipe Shotgun. Now you think you're ready to hunt the extremely rare animals seriously there are almost no animal spawns in the new version because they are the only way to get cloth. (Sidenote It's easier to get a pipe shotgun than the amount of cloth you'd need for a bow...) You step outside and start gathering. You're carrying the key that unlocks the door to your base. Suddenly a naked guy carrying a rock sees you and comes right at you. You think ""Hey I have a pipe shotgun. I'll let him get real close and then boom."" In a game where the hit detection and lag are obvious you might account for the other guy's lag. In Rust? Nope. Before you can react and well before his character model is in striking distance with his rock you've already taken damage and are bleeding out. You try to fire a few rounds of your pipe shotgun but Mr. 3rd World Internet is rubberbanding like crazy and just spamming his left click attack. A few seconds pass and you bleed to death. This guy who has only been playing for a few minutes at most now has everything you dropped and the keys to your place.You think ""Hey I'll respawn in my sleeping bag and see what I can do."" Unfortunately he finds your place nearby lets himself in with the key he took off you and then kills you with your pipe shotgun.That's it. You have now been set back to square one within less than 1 minute and without much of a fight at all. I'm not hating on this game because the penalties for death are harsh I'm criticizing it because there should be more to the gameplay than simply dying once and losing everything you've done. If I'm going down I want to have fun doing it.Maybe the 2016 version of the Alpha will be better?",Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,1233,True,Recommended,Feel free to read all of the reviews but know this.Rust has its slow points but when the game gets big it gets BIG.No other game will EVER beat the feeling of beating a 1v3 with a bow. It will never beat the tense feeling of raiding bases.Nothing can beat that intense moment of running resources back to base or killing a guy who is COMPLETELY loaded.People WILL kill you on site.People wont always be friendly.People wont always be nice.And you WILL get raided.

2017-12-09,0,0,1492,True,Recommended,This game isn't for the faint of heart. You can spend hours grinding a base and make one bad decision and lose all of your work. That being said thats what makes this game so great. You have to really practice and learn rust to really enjoy it. It can be a very taxing game on your time having to stop auto decay on your base or check to make sure you aren't being offline raided. Overall though the adrenaline rush and the feeling of reward that can come from this game is immense. There are drastic ups and drastic downs in the life of a rust player. Trust no one in this game untill you have played with them for a while. Most of the community are toxic trolls but it still can be fun. There seems to be a lot of praise for the devs on this game. I really do think the devs don't deserve it however. They have had a long time with rust and its still in early access. Rust has been out since 2013 as an alpha early access game. They have worked and reworked systems constantly and can not decide what they like. They scrapped the best system they had only to finally bring it back realizing the mistake they made. The game is worth the price tag but the development team has been far from stellar.,Rust

We built it up to the point where it was almost impenetrable. we sit on our roof waiting for fresh spawns and tell them that we will give them a prize if they kill eachother the prize is some pants. After a while we found a group of 3 or 4 fresh spawns so we ask them to help us raid this guys base. there is 5 of us bashing this guys base with a rock while i play the guitar. Eventually we get in realise that they have nothing so we kill them and leave.10/10 would gather 4 fresh spawns and tell them to bash someones foundation with rocks againin all seriousness tho dont buy this game if you get super salty about losing some stuff,Rust

2014-05-05,0,0,475,True,Recommended,"Rust.Damn frustrating makes you want to smash the hell out of your keyboard. But still is one of the games I'm mostly looking farward to playing more.My first 20 40 hours or so I spend my time running around get killed starting over getting lost gathering stuff get killed starting over getting lost gather stuff get killed building house get killed again starting over over and over. But luckily I never gave up now I gave about 60 hours on record and I know my way around the whole map and fit for fight. I know someone that won't be happy I never gave up when the time's ready I will pay them a little visit. )As long as you don't give up you will learn many important lessons.The hardest part is when you're joining highly populated servers and you're going to start from scratch surrounded by trigger happy gamers with their inventory full of weapons and armor. You can't start up near towns and such and neither live in the land of nowhere. You need to find a good balance between convenience and security and be damn careful.Free tips Get a freakin sleeping bag! Hide it well where no one will look. Don't start around populated areas but still not too far from ressources. Learn the map (www.rustmap.net be aware that the images are a bit outdated) Read up on ""decay settings"" and how that will affect you (most servers have decay enabled) You want to start by making a well hidden secure building. Remember that when you gather blueprints and use them you don't lose them after dying. Might be an idea running around getting to know the map gathering blueprints. But make a sleeping bag so you always spawn at your SAFE WELL HIDDEN base.You will get killed. You will get lost. You'll lose everything. Again and again. This game is a lot like Groundhog Day actually. It will make you furious and you might want to give up and run into the risk of becoming a mad psychopath. But that's okay. Learn from you mistakes and don't give up. If you manage to get past this learning curve I promise you it'll be very awarding. If you don't invest a lot of time in this game this isn't for you.Considering that the game is in alpha stage it's very playable and enjoyable. You will experience bugs and flaws that hasn't stopped me from having a good time. With time it will only get better and better. And you can also access an experimental BETA where you get some ideas of how the game will look in the future.Now go buy the game run around naked hitting wild pigs with a rock until they turn into chicken filets!",Rust

2016-08-23,0,0,13,True,Recommended,"Rust is most certainly worth a look. It has elements that remind me a lot of Minecraft but the way the game approaches the survival aspect is rather enjoyable. You can be dropped into a server and play with others without ever realizing there were people on with you (unless you come across them randomly). One of my most exciting moments were after a failed attempt to capture a supply air drop my buddy and I were walking back through a field in the rainy night. The torch I was using to light my way was the only sorce of light to see with. As we discussed some of the stuff we came across on our failed trek suddenly gunshots wizzed over our heads we scatter into the bush and I extingush my light. Haven't played a game in a long while that got me that excited to be playing. Do I recommend this game? I do. It's got it's quirks but you can paint anything and everything you could dream of on signs. I painted a large ""goat se"" sign on the side of our fort hopefully randoms will come across this beautiful artwork and be awstruck in the wilderness as I was upon seeing it.",Rust

I have 150 hours as of this review and maybe I'm just playing on the right server with the right people but I'm still not tired of it.Yes this game was terrible when I bought it and I put it down for a year but I came back.

2016-01-12,1,1,1770,True,Recommended,First off playing this game by yourself is nearly impossible. Buy your friend a copy and play together to really enjoy it!Day one Wake up on a beach. Run inland get by a bear. Die.Day one (2 min later) Wake up on a beach. Run inland found some stones and wood. Built a shack and upgraded it to stone. Built all kinds of stuff. Someone knocked at the door and I stood there for 5 min with my water pipe shotgun pointed at it but nobody came in. Day two Woke up. Someone came in and me last night. I DONT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!!!Day two (2 hours later) Built another house way away from others. I figured out I could loot barrels trash airdrops etc. I learned how to make wooden walls! Ended up putting down about 15 high wooden walls. Day three I woke up alive! Walked out my front door only to find my entire house surrounded by bear traps...Rust Single handedly the most fun survival game to play IF you have friends to play with. Without friends you're an easy target. I found that most people are willing to help you out. Larger population servers are meat grinders. I spawned and died so many times because people would wait to get the kills. Since FacePunch is finally nearly done with Alpha I can't wait to see what kind of optomizaitons they're going to do. My PC runs it like its nothing. My Surface Pro3 runs it like it's nothing as well. Great game! ProTip Play with friends to have the best experience. StayAway Don't go into a game thinking you're going to dominate. This game has a way of killing you at the most inopportune times.Rust in one sentence Imagine working REALLY hard all day to get everything you need or want just to go to sleep and wake up and it's all gone.,Rust

2016-11-23,0,0,380,True,Recommended,(If you don t want to read all this the bottom line is Rust is one of the best survival games in my option and I recommend buying it if you are interested in a fun survival games solo or with friends.)Do you like to build?Do you like to craft?Do you like to raid other people?If you answered yes to any of these questions than you should buy Rust.Rust is a game where you grind for resources till you have enough stone metal frags sulfur ect to either build up your base and or make a base or start crafting different tools and weapons. You can craft such weapons as a bolt action a semi auto rifle a pipe shotgun and many more. You use these weapons for either self defense or hunting down other players and killing them for their loot on their body. You can also craft different types of armor and cloths. For your base you would want to build a safe and defendable base against raiders. You probably want to make your loot room somewhere safe inside your base and also have a second or higher floor with windows so you can protect your base if any raiders decide to raid you when you are online. You can also raid other players bases using C4 satchel charge rockets and any other creative way to get inside another players base. There are many many elements in Rust and I recommend you explore them all. I give it a 9/10,Rust

2013-12-19,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Rust is a great survival game. It is in Alpha so the servers often are wiped due to the constant updates.

2013-12-17,0,0,38,True,Recommended,In a few weeks and months this game will be a MUST BUY game. I have only played for about two hours now but I already highly recommend Rust. If you get past the fact that you get killed by mostly everyone that sees you you'll see potention in this game. It wont be another WarZ. The only issues about this game is that stone and animals are never to be seen most of the time and when I see them they're surrounded by zombies. Now this might just be me but when I am not getting ripped apart by zombies or getting shot up by some dude. I always end up starving to death. Another issue I have seen is that the map seems to be a little bit too tiny and I hop the developers work on that. I cannot get into the valley without seeing 4 naked guys and about 6 guys who are all stacked up. This is Alpha of course and I hope they will work on these things. Like before I highly recommend this game. If you enjoyed DayZ or Minecraft this will probably be the best game you have ever played. Just look past the fact that its in Alpha and look in the future to see the potentiol of this game.,Rust

Whether you are playing as a lone wolf a bandit a good ""peacekeeper"" or as a large team with friends you are able to get extremely emmersed into the game. The combat system is amazing and make tactics and timing an essential to winning a fight. It basically takes a military simulator such as arma and combines it with a survival game such as Minecraft. I am one of the lucky few who can play the game on the max graphical settings and i must say it looks very much like real life. The light refraction and reflection are insanely realistic. The only things in my opinion that could make the game better would be weather rivers and lakes vehicles and more wepons. The rest is amazing.",Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,48,True,Recommended,"This game... is ridiculous. It appears to be nothing more than a complicated starvation simulator.HOWEVER... it's also incredibly fun and nerve wracking. Finding other players is absolutely terrifying because you never know if they're going to kill you and raid your shelter but at the same time you don't want to log off and have them do it anyway. And if you play with friends? Awesome!My only grip is the fact that right now it really is nothing more than a starvation simulator and you become very hungry very quickly you don't spawn with a full stomach and when you're starting off you will likely die a multitude of times attempting to gather enough supplies and food to survive just one more in game day.Some basic console commands would also be incredibly useful such as ""toggle grass"" because it would vastly improve graphical performance on low to mid range systems.Also be sure to check your window size and graphic settings in the launch menu as they constantly change to random offsets.",Rust

2016-01-20,1,1,1418,True,Recommended,I lived in a community of people that was getting raided. I was one of the first few to get raided mostly cus I just lived in a sniper tower on the edge. Ran inside as I saw the raiders coming was still fairly new to the game and the snipers tower was a sorta gift from a buddy. Just a stone 2x2 tower with scrap metal door vs. 10+ guys with ak's and rpgs. I had no weapons and I knew they were gunna break in eventually. So I made them tell me knock knock jokes while they started pickaxeing my stone walls. When they only told two jokes I had told them that I accepted death and will be sitting by the campfire with a guitar when they got in. They eventually just rpg'd my door and shot me in the face. It was a alright time.10/10 would make raiders tell knock knock jokes again before accepting death while playing some rocking solos,Rust

2015-05-13,0,0,1127,True,Recommended,"At 91 hours I am really enjoying Rust. It could be this way because the server I am playing on has really friendly admins that don't interfere with the players. There are a few facts that must be understood at the moment I am reviewing (may 13th 2015) and should not be reflected on in any future plans or changes due to the development state of Rust This is a multiplayer only game the only thing close to single player is acquiring a server and applying a limit too who may connect. This can be frustrating and glorious at the same time overall it has a many different types of unexplainable in game challenges. I have only played on the vanilla servers so far but modded servers will give you a different game experience from the videos I have seen in the community.There is a ""highly specialized"" game development cycle. There may be a patch every week up too every month where they may also ""wipe"" the servers. Usually this does not seem to wipe the blueprints you may have previously found but on the vanilla servers the ""world"" is wiped. This means simply that your buildings and items you have found will be gone and you must start as a fresh spawn. After the patch has been launched some servers may elect to change their ""seed"" and create a brand new map. These game cycles create a fold within the community where users can take advantage of the weekly to monthly patch cycles and create events that seem to complement the pains of losing all your digital lootz.There seems to be a high level of investigation and information exposure by all players in the game. All data seems valuable in Rust. This may be just from people learning how to play base locations blueprints or people creating prophetic plans to destroy you and collect all of your items. Many people will enjoy your trust but many may also exploit it. If you can handle getting your dreams crushed then this game is for you. 1 055.8 hrs on record still recommend the game but it is not the same as when anyone started. The dynamics are changing greatly between patches and early access content is getting released and tested really fast.",Rust

2014-08-31,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,I would recommend this game for people who play with friends often. In other words single player is a pain in the at the moment due to hackers and raiding clans. If you jump in with a friends you have the advantage of spending less time starting up. This can be a big help when dealing with the first and major problem (hackers using aimbots and speedhacks). The second problem can be easily fixed by either building a fort or getting a group of friends yourself. I can only recommend this game once they implement a very strong dectection software for these low life hackers.,Rust

2016-06-17,0,0,482,True,Recommended,I've spent 200 hours playing Rust at this time and I plan to keep on playing it. Rust is a game like many others where it is better with other people but you don't have to play with people you already know you can find other people and team up with them. The Rust community isn't the best most encounters will come down to 'kill or be killed' and even though this can be quite annoying when trying to start off it's even more comforting when you find someone who chooses not to kill you. I would recommend playing with a friend at first so that you have a better chance of survival in those dreaded encounters!Apart from the kill on sight thing that seems to happen quite frequently this game is really addictive one of the best early access games out there with one of the most reliable dev teams behind it. There are also weekly updates that ensure the game never really gets boring. QuantuumUPDATE 2017 After saying all this I've not spent much time playing the game which is a shame because I really do enjoy the game but I've become bored of the progressional system it feels like it takes too long to make any progress but battlefield servers take away from the core basis of the game if they somehow found a way to find a middle ground between the two then this game would be perfect. If you've just bought the game then you'll probably still have a lot of time having fun. I feel that I probably played too much too soon and I exhausted the game of its enjoyability and in time I'll come back to it. Quantuum,Rust
2016-08-11,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,As of now the current state of this game is horrendous.*The leveling system is garbage and is obviously there to make you grind even more than you already need to.*Hunger drains way too fast and most foods only fill up around 5% of your food bar.*Animals clip through mountains rocks and other things that make getting food to fill your abyss of a stomach even harder.*The amount of resources you collect and use are rediculous. Why are there stacks of 1 000 and why does making a machete require 100 pieces of metal? Following Minecraft's footsteps and making stacks small and craft requirements reasonable would be a wise decision.*Growing food takes way too long. I end up starving to death waiting for corn to grow.*The game's essentially made for people to greif and loot. When you leave the game your body lays on the floor where you were last at even when you lay down a sleeping bag. My character ended up getting looted inside of my armored house because his foot clipped outside the walls. This is incredibly annoying because my character was at the oposite side of the house from my sleeping bag instead of just being in the bag sleeping. I understand that this is an alpha build at the moment however it seems like these decisions were intentional. It's essentially a kick in the nuts to find out that the 7.1 hours you spent bashing a rock with a rock to get just the basics can be all for nothing because the game doesn't despawn your character when you leave the game.I see potential in this game however the mix of bad decisions bad AI programming and bad balancing make me want to find a way to return the Humble Bundle I spent 5.05$ on.Not anywhere worth 20$ in this state.,Rust

Then there is the otherside I hate this game with a flaming passion. It makes you want to eat your mouse and put a hole in your monitor but it always makes you come back for more.

The developers are very active listen to the community and the progress they make each week is great. I really like the direction they are taking the game. It has a lot of potential but is also fun already if you like brutal survival games. In my opinion it is worth the money already.,Rust
2015-02-14,2,1,476,True,Recommended,I awoke on a white sandy beach. It was calm quiet peaceful. I gazed over the water into the beautiful sunrise when I heard a soft pitter patter. I turned to see the source of the noise. It was a naked black man approaching me with open arms He looked so very kind. I eased forward to greet the naked man. He stopped for a moment seemingly mystified by me. He began to reach for something in his inventory a gift? He smiled then he raised up an AK47 and shot me seven times. I screamed in agony before the naked man began bashing me with a rock.Next I awoke on a white sandy beach. It was calm quiet peaceful. I gazed over the water into the beautiful sunrise before wandering about and stumbling upon a corpse that looked just like me. I took my rock into my hands and smashed the corpse into pieces. I sat on the beach and thought about what I had done. I sat on this white sandy beach. It was calm quiet peaceful. I gazed over the water into the beautiful sunrise while I slowly ate my own battered body.white sandy beach/10 would AK47 again beautiful sunrise to a friend,Rust

2013-12-28,0,0,78,True,Recommended,You start off in the woods naked (literally) a gray screen filter fades and you see trees rocks grass all around you. Your objective? Stay alive. This game has a real interesting way of introducing survival aspects with the way it has body affects such as cold and hunger but in a much more dynamic way than other games with this mechanic such as Infestation and DayZ. You need to chop down shoot cook and steal anything that is in your way. You need to find blueprints to make new weapons medkits and structures. Make bases sleeping bags doors to keep the main enemy the player as far away from you as possible. The game really makes you feel like you are alone and no one is there to help you players that find you usually kill you on sight the game really is a kill or be killed situation which is amazing though does not go without it's faults. For an alpha it is great but I do hope they add some type of friend system in the game where it doesn't immediately teleport you to your friends or anything but shows you where they are using some sort of directional arrow. That being said the game being in this state I would give it a 10/10. I hope to see more updates to this game from Garry and his Team.,Rust

2018-06-21,2,1,567,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is pretty great but if you enjoy having fun this game isn't for you. The entire game is about survival of the fittest so going into it you expect to die and get ed over. And that happens a lot. You'll get pretty far into it thinking maybe just this once I can make a respawn point only for someone to one hit you with a bow and you lose two hours of progress and everything you've worked on. It's fun for awhile except you don't ever get past that part. You can't make friends because half the people either don't have mics or don't give a and good luck staying alive for more than three minutes tops. You'll find something then get on. You'll die over and over and the fun parts of the game get quickly drowned out by the constant respawning and lack of any progress at all. Good game player base.,Rust

Even self proclaimed PvE servers don't have the tools to make it a completely pure PvE server. It's just generally bad lacking and .Forced character gender is also something they can shove right back up.Go play Call of Duty or Counter Strike it doesn't have any of the grinding involved.I give this game a 2/10 it has potential but so do so many other games and they're already hundreds of times better.,Rust

He is only wearing pants. He looks so peaceful as he rests. His body slightly vibrating from server latency his hands tucked underneath his head to mimic a makeshift pillow. As I watch him sleep I begin to contemplate my actions. What should I do? How do i respond to this situation? I remind myself Rust is about survival and only the strong survive. Proceed to fill him full of 556 ammo using my bolt action rifle equipped with a laser sight. He is dead. I feel guilty. I killed an person all that is left is a backpack. He is gone from this world.

The community is just rude now and no longer friendly. A lot of servers are pay to win (pay us money to keep the server going and we give you a bunch of free stuff aka VIP packages). I do not recommend the game in it's current state maybe if they add the zombies back in PVE servers will be fun but they're boring and PVP servers are just impossible if you dont play day one and play every day you stop for a single day you've been offline raided.

I had one experience in this game in which I was stuck in my base by a guy that was enraged not to mention he had a few buddy's. My conclusion was that his life was filled with stress probably overwhelmed. Back to the story. He was out there for a while I grabbed some food and came back after about 10 minutes. Not suprisingly he was still there. So I came up with the brilliant idea that if he could sit outside I could sit inside with a little twist of course. I pulled up an audio clip of noises that came from a base (Footsteps hatches doors and not to mention leaving the furnaces on). I then left for a extended period of time that being 2 or so hours. I came back and a different group was at the door door camping of course. At first I thought the same guys were still out there but I was wrong gladly. The other group wasnt to far off though and not to mention I am a solo and both groups are 3+. I went and got a semi and lured the other group over provoking a giant gun fight. One guy stood from the active door campers and I had no hesitation to clean him up So I did. That was the moment I realised what rust really was and how it works. With the right attitude and mindset anything is possible. From then on I never filled myself with the anger and toxicity of the game and instead enjoyed it for what it it.,Rust

Ну а если ты все таки тот счастливчик у которого откуда не возьмись оказался такой комп то тебе по адресу.Обращение к тем кто ""слышал про эту игру и может быть купит"" если вам нравится хардкорное выживание с присутствием других игроков то Rust для вас! 2.Минусы.1)Когда я первый раз зашел в Rust я слегка расстроился (. Было такое ..ощущение неудволетворения. Вроде бы дорогая игра а земля не копается и камень не разбивается (. Но поверьте стоит посмотреть пару видео на ютубе в стиле гайдов или же пообщаться с другим игроком в раст с целью обьяснить тебе что да и как и ты поймешь что мысли о том что ""зачем я ее купил?! Возврат средств!"" Пройдут)Ты поймешь ее главные основные правила и возможности и будешь играть пытаться что то сделать.У тебя конечно могут возникнуть какие то вопросы по самому геймплею (как найти металл высокого качества например но это все поправимо опять же просмотром видеоролика на ютубе или подсказкой профи друга играющего в Rust.2)Производительность.Пожалуй это главный минус раста (. После игры в GTA V на ультрах вам придется принять серьездный нравственный выбор и выставить скорее всего все настройки на минимум. Прям на самый минимум. Это как никак самая требовательная игра за 2к16 год и надеяться на ""ульты"" думаю не стоит.3.Плюсы.1)Проработка. Разработчики этой игры постарались не только над графикой но и над проработкой геймплея причем неплохо так постарались. Раст очень сильно затягивает когда играешь один не говоря об игре с друзьями.В общем говоря эта игра оправдает ваши ожидания и вы без затруднений сможете согласиться с тем что не зря ее куплили)",Rust

2014-01-16,1,2,107,True,Recommended,"I built a majestic wooden palace in a secluded dense forest. From time to time a weary traveler would come past and be in awe of this mighty structure that provides shelter from the elements and beasts (people as well I guess). I would welcome them with open arms if they were a naked man with nothing but a rock. It is of course the right thing to do.I assure them the shotgun is for protection not only for me but them as well. I invite them in from the cold with the promise of a warm fire and food in their belly. In a world as brutal as Rust it is rare to meet a kind soul offering shelter and food not many can resist this offer. Once he is inside I lead him through several doors which lead to a sunken pit room with an open ceiling. I then lock the door behind him.It is only then he realises the true nature of the situation as the floor beneath him is full of backpacks and bodies. I throw scraps of chicken to my new captive from the open ceiling above. Another weary traveler walks by I invite him inside for a can of beans. My prisoner screams at the top of his lungs ""DON'T TAKE THE BEANS IT'S A LIE!"" but it is already too late. He too is trapped. Soon enough they have 3 more friends and I make them fight each other to the death for scraps of food for my amusement. It is prisoner number 7 who changes the game forever. The 4 remaining prisoners combine their limited resources to build a stair case out of the pit. It is then the hunt for the most dangerous game begins. There is no exit all windows are barred. There are no weapons only an 8 story tall maze building and a man wielding a shotgun hunting for you.There were many screams that evening and people passing by quickly fled. By morning only I remained. Preparing a meal for the next person to come to my home.11/10 would hunt man again.",Rust

Its nothing like that. when you build a house grass comes out of your wooden floors. when you go hunting... you never see any animals that dont attack and if you do there gaurded by bears and wolves. Everytime u go hunting you will just die from a bear falling out of the sky. When you make friends you'll most likely get shot and get your stuff taken from you. If you bring a friend to play the game it takes a hour to find your friend and when you do you and your friends will most likely die from a wolf. and then find your friend all over again. The smelting and door locking in this game is confusing. AirDrops happen rarely and when they do you will just get gunpowder. when you go loot a village you will die from radiation the only way not to die from that if from a radiation suit. and when you do have ur suit on and loot a village theres nothing there execpt already looted chest. And when you think everything is good with your armor and your bow and all that. you will get shot from a player Your friend or get 10 flying bears chase you. 1/20,Rust

2016-04-21,0,0,191,True,Not Recommended,I've tried Rust in legacy and now it's new format and I find both have the same fundamental problem. This game rewards stealing and griefing (destroyers) above gathering and building (creators) which inevitably leads to servers dying and there being a ridiculous number of abandoned buildings.Why do I think this is inevitable with this game's model?The only time the destroyers are having fun is by taking advantage of the creators who by necessity have to take more risks in the game (they have to be looking at a rock or tree and making noise while the destroyers just have to run around listening for the sounds of gathering or building). As a map matures the creators stop having any chance at all of advancing far enough to compete with the destroyers as they have already compiled the resources of many other creators and all the supply drops they monopolize.In the end the only people left on the server are the destroyers who now can only fight the other destroyers which is not the easy gains they are accustomed to so they abandon ship and look for a server that wiped recently to restart the process.Until they fix the broken game loop this game will always be a pretty terrible experience for anyone who wants to roleplay and create instead of play deathmatch on a big map.,Rust

Gather loot from trees or kill naked guys farming wood you decide how you want to play the game. Don't trust anyone but at the same time if you have a mic and find the right person to watch your back you can have a real good time with this game. It is one of the best early access games you can buy right now and there is always a new devlog out on Friday. Garry from Gmod is making this so you know he isn't going to just leave it like He wan't people to make mods and game modes for it so even when the game is done and all the final touches are made there is always going to be someone making new guns/craftables to add to their moded server so that the game keeps evolving. $20 well spent I have spent more than that and gotten a ass game. $20 is a safe buy for something that you can pick up and see what is new and going on on a weekly basis.,Rust

This game is so interesting and always fresh because you cannot plan what is going to happen next. as much as this game makes me rage and shout i always come back to this game because i know that i cannot have that much fun anywhere else. I was playing this from legacy and i have over 1000 hours in this. i cannot have enough.

2018-02-11,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,"Rust is an extreme time waster in the worst possible way. The ""time investment risk"" ratio is terrible. You could spend hours on end grinding to create a decent base all for a clan/small team to just destroy it all in minutes when you're offline. This type of play style throws a huge disadvantage in the direction of the casual players. If you want to be good at Rust you need to be prepared to allocate a massive chunk of your time to it.The community is shocking and the lack of a deterrent to kill players results in a ""Kill on sight even if your character is naked and has nothing of value"" mindset which just ruins the game even more.Imagine writing a 10 page essay. It took you five hours. It was the ultimate grind. Word crashes you lose everything. Rust is this exact scenario in video game format.",Rust

2017-01-30,0,0,630,True,Not Recommended,"EDIT UPDATE 3/8/17 WHY MAURINO BERRY SHOULD STILL BE FIRED EDITION.So you see a lot of older users in the community having a grudge against new updates. If you read closely the game dev blog you will see who plagues and ruins this game. Usually whatever has the name Maurino Berry means that your gaming experience will be demoted.The guy literally has the touch of Midas but whatever he touches turns to After ruining the damage rates of lower tier weapons (AKA REDUCING CROSSBOW/SPEAR/BOW DAMAGE) and ruining all the raid system his plague has reached late game Ruining the aiming system with an rng cone and then trying to half fix it with a toddler recoil pattern. Mate I know you suck at your job but in case you want to get an idea You live in U.K. I guess where the facepunch studios are. Try to go to a shooting range or go for vacation to US. Pick up an automatic rifle. Shoot in burst fully auto and single shots. Record results. Try to mimic this into the game. If you are too much of a to do that ask a person that has handled a rifle . PICK UP YOUR PHONE FIND WHERE YOUR CLOSEST MILITARY OFFICE IS AND ASK THEM WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN. THANK THEM. DONE.You are achieving demand destruction in unprecedented scales. LOOK AT THE GAME. SERVERS HAVE A LIFE OF 6 HOURS. WHY?It is the time a person needs to find a radsuit.Go to launch site.camp the ladder.get rifle bodies.Make rifles. Kill people with crossbows. Server dies. Maurino Berry still gets to have a job.Normally the reason you have 5 tiers of durability walls is the stages that the game should be experienced. Caveman (Bow/spear/eoka/rock/bone armor/bone weapons/twig structures).Early civilization (Stone wood tools Crossbow Waterpipe beancan wooden armor wooden structures)At this point if the game was balanced you could enhance this era.""mid game"" (Revolver semi automatic rifle road sign armor you could put a mortar here or something worse than a rocket launcher stone structures)late game (semi automatic pistol custom smg rocket launcher grenades facemask Iron stuctures iron tools)end game (the meme weapons you have made so far C4 Better rocket launcher scopes everything that a guy with a stone wouldnt know in 6 hours reinforced structure)Now I know this might sound weird to you but people would like to have time intervals that they could compete you know. In order to enjoy the game.So either you'd have to come up with something smart or something linear to allow progression in between those phases in a span of a month. So people who enter the server the first week for example are together with the rest of the server in the caveman age. But the cavemen of the first day have more resources and a bigger base. The resources can be utilized when the second phase kicks in (hint Make the airdrop drop the recipes. When the first team picks the recipes 6 hours later the rest of the people can pick them up). So a PVE event triggers the change in the phase and those that get the first airdrop get to enjoy the current average lifetime of rust servers (6 hours). Make raiding entirely possible in each phase. So twig era can raid twigs mid era can raid stone etc. If they want more defence they have to build bigger. not a 2x1 stone square with an iron door which needs the latest game explosive to be raided. HOW DENSE ARE YOU TO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT 6 HOURS OF SERVER LIFETIME WITH A GAMEPLAY THAT INVOLVES BUILDING a 2x1 STONE CRAP IS WASTING THE POTENTIAL OF GARRY'S IDEA. YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW. JUST UTILIZE WHAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE 5 ERAS OF EQUIPMENT AND A BUILDING SYSTEM THAT WORKS. G E T Y O U R S H I T T O G E T H E Rsomewhere around 1/3/164 years in development. Still everyone in this game has no hair. N O HAIR. There are horses you can't ride them.You can figure out how to build an assault rifle from scratch but god forbid you tried to make anything like a catapult of siege equipment. Now grenades do not deal damage to buildings.Anything that was good about this game has been modified/removed/tweaked into forcing you to follow the standard meta which so far leads to the death of servers. (ESPECIALLY ANYTHING DONE UNDER THE NAME OF MAURNO BERRY PLEASE FIRE HIM ALREADY).The first time something slightly interesting popped up was the plantation/crop system. But be sure if users find a way to have fun Mauricio Berry will modify it into a lukewarm boring friendly for 12year olds with 2 hours in game experience.Until he is removed from the development team I firmly believe that this game will devolve to garbage.Do not buy until they remember what they were aiming to develop. A RUTHLESS SURVIVAL GAME NOT MAURINO BERRY FEELINGS ARE SAFE WITH ME SIMULATOR (NO RAID PLS NO FRESHSPAWN KILL PLS NO FUN PLS only farming hugs and homoerotic copulation). There are better games out there go for them.",Rust

Gameplay gather your friends many if possible gather resources and graft weapons and armor. Profit kill anything and anyone you see in the game destroy loot pillage and eventually become part of the worst community in videogame history. I played Heroes of Newerth couple of years ago thought the community there was cancer. Well this game is like if AIDS and Ebola had a child and the child would have been raised in Chernobyl in terms of internal communication and friendlliness of people in the server.

2018-08-08,0,0,1756,False,Recommended,What I love about RUST At the time of writing this review I have 755 hours which I aquired over the span of roughly 4 5 months and let me just say this game is phenominal. Rust is a game that has it all great pvp amazing visuals but what stands out most to me is the freedom that you have. In RUST there are zero rules literally none. Some servers may have group caps and and base building restrictions but everything else is up to the player. You can explore long valleys build bases in tree's and caves kill whoever you want etc etc. The freedom that the game offers you is what keeps me coming back to this game almost every single day. Rust also has amazing pvp. I would say most weapons in the game are optimized enough guns like the LR 300 and the M249 are OP but are extremly challenging to aquire etc. I strongly reccomend this game if you are looking for something to just dump hours in.,Rust
2014-06-21,0,0,62,True,Recommended,I have to say this game sure has some potential and i can't wait to see where else it's going! Especially since i'm following the developer blogs on playrust.com.

2014-03-25,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Overall I find this game to be VERY entertaining. You start with nothing and you just build your way up. There is one HUGE problem that I have with this game. Decaying structures are the most annoying thing ever I can understand having the structures decay after inactivity for like a week and a half but for 2 DAYS?! REALLY?! I don't have that much time to invest in this game while trying to juggle school and work and then somedays I just don't feel like playing the game! We shouldn't be punished for not playing the game as often as possible. I say if you can completely commit yourself to this game and make sure you play it atleast once every two days then get it but if not you are just going to end up being off that your 6 story house and everything in it has decayed. I'm putting recommend but just be wary of the possibilities of losing all of your hard work. If the Devs are looking at these reviews I hope to god that they either do away with decay or make the decay period longer.,Rust
2014-03-20,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,I understand the game is Alpha/beta whatever but I don't see this game ever being something great. It's a bunch of mediocre games smashed together.Mediocre FPSMediocre survival gameMediocre exploration gameMediocre creative gameI guess the FPS mechanics are alright but the desparity between bow/arrow and M4 are huge. The game is built around griefing other players once you hit a certain point in the game the most efficient way to gather resources is to kill other players and take their stuff or break into other peoples houses and take their things.There isn't anything new about the creative aspect of the game. You smelt stuff you build a wood shack maybe a metal house if you have infinite free time but for the most part you have to build your house in a certain pattern or someone will build a wall around your entrance and block you in.The terrain is boring it looks a lot like Day Z there isn't anything interesting about it there isn't much satisfying about exploring other than finding gear to kill other players with.I'm trying to think of something positive to say about this game but the only positive experience I had with this game was when myself and three friends tracked someone down killed them and took everything they owned. While it was fun for me it wasn't fun for the other player which is pretty much the story of this game. At least they got rid of the zombies just kidding they just reskinned them as bears.,Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,224,True,Recommended,Great game in general I really enjoy it and would really recommend buying this game if you havn't already. Rust is definitely at a playable state it is still alpha but i dont see much wrong with it as it is. This game is really good its fun collecting resources and building a giant or small base to live in and be safe in. It's cool how realistic it is hunting animals to collect food cloth animal fat. And funniest of all ( Censor.nudity false ) type that in f1 console and see what it does. Loads of naked men running around wacking trees and rocks. If you really want to succeed in rust and be know as the scary guy on the hill you need to put hours of effort into collecting resources and killing animals and fortifying your base so its hard for people to raid you. Which i like about rust. The day/night time is realistic besides from half an hour day/night. there is a certain time every night when it is pitch black and you cant see a thing. This is where a base comes in handy you just turn your campfire on and cook your meat and it lights up your room. So yeah great game really fun.There are just a few minor issues that slightly annoy me at times. (1) i would be walking along and i suddenly hear WOOF WOOF GRR GRR so i look around for a wolf but there isn't one. Then out of the corner of eye i see a wolf glitched inside a rock his head sticking out of it and his legs poking out of the bottom. This also happens with bears ive seen it a couple of times. Again just a minor issue.(2) Messed up spawns. I would die normaly by natural causes or missing a jump on the rocks. Yeah s**t happens but I spawn in and instantly GRRR GRRR WACK WACK im being attacked by two giant bears and im already on 30 hp. This has happened to me on countless occasions. Again sort of a minor issue but i would definitely like this to be fixed as soon as possible.(3) Ok so i kill a pig and start collecting his resources. WACK (2 cloth) WACK (1 animal fat) WACK (3 raw CHICKEN breast)? hmm hang on a minute didn't i just kill a pig? This happens with all other animals aswell. Not a major issue but its slightly strange. Atleast it gives you food to eat.Ok to conclude my review of Rust (alpha) i'd just like to say that this game is at a very playable state it is very enjoyable and i would strongly recommend buying this game It's definitely worth the money.,Rust

2015-11-05,1,3,154,True,Not Recommended,"Rust. This game is a good game that I really enjoyed playing for the little bit of time that I put in. Survival game with lots of different things to craft from Shotguns to AK's to Swords. The biggest turn off for me is the community. The community is very toxic with little to no respect given to new players. For example a new players was asking a pretty legit question but got met with answers to press Alt + F4 and delete ""system32"" these kinds of childish malicious responses are the kinds of things that make this community toxic. It may seem all haha and funny but this is the kinda thing that speaks volumes about your character. Now players of Rust will disagree with me when I say the community is bad and they will attribute my grief with the constant KoS (Kill on Sight) and the base raids (you have the ability to build up a home/base and put your valuables in which will more than likely get raided) but I dont mind these at all. These are parts of the game. And one shouldnt get upset for things that are almost commonplace in the game. Its like disliking a game that has permadeath and you hate permadeath.... (off topic) but anyway the reason that i cannot recommend this game as the genre its portraying is because although there is some ""surviving"" aspects the game highly revolves around finding landmarks (Airstrip Radstown Lighthouse Sphere roads) and camp them out to get blueprints ( the only real way to progress in the game ). You cannot get any things of value any other way. TL DR game is fun community is unforgiving. DONT TRUST ANYONE",Rust

2017-12-21,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,"FULL REVIEW EARLY ACCESS Toxic Players. Toxic Game. Good luck trying to play when you get DCed every 10 mins... if you don't get killed during the first 5 min by someone with a gun. Unstable servers. Unstable players. Can't even place a storage box on the ground without a ""Error Not Enough Space"" message. If you manage to get past the servers problem and acutal build stuff make sure to bring a few friends along. Solo newbies don't last long and even fewer chances of making friends. OFFICAL RELEASE REVIEW NO TEAM MECHANIC I am really surprised they never implemented a team mechanic. This will effect their bottom line for sales in the long run. This is a very fun game... when you are playing as a team with 3+ players. This game NEEDS a team option with no friendly fire. PLAYER COMMUNITY The current player community is 90% toxic. They will pretend to be friends with you only to kill you for fun and take what little you may or not have. There isn't even a whisper or local text mechanic. You can talk on a mic and only those in a reasonable talking distance will hear it but that gives you a tactical disadvantage if are hutning someone. Get a discord. If you are lucky enough start with a new game hope you don't get ganked by players that found out how to cheat or hack themselves an AK. Players that have the upper hand and have been playing for days or even hours longer than you often abuse that advantage and will run around killing noobs near the spawn zones. Or they will troll mid to high level players by raiding their places while they are offline. You can trust no one. You have to constantly watch you back. You will die and start over many many times. You have to hide your stuff more than you think. You have to have a back up plan every time you log on and off.REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY If you dont have a good to great internet connection you will hate this game. If you are not looking around for someone possibly following you ducking behind cover looking for movement in large open areas and generally being cautious and skulk 24/7 you will get followed and killed. If you are lagging even a little bit you are putting yourself at a huge disadvantage. A careless split second will mean losing your stuff on you and starting back at your bag or the beach. Also headphones are recommened if you are not paying attention to nosies around you you will die quick.THE GAME As I mentioned this game is FUN. But it is NOT FUN if you are playing solo. Being a lonewolf doesn't bring perks unless you are on a low pop server and/or start from the begining and constantly work at it. Find someone willing and able to run a private server and if you find the right community boards you will easly find 20 people willing to start a 10 v 10 (or more if you are willing to risk) team death match. Get everyone on sperate sides of the island and start from there. Its not that hard to find players willing to start a good game rather than jumping into a messed up free for all. OVERALL Have a good internet connectionBring your friendsPay attentionEnjoy being a lonewolf and find a way to play the game without losing much of your stuff when you get ganked and be lucky enough to get a edge amog or above the others. Or play with friends or a small community and get the most out of this experience.",Rust

In the 100 hours i've put into this game i can tell you that this game will not be fun for new players. It's almost like a full time job. To be able to do absolutely ANYTHING you have to grind for at least 4 hours a day with a group of people. Of my 100 hours of playing only about 3 4 hours were fun events like raiding or pvp'ing.,Rust

2015-12-22,1,2,4120,False,Recommended,"New review Pros Fun game to play with some friends for a few hours a day. Intense PVP gunfights. Lots of lovely RP opportunities. Radtowns and LOOOOOOT. A couple interesting PVE encounters (Heli &amp Bradley APC) More to come. Great building mechanics easy to learn and use. (probably one of the best in the survival game genre) Although some would disagree the gunplay in this game is pretty decent and easy to pick up. Awesome Developers who update every week with new content to play around with.Cons If you don't have much time on your hands you may have a hard time getting much done in this game without either your base disappearing or it being raided. Playing in a group is advised. Game can be slow at times framerate can be very inconsistent but if you have a high end PC you shouldn't notice much. The community can be VERY toxic. If you are someone who is put off by that then this game is not for you. LOL The game can be hard for new players when you are just starting out. There are a few tips ingame to help you out but for the most part it is very hard starting out for the first time especially if you are solo. Survival aspects in this game are not very ""survivaly"". There are times where you do feel like you aren't just trying to survive against other people but that is usually very short lived as you can find food and water easily around the map. Conclusion I don't have as much fun in this game as I used to but maybe that's just because I have played it to death and have become quite bored of its repeatitive nature beyond early game. I still recommend it as it is one of my all time favourite games and I still look forward for the future of the game. Epic.6/10 as of now.",Rust

You can play this game a few ways getting to late game joining a group playing solo going around with a bow shooting everyone or just join a combat server so you spawn with guns.

2016-02-10,1,6,676,True,Not Recommended,"Rust is a promising game with some fatal flaws. While I mostly love the gameplay mechanics and the scope of the world the ""fun to suck ratio"" is very skewed. Everything in this game is temporary and it can be very frustrating to spend hours building before watching somebody destroy it in seconds. Ultimately you'll spend three or four hours building a relatively safe base before you consider focusing on PVP (you'll need a safe place to keep your loot respawn point and crafting stations). It's around this point that three guys always destroy your base with C4 destroy your spawn point take all your stuff and say mean stuff about your mom. No matter how skilled you are you will not be able to prevent this as your opponents outnumber you and dump ungodly amounts of time into the game grinding for resources and fortifying their bases.The community is overwhelmingly toxic. Expect signs on walls to feature a lot of crudely drawn swastikas and My friend and I have both uninstalled this game multiple times because we actually have jobs and it's just not fun to come home log in and discover that middle schoolers have burnt your fortress to the ground while you were busy being a human being.",Rust

I wouldn't be mad if this was the final game. Emergent gamplay similar to Day Z and Minecraft but a great flavor all its own. This isn't just a base building game. It is survival through and through.

A lot of ways to play whether you want to roam and explore to stick to a town and build a base. The first few hours of playing will be challenging you will die a lot but if you learn from your mistakes you'll be a lot better.

2015-07-31,0,0,699,True,Recommended,Ok so they finally tidyed up their game. It's now amazing for both starters and long time players. The clans are still ing stupidly overpowerd. Especially the asian ones (No Racist) But they made farming wood stone etc Fun. And they now have tips and actuall Item descriptions. There hardly are any noobs because this game is so ez to start playing. And ofcourse they settled between 2 systems. First was BP (Blueprints) then XP *(Experience) Now Components. But suddenly they Intergrated Blueprints into the Components system. And it is now really balanced and nice.So if you are deciding to buy this game i would say go for it. But if you give up after 1 try this is not the game for you. Even the good ones have bad starts sometimes. You just gotta respawn and give it another try.Last and least Don't trust anyone if not they already spared you. Even then do not give your code away. etc. Good Luck,Rust

It's not limited to new weapons or skins but vehicles and puzzles and multiple layers to add new gameplay for more enjoyment. With the multitude of servers you can pick your preference of a short term weekly wipe server to a long term two month wipe server. The blueprint system forces you to go out and take a risk with your hard earned items to get more weapons or armor to roam or more resources to fortify your base from raiders. It's a constant rollercoaster of huge wins and devastating losses that will have your heart pumping with adrenaline. Every fight is important and you're constantly on alert. Great game.,Rust

2017-07-14,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,Should you buy this game?If you are a solo player NOIf you play with your friends YESIn this game there are no benefits of being a solo player just like there are no downsides of being a group player. Therefore teaming with other players is always a priority since it makes the game much easier. On the other hand as a solo player 9/10 times you will be put in an unfair fight against a group of enemies which you WONT win even if you are a god since the numbers are against you. What is the point of playing a game where you can't progress or achieve anything. This is the reason why there are a few solo players (At least in my experience). Even if you succeede and aquire best equipment possible the chances of you winning a 1v3 or 1v4 fight are microscopic. I don't see a reason why you should play this game solo. First 50h this game might look fun but as you keep playing you start to realise how unfair it is and you just get frustrated. This game seems fun but as you play it it doesn't feel that way.I will give you some examples of my own experience to prove my point I went to a server that wiped 2h ago to start a wresh wipe. After 20 min I have gathered enogh resources to buld a 2x2 wood shack. As I was waiting inside my shack for morning to come 2 3 people appear near my shack asking me to bring them 500 low grade fuel or 50 hight quality metal in 1 hour otherwise they will burn my house. Obviously this requirement is impossible so I lost my house and a desire to play this game. If only this situation was a rare thing in this game but it's not.The community in this game is beyond garbage. Clans shooting nakeds at the beach getting killed while trying to be friendly being chased by 2 fully geared people across the entire map 5 secs after spawning naked being insulted in every way possible by other people when they lose the fight and I'm not even going to mention door/roof campers.What does Facepunch do to fix this? Nothing.Each patch this game becomes more and more team based where clans rule everything while solos are stomped into dirt.P.S. I know that there are unofficial solo only servers but most of the time they are either almost empty or moded to hellP.S.S. I'm not saying that they should make their game solo only I'm just stating that solo players should be on the same level as team players.,Rust

2018-11-23,0,0,381,False,Recommended,An open world multiplayer survival game sporting monthly updates that are sure to keep you playing in the next wipe. This game is unique in its wipe mechanic meaning that on the first Thursday of every month when the update hits every server and map are reset completely and players start from ground zero once again. This ensures that everyone has a fighting chance in this game and you won't have to worry about going against players with endgame content while you yourself have but a stone spear while keeping the game feeling fresh.I would highly recommend this fun yet challenging game for anyone looking for an online survival experience!,Rust

2018-11-07,0,0,789,False,Recommended,"Positive points The Survival Genre at its finestRust is a very immersive experience. You spawn with nothing but a rock and a torch and from then on you need to survive as you can collecting resources building up your base upgrading your tools upgrading your base to keep it safe from raiders fighting wild animals nature itself trading with other players eventually killing them raiding people exploring abandoned buildings etc. Everything in order to survive and set up your life on the game.The graphics are beautiful the sound system is surprisingly good game physics are balanced the maps are gorgeous the monuments buildings caves beaches mountains cities biomes everything meticulously made with plenty of details NPCs' AI are so good that it makes you salty sometimes the game has a lot of weapons resources items puzzles cloths skins and a buch of new features getting in every month. This game is rich of detailes and ways to play it.Always learningThat's my favorite aspect about this game there's always something new to learn on it. I've learned more getting raided ambushed trapped killed cheated than any tutotial could ever teach me. Mistakes make you stronger keep it in mind.Updates and the devs teamRust has monthly updates which makes it always seem like brand new. Some of these updates drastically change the playstyle which is for good most of the times. Anounces of upcoming updates and its contents are always published a month early on rust blog. In other words this game is far from being dead and/or abandoned on the contrary it's never been so alive.Negative points ClansIt's more like a flaw if I can call it so. The game privileges larger groups of players which means duos and small groups with 3 4 players are in a very unfair scenario against larger groups containing +10 people. When the late game comes they're gone raided. Abolutely wiped out of the server. You can always try a diplomatic agreement with these clans to prevent these unpleasant situations offering resources teamworks etc. Another alternative is to hide your base very well making it as hidden as you can. It's totally possible to survive an whole wipe without getting raided by simply choosing the right place to build your base up and avoiding unwanted attention.GrindingThis games requires grinding. A LOT. So if you have time to spend on it that shouldn't be a problem to you. Otherwise you may get stuck in the early game forever. Having a large group of players aside of you makes everything much easier once everyone can focus on a different task doing everything by yourself just to get raided on the very next day is extremely frustraiting.Two phrases which summarize very well what is like to grind in rust ""It's never enough"" ""You will always need more scrap.""Toxic BehaviorYou get yourself killed in rust for the most stupidity reason. Sometimes you have just spawned at the beach and get a bullet in your head for absolutely no reason at all. Most of the time people will kill you just for the sake of killing nothing else. There are good people out there tho willing to socialize and be friendly you just need to be luck and find them amonst the murderers and psycopaths.If you're a big fan of the survival genre I strongly recommend you to give Rust a chance. The good aspects certainly prevails the bad ones.",Rust

Tip 1. You want your community to like your game right? So listen to them.Tip 2. Make a vote or a test server where the community can test things like that.Tip 3. (This one is for the payers) Make sure you have a decent sized group (5+ Members) and you abuse the XP share system.

2014-06-07,0,0,157,True,Recommended,Rust is not for the faint of heart. Or easily offended. Or those who don't care to see semi naked men running about with rocks. What Rust IS is a game that takes survival and resource collecting and player vs player and melds it into an arena enviroment that the hapless player is dropped into to fend for themselves. PvP servers can be ( and usually are) brutal. PvE servers are highly recommended by this author so a new player can try to survive without fear of other players. It should be noted ( at the time of this writing) that Rust is still in development. One would hope some sort of tutorial will be included in the future to help players better understand how the game works. As it is you had best watch videos online to see how the game works and what is expected of you before you start esp if you plan on playing PvP.I do recommend Rust even in its current build. Although buggy at times it (usually) doesnt take away from gameplay. ++Update++ March 11 2016 There is much to say about the state of Dev's minds when tearing down a game and re building seemingly from scratch.. Honestly..I have no Rivscore sorry the state of the game as is is so laggy and full of bugs I will update asap.. stay tuned!,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,1551,False,Recommended,You feeling low on sodium? Fast food is not an option? Play this game and get your sodium levels up in no time. Spawn on the shores of the procedural generated maps of Rust and explore the forests valleys mountains and monuments of Rust. Then start gathering resources until someone finds you kills you and you have to start over. This will be a loop you will be stuck in for a while but don't worry 'cause when you actually get to survive and get your base up and running while your sodium levels will keep rising so will your enemies' when you kill them after they have killed you over 9000 times.On a more serious note this game gets weekly updates and the devs are pretty close to all of their players even when they are called a holes and other lovely names 'cause they didn't test that ONE out of 100 features. Be good be bad it doesn't matter Rust is unforgiving but you will decide whether you will get back up instead of ragequitting while banging your head on a wall. ENJOY!UPDATE 24/11/2018 Whenever I play this game my sodium levels still increase. Game now gets big updates every first Thursday of the month instead of weekly.

2017-09-12,1,1,1000,True,Not Recommended,This is my first review for a game and im only reviewing this to let people know why you shouldnt buy this game. The game is fun. honestly I love how active the dev team is in updating and modifying the game. As you can see I've got nearly 1000 hours on the game and for good reason. There is one downfall to this game. And its easily the worst aspect of the game and a huge deal breaker for me. The community SUCKS. REALLY REALLY It filled with 13 15 year old racist sexist homophobic spolit little excuses for kids. It is an absolute rarity to actually be able to find someone who is nice and doesn't just kill you straight away. The amount of times I've been starting this game and have been relentlessly killed by people who are fulled gear with guns and I've had barely anything to even start a base with. If you're one of the s who doesn't give a about anyone else besides yourself then this game might work for you. But if youre anyone who isnt a white male I'd recommend going somewhere else unfortunately. Because this game will honestly make your skin crawl. I just wish that the dev team could do something about this and maybe enforce the age restriction on the game. Because without the younger kids playing this game it would be CONSIDERABLY better. In every single way.,Rust

2018-04-16,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,"Don't buy this game if you value your time and sanity.The game is set up to encourage grinding over everything else. Nominally your goal as a player is to survive. Gathering food water and building supplies so that you can make better structures and weapons so that you can get better supplies etc.The problem is that at any point in this cycle if you die and lose your home base you have to start over from scratch. Also other players can raid your stuff and kill you even when you're not online.Given that success is predicated solely on the amount of materials you can harvest from the environment being successful means dumping huge amounts of time into doing repetitive tasks for marginal gains. And like I said before this can all get stolen from you at any time. All it takes is for some other guy or group of guys who spend more time grinding than you to gather the stuff necessary to demolish your base and steal your stuff most likely while you're offline.In essence your typical Rust session goes in one of the following ways 1. You are killed repeatedly before being able to find any tools or supplies whatsoever. You get insulted by 12 year olds over VOIP for being bad at the game. You quit and feel immense regret for spending your time on this game.2. You manage to gather enough materials to build a small base. This takes about 2 3 hours. You log off. You come back to find that your base was destroyed your materials were stolen and you were killed. You must start from scratch or you most likely quit and feel immense regret for spending your time on this game.3. You build a base only to find out that the server is empty and there's nothing to do. You quit and feel immense regret for spending time on this game.4. You did it. You managed to grind more than anyone else and are now the most powerful person/group in the server. You then realize that there's no reward for doing so and have become the person you despised for so long. You figure that any further ""progress"" you make is just going to deter people from the server you play on and that your enormous amount of time spent has been for nothing of substance. You quit and feel immense regret for spending your time on this game.By the way the community for the game is incredibly toxic. If you're lucky enough to not be berated with racial slurs every 5 seconds you're going to have to deal with Russian hackers clan s people who shoot you for no reason obnoxious 10 year old kids and pretty much any other stereotypical internet troll you can think of. They are all that is left of the community now.This is on top of the fact that the game is littered with numerous bugs glitches design problems collision issues bad hit detection desync issues poor optimization and all the other fun stuff that comes with the ""early access"" label.The game has been in development since 2013 and yet the core issues that I have with the game have not changed since launch over 5 years ago. The game is still in alpha. Where did the time go? Where did the money go? It seems to me like they've been doing the bare minimum necessary to prevent people from saying that they've abandoned the project.As a person who has owned the game since its release in 2013 I have personally spent way more time playing Rust than I'd like to admit. Once you fall into it it's addicting. With friends Rust has its moments. But none of what you do in the game ever feels like it's worth the effort. It's probably one of the only games that I have played that consistently makes me feel worse after every time playing it. There's never been an instant where I've left a game of Rust feeling like I had a great time. You're either dejected from your lost time investment or anxious that whatever you've worked on is in jeopardy of being taken from you.I know I've ranted a lot here but this has been a long time coming. I can say that no other game I've played has given me such a negative overall experience. Words alone cannot describe the extent to which I can recommend against this game. Take the money you wanted to spend on this game and put it towards something you can actually enjoy. Buying it will only give Facepunch more of a reason to maintain the farcical status quo they've created over the development of this game.",Rust

2016-12-26,0,0,50,True,Recommended,This game is essentially the most challenging PVO (Player Versus Offline) game I have played. I honestly stopped liking this game a while ago but I would definetly give it another try if I have friends who want to play. I recommend this game's mechanics and beauty but not the community and overall experience. I haven't played in the last month but I played this game religiously previously. If you are looking for a game that is raw survival involving food management construction and scavenging then this game is for you. If you want to play with a community then that is a different story.This games is designed to essentially live life as a raider. You start out naked and work your way up to gain the most resources while huge mass of other players are also competing. You start out only with a rock and eventually you will have a gun to defend your stuff. If you do happen to make friends that won't actually steal from you then this game will be consume your time with fun and friendly banter but it can also destroy your faith in humanity as you login to find your property pillaged.As time goes on the game gets slow it's fun for a while but you eventually get tired of having to either own enough stuff to build something solid enough to stop most attacks (concrete for example) or hide. The people who play this game devolve into three types the raiders the desperate survivors and then the players who came with friends who also liked the game but wanted friends to both help and be able to log off without worrying. The raiding players are ones who played long enough or cheated (which happened a long time ago but not recently to me) who hunt new players for sport and steal your stuff just out of entertainment or to cement their power. The desperate are players who spend their time playing to survive and hide until they are powerful enough to be a raider themselves. The friends group are the rarest but the best players to play with as they rotate online and are able to render help to players.What really spoiled the game is the server wiping hacking and community. Unless you play with friends or happen to find some online then be prepared to play the entire time with a hightened heart rate and fits of rage while also being anxious offline wondering if someone has found your base yet. After spending hours uppon hours of playing to become powerful enough to ward off the raiders and other hostiles (zombies) then the worst happens you encounter a hacker. You spent all the time making a machine gun ammo and scavenging materials to be able to play without fear just to have your bullets do nothing and have a teleporting troll blink into your fortress and raid everything. If you finally do wait for the hacker to be kicked or get bored there is the worst thing that happens a server wipe.As it should be expected of early access games server wipes are devestating for players who have sunk more than a couple of hours into a server. You finally find your friend build a base and crafted some decent items only to find that everyone is running around like they have nothing to lose after the admins gift everyone with rocket launchers guns and other weapons only seen after at least a day of mining crafting and scavenging schematics.All in all I would highly recommend this game to someone who wants a SURVIVAL GAME. Suvival does not always mean friends given things and expecting everyone to be reasonable. I would also recommend it to someone who wants a challenge in online multiplaying.,Rust

2016-12-08,1,2,3384,True,Recommended,After having played this game on fairly populated servers I can say that most people kill you on sight but after a few hours of messing around the game becomes much easier. I have run into plenty of players who have also offered to helo me out with whatever i need. Sure there are huge zerg style clans that can easily ruin your day but what do you expect from a game like Rust? Being a solo player like myself can be especially frustrating at times but with a little bit of brainpower and effort you will soon have yourself set up to defend yourself well enough against attackers. As far as optimization goes there is some work to be done there but I myself have a average rig and on good settings im running at around 50 60 fps wich isn't too bad. Most of the negative reviews I've read just seem like salty kids who got raided one too many times. It would be nice to see some more PVE content but that isnt too much of a downfall for me as I really do enjoy playing but I would also like to see some more variety with regards to clothes and armor as they are quite limited. I am currently playing solo on a vanilla server with a population of around 250 players online at a time it has taken me two days to set up a metal base with huge walls around and I have managed to defend myself against groups of up to 5 people at a time without much hassel. All in all I would reccomend this game as it is loads of fun but if you are a keyboard samurai and dont like having to start fresh a few times before you become comfortable in the game then I suggest you give this a skip and try something like the Sims instead.,Rust

2015-07-31,1,1,2398,True,Recommended,This game used to be a mess. It's nowhere near perfect however the devs are really working to make this game exactly what we all kind of had in mind for rust. They're listening to the community input much more now than ever and eventually this game is going to be incredible. The only cons to this game would be the server lag and most importantly the hackers. They're the only thing that drives me away from the playing this game as much as I used to. There's nothing worse than buying the game spending hours on end to build up a compound with your friends and then have everything taken away by a script kiddy who bought the game that day to terrorize the server you play on with every intention of ruining people's time until they are banned. If this problem were fixed the game would be my all around favorite game.,Rust
2013-12-23,0,0,524,True,Not Recommended,this game is a SCAM stay away from it. if you want to really off an enemy you can buy this game as a gift for him.they took 8 months to release a new version of the game the new engine is even more broken than it was before. ok the new engine looks beautiful but you want play a game or it should be a screen saver?1 you can't awake your character on official servers 2 animals just enter inside rocks like it doesnt exist 3 melee is broken you can swing your rock to hit an animal and in fact you only hit like 10% of the time even if you're clearly seeing your stone going through the animal it wont take any damage 4 when you try kill a bear using a rock you can actually do it in 2 hits (like pigs or deers). but the most laughable thing is when the bear tries to hit you you take damage before his pawns hit you 5 they added some satellite dishes around the map and they have stairs for you to go up. but your character doesnt go up the stairs you must jump your way up.7 you can take 1000 wood from one single tree8 you need 100 cloth to make a bandage exactly half of what you need to make a sleeping bag or some pants (50 cloth). thats what i call balance!9 you need a super computer to run it smoothly. forget about the minimum and recommended settings my rig is better than recomemended and that doesnt mean i can run it on medium without stuttering or huge drops of fps.the list goes on i got this game broken errors after only 30 minutes so thats enough for me. im just waiting for next excuse by garry. they probably will say they're gonna change the engine again and the game will never be released. Oldest EditAfter 4 months of the release date there are no content added just a bunch of excuses from Garry and his team. Week after week they tell us the same excuse and the game is the same for months which it's not what an alpha suppose to be. Devs should add content test new stuff and that sort of things but facepunch only works to change rock skins new deer skins and some stuff they say they're working but in fact they don't update the game. The most curious thing is when they did update the game before its got worst. Every update crashes something and they take weeks only to fix what wasn't requiring a fix before the update (example is the air drop it was broken for 3 whole weeks after the last update).IMO the game doesn't seem to evolve I guess devs are quiet happy with their sales so they don't need to work on the game anymore. If you doubt go check playrust the official devs page and check it out for how long they don't add anything to the game it's excuses after excuses and there are no proof that the game still in development. Another alpha early access games have more continous updates than this one.It's sad but I think this game won't change that much until they release the final version which will be basically the same of the early access version. Old EDIT2You can't even complain on facepunch forum about the lack of development of the game because you'll get banned for one week and they'll close and hide the thread. Some fp moderators told the game is more a prototype than an alpha access in my thread so maybe that's why they buried it very quickly! All about this game is shady don't give your money to this kind of people they're scammers. They're capable of lying even at their changelog from updates. You can see they said on february update that they added some gfx configs that can be edited in order to run the game smoother but if you search online in forums (here on steam you'll see a thread on how to run the game without lag) and you'll see the same gfx configs there before the update was released so the guy was a psych or devs are lying.,Rust

For example if you're solo you can find good bases for a solo player same thing if it's for a duo or more. And by watching some ""tricks and tips"" or some kind of ""Rust video for beginners"".As i've said before the first 0 200 hrs won't be very good for you. And here are some reasons You will be killed (a lot)Honestly this is the only reason. Getting killed is the main reason as to why you are not progressing or you are progressing very slowly. But after approximately 200 hrs (may be earlier or later depending if you're a fast learner or not) you will understand how the game works and you can counter all the things that can get in your way of surviving the wipe. Such as Stonger base Guns More efficent farming Better blueprints Better movementIn conclusion Don't complain until you have actually tried it. Don't say you have tried it until you have 200+ hrs and play more than 1 hr per day or just a few hrs per week.

NEVER leave gameplay up to the people because trolls and cheaters will simply come in and wreck your game in an INSTANT they have done here.

But for those of you who have played before or a developer or member of Facepunch (fingers crossed that you guys will read this) I have some 'complaints'.For those of you who dont know Rust legacy is a version of the game which was introduced while the game was being developed and was playable as an alternate version up until recently (as far as I can tell from the forums within the last few months of 2k16). Honestly the current Rust and Rust legacy are two completely different games both haveing their strenghts and weaknesses. While the majority of people play the current version both for its better graphics lack of hackers and the fact that its still being developed there was a strong community who still played the old game. Personally I hadnt played either version of the game in several months but between my three account I probably have close to fifteen hundred hours on the two of them and most of that was on legacy. I came back recently because of rumors of the games death and after discovering they were true Ive been working to find a solution. All I ask is for your guys help and support in getting this game back either as its own title 'legacy' or as an alternate version of the current game. In all honesty we as a community dont care about the lag and the bugs and the hackers that plauged the game and getting it back even without further development on FacePunches part would make us happy. Most of us would even be willing to spend the money to buy it as a seperate title. As far as it not being worth it for the developers to continue it I say dont worry about it. If PacePunch truely got rid of the game becasue they didnt want to host the servers anymore just make it our problem. Have all the servers be client sided. if you cant do that give us the code! I'd be happy to personally develope and host the damn game if it ment people could play it again or give it to the community at large make it a project we could all work on together.Just please consider giving us our game back!,Rust
2014-04-20,1,1,113,True,Recommended,"This is a story about my first experiance with RUST.I spawned into a world full of massive houses. Assuming they were filled with well armed people I avoided them like the plague. This is how things went until I got beat to death with an axe. Second spawn I decided to build a structure. I found a nice clearing by some radiation and an animal spawn. I had just built a shack when I saw my second person ever. He turned out to be friendly and his name was cass. Me and cass were down on supplies until a kind soul named moldy gave us some weapons and supplies. He was our savior. Another man with a base at a hanger gave us all of his things when he was quiting. He left me with some sound wisdom ""Remember this is RUST everyone dies"". We took his things and built an actual house. After getting raided a few times moldy called out on the chat that he was looking for some teammates. Feeling obligated to help him me and cass joined up with the ""Potato Army"". We wandered around helping noobs and killing foes. We were invincible. Until we were killed by a hacker at a friendly rave at the hanger. Moldy and cass quit out and I was left with only one other army member gummy a girl who made cat noises into her mic for the next 7 hours. So I took moldy's stores of weapons and armor and started recruiting members into the reformed Potato Army. At my best we had around 5 15 members gathering wood to build a larger base. the base was almost done while I was negotiating with a man who said he could help us get airdrops. Then a hacker came and killed our entire base. The army was left with only 3 loyal members me gummy and a guy name phoenix. We were selective in who could get in our base and we let the man I was negotiating with in because he said he could also help with the hacker that was killing us. Long story short he killed all of us and raided our base. But he didn't know the password to the door so he was locked in. He stayed there for an hour shouting about how he was a hacker and would ruin the server for us if we ever came back. So after 18 hours straight 2 of my empires had risen and fallen in the same server. Would I recamend this game? Yes.

The only thing to dislike about this game is of the high spec requrement. i have build specifically made for gaming and at tops with all the GFX ingame turned off I get 15 fps. horrible I know. it could be because of my internet but I highly doubt so. anyways I highly recomend this game to anyone reading this. especially if you enjoy these survival type games. feel free to add me and we could play rust sometime!

2015-07-13,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,So much potential but in the current form not really offering much in casual gaming.I've only spent about 15hrs on the game and the learning curve is quick the build up of resources initially is slow and sadly this game doesn't have the right balance yet. It's just too tipped toward the players that can accumulate the resources fastest.The early format though looks interesting and I hope to review this again in a few months.For all the people thinking well this is an Alpha well it is. But once you put a price tag on something you have to be prepared to deliver something that has some enjoyment value and at the moment it's too much of a grind.,Rust

2016-08-21,0,0,146,True,Not Recommended,The XP system sucks. Unless you're playing with a large group of regular players (think 20+ hours a week) you have no chance of survival. Good luck surviving when you're constantly being chased down by hordes of players with assault rifles and all you can make is a wooden spear.This is so close to being a really fun game but as it stands it kind of sucks.

2018-01-20,0,0,54,True,Not Recommended,"I wanted to like this game a lot I really did. Like a better survival game than ARK SE. But it's hecking bad.Both the game itself is bad and the community. The community is sexistic racistic and use homophobic slurs. They also LOVE to kill fresh spawns for sport. In this game you don't die straight away when you get gunned down. You go into a ""wounded"" state where you will lie for 5 minutes before you die. Unless you get help. So these high tier guys guns you down so you can stare at a grey landscape for 5 minutes after you just spent 30 minutes trying to find some food water and clothes. There's no way you can speed up your death or commit suicide. You are forced to wait while the gunners mock you for being new to the game/server.And then you try again...and again...I have about 50 hours in this game but I have practicially only been playing it for 5 10 hours. The remaining have been me trying to find a safe spot to settle find food and get gunned down by high tier guys with AK 47s while I have a rock I can throw once.

This game is probably my favorite game ever for several reasons.Most negative reviews on this game is mostly either people complaining about load time fps etc or they have 10000 hrs and start complaining that farming gets super boring. If you want a good game with good devs this is it chief. You really dont need a great computer 2 run this game if you can handle playing at potato and if potato still is not good enough download Razor Cortex or sumting. I'm going 2 tell you guys a secret IF YOU DONT LIKE FARMING PVP. when you get good enough you can kill a naked with a rock and find out that he farmed 20 stone nodes 4 you that is how you farm ladies.

2017-01-02,0,0,1512,True,Recommended,Time to write a real full indepth review of my time so far in Rust.I have over 1 110 hours in this game as of writing this.I've played solo duo trio all of the above. One of the hard facts is that with a small group of 3 or less I would recommend playing on low population servers or small community servers otherwise you will get destroyed everyday to being on or ofline raided.But lets start on a wipe day. Typicaly the first thursday of every month unless forced more information can be found about updates or wipe things on http //www.rustafied.com/ . Wipe days are my funnest times for fighting primitive combat(spears/melee/bow/crossbow if you are lucky) fighting for that first few hours trying to get a base down so you can expand is extremely exciting. All the high paced action without the worry of anyone having guns to blow you away with to fast for you to react.Okay so now we are a few days into wipe. You have a base you go to bed and get on in the morning to see you have been ofline raided but they didn't greif you(Not raiders). You fix up the holes they made and start working on repairing and figuring out where you went wrong. You look to youtube and find a better way to go about building. You and your mates collect more for building this new and improved base. You finish and feel so proud about what you have done.Skip to the next day you look into getting guns. You get your radiation suit all ready to go you head out to a monument and manage to get out with an smg body and/or a rilfe body and get your self a pretty gun. You kill a few people but die to the heli because you didn't know what it did. You get your stuff back after finding your body now you seek revenge on the heli. Once again looking up how to take out the heli. You build you and your mates heli towers or heli boxes to fight the heli and finaly take it down getting all sorts of good loot in trade for bullets.01/02/2017 I don't have time to finish this review yet so I will post this now and continue later stay rusty mates.,Rust

2015-12-06,0,0,294,True,Recommended,All will decay. Everything will return to the dust from which it came. Entropy is at the heart of Rust. The title of the game suggests as much. Although packaged up as a survival game Rust is a wonderful resource management game. One in which you are constantly gathering resources in an attempt to push back the decay of time while trying to mass enough resources to beat your neighbour on the head.Expect trolls griefing and a bunch of moments of utter dispair as you lose everything you've spent hours collecting/crafting in this semi persistent survival FPS.Highly reccomend playing in a team or at least 2 players. Yes it can be played alone but you will constantly feel like an underdog barely able to keep your house together from larger more aggressive teams.,Rust

2016-05-17,0,0,604,True,Recommended,First of all this is I play the dozens of the game of living in the most fun and optimize the best a multiplayer online game of survival. Secondly this game why I recommend for everyone to play it fast paced! Multi server according to adaptive server selection of their own network environment for the game can experience the best. Made a simple free can completely spell wisdom to build a opponent mad construction order to increase the strength of our team by plundering of supplies. And so on.Then I say my most painful place is why developers may not like to add a hero as the ark of underwear you have not considered by many countries prohibit nudity I am an anchor to give us a positive positive content not yellow violent antisocial! We prohibit the broadcast platform the game live so I lost my buddy and play this fun game of chance so I am very disappointed developers so open to let the hero born naked even if the end of the world is very consistent with the background of the game but because it is the game please consider a lot we are not interested in naked heroine here I want to say to the developer can improve and solve this problem will lead me naked partners continue to back this fun game and will make more people join this A game. Such a win win thing I think you will be carefully considered I hope the developer can see my message. There are a lot of things you want to say to you but this is the case today.首先 这是我玩了几十种生存游戏里最好玩 优化最好的一款多人在线生存游戏.其次 这款游戏为什么我推荐给大家玩呢 节奏快!服务器多 根据自己的网络环境选择适应的服务器进行游戏可以最佳体验.造家简单 自由 可以完全拼智慧来建造令对手发狂的建筑 可以通过掠夺别人的物资来增加我们队伍的实力.等等.接着我来说说我最痛苦的地方 就是为什么开发员不可以像方舟那样给主人公加个内衣 你们有没有考虑到很多国家禁止这种裸露行为 我是一个主播 给大家带来的是正面积极向上的内容 不黄色暴力血腥反社会!我们直播平台禁止该游戏直播 因此我失去了和小伙伴一起玩这款很有趣游戏的机会 为此我很失望开发员这么开放的让主人公裸体诞生 即使是世界末日 是很符合游戏背景 但是因为它是款游戏 也请多多考虑下 我们对裸体主人公并不感兴趣 在这里我想对开发员说 能改善和解决这个裸体问题 我将会带领伙伴们继续反回这款有趣的游戏 并且会让更多的观众加入这个游戏.这样双赢的事情 我想你们会慎重考虑的 希望开发员能看到我的留言.有很多话想对你们说 但是今天就说到这吧.游戏优化很好 还有很多开发的空间 你们辛苦了! 暂时玩不了但我还是永远的支持你们!加油!,Rust

And unlike some other members of this incresingly toxic community I'm not going to try and blackmail the devs by changing my review if they do something I don't like. It's a great enthralling engrossing survival game. Your worst enemy is everyone you meet and that goes double on Twitter and Reddit. Build great bases and upgrade them only to be raided and heartbroken by a 30 person clan who doesn't need your stuff but will take it anyway. Collect resources and try not to be headshot by someone sitting on their roof. Write an honest review and watch the downvotes pour in. I absolutely recommend this game. Watch some videos to get you started there's things you need to know. Best most interactive (and patient) dev team I've ever seen even in the face of spittle lipped twelvies screeching poorly spelled hyperbole at all corners. Go buy it now. Scrub.,Rust
2016-07-01,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,So first time I played this got into an official server and grinded for 2 hours then for some guys with autos to gun me down and I lose all my progress. I quit. Second time months later completely forgot I owned the thing grinded for 2 hours then for some guys with autos to gun me down and I lose all my progress. I quit.I think to have fun in this game you need to be a very active player and probably most importantly you need friends. Without friends to play the game with you you just can't compete with the other huge clans that have propped themselves up and random chads with rifles going around hunting for noobs. Why grind for 2 hours when you're going to lose everything you get anyway? An excercise in futility. It's not challenging it's just ridiculously hard to get anywhere. It's not fun it's grindy. It's not rewarding the only reward you get for all your hard work is a bullet in the skull. Rust tells you to try and then pisses on you for trying. Well I'm not trying anymore,Rust

2015-10-22,1,1,149,True,Recommended,Can't put it down despite how much time it steals away from me from playing other more rewarding games. This game has made me question whether or not I am still sane because I will sit down and play for much longer than any normal human bean should be sitting for. There are tons of bugs and exploits and even more system issues. Like why do my frames drop by at least 50% when shooting an automatic gun? Why does the game freeze for 10 seconds whenever I access a different thing to loot every time? Horribly optimized to me but still highly addictive to play. More reclaiming properties than negatives so I rate it a solid 8.2575/10,Rust

Would recommend to anyone.Update 11.2018 Weekly updates are no longer a part of the game. Work benches required for crafting constitute of a large grind and act as a deterrent for investing time in the game since they cannot be moved/removed after placing. The player base is no longer neutrally friendly but more a toxic band of children. If you have a chance to play on a low pop server with a friend or two go for it otherwise no.,Rust
2018-02-12,1,1,5,False,Not Recommended,Can be fun with friends. Definitely not worth now that the price is increased though lmao.

2017-01-17,0,0,190,True,Not Recommended,In theory this game should be fun in action it isnt.To start off most players who have good gear will kill you for no reason. People will also go around hunting naked people so you wont be able to make a start on their server. Spawn rates of important early game items like Hemp are also incredibly low. Its almost impossible to find a decent amount of Hemp in one life time nonetheless multiple ones. Food is too hard to come by early game unless you eat other naked people and finding rock nodes is extremely difficult. Maybe if a gang of your friends played this game it would be fun however playing solo or with two people is not enjoyable. Until they make this game more fun for beginners im going to give it a negative review.,Rust

The way this game gets it hooks into me is absolutely amazing.If you want a quick picture imagine DayZ. Give it a good engine so the gameplay doesnt feel like a mess. Make the map smaller and different everytime. Add base building and ""blueprints""(learning) for a good way to feel progression. And tools to destroy said bases.The game is not perfect but compared to other survival/sandbox games that were released around 2013 this one has shown the most progress and continues to do so.It is not perfect optimization could still be done as FPS varies a bit more than it should and if you play solo duo or trio (1 2 3) the server you play on will die quickly but most of the time the ""tense"" element remains.",Rust

2016-11-10,0,0,2177,False,Recommended,"So straight up. It is a great game.. It has endless replay value as maps and updates change how you decide to play the game. As a ""turtle bot"" building a grand base to defend all your hard earned materials. Or maybe as a nomad carrying only what you need while you hunt down people with better gear than you.There are 3 big parts to this game which are Raiding (the action of breaking into another player or groups base taking their stuff) Building (pretty self explanatory you build whatever you like and the terrain allows) and survival (you need to stay warm/cool eat and drink and fend off bears and wolves.)As of the component systems release raiding has become way harder in my opinion. The amount of materials needed to craft the needed timed explosives and/or satchel charges are far greater than the resources needed to build a base safe from said explosives. Weapons are also very limited and the rule of ""first raider have the advantage"" is much more in effect now. Except for that the combat system is very good with a wide selection of weapons when you finally get them.Building is still a little wonky at times some glitches here and there but overall it is fairly good. You can make pretty intricate designs and use the system to your advantage (double walls where there should just be 1 etc) The constructions some people build still amazes me. And it is easy to understand.Pros Great varietyAmazing graphics if you have the pc to run itConstant updates (small ones every thursday and first thursday of the month a large one)Easy to set up a private serverCons Constant updates... Updates sometimes alter the game to much imho and lately there have been 2.Load times when you enter a server are really high on medium/low tier computers. (read 5 10 minutes)Key aspects of the game are harder now to the point modded servers die out.All in all I think it is a great game and having clocked 2000 hours ingame I would recommend it for anyone that are into multiplayer survival. 8/10",Rust

I told him I didn't care and that he was lying because I found a sleeper inside his base. He got really annoying talking to me and so I just talked smack to deter him.4 wipes later he keeps calling me an asshat wow am I surprised. He then got 12 guys to offline raid me and after that he said in chat that he was 30 years old has a wife and 2 kids. He said it was his dream to raid me and he plays Rust all day. Quite literally he was obssessed and hates me like a lot. He kept talking and whenver I would talk he would blow a barrage of insults at me.This game is ing great. 10/10,Rust

2017-06-15,0,0,1296,True,Recommended,One of the better survival games i've played. Combat is fun and balanced I guess. I can't count how many times i've had funny moments on this game either. Game speaks for itself it's player count is high all the time and it recieves updates very often... which makes me come to the bad part of the review.Updates. They've reworked the entire system to how making things and loot things 3 times already since release and all 3 times nobody asked for one. The current one however is the worse out of them all. It's not so much a problem for me anymore but out of all 3 things they tried this one I hate the most. RNG component system to make guns and such ripped straight from 7 Days to Die. There are things in the game that they have chosen to neglect like the animal AI which has been a problem for over a year now to reworking something that was fine to begin with. We went from hitting barrels and looting rad towns to find blueprints for certain items to having a leveling system that unlocks items based on how much work you put in to what we have now.. an RNG looting/crafting system with everything unlocked.Another bad thing about it is it's community. Expect to be offline raided A LOT. 90% of the time you will work for week to make a base only to go to sleep and wake up to find your base destroyed and everything stolen by some no life who grinded the game from wipe day. There is no way to combat this and I doubt they're going to do anything to fix it. Another thing I heard hackers are rampant. Although I rarely come across one it feels as if many people who I fight are hacking. Far as I can tell it's really easy to make scripts to make gunplay extremely easy.My current view on this game is positive. I can overlook the toxicity and the devs almost ruining the game with the component system for the fun moments i've had and the many hours i've played.,Rust

2016-03-06,0,0,951,True,Recommended,This game has some amazing potential! It's near polished and ready to leave the alpha stages in my opinion. The gun play is great and pretty easy to get a handle on as well as the crafting. My ONLY complaint is the lack of oversight on the part of the server admins. Way too much cheating on the official servers. Fly hacks no clips and other issues plague the legit players. However that just shows you how popular this game is. People are willing to waste time writing script and distribute it for ppl just to have troll like fun. Overall I would recommend.

Why Ban someone for playing a game and was tly banned before.Anyways less ranting about accounts and the VAC system and like that.This game has changed since legacy Seemingly it seems like a different game but still this game is fun and in' epicly awesome Has been since legacy. This game has been amazing since the start It constantly changes and changes and changes over and over and over This game is alot more than what it was before. The comunity of this game how ever has gotten and and There are still people around the place that are still good. Most people that i've met have either been or good. Being a moderate stage in the game i gave out stuff and helped people and i lose it all when i'm offline i'm not saying that this is a thing that needs to be changed but people have been all over the place Some agree to the updates that are good and bad some people whine their ing arses off about changes that make it so you can't just get end tier'd at the begginning of the bloody ing game... Look This game has seen alot of has gotten alot of good comunity members that are just in game but are pretty good overall to the comunity There is alot more than what this game can be and what people decide apon it will always be changing so you can't really expect alot from facepunch to change that makes the game unbalanced. Just understand where facepunch is coming from The devs could of just said "" THIS WE'RE GOING WITH THE MONEY"" and go onto holiday for the rest of their life.

2018-06-25,0,0,971,False,Not Recommended,Game is way too overpopulated on all the official servers. Impossible to play because the resources are slim and you get raided on the first day of a blueprint wipe. I literally built a base with armored walls with 3 floors and like 10 sheet metal doors and got raided on the first night. Its way too easy to get C4 and satchel charges.

2018-06-27,0,0,441,False,Recommended,Let me just start this review by saying the obvious. If your'e into survival adventure crafting games then you are already very likely to like this game. If you like survival adventure crafting games with shooter elements then this is deffinitely your game. You can put hours of gameplay into Rust and most will still be having a very enjoyable time. You can play on certain servers for the longest time but yet lose it all because of the smallest mistakes. It is very hard to trust people in this game thus leaving you the oppurtunity to raid bases and kill other players. I do although suggest finding friends to play this game with as in doing so will greatly increase success rates at pretty much anything (the game is still really fun even as a solo player such as myself.) It may be hard to find friends in Rust though because of the very toxic community very little you will have the chance of meeting a nice player. Overall this game is amazing and I plan on pouring hours of my life on it. Plz friend me and message me coz I need myself a Rust buddy...,Rust

2014-09-27,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Much like every other open world sandbox this one is focused survival and building. BUT game mechanics makes it more like first person shooter with crafting options.So I would recommend this game rather to FPS fans than to sandbox/simulation fans.What I like 1. Pleasant real world graphics (not to compare with Minecraft).2. Exploration concept higher ranked items can be crafted after you get a recipe which spawns in radiated cities only non player built territory in the game.3. Building system is hard enough to take considerable amount of time to create safe and convenient place to live.What I don't like 1. Just like many PvP oriented games this one totally lacks any other kind of player interaction except killing encounters. It makes the game boring if you are not playing with your friends.2. Despite seemingly open world on the server I played I found like two day travel territory without any food resources. It seems unrealistic like game mechanics force you to play on the smaller territory and compete for resources with onther players.,Rust

2018-01-22,2,2,437,False,Not Recommended,I can't recommend this game until they allow character customization.Is that petty? Perhaps but let me tell you why it's important to me (and a standard for video games in the current age especially games that are out of Early Access). 1. It limits how much I play the game The game is fun even in its current state. You spend hours and hours of grinding to get the perfect base but at the end of the day what's a base when you can't personally connect to the character living inside? When I create a character I like to imagine where they came from what their stories are to justify how they would look in game. You know what if they add character customization I might actually make the same ugly bastard that I'm playing with now but at least it'd be on my terms and that's what matters.The developers have said that you are brought to the real world the way you are and you didn't get to choose how you look so why should you in Rust? That's a ridiculous statement. You can get surgery to change how you look in real life if you don't like it. Games aren't meant to be like real life there needs to be a point to playing games. So I can't choose how I look in game but I can survive and run away with a bullet in my leg simply by bandaging my arm? Yes that's realism! 2. I would spend more money on the market When buying skins for clothing on the market I like to think of how it would look on my character. Then I realise everything would look like absolute on my character so I don't buy anything. That's bad business.3. Just give us character customization already.Seriously I don't care if you make us pay for it just let us choose already. I wouldn't even care if you had to choose from premade presets. I wouldn't even care if you added it as character lootboxes Pay to get a new randomly generated character. I would lose respect for the developer for the last option but I would be insanely happy nonetheless.Update I can't recommend this game for what the game has become. It's just no longer worth playing.,Rust

Admins will not ban you if you grief (like actually grief not raiding).This is pretty much a griefing simulator. if you can tolerate harassment (actual harassment not ""he called me a name waaaa"" or he took my things waaaah"") then you're good.

2017-11-05,0,0,95,True,Recommended,"Hm what can I say about rust? I mean sure the game's community is a majority of horribly toxic players who kill new players on sight for no logical reason there is nearly no sense of wildlife in the gane except for the rare deer or bear and that the game is horribly unoptimised but these are just minor set backs right? Ehhh kinda? The game has a $20 price tag which rarely goes down on sale which means its difficult for people to try out this game without paying the extremely high price. Unfortunately this game can be quite tedious and just an openworld PvP FPS most of the time with next to none of the ""survival"" aspect that Facepunch was going for. The game itself is quite enjoyable with a larger group of friends or even a clan but playing alone is a nearly impossible task as if you are alone and farming resources to upgrade your base and a small group of players ambushed you. Bam everything is lost. Oh and if you try to join a group of players to survive with they'll either kill you or they'll....uhhh no actually they'll just kill you. Luckily this game has got decent players that help new players and aid they're attempt of survival and these players are what give you hope to take down the toxic and fight for the good. Now why am I giving this game a positive review? It's because of how the game has a way to keep bringing you back to make you think 'I want to build a fort and start a clan."" Or "" I should check back on my base and upgrade it"" or just "" man I wanna play some Rust "". Sure the game needs many updates and improvements to become a full game sure the players need to stop being so toxic so the game stops having a bad reputation for it's community and sure the price should drop more often for players that don't want to buy a non developed game for $20. These things may happen overtime but at this point I believe that Rust was worth my money and was *mainly* good fun.",Rust

Although it can also be very rewarding after a succesfull raid or a clean headshot it is very agrovating when it happens to you. If you are new to the game I strongly recomend playing on a low pop or highly modded server such as a noob freindly or 10/1000 times resorce. This will teach you the basics by doing. Or if you wish to pratice ypur base building skills ther are plenty of creative servers with unlimmited eveything( Just search ""creative"" in the modded tab). Also there are also servers in which you spawn with all wepons and ammo which is good for learning pvp skills. When i brought the game i just jumped into the first server i could find. This was a offical server which very hard as a noob then i found the bluebery line of servers in the modded tab these are what i play as lot. I tend to play 5x a lot. Overall i think that this is both a fun and rewarding survival pvp game that is well worth its alpha price.",Rust

It was made to be an intense PVP surivial game so complaining about what other players do and other clans do is downright silly. It's meant to be a brutal game and it does just that. If you have a decent rig and a decent GPU the game will run fine with few problems. After putting 700 hours into this game I still find myself playing and enjoying everyday. I lead a clan of 11 members and I can tell you its one of the most fun things I've done on the internet yet. This is a breath of fresh air because far too often there are games getting popular where you get banned for talking and greifing however in rust anything(besides hacking) goes and thats what I love about it.

Bauplan craften vier Wände und ein Dach Schlafsack Schmelzofen Werkbank läuft doch prima. Bis auf einmal nachts Schritte zu hören sind. Da ist einer vor unserer Hütte. Klick. Und unsere Tür steht in Flammen. Da will uns doch tatsächlich einer mit dem Flammenwerfer heimsuchen . Jetzt schlau sein und warten. Die Tür ist weg die Flammen auch und schnell rennen wir raus in die Nacht. Geschafft! Sicherheitshalber warten wir noch zehn Minuten bis er auch sicher nicht mehr da ist bevor wir zu unserer Hütte zurückgehen und nachgucken was von unserem Loot noch in den Kisten ist *Schock* Der Kerl hat uns nicht nur alles geklaut was wir haben er hat auch noch eine neue Tür eingesetzt und ein Schloss drangehängt. Das war es mit unserer Base Mit Stock und Stein kommen wir da nicht mehr rein. Jetzt gibt es nur zwei Möglichkeiten Rust deinstallieren oder es so oft neu probieren bis wir selber der Mistkerl sind der anderen die Hütte raidet .https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1370833249Rust erschien 2013 hier auf Steam und blieb fast fünf Jahre im Early Access bis es im Februar 2018 endlich offiziell released wurde. Ich verrate euch jetzt warum Rust meiner Meinung nach eigentlich ein gutes Spiel ist aber worauf ihr euch da einlasst.GameplayWie schon eingangs beschrieben ist Rust ein klassisches Survival Action Adventure im Stil von DayZ Ark 7 Days to Die und wie sie alle heißen. In der Ego Perspektive steuert ihr euren zunächst nackten Recken durch eine offene Spielwelt sammelt Holz und Steine baut euch eine Basis sammelt Waffen (vom Bogen bis zum Raketenwerfer ist alles dabei) und kämpft PvE und PvP ums Überleben. Und genau im letzten Punkt liegt der Hund begraben.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1372199356PvE bedeutet im Prinzip nur dass in der Spielwelt meistens in der Nähe des besten Loots ein paar blau gekleidete Forscher rumlaufen die mit Maschinengewehren auf euch schießen wenn ihr ihnen zu nahe kommt. Die sind aber nach ein paar Spielstunden keine ernstzunehmende Bedrohung mehr für euch. Anders verhält sich das jedoch in Sachen PvP.Ich habe selten so aggressive und unfreundliche (menschliche) Spieler in einem Spiel gesehen wie in Rust. Selbst wenn man nackt ist (also klar erkennbar keinen wertvollen Loot besitzt) wird man grundlos umgeschossen und selbst Anfängerhütten mit Holzwänden werden rücksichtslos geraidet. Jetzt könnte man auf die Idee kommen den Spielern einen Vorwurf zu machen und manchmal mag das bestimmt auch berechtigt sein. Aber genau das ist eben der Sinn dieses Spiels. Es gibt keine erlesenen Basis Bau Rezepte. Es gibt keinen nennenswerten Endgame Content. Der einzige Sinn des Spiels ist das Aufleveln der Werkbank um so zunächst einfache Pistolen über Sturmgewehre bin hin zum Sprengstoff zu erforschen und craften zu können damit man damit dann auf die Jagd nach anderen Spielern und deren Behausungen gehen kann. Die Starken jagen die Schwachen. So funktioniert Rust nun einmal. Und wer meint casual auf einem der Server unterwegs sein zu können und jeden Tag ein Stündchen vor sich hin zu spielen der sei gewarnt. Wer so spielt gehört in Rust definitiv zu den Schwachen.GrafikRust sieht einfach super aus. Die Entwickler von Facepunch Studios zaubern mit der Unity Engine ein inzwischen optisch tadelloses Spiel auf die Bildschirme. Schönere Sonnenauf bzw. untergänge mit ihrem orange bis lilafarbenem Licht habe ich selten gesehen. https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1371422484Die Optik fordert jedoch auch ihren Tribut. Bei Mittelklasserechnern mit vollen Einstellungen gehen die FPS gerne mal in den Keller. Ich empfehle in diesem Fall das Gras etwas zu reduzieren was zugleich auch der besseren Übersicht im Spiel zugutekommt.UmfangRust bietet euch im Hauptmenü eine Vielzahl von unterschiedlichen Servern auf denen ihr (jedes Mal beginnend bei null) ins Abenteuer starten könnt. Klassischerweise wählt ihr einen offiziellen Server und spielt dort den klassischen Spielmodus also Survival gegen alle auf dem Server befindlichen anderen menschlichen Spieler. Der Servername gibt euch dabei Aufschluss über Land (und somit Sprache) des Servers und über den Spielmodus. Regelmäßig sind auch Zusätze wie beginner friendly oder noob friendly zu finden was zu Beginn vielleicht nicht schlecht ist )Neben den offiziellen Servern gibt es noch Community Server welche von Spielern betrieben werden sowie modded Server auf denen sich eine Vielzahl von anderen Spielmodi und Spielvarianten finden. Wie und wo man da selbst richtig aufgehoben ist muss jeder selber entscheiden. Es gibt die verschiedensten Spielvarianten von Deathmatch (mit sofortigem bewaffneten Respawn) bis hin zu superfreundlichen Servern ohne PvE und PvP wo man einfach nur in Ruhe vor sich hin bauen kann. Rust bietet also zwar durchaus Abwechslung in den Spielmodi der tatsächlich klassische Modus und somit auch die Server die am besten besucht sind sind aber klar die offiziellen mit dem oben beschriebenen Standardmodus von Rust. Cheater Problem?Man kann nicht Rust sagen ohne das gleich jemand bereit steht und etwas zum Thema Cheater berichtet und tatsächlich scheint Rust zu Beginn stark von diesem Problem heimgesucht worden zu sein. Ich hatte jedoch in den nun beinahe 100 Stunden in denen ich Rust gespielt habe nie das Gefühl gerade von einem Hacker getötet worden zu sein. Ich schätze dass die die mich gekillt und geraidet haben einfach nur besser waren als ich )ErrungenschaftenGute Nachrichten für alle Achievement Sammler. Rust beinhaltet 48 Errungenschaften die alle lediglich an das Bestehen des Tutorials geknüpft sind. Man muss keinen Gegner töten und kein Haus raiden aber dennoch ein Weilchen spielen. Diese Errungenschaften sollten für niemanden wirklich eine große Herausforderung darstellen. Da sie sich aber nur auf offiziellen Servern freischalten lassen muss man sich schon zumindest zeitweise für die Achievements den echten Spielern unter den echten harten Spielbedingungen stellen. FazitRust ist grundsätzlich ein gutes Spiel. Es hat ein zielstrebiges Konzept eine sehr schöne Optik eine aktive Community und knallharte Emotionen zu bieten verlangt dafür aber Taktik gewisse Skills an der Waffe und wirklich viel Zeit um die ersten Stunden und Tage eines frischen Servers mitzunehmen wo dort noch keine Spieler mit Raketenwerfer und C4 unterwegs sind (also nur im Urlaub/ in den Ferien spielen ).Wer kein Problem damit hat nach stundenlangem Spielen alles zu verlieren und wieder von vorne anzufangen und auch mit knallharten und erbarmungslosen menschlichen Spielern umgehen kann ohne die Maus an die Wand zu feuern oder in Depressionen zu verfallen der kann in Rust viele unterhaltsame Stunden verbringen. Für Casual Gamer und Pazifisten ist Rust hingegen absolut nichts. Die aktuellen 31 99 Euro hier auf Steam halte ich in Anbetracht des Alters des Spiels für etwas zu teuer. In den häufigen Sales ist Rust aber regelmäßig für unter 20 Euro zu haben. Von mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung aber mit ganz klaren Einschränkungen!,Rust

2016-08-07,0,0,2056,True,Recommended,Writing this review has taken a lot of thought and speculation for what is to come of Rust in the future as it will (hopefully) exit early access and be published as a finished game. My first 300 hours in Rust were amazing. The expanse of the world and its playerbase made me super curious about the game and how I could get better. I literally didnt stop playing. Keep in mind that I played on a single 20 50 player server this entire time that didnt have huge clans. Eventually the excitement dulled out (yu yi). I wasnt playing a game I played it like a chore. Resource gathering 24/7 and taking time out of my day to catch up with the others on the server. Later last month I picked up the game again. To my surprise upon logging in to a 120 player server i found a wasteland of abandoned and raided bases before a montser base. It seems that nowadays in Rust if youre on a more than 100 player server you just play with the intent that you will be found if you are hiding your base away and you will be raided by a monster clan like DMG CML etc. Even hardcore players in small groups dont stand a chance on these servers. It's just a matter of time and surely not a fun one before your bases demise. Rust is now a clan game. Numbers are pretty much all that matter. I still love it.,Rust

2015-02-17,0,0,2110,True,Recommended,I've played since Legacy and this game has come an increadibly long way ! Over me and my mates account I've played close to 3500 hours. The gameplay is great although often feels choppy even at a high FPS/Good Ping but that is very minor. Updates are rolled out every single week with fixes anti hack updates optimization new items and texture overhauls !!! My biggest problem with this game is the emphasis on clan building a game such as this should be made easier with more people after all thats how all the greatest civilizations lasted..through team work ! But it makes playing on most servers as a solo player almost impossible they need ti implement mechanics to either help solo players or negate the bonus to having a large number of players in a single group ! If you havn't played RUST yet you should take a long look at yourself in the mirror while it's downloading and getting ready to play just expect to find friends fast or get stomped !

The only servers that stay populated are the very limited ""Rustafied"" official servers who you most of the time have to wait in a 200 player+ queue to enter which may take several hours unless you have VIP pass (not even exaggerated).Offline raids ruin the fun in the game too as the community seem to enjoy grinding materials for a ton of hours without any action for then to attack an undefended base with yet again no action. Obviously raiding someone while they're not there to defend it is easier for the attackers. However I really don't see the fun in it.",Rust

Whats the point of having tool cupboards if they can still build the first level of foundation and all that its literally useless. You spend days working on a base and getting loot then they spend 30 seconds building stairts to just hop over your big walls you spend forever farming for to make. Then they just casually walk in destroy everything you worked on and then thats it you just do it again. Or you can go to another server and the same thing happens. Biggest waste of money ive ever spent cant reccomend this game at all. Fix the stupid tool cupboards and maybe its a 6/10 but thats never going to be fixed because the devs support jerk wads who like to go arround raiding everyones bases.

2016-07-15,0,0,79,True,Not Recommended,Rust originated as an awesome game where you could focus on survival or on attacking other players. The game developers held that against people after forced map wipes so any of your work is done. The game was beautifully designed and lots of fun you had to find blueprints to find new weapons and you could easily work as a team with friends where some can hunt and others build or whatever struck their fancy. The game developers then screwed it all up introducing an XP system that did not work. The system made it that you had to level up and then unlock weapons in a stupid way as you could not easily get all items. and the levels made it you could make metal knives and stuff before a primitive bow and arrow go figure. The Developers then screwed things up all the more by yet another full game wipe and insulting players who game often as well as holding it against them wanting to give XP 'buffs' to people who do not play the game much instead of rewarding those who do play it often. they are wanting to further make it harder to play the game peacefully and want to force players into pvp rather then pve.,Rust

If you make the long journey across the map you'll find that your base has been destroyed or building permissions have been locked by the raider meaning you can't even place a new sleeping bag there let alone repair and use the base again.

2016-07-22,0,0,235,True,Not Recommended,I really really want to play and enjoy this game but it simply isn't worth it at this point in time.The recent addition of the XP system took this game from a exciting tense unpredictable survival game with a strong PvP presence to another MMOish predictable unexciting grindfest. Even the no lifers are complaining about the grind to unlock blueprints via levels.Worth noting for those of you with a life ... XP based blueprint unlocks mean most of the advanced(fun) stuff is behind a minimum of 40+ hours of grinding XP/Level is PER SERVER meaning any change of servers to join your friends means completely starting over from scratch Both official and many community servers wipe the map(all bases gathered resources etc) very regularly(1 4 weeks) and also wipe XP/Level on a less regular basis. Do not expect the in game results of ANY time spent in this game to stick around. Once a wipe happens the only thing previous sessions provide you is knowledge in game you're just as scrub as the other nakeds. The developers are still hiding behind the 'Early Access Alpha' tag and will change MAJOR CORE GAME ELEMENTS at whim usually followed by a few weeks of almost un playibility due to repeated wipes from buggy code that has to be fixed and requires character/server data to be wiped to institute the fix.Avoid this game until they decide to 'release' it and remove the Alpha tag. Until they do expect a horrible player experience with tons of bugs and developer induced wipes even the server admins don't want because the code control is awful. Honestly not even sure if the developers themselves know the direction they want the game to go.,Rust

2018-12-03,2,1,37,False,Not Recommended,This game really makes no sense. Why is it crafting if you lose your whole progress to start all over again in endless loop? Community is toxic people will shoot you at sight or group raid your house when you are afk. Later using buggy mechanics to block everything off. You spawn naked surrounded by 4 steel walls. so with that easy move your robbed house is lost. Not to mention exploits that won't be fixed. Especially boosting. Other thing is complete lack of charackter customization. No other survival game is so bad in that manner. In every game I play I spend most of my time on creating character I can enjoy playing with. But not here I just got some black bald dude not only that but also fat. Like literally game tries to make you as ugly as possible. And how devs explain their laziness? By telling us to deal with it and that in real life you also don't know who will you be. It is a lie. My parents knew very well I will not be a black dude and for sure I wouldn't make myself fat. Those are choices this game simply does not offer. Other people aren't lucky aswell from what I have witnessed. Most of players run around as half naked bald women that look like they had some serious chemotherapy. It doesn't take long time to watch survival programs and know who would dominate in numbers. Only other game that broke my immersion so badly was ARK.Building is also out of date compare to more modern games. Building something that isn't made from squares and triangles can prove challenging. Different styles? Not in this game. You have a wall that you can upgrade into a better wall. No diversity in that field. But hey! Does it matter in a survival game?Why would someone want to play this game? Probably only if you like post apocalyptic survivals if you like survival FPS if you like to fight afks if you like to farm dudes with no stuff on them (there is a lot of those) if you prefer to do all of that above but spend as limited amount of time as you can on creativity aspect this game is for you.,Rust

2018-12-18,0,0,1939,False,Recommended,heey all I played rust for 1600 hours or something. So I decided to write a review. Forgive my grammar because i am not the best in English writing but I want to share my experience with everyone.I loved this game and really straightforward.You spawn in to get your starting items and start to gather and killing.It is nothing more than that. first rust was really simplistic and gave everyone the same fair chance no buy to win scenarios and no extras that give other an advantage on the start. I even believe this game would be played like this even after 10 years from now if I would have stayed like this with just little tweaks to it.After some tweaking some area's got a new finished coat on them and put some scientist in the Military tunnels and on the road. I told my friend and wife in the beginning this would do the game well if they could implement something like that in the game. Maybe a zerg bandit group would be nice also.Also the Outpost came out.I think the outpost would be fairly ok if you could buy like components and armor there. But overall I do not think this would add something to the game then give ppl quick weapons and let ppl hide when chased.Bandit camp.I loved the misty march area it is and I love the scenery around it. Deffo brings a new dimension to the map.Also the gambling area is a really nice setup. But why put a shop there where you can but so many overpowered items.Again a game bust for me.Now Facepunch really did a number on this one.The first negative for me was the Chinook crate. This crate was just to much impact for 1 item. You can get every vital item in the game out of it. so about few hours into the game you can have an AK and Bolt action. One time i started on a Solo server and few hours after the wipe i got the chinook crate with AK and bolt metal face and some other stuff. Looted. For big groups or small zergs this is just to Overpowered and I think this pulls the survival aspect out of the game. Airdrop is far more balanced because half the time you get only simple loot out of it.Then the puzzle switch spots came. I do not really like it myself because it is too vulnerable area now to me. The big group has soo much advantage over that. Also the whole survival game aspect of searching for loot and stuff is just over because all the good loot is now concentrated on one spot in every rad town. Ofc there is some random loot everywhere but you get my point I hope.And then the boat comes. OMG 4 loot crated with the most OP stuff in one spot. I think the scientist on the boat and the boat moving around is very cool. But so much good loot on the boat is just stupid. Probably done because for less no one would go there.From a good survival game this game when to a whole different style. I would call it more and less a hunger game style.The surprising aspect of survival is far gone. The fun of bow fighting for 1 or 2 days is far over. It is rush for the best gun as fast as possible. Ofc you did it in the beginning also but the chance of getting some was not so easy. In the early days I could even trade for armored doors and guns and armor. People searched for day to get an AK. Now no1 has to anymore and if you always struggling to get items then its time to get the other game for real if you can not find 1 gun in 1 day playing then you should go play pokemon.I really hate it that this game is violated so much. why i dont really know but mostly its because all these noobs that can not play a game keep complaining on the forums that they can not get stuff. But does not matter how much they try if they can get it in the beginning they deffo dont get it in the end. Also many game makers overdo themself by adding and adding to a game to keep ppl interested. For me rust just needed some envoirment tweaks ( as bandit and scientist and bug and glisch fix. Also some more anti cheat would be great. Ban those ppl on IP. because many of them just buy a new game. Then ad some new guns now and then and maybe a shop for attatchments. Anyways there are so many things to ad and do without screwing it up so much.Still RUST has its charms and maybe on a modded server you can find the real surviving trill you need.I can not really say that i could not recomment this game because i still enjoy a good old battlefield server to just go and shoot some ppl. Altrue i think that the price asked for rust is to hight. For me then the game is killing itself and wat i see on games that will come in 2019 rust will have to fight for their spot in the top 10 list.thank you for reading and Game on to you all,Rust

2016-03-06,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Right now unless you have a lot of friends willing to waste time on this game with you its simply not worth it. Solo play is near impossible as you will be hunted down ruthlessly by other players. In its current state RUST is more or less a Troll simulator and not a particularly good one. If your sick and tired of immature gamers and want to avoid games which are based entirely on griefing others DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Pros 1. Interesting concept. Cons 1. Based entirely of murdering other people. 2. All other elements of 'survival' like hunger thirst etc may as well not exist they do not play a major role in the game other than at the start eating and drinking gets your health up. 3. Worlds can be too small the Devs did this to increase 'Human encounters' but what it really means is the guys with the guns don't have to go far to slaughter everyone else/each other. 4. Unless you start at a Server refresh you are not likely to get far. The world will often become covered in buildings which sort of saps the wilderness feel away from the game but also means there is no free space for others to set up in. Basically you will get molested straight away. 5. Needs more NPCs. 6. Needs more Hostile NPCs. Overall this game has no real aim its pretty generic right now.,Rust

2014-11-29,1,1,461,True,Recommended,(2014 review)It's gotten so realistic in details on some parts and it is an hour wasting fun game.Be warned that so many cheaters play this at the moment.Since I want people to know I made this review way back before Rust was how it is I'll make my second review here (2017 review) One of the best Multiplayer PVP games out there it's a pretty difficult game many people in the game are better in terms of PVP so I die a lot but I mainly go for base defense over raiding it's really fun to play in groups with your friends and can be extremely boring when you play solo a thing people commonly run into is being offline raided raiders find it easier to break into your base when you're offline so they don't have to waste as much resources firing back.This is a review so I won't add too much just the parts of the game that makes it fun.Component system is cool so you can craft anything you want as long as you have the parts you can scavenge parts from barrels.This game's community is cancerous so don't expect people being friendly and giving you stuff of course I am one of those friendly people that's why I said cancerous community but it's rare to find others like me.,Rust

Rust is a game in which you start out (hilariously I might add) completely nude with just a rock and a torch. The default settings in Rust actually allow you to see the character models' (rather detailed) genitals though I'm not sure why it's optional to block these out. In terms of legality it doesn't help the devs but this is a review. So here it goes.Pros Strong gameplay aspects (crafting is awesome)Great graphicsBeautiful environmentsFun things to do including huntingEasy to set up with friendsVery well set up for an alpha gameCons Awful community super toxic.Can be terribly grindy (but it's a survival game so duh)Some blueprints are impossible to findThis is an early access review I'll revise it once the game's released.Definitely recommend in its current form for an alpha game this is probably the most promising I've ever played.,Rust

2016-08-21,1,1,1689,True,Not Recommended,"Released 12/11/2013 (and still classified as an alpha release almost 3 years later) but many of the bugs are gone. Animals still move in fixed small circular patterns and often phase through the walls of buildings to kill you in your sleep. With the current version bows and crossbows are severely overpowered compared to firearms but games rarely have a perfect balance when it comes weapons. The build system is well done even if it sometimes seems to take forever just to get a solid base up so you have some protection from the elements deadly animals and looters.The mentality of a large part of the community is on part with the worst behavior depicted in ""Lord of the Flies."" However that is somewhat expected in this type of game. If that is not something you can tolerate you should probably look for a different game. The bad news? The entire experience is very often completely ruined by people using downloaded skill (yes hacks and lots of them). Aimbot ESP door hacks etc. You can spend 8 hours building a solid base with friends and two cheating thirteen year olds can take it and everything in it from you in 30 seconds or less. Many openly admit to using this or that hack but it is often readily apparent even when they do not admit it (one shot one kill on a moving target on the distant horizon or one player who can mysteriously take on five or more armed and armored opponents repeatedly and never lose).How bad is the hacking problem?

You can make friends and stick with them betray them make enemies kill them etc. you will have a love/ hate relationship with this game but thats what makes it great. In my opinion its the best human/ nature sim out there. I like playing a survival game where i dont have to worry about zombies or mutants getting in my way whereas here all i have to deal with is wolves and bears along with other players. So i would highly recommend this game if your looking for a survival open world game that feels unique slightly cartoonish and that doesnt have zombies or monsters. 100/10 The Almighty Wumbo approves. Only con is that your not playing it now and my intewebz is being atm...(P.s just remember that the game isnt complete yet and things WILL change as in somethings might be removed or other things may be added just like what happened to legacy although you can go and play it by switching versions.),Rust

I would absolutely recomend this game to someone who is looking for a fun good looking game. This game is an Early Accsess but Facepunch the developers know how to make a game and a good game at that. I have a good feeling for the direction this game will be headed in when it is a full game. It's already a really good game.,Rust

2016-11-11,2,2,7,True,Not Recommended,"For a game focused on PVP one would have thought the game was more polished.Hit detection is terrible.Jumping is terrible.The community is terrible.For some reason your steam account is bound to one selected skin and you're stuck with that forever.You spend hours farming to get good gear just to get speared in the head because the server didn't detect your shotgun shooting the opposing player in the face and lose your stuff.Doesn't seem like the devs can decide on being immersive or not.You can chop down a tree with a rock but you can't use a fireaxe to break open a wooden door unless you spend 1 hour hitting it.Also there is no ""survival aspect"" to the game as there is no punishment for dying. Sometimes when my character was hungry I just went and killed myself since that was faster and less costly than getting food.There are better alternatives on this overblown market of ""Early access survival games.""I'd recommend Don't starve together if you want to PVE.And for PVP I'd recommend....

2018-01-06,0,0,536,True,Not Recommended,This game is pretty fun and addicting I really wish I could actually play this game but my biggest problem is arguably the community and raiding. This has to be one of the most toxic communities ive ever seen in video games. KOS is common place flaming/trashtalking is everywhere loot despawning door camping for over an hour etc. Its actually worse than gta 5 which is saying something. People become so sweaty and competitive like they think they're in walking dead or something (maybe they do) And with how they've been updating it they're only catering to this kind of playstyle. They added stores to give the game some other kind a player interaction besides cod style shoot on sight but was so half its not even funnyOnline Raiding is probably the funnest and most exciting thing to do but why would you do that when you can just offline raid. Offline raiding is awlays the better option because you have no opposition. I don't know how you can consider that player vs player its player vs static building. And if you're like most people and actually have other stuff to do or am not in a massive clan of people its pretty much inevitable that you're going wake up to a cleaned out base. Of course you can make multiple bases to minimize damage but thats not really a solution and exspensive as now with the new upkeep system. Playing on a pve server is pointless because the devs don't give a about pve. They really only care about making money off of skins at this point thats just early access drift for you.TLDR TOXIC COMMUNITY OFFLINE RAIDING IS BAD,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,135,True,Recommended,TL DR Couldn't get into it got into it with a friend played for almost 20 (edit make that 70) hours straight bought a server. You should probably go buy it.I bought this game a while ago. My first experience was pretty standard. Walk around for 4 hours get the hang of things in the last 10 minutes after 3h50m of walking in circles only to get shot in the face by a naked dude by a shotgun. Then I played with a friend on a PvE server and he had a base setup. He taught me how to use the map how to craft and build etc. We played for 6 hours together just running around hitting the towns for loot to make our base bigger. He logged off so I continued to play. For another 2 hours. At 6 in the morning. Then I bought a server. And played for another 2 hours.I went to sleep woke up a couple hours later and hopped on my server. Then I played for 12 hours straight. I peed maybe 3 times. I blinked for less. Now here I am 8am not wanting to play more for fear of pulling a 48hr er but still wanting to tell someone how hooked I am on this game. I haven't been hooked on a game like this since halo 3 or early minecraft. I can't sleep.God help us all.,Rust

2017-08-14,0,0,7232,True,Not Recommended,After I purchased Rust roughly 1.5 years ago it quickly became one of my favorite games ever but at its current state I can't recommend it and am probably going to quit playing soon myself. (AFTER 4850HRS yes you read that right). The devs (HELK) are slowly killing every desire I had to play this game and are turning it into a shell of what it once was and is supposed to be. It started firstly with the twig update which has essentially killed building overall. Then comes the stupid new changes to nodes once again completely uneccessary and pointless. Not to mention the aim mechanic changes. WHY???Every update is now just pointless roleplayer or cosmetic BS nothing towards fixing what is fundamentally broken with this game ans the reason the player base is FLEEING. The devs only seem to focus on what the rust youtubers want (the minority) and not what their actual playerbase wants from the game. Most of the 'rust youtubers' arent even solely playing rust anymore so thats gotta SAY SOMETHING. It's really quite depressing to see what a game I loved so dearly has become.,Rust

2017-12-10,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,Just Say NoI can not stress enough how horrible this game is compared to other games of it's genre and just in general. This is mostly to do with the how the game is coded and the person who done said coding (and whoever the rest of the team is). There seem to be other influences as well such as umm uhhh hmmmm well if I think of any I will sure let you know so let us get down to it. This game is just no fun. it's full of ugly grass rocks and alot of ugly naked people. If you like games that have a goal then this game is not for you as there is nothing to do. You can argue that you can build awesome bases and raid and just have a good survival experience but this game just does not do it the right way. The multiplayer coding talent does not exist as the servers available are some of the worst gaming experiences I have had. Want to go kill some mobs with the worst animations and AI ever? Maybe this is the game for you then. Want to take 100 spears and break into the strongest base on your server? Too easy why do that when you can just spawn right into someones base because of never ending never fixed glitches? The game has no goal but to ignore it's community. No I have never posted on the FPunch forums or cared too I just did my own research by looking at the forums. The bugs in this game seem never ending due to the way the game is coded. I like to put these types of games in the class of (kindergarten Coders Games) and have a laugh about it but then reality sets in and I get quite down when I realize that people actually spend their hard earned money on games that (in my opinion) are this bad. If you like garbage then go for it. If you like to have fun then why would you play the worst game of it's genre? Years later the game feels like it is still in the same state as the day I bought it,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,734,False,Recommended,I've played this game a bit. It's fun.Seriously tho Rust is the gold standard in survival PVP. Even better there are modded servers and PVE worlds if you like me don't want to just run around murdering defenseless noobs. I've been playing since the earliest days of Early Access and it's only gotten better.The building mechanics are fluid and fun. Gathering is balanced and bears can be deadly when you start out. The graphics are excellent (albeit resource hungry) and the combat is fair. Most people play it for the excitement of violence but there's plenty of game for the rest of us too. (I'd like more PVE elements but obviously the lack of them hasn't stopped me from spending lots of time in the game.) The developers are smart but don't immediately capitulate to the demands of the mob. Highly recommended.,Rust

Even if you get inside you won't live long enough to see anything of worth.And that's the problem here. I have spent more than an hour attempting to play this game. However I never was able to get anything more than the rock that you start with. Some of this is due to the game's interface itself. There is no tutorial. No objective. And no way to refer to game controls from within the game to find out what does what. For most single player games this would not be an issue and is sometimes a great strength of ""exploration"" style games. Much of the fun is finding your way in a barren world learning to survive on your own.However this is NOT a single player game. This is a game world populated by hundreds of young boys whose only apparent goal in life is to slaughter any new player that dared to purchase Rust. You will not survive. The moment you find something interesting to look at or try to craft you will lose it all because some little brat with his junk hanging out has smashed your head in with a rock. You lose everything and must start over.So do I recommend this? No. Not until the developers include a way to at least learn the controls and the crafting systems PRIOR to throwing you to the wolves.",Rust

2018-08-22,0,0,637,False,Recommended,Ok I will say this Rust is not an easy game yet it can be easy. I will explain with the following paragraphs that will be split into 2 sections General PvP &amp PvE. General In general this is a great game. Good graphics and great gameplay. Overall a solid 7/10 for me. The next 2 sections will explain my numbers. PvP This section of Rust can be rather difficult. It is not a new player friendly portion of the game. Often times there are jerks on a PvP server that tend to harrass and target new players either to the game or the server. This is a sad part of any MMO but is more previlant here in RUST. This part almost ruined the game for me when I first started. I explect a fair share of bullies in the gaming world but my first server was full of them. my first 6 hours were spent dieing very shortly after I spawned into the world. This would have been due to the players more than the environment. I felt outnumbered and left with little to no way to defend myself. A naked man with a rock and a torch is no match against players with Custom SMG's and with Metal armor on. Seemed like every based I made got raided too. While I know raiding happens but again a bully targeted me and me alone and intentionally raided my based 16 times within the first 5 days of being on that server. Bit much even by my standards. This nearly turned me off RUST completely. In fact I stopped playing RUST for a long period of time. I give PvP a 5/10 cause of all the bullies and hassle you have to deal with in this environment as well as the foul language that is used. PvE This part of RUST is an awesome setup for servers. There are of course bullies anywhere but less so here. The community seems better and friendlier. It is also the section that saved RUST for me. Players against NPC's animals APC's the helicopter patrols and others can be more entertaining then spending hours dieing from players. Yes this seems to be a tamer side but a fun part. Seems to be harder to. Especially when it comes to the servers that have added zombies to the game. Hordes of zombies with only a shotgun and a crossbow seems like it would work but not always when nature decides to try and attack you as well. Overall this style of play is better for those that are starting out or wish for a friendly playthrough. I give this section an 9/10 because of some lag that is caused by PvE mods.,Rust

2016-08-21,0,0,186,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a FPS PVP survival game. If you're familiar to Hurtworld H1Z1 then this will be pretty much similar. At first you will be stranded from at the coast with just a Rock and Torch injured and hungry. You are to find resources around the map and build your way up to making your base. While at the same time cross pathed with some mean players or even the AI helicopters. Getting to kill the helicopter is hard too with this ongoing community of raging wars. The game is built to be PVP in a real harsh world.Rust have generally revolved alot from the beginning stages where players can still pot lucked themselves when hunting out the barrels for blueprints to get some lucky items. However after the developers have changed the gameplay system to an EXP leveling system. Now it's pretty hard for new players whom have joined the game. Especially the game of being the nothing on hand continues to be poor while the fully loaded continues to get richer. With this system in mind it's hard even for players to reach the top level of leveling system. Generally I've seen most of the players get raided at around Level 12 onwards. Where you have gathered your resources to make your Furnace and smelt some Metal Fragments. Ready for some Gunpowder crafting and make guns.For networking most of the official servers are located in the US Australia and Hong Kong. But most of them are stranded with raided houses it's nearly impossible to survive out there where there's already ongoing players whom have build them long ago. While some still continues to play them but have shifted to modded servers instead. It's just basically pointless for players to build all the way up for days and to be destroyed by C4 detonations within seconds. Although modded servers practice a way that they will wipe the servers every monthly or bi weekly basis to get new players to come back and climb the ladder again. It's a vicious cycle.None to say most of the servers are still pretty mean towards players or rather shoot on sight basis. It's hard to get team players if you were to be playing single. So get this game if you're going to play with friends by means they are active in their gameplay too. Since raiding can happen anytime online or offline. You wouldn't want to get back the next day only to see your sleeping body to be emptied out and slaughtered.If you're looking for more friendly survival games out there I suggest you play Unturned Don't Starve Together instead. It's still a survival but in a PVE role yet still able to team together. Moreover the server reset are more frequent there than here. Where you nearly survive less than just a week while the wipe is a month later.It will be good to have the players to choose probably 3 teams on the first day of the wipe. Thereafter players whom just came in later to only have to choose within that 3 teams and play along side with them and unable to swap teams. So at least it's still a PVP with raging war going on meaning three factions team fighting each other and also the neutral party of the AI helicopters. Yet still able to get incoming players to join the team with the growing of faction parties. It's like hiring more players to join and fight for the war. This makes players to have a better objective in game than to think whether should I just roam around killing players and only to hide when the AI helicopters come. Or should the teams form an alliance and gun down the AI helicopters? Now that's another diplomacy system that Rust developers have to think of.,Rust

2018-08-10,0,0,908,False,Recommended,"So this game is very interesting if you are a soft type of person get offended easily or have a very quick temper this game is NOT for you. Rust is full of so many Toxic people it is crazy if you do not know what toxic means a toxic player is someone who negatively impacts a game in an intentional way. Bad gameplay and lack of understanding is not being toxic. However bashing anyone in game leaving when things aren't going your way or intentionaly aiding the enemy in any form is toxic. A lot of people are toxic in it and if you do get it you will probably be toxic at some point too. Rust is a brutal game from the players to the gameplay you can just finally be building a base and then you just instantly die to someone from a bow to the head expect this it happens all the time. ""friendly"" players are VERY hard to come across some may even call them ""albino"" lol some people will act friendly at first and then betray you in some way that is either talking to you in a friendly manner which gets you to stop running and you most line up a perfect shot for them or its them taking over your base if you give them your base codes or you lead them to your base and then they raid it. Whatever it is it happens alot. I know I am making this game sound horrible but it is extremely fun if you understand it and/or am good at it in some way whether that is farming for your clan PVP raiding or building. I highly suggest you play this with your friends as most other people do but it is an amazing game and I highly recommend this game.

2016-03-28,0,0,561,True,Recommended,"I've been playing Rust almost since day one. In recent years I have stuck to Rust Legacy(Which is the older rust.) mainly because regular rust gave my computer issues due to Easy Anti Cheat. My old computer would always get kicked on anygame running it. I have gotten a new computer recently built from the ground up and thankfully it doesn't seem to have any problem with EAC....so I have been spending a lot of time playing the newer one...And I have to say I am loving it!Is it as good as Rust legacy? Not at first but that's mainly because I don't like change...once I slowly adjusted to it though? I would say it's better! Rust Legacy got boring quick because there was nothing new to do...This version? Always being updated and just overall fantastic!I do wish they would texture some of the ""Monuments"" though.....all solid colors makes them look unusually clean for a wasteland. Inside factories is so white and shiny it puts modern day hospitals to shame...Still an overall excellent game and one I am enjoying very much! It's easily the best EA title I have purchased.",Rust
2014-04-01,0,0,71,True,Recommended,Rust to me is the backdrop of Fallout 3/NV and the building mechanics Minecraft that has some of the beautiful elements of Far Cry 3. All great things and what hopefully is the start to an amazing game when it finally sheds it's Alpha build state.I think Rust could be the best MMO I've ever played because I personally don't like any MMO's but something about Rust that works mainly because of it's life like rules and harsh realism. From the moment you wake to the inevitable moment you die (or be killed) you're constantly trying to survive and better your gaming life. Time balance and fun.The sad part is I'm not sure if the game will ever be fixed beyond what it is and improved because it seems already that a lot of work has gone into this 'value' priced game and will take a lot more work to both fix and improve.Technical issues small and brightly coloured text on light backgrounds networking lag on busier servers (yet it says they are at 1% capacity) terrible shadow shimmering/flickering on everything controls are a bit odd (holding down E and also use mouse/trackball to click in another menu is not user friendly) can't scroll with mouse/trackball to select anything can't search for certain server graphical collisions and physics seems too random at times and the moment you 'touch' water (sea/rivers/etc) you instantly drown and die.Though in general the game looks impressive runs without crashing the sound atmosphere is almost perfect (breaking stuff is too loud for yourself to hear though) survival methods feel balanced and the day cycle (sunrise to sunset is truly amazing). Graphically it reminds me of playing GTA IV (2009) 'unmodded' now where it still looks pretty impressive but then it also looks old and in need of graphical TLC ...textures for one!In random order these are the gaming faults of 'Rust' I feel that should change or fixed Weather variations (rain thunder storms snow wind extreme weather moments etc) a lot more wildlife on ground level and skies (harmless and harmful) needs to be added smoke from fires should be seen further way (white and black smoke) advance guns needs to be 'removed' as this breaks it's realism in this type of survival game textures for trees rocks doors etc need much improving (looks to low res/pixelated and old school) you should be able to swim in shallow water and even fish (when the right equipment has been made of course) insects should be randomly around (ground level and flying) plantation should be greatly a part of all this tree fruits (shake tree to gain fruits) the ability to talk to those you are near you 'only' in the game (others too far can't hear you or read your typed messages maybe an indication for those a little to far saying Insert Players Name Said something but was too far to heard or read etc) The Ui should be scalable as it's a little too small to read the Ui should have the ability to be transparent (amount set by user) Inverted Ui colours at night the ability to build and use a compass (can be seen in the Ui maybe) you should be allowed to make your own bare skin character (basic is fine but at least something) the ability to climb trees with a balance gauge so if you mess it up you fall and break something even faster sprint running that only last for brief moments foot prints recently left by others ability to dig (though I'd image this would complicated and change the game too much) ability to throw rocks (you don't need guns in this sort of game it's stupid really) accidentally setting fire to things (but they go out fast otherwise it will be too much of game change) ability to drink and gather water does anyone use the loo in some form on Rust player origin country flags or symbols self created maps (when your able to write on paper or similar with charcoal for example) write on rocks with charcoal or similar (but vanishes or is washed away with rain over time) fighting with others barehanded (no weapons) barehanded fights are balanced by you physical strengths (food consumed exercise fat etc) and lastly ...genders ...I only see men and NO WOMEN ...WtF?!? ...What kind of island is this?!?!?OK that was my random and late review which is months over due but it wasn't something I could just say without truly playing this 'huge' 'expansive' and original MMO type game. If your wondering it's a lot better than Nether and 7 Days to Die but I've yet to try and play DayZ which I believe is very different and not as raw and real as Rust.*2/3* I recommend Rust but sadly feel it's not going to get much better than it is and not include any of what I've said above.Note Rust does not work to well in Stereo 3D (lots shading and lighting issues) and will probably be an issue with VR headset such as Oculus __ ...one day I hope it will though!,Rust

2016-04-01,0,0,575,True,Recommended,As of writing this review i've played 450 hours of this game. (thats a lot)This is a survival simulator you start with a rock you end up with a huge castle like base chests full of loot and probably an inventory full of human skulls. Imagine if Skyrim Minecraft and DAYZ collided thats the best way to describe this game.You'll struggle against the elements and wildlife to build a house you'll then spend hours improving that house to protect it from other players (with guns) you'll then go out (with explosives) and raid other peoples houses. Rust is extremely life like you can't take 10 bullets to the chest and live you can starve to death you can freeze to death you can't out run wildlife and you most deffinatly will be murdered if you stumble across a bear in the woods.If you enjoy building and protecting your base or enjoy sniping players from a top a mountain or enjoy hoarding chests full of ammo and guns or taking taking part in full on brutal clan wars this game is for you.Also for anyone concerned about the alpha state this feels like a finished game nothing is broken there is an update about every month.BEWARE This game is hard you will die hundreds of times your base will be raided you will probably google 'how to build a decent base' after a while you will rage quit but most importantly you'll keep coming back because god damn this game is utterly amazing.,Rust

2015-11-01,2,1,621,True,Recommended,"Rust teaches you that there are three kinds of people in this world. People who will offer you help and be kind to you and not leave you as a limp lifeless corpse riddled with bullets. People who will in fact leave you as a limb lifeless corpse that is 56% Metal 44% Flesh and 100% Dead. And then there's the oh so magical third one. The kind of person that runs around with nothing but a pumpkin on their heads whilst screaming ""Stick it up my butt"". I am usually the first kind of person (and sometimes the third) which as you can see makes you the most attractive to teenagers with Tommyguns and mafia fantasies. As you adjust to life after the Third World War (or after an unpopular team wins the super bowl) you will learn that living on your own is meaningless and boring. What fun is it to survive without friends? I eventually moved into a town yes a THRIVING town known simply as ""Smoke Town"". The server I had chosen was TheRustyChicken (a server I highly recommend). Smoke Town was a thriving place...until the wipe where we proceeded to decimate the town with rocket launchers. THEN WE REBUILT THE TOWN and everything was fine. That is until the mafia obsessed teenagers arrived. They annoyed our town by constantly re spawning stealing what they could and going on Friday the 13th inspired rampages. Life was good in between those though. This game will teach you to be a better person because in reality you don't want someone to break in to your home steal everything from your kitchen and smash you over the head with a rock they found in your garden. Either that or you'll eventually become a self righteous hoarder who says things like ""it's survival of the fittest man"". You'll then proceed to become a powerhouse until the first people who set up stuff on the server notice you. They will raid you take your stuff and you're back to being a simple naked fellow with a pet rock. Rust is a game that I highly recommend (definitely try to play with friends if you can). Rust is a game that makes you wish the servers time out because if you log on before the people who held a gun to your head do then you can loot their bodies and slay them in your sleep. 8/10.",Rust

2014-12-14,0,0,32,True,Recommended,Note its ALPHA version guys 3It's a good game ! Yes it has a lot of bugs some may annoy you more than the other but it's allright. As long as you know everything will be once fixed !. So far 14 dec 2014. Bugs aren't such big of a deal. So enough with the bugs let's get on the real review.You start up with a rock and a torch or with a starter kit on modded servers. You cut trees mine ores and make the best house ever. It's addicting if you are into survival games this is the best one so far i have played. Building houses is not hard at all but gattering resources and NOT getting killed is indeed. Someone can easily sneak behind you and cut you. You die so easily you wont even stand a chance againts a sneak atack. You will always hear footsteps so as long as you don't use music you are safe. You can choose between normal Rust and Rust legacy mode. What is legacy mode you may ask ? Legacy mode is a old version of rust the first one ever made. The 2 modes are like tootaly diffrent games. Nothing same . You can see the devs are working hard on updating the game ASAP to fix the bigger bugs. Smaller ones get their fair spotlight aswell . Overall VERDICT If you are into games like minecraft this is worth a check. And its 10 euros so why not ?7/10 Worth checking outWhen the full version comes I'd say i would give it an 8/10,Rust

2015-11-22,0,0,33,True,Recommended,First off I would like to say after watching many people play this game on youtube and having mixed opinions about it I still chose to purchase this game. I have only played a few hours on several diffrent servers and had few interactions with players but some have been as expected (killed on sight and looted for what little I had) but I have also had some positive ones aswell. The game seems to fall to how players interact with eachother this could make people either enjoyor hate this game entirly bassed on these situations. I find the crafting base building and pvp apsects to be entertaining no matter the outcome. Yes i do agree it can be frustrating having progressed so far or finally get a blueprint or item you were working towards or get your base built up just the way you want it to be and get killed but thats just the roll of the dice you take while playing if you cannot stand that I do not think this game is for you. I also think that the progress inprovements that they have made in the updates i have played and also watched on youtube things will never be set in stone or at least in the forseen future. I would recomed this game to anyone who enjoys survival crafting pvp games and is willing to be the most frustrated with a game that they have ever been.,Rust

2018-07-08,1,2,1601,False,Not Recommended,Bought this game mid 2016 At this point it was the xp system that was in place which is personally one of the best systems that rust implemented. But now i have accumalated enough hours to have a viable opinion with nearly 2k hours over 2 accounts.As of now i have quit rust ever since the components system was implemented the game has gone totally down hill since it release in all honesty. Extremelly needy in terms of power and unstable fps constant drops.(may just be me) but i use to run this game at 100fps but anyway a definate not buy in its current state unless you like spen ding days farming then to just be camped by a try hard 10 man clan because thats what the game is on all servers other than solo duo trio but they die down really fast.But yes game is in a state with the developers making the game for themself and not listening to the players.

In my first hour i played i made a pretty basic hut and someone had a bright idea to kill me and i stopped playing for the day.So my friend bought the game and we found a shotgun with some ammo we were so happy that we could defend ourselves from intruders and what not. So then a new spawn with a rock comes out of no where and starts bashing my friends skull in with his rock and i dont know how but my friend got killed by him and as i was about to pick up the shotgun i get killed by a another person.8/10 i reccomend this if you like open world survival games.,Rust

2014-06-02,0,0,422,True,Recommended,Awesome game I have ahd so much fun on this game so far and its still only in Alpha! You can tell its in alpha as some elements of the game are buggy with door glitches foundation glitches and a few more but don't focus on these things.The games really cool with crafting raiding base building PVP battles looting and resource collecting if you like these things then buy the game if not don't complain in the forums.,Rust
2014-06-01,1,2,59,True,Recommended,This game can be really frustrating at times but it's very rewarding. It almost gets me to tears when I cannot build a base without being killed but it's all worth it when I find and/or lure unsuspecting 10 year olds and force them to my will. Nothing is more empowering than standing over a naked 10 year old while you yourself have no pants on. Sometimes before killing these innocent little scoundrels I like to shove a rock up their butt or give them the choice between or jumping off my 12 story home. All in all i spend about 10 hours a day hunting down little children and shoving my entire package scrotum and all inside their bodies. I suggest you do the same. Buy the game. 69/10,Rust
2014-06-01,0,0,107,True,Recommended,As I awoke in a forest I clutched the first thing I could find it was hard and it was round. It was a pet rock quickly I adventured looking for any scrapes of civilization to begin pulling my life together in this hostile world I began to chop a wood pile that had the texture of ceramic fireplace logs. As I smashed my pet rock mindlessly into this pile or ceramic wood a whoosh passes by me I turned to see a bald man in green doctor scrubs holding a bow and arrow aimed right at me As soon as the notion crosses my mind I realize he wants to kill me I damaged his ceramic log god it seemed I ran to my left immediately and then towards him when I got into arm s length my pet rocks face met his face in a violently French kiss of saliva and gore I quickly locate a black bag that it appears he had dropped. There s the scrubs the man was wearing in it and then a shoddy bow and a few arrows and some raw chicken meat. Normally I don t eat meat I find on dead strangers but seeing as I was hungry and there was no KFC in the area I quickly consumed this raw chicken meat. Then as soon as it went down I began to throw up. the sound was of liquid celery on a tile floor a unpleasant sound really as my vomiting stopped I see I m being watched a man in black clothes and a large fire arm brandished at me with malicious intent then I notice the naked man approaching from behind him a documentary about bears flashes into my head its protecting its cub I turn giving the mother distance as the firearm is still aimed at me I hear a crack and a thud next to me the mother is protecting its young as it scavenges the other man who s scrubs I am now wearing I run as far as I can until I hit a road and I follow it so my adventure continues in the hostile land of the angry naked men.,Rust

I enjoy it very much and the pvp requries skills. The npcs are a great way to make rust less pvp and more pve or more surivial. i'd wish the locks had better use beacuse the key raiding dosent make any sence maybe it can use a lock picking tools and skills you gain to unclock and the code locks should have 1 tech trash to its crafting.

2018-02-17,0,0,17,False,Recommended,Rust has become one of the most iconic games online and its no suprise why with it being an early creator of the mixture of survival base building player interaction and a Development team that truly wants to make a game be the best that it can be. The Good Amazing Development team always looking to make the game better. Gun play is satisfying enough. Community (while not as big as it used to be) is still large enough to alway find a server. Frequent updates. Providing countless hours of entertainment well worth the price of admission. Very easy to run of most pc's and keeps just getting better over time. The Bad While yes this is a survival game after a few days and once you have an okay understanding of the game you really are never in fear of dying from the elements just other players. The ease of weapons kills again any sense of this being a survival game and makes it feel like a shooter with base building and naked people. While there are still communties and servers more than willing to help new players the game overall feels alot more closed off than in previous years and I can see it being hard for a new player to feel welcome if they just jump into whatever server they want. The Conclusion Over the years the player count seems to be less and less with more games coming out that are similar to Rust but I do not believe on the market as of right now there is a game with a Dev Team with this much dedication and interaction and a community that is so creative with how they develop their worlds with in the game. Whether you love survival games or just want to see where it all started this game is well worth whatever price they are asking for at the time.,Rust

If you are playing with friends you need to keep suiciding until you respawn close to them. The process gets annoying and tedious if you want to introduce someone new to the game. No clear objective. You are just... looting to craft better stuff to loot more stuff faster to craft better stuff rinse and repeat add guns in the mix to kill faster/better. All of it to accomplish....nothing. You have to carefully look for servers that recently had a reset. If you join in a let's say week old server then you will have a really hard time as every spot in the island was already taken and everything its filled with automatic guns and sentry turrets and whatnot. Sociopath Simulator 2018 nobody will attempt to communicate with you. The community has an unspoken rule of ""Shoot first then check"".

2017-10-21,1,1,460,False,Not Recommended,Not recommended. Not anymore... not againI loved the old version which they scrapped. It was complex enough with fun building and raiding required a lot more skill and planing. I have so many fond memmories of the the old version Memmories of growing up from dirt fending off my shack building a tower in a highly contested area and dominating groups on my own. Then having secret dealings at night with a clan of Germans to aquire the elusive C4 blueprint which I needed for my revange plans. That night was unforgettable as I was terriefied of them scamming me as I had quite a lot of items as payment. It was a one on one transaction and when all was said and done the dealer called off the sniper group which was placed just in case I was a scammer. Later on my friendship with that group grew and they let me join their village and keep my autonomy.There were great characters there was soul. Nobody cared about fluff like character looks breast size race or such. There was one simple model for everyone and you had to make a name for yourself as a character that you could role play to your heart's content. It pains me to see where the game has gone and how it just keeps straying from it's origins and just adds on bloat instead of tightning up all the loose nuts and bolts. Waste of potential and a prime example of a project wondering around without purpose due to lack of a goal and constant bombardment of demands by the userbase that does not know better.,Rust
2016-05-19,0,0,1626,False,Not Recommended,An up to date review of Rust Are you 1) Unemployed?2) home schooled?3) Have you paid for hacks? (ESP especially)If so then this is the game for you!As a casual player you won't be able to compete with the above 3 categories as most servers when they reset it's during the day. So by the time you get home from work The try hard kids already have everything made and are busy scouring the spawn points looking for new spawned players to kill as no doubt their desire to grief new players comes from some deep psycological issues most likely attributed to being heavily bullied in real life.If you do manage to get a small base built by the time you manage to actually build your first few metal tools you would have found yourself repeatedly door camped for nearly your entire evening (with which is very limited because you actually have a job) as the try hard players have nothing but time of their hands to sit there for hours on end.But don't feel disheartened! You can still at least get to a tier 2 workbench by near the end of the week just before the server resets and it starts all over again...That is the current state of Rust and you can be sure that this will never change.Also if you're not using ESP don't even bother playing. more than half the players on any server you choose are using ESP. The people that use ESP claim they use it to counter the other ESP users. The ESP users are also the very same unemployed try hards...You know how it is Fail at life succeed at video games that reset weekly...,Rust

2017-04-04,1,1,98,True,Recommended,Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive.Rust is a multiplayer game receiving updates adding new content to it every friday. These constant updates are very large usually (100+ mgb) and it is not reccomended to buy this game if you do not have much data. Rust also has a terrible anti cheat installed to it. It is called easy anti cheat and you will often have to verify game cache or even reinstall the game to even connect to a server. Now off the internet part onto the community. I can NOT stress enough that if you cannot take the toxicity of this community do not buy this game. From my experiance of this game the community is very toxic towards new players and will KOS (Kill on sight) unless you are on a PVE server.

This game hooked me in and kept me hooked in for many weeks and to this day I am still very much addicted to it. Get a group of mates find a server with 10 20 people and enjoy. Whether you want to run around as naked men hitting other players with rocks build a fortress and hunt other people down or make a little cottage and set out on supply runs without disturbing other players this game is one of the best experiences money can buy.Presentation 9.5/10 everything is perfect as far as presentation goes from in game to the server selection menu. Flawless. The only issue I had was last patch changed a few things but they will soon be fixed I am assuming.Graphics 9.5/10 so many moments in this game where I just stopped and looked at my surroundings. I was standing behind a hill while the sun was coming up and I saw a shadow moving in front of me the entire mountain's shadow. I followed it all the way up until it disappeared. The graphcis in this game are just jawdropping. Sound 9/10 There is nothing nicer than making your first gun and firing it for the first time and hearing that gun shot. Zombies make terrifying noises and when you are just chopping wood in a forest and you hear a bear running at you. Some of the best adrenalin you can get from any game.Gameplay 9.5/10 The gunplay in this game is fantastic it accounts for lag so you wont have to lead your shots yet when you shoot a zombie in the head it will instantly drop without any lag whatsoever to avoid for frustrating after death hits from zombies.Lasting Appeal 10/10 I will be playing this until it is full released and beyond.Overall 10/10 If you like Minecraft or DayZ this game is 100% for you. Buy it and help out the developers. If you aren't convinced this game is being developed by Gary of Gary's Mod so you know it's in good hands.,Rust

I may not have many hours but DO NOT complain about getting killed as a 'naked' because when you start doing it you will realise how much fun it really is.

2018-02-13,0,0,611,False,Not Recommended,"Rust has become a toxic wasteland that will cause you to lose all faith in humanity. I began playing in 2015 and the game was great. Over the last few years the Rust community has gone from mature players enjoying the game to 9 14 year old children who run around and kill whatever moves. You will spend an hour naked gathering items for clothing and a base to be killed by a prepubescent child that has by luck of the the draw aquired a revolver from a barrel somewhere. You will respawn naked and again attempt to gather items but will meet the same fate. If you happen to get lucky (skill does not come into play when it's rock vs. AK) and live long enough to gather enough items to build a base or put clothes on your back you will spend literally all of you free time gathering additional items to ensure your base doesn't decay. If you are able to gather the resources to prevent base decay (for the time being) then you are stuck incessently searching for scrap and blueprints so that you can first craft level 1 2 and 3 work benches and a research table so that you can then began researching items that you find (by luck) or researching blueprints that you find (by luck) so that you can actually craft something useful. In the meantime you continue to be murdered by squeaky children for no reason other than your existence. There is no teamwork. There is no community. If you have the misfortune of joining a server later than five minutes after a full map/blueprint wipe you are woefully and hopelessly behind the curve and will find yourself fighting off AK 47 attacks with nothing more than a stone. The concept of this game is phenomenal but the actual gameplay is abysmal unless you're downright lucky. Skill will get you nowhere in Rust and essentially playing the lottery every spawn becomes old very quickly. The game begins to feel more like a full time job than a game. If you do not have several hours per day to devote to gathering resources to prevent base decay gathering blueprints/researching items etc. then you will never actually be able to ""play"" the game. You will be stuck in a constant state of building and maintaining rather than playing the game itself. This game is essentially a PVP solo deathmatch but you have to devote hours on end to the game (daily) before you can even participate in the match.",Rust

The boring starts when you have no idea what's going on no one wants to help you made the mistake of playing vanilla. So you move to modded you get faster progression and finally craft a gun. You miss every shot because of RNG and die losing all the progress you made. You rage and form a Zerg recruiting members you find on the server things are going good for the next few wipes. Until you trust the wrong person and they inside you stealing all your stuff leaving you with nothing. You leave your Zerg and play solo trusting no one ever again. I've never wasted so much time to learn how bad a game is and how bad the developers of rust really are. I truly believe this games current state is going backwards so fast It's almost as if the devs have given up.

2015-07-13,0,0,74,True,Not Recommended,I enjoyed the legacy very much but the new version is one of the worst games I have ever played. I have tried playing on a official server. In this game you play as a naked guy with a stick fighting other naked guys. Almost everyone you meet will instantly try to kill you and since the melee combat system is awful you have a really high chance of getting killed. Wood is quite easy to find but finding stone metal and animals is really hard and boring. Animals are the worst thing in this game for me. They are very few hard to find run like they have rockets stuck on them and can instantly climb rocks.Without getting meat cloth and animal fat you can't do almost anything in this game. Even if you manage to build a small wooden house somebody will probably destroy it by the next time you enter the game and steal all your items. Also the basic locks work with keys so if anybody kills you after you leave your house and gets your key can steal pretty much anything you have inside However the building system is awesome. You can create a lot of beautiful buildings. It's one of the best features this game has.I do not recommend this game in the current state because it's simply not enjoyable. It has a huge potential so I recommend waiting until it gets out of alpha stage.,Rust

Some people are friendly (usally zergs or groups larger than 4) but get ready for the toxic ones( moslty solo or dou) this is where you find the most toxic and saltiest players. I mean i dont mind i love the talk over mics whenever i score a kill.A bit of a learning curve but nothing crazy.

2017-01-06,0,0,94,True,Recommended,I think people who complains about the community are missing the whole point here. Rust is not only about building and surviving bad weathers. The ''toxic'' community as people say is 100% part of the game and I think it is pretty clear. The surviving part is not about hunger the weathers biomes or animals it is all about to survive in this community you have to build to protect yourself from them made a base that will discourage your neightboors to raid you and speak to people arround to see what kind of scum bags they are. Considering this it will probably be the hardest game you will ever play. It is not a game for puppies it is a USA apocalypse simulation my friends in real life people would be total exactly like in the game. You can team up and be head in group or play lonewolf like I do and I do managed to survive an entire wipe being quiet furtive like a ing shadow and of course I made some ennemies I've been raided but I also managed to raid back and took a whole base from a clan of douches all by myself. This game is all about survival like no other games on the market. I give this a 10/10.Little advice for the noob don't go in the overcrowded servers (100+) unless you want a freaking ''hunger game movie'' experience.,Rust

It's kind of Minecraft meets CS GO only to result in a frustrating experience.The good Graphics are amazingLots of stuff to research/discoverHuge maps with points of interestsEvery footsteps you hear will make your heart race.The bad Community is only griefers.It would literally take you ages to search for the interesting items.You start with a rock and a torch everyone will kill you on sight and it takes ages to build something loosely secure.You can't rearrange your house (unless with C4 which can't be easily obtained).I wouldn't recommend this game because of the community at large It's kinda sad to literally spend days building something only to have it take it from you by griefers. Not only they will loot your stuff they will also emprison you in your own home leaving you with the only choice to commit suicide and respawn elsewhere starting from scratch...Makes you really reflect on what kind of sick f**ks are playing this game.You have to then spend countless hours to gather enough resources to get raided again.It's worse on community servers every now and them they will wipe the whole thing including all research that you discovered. Rendering all your days of of farming/building pointless.Unless you like pain and frustration this game is a complete waste of your time there are so much more rewarding games out there.,Rust

2016-08-21,0,0,209,True,Recommended,Product received for free. In my time of Rust I have thoroughly enjoyed it. However the worst thing about this game is the fact that no matter how many times you try and interact with players in a good way you will always get an that's willing to destroy your fun. There is also a huge problem with roof camping and camping outside peoples bases until they come out. However this is overcome by the amount of times you can get a good group going or a little band of players ready to take on a clan with just spears and bows. It is overcome by the adrenaline you can get just by getting into a bowfight or a spearfight. Is it overcome by the amount of friends you can make just by trying to have some fun. The developers of the game also listen to the community and give what they want as soon as possible. And by far the best thing about the game is the shear amount of stories you can tell by just playing 15 hours on the game.,Rust

2017-07-21,0,0,238,True,Recommended,Good survival game challenging... survival. The gameplay is good and usually just mindless but entertaining tasks funner while working with a friend. I personally find the PvP server to be quite cancerous. Everyones out to take from someone else or ruin someone elses day (like any Gmod/Arma 3 RP server ever). I could be sitting in a 1 story wood shack with a key lock door only to open and get blasted down with an ak 47. I find playing alone or on a PvE server better than on a PvP server. The optimization for this game is horrible yes i have a crappy dual core cpu but i can play Just Cause 3 fine and cant play this on low settings without some type of lag. OVERALL good solid survival game but a community that came from Gmod DarkRP and optimization of a... i cant think of an example but you get the point. NEEDED Singleplayer Mode Optimization,Rust

2015-03-28,0,0,806,True,Recommended,Rust is a game I played...I left...and then I came back to.The original Rust I played (now known as Legacy) was a catchy intro to survival type games for me when it was first released. However it was driven downhill with the increasing numbers of hackers and exploiters and eventually made unplayable.With the release of the experimental now as the new stable and the improvements to the anti cheat we are coming back to Rust for the second time to find yet again a nice experience of a new game with new features thats very playable and fun.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival with a pvp aspect on it and providing Facepuch can keep on top of the hacker situation this time I think this game is well on its way to becoming an all time classic...even with the development hiccups and delays...well especially in this case with them as it shows us how focused the team are towards this project so many people stated was abandoned.Rust is great. 9/10,Rust

But the current version is an unoptimized bad looking mess (don't get carried away too much by the great looking screenshots in the store page it is not so great in action it's either blurry AF or jaggy AF with weirdly popping up textures). And don't get me started on the new XP system. I cannot recommend this game in its current state at all.,Rust

2016-05-10,0,0,969,True,Recommended,Product received for free. TL DR Great game with many flaws. It's Alpha after all!I received this as a gift from a friend over a year ago now. I never got around to installing it and trying it out sadly but recently I decided to do so at the recommendation of another friend. Luckily it came at a time when my interest in the Survival Sandbox Crafting 'genre' had been piqued. I decided to give RUST a good try after having tried ARK for the first time a few days prior.... I became addicted...123.4 of my 123.5 total hours played have been in the last two weeks alone. I can't get enough of this game and it's quite clear that I have a problem... and my friends have had no aversion to telling me so. &lt RUST is unique to me as it's the first game to truly take my virginity to the genre. Although I had played ARK once before it was for no longer than an hour and it had failed to fully engross me (not bashing it I admit I haven't played it very much at all). As high of praise as it may seem I'm giving RUST there are definitely issues... So enough meandering personal bs let's get into it.The Good Fantastic Graphics for Alpha (Sun shafts water and environments look particularly gorgeous). Great Sound Design. Footfalls wildlife explosions and gunshots all come from the direction of origin and decrease in volume with distance making it easy to orientate yourself and roughly estimate enemy locations. Good Models/Textures. Character models are surprisingly well designed and relatively realistic proportionally. Textures of course vary depending on your settings but for the most part they're on par with even some of the newest games. Procedurally Generated Maps. This is a double edged sword but I'll get into the negatives down below. These are fantastic in theory and make for a unique experience between servers and wipes making it so that no one person can gain a mastery of a certain map which lends itself to an equal playing field... literally... and encourages exploration. Fun and Engrossing Base Building. Nothing is more satisfying than building a good base and RUST's system is rather entertaining and indepth... The problem is grinding for enough resources to build it all. Immersive. I wouldn't have been able to stomach 124 hours if the game wasn't immersive. There's nothing quite like being out in the world with an inventory full of stuff on edge that a player or bear could come by at any second and your up. The adrenaline is real. Weapons/Gear. Weapons are punchy and feedback is solid. Gear is relatively bland at the moment but it serves its purpose. Ingame models look great for an indie title and mechanics are passable. Nothing too special here but nothing bad either. Development Progress. The team has made some amazing strides when it comes to fidelity and gameplay. They've updated graphics character models game models/mechanics and even the game engine such to the extent that Legacy RUST looks like an entirely different game from New RUST. Just go look at some videos you'll see what I mean. Hopefully this is one that will continue through Alpha and into Beta and ultimately release. I feel that many of my grievances below will be addressed in the future. Ingame Progression. The progression is actually quite good and it can be done at your own pace. You're forced to go into Radtowns or Landmark areas (pre built structures. Air Fields Military Bases Power Plants etc...) in order to collect Blueprint Fragments which are used to discover new items to craft. It's an RNG system so good luck... The problem with these areas is that they're usually highly contested and very hostile whether by other players in the area farming Blueprints snipers or radiation. The process is obviously much faster if you team up with friends to share resources and to have someone watch your back in sticky situations.The Bad ING BEARS! Seriously. Bears are way too fast have way too much health and deal way too much damage. The primary cause of death for me has been bears secondary being players tertiary being falls and lastly wolves. Optimization. The game is very poorly optimized and eats up WAY too much RAM. My average is around 6gb on medium settings and tabbing out is basically a no go for me. Load times are excruciating and I've been told it's because of the procedurally generated maps. Why the game can't just cache this information on your HDD? No idea... Alpha is alpha though I guess. CRASHES. To expand on optimization the game is almost unplayable as of the latest patch for me and a lot of other players it seems. Though sadly this isn't anything new as the issues I've been having have been occuring on and off throughout the development cycle. Two weeks ago I was running the game for hours on end without a single problem. Ever since the latest patch however I've been crashing every 15 20 minutes or so which is incredibly discouraging. Animations. Character/NPC animations aren't necessarily all that bad in fact some are good but they definitely seem a bit jenky and/or floaty depending. First person animations are actually quite good save for what looks like some weight painting issues wrists contorting in odd ways and certain mesh vertexes not adapting to the animation rig well. Character Design/Gender Randomization and Lock. The developer's philanthropic view of giving each Steam ID a unique permanent randomized character appearance is quite frankly t as many have aptly pointed out. I'm personally of the belief that this is some copout/consolation. A way to give players variety but also dodge the bullet of implementing a character creator. Give us the ability to create our own characters and stop being an SJWtard. Whether or not this is due to laziness or a lack of skill/ability I can't tell but the fact remains that it's t and you know it Garry! Hire some more devs or get your into gear! ALSO GIVE US HAIRSTYLES FFS! I'm tired of being bald... A.I... A.I. Is literally braindead it's absolutely awful just terrible. Bears Chickens Deer and Wolves (all the wildlife really) often just walk in circles forever. The pathing and waypoints are terrible and the only time they appear to have any brains is if you get close. Predator animals will attack you on sight and prey animals will run from you. Collision/Object Detection. This goes in tandem with the A.I. NPC's literally have no detection of hills rocks cliffs buildings etc. A creature will run straight up a cliffside denying all laws of physics or whatever it encounters. Luckily this is not the case for player structures. You can stand on top of your house and snipe creatures without them being able to reach you. However this is not the case for player structures that do not require placing a foundation wildlife completely ignore those as if they have noclip enabled. Items such as large wood/stone walls barricades traps etc... will be completely ignored by NPC's. They will receive no damage for walking over/near/through these objects it's as if they're not even there. It's clear that these are only intended for enemy players at least for now.Here are just a few things that are not necessarily good or bad but are worth taking into consideration if you're thinking about buying Players can be s. Most will probably kill you on sight if they are in a position to. These are usually very progressed players with full armor guns and a lot of ammo. This is common for the genre so be prepared. The game is tedious. Gathering and farming is real and can be a turn off for many players. You WILL die and you WILL lose many valuables! I can feel your anger... Wipes can make the game feel pointless sometimes as once or twice a month all of your progress will be wiped.,Rust

2014-12-09,0,0,1411,True,Recommended,1 000+ hours in Rust. 500 of those where in legacy (the old version). Legacy has a lot of hackers. It's still a lot of fun.Short version It's worth more than $20 easy.Long version The new version of Rust is better than the old version now. There are very few hackers right now in the new version which is such a breath of fresh air for Rust players. The addition of in game voice chat has made the community much more friendly. Don't get me wrong it's still Rust and people are still s. That being said in the new version of Rust you'll see more groups than solo players and those groups have often met while playing Rust. This is a big aspect of the game that legacy didn't really have.Building in Rust is amazing. You start with twigs but upgrade quickly to stone and then armored. You have complete control over your base / buildings. What I mean by this is that you don't just place a house and then place a storage building. You build everything from foundations and walls so it's totally up to your creative freedom. Everything is raidable but some bases take more C4 rockets and pickaxes than others.You will die. A lot. Get used to it and don't get upset. Remember that it's a game. When Rust starts to stress you out take a week or two off. Seriously.I started playing Rust before the new version was even being created. It has been one of the most entertaining game journeys ever because the game is constantly changing.When I started playing the new version there was only 1 gun it had unlimited ammo there was no sound when you shot it you could only build white blocks that didn't really form into anything. Now we've got rockets C4 assault rifles shotguns smgs plenty of tools and armor and clothes.Oh I almost forgot about the part of the new Rust PROCEDURALLY GENERATED MAPS.Yes that's right. Every map in Rust is huge and different. No two maps are the same and this takes the replay value of Rust through the roof. One of the most exciting things is when a map wipes a new map is set and everybody ventures out with nothing but a rock and has no idea of where things are in the world. This is an amazing accomplishment in gaming history and you've got to check it out.Updates come out every Thursday and it is completely obvious that Garry and the rest of the team is dedicated to this game and it will be finished.If you like FPS sandbox building or even just action adventure and strategy games Rust is a must. Seriously. $20 is a damn steal for this game.,Rust
2016-12-27,0,0,328,True,Not Recommended,This game gives me mixed feelings because its fun but only when you're winning. The main goal of this game is to with people. This can be done by destroying their base building a wall around them jokes mic spaming memes outside someones base etc. You can lose everything you've worked for in minutes or working alone take a group of 5 peoples stuff in minutes as well. Obviously there are balance issues though the group of 5 almost always wins because they can gather the resources to make explosives and guns to raid you much faster and you would have to kill 5 of them while they just have to kill you. I have played solo and it's ok and can actually be easier than playing in a group if your group is bad. The balance issue is more apparent when so many people play in clans. The best tips are pick an accessible weapon and get good with it and if you can find a decent player to team up with. Overall the game is ok I wouldn't reccomend it expressly but it is worth a try and I do enjoy playing ir from time to time.IMPORANT hackers are a majior problem in the game and I'm quitting again because of it people will shoot you across a field in the head full auto without missing and snipe you with smgs from the roof of their base (and yes they will do it with mp5.entity) even head on I get killed before I can even see a person as I come around a corner and it's always a little kid who acts like he's tough afterward too. You will see several people get auto banned a week if you play a lot and you know the auto ban isn't catching everyone.,Rust

2017-03-19,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,This game is litlerally presentation of how NOT to make games. Even if it's popular it have big problems firstly since 2013 this game is in ALPHA!! Secondly game is very poorly optimized I mean even Hi End PC's can struggle while playing this game because game needs MORE THAN 8GB RAM! That means a tons of t is loaded into our RAM Memory which we would not even use in this game. While Loading game a tons of junk goes into our RAM Memory. And If you know something about creating any type of software then you know that you NEED to optimize it by clearing memory from unused stuff.Recently I saw video which one of known man in Youtube said that he want to help making this game an e sport game... Are you kidding me? This game isn't event partially prepared to be e sport game. Some people said that Battle Royale gamemode is good for e sport because there was one tournament using this mode. FFS people Arma 3 have this gamemode Arma 2 aswell one of H1Z1 version of game is focused on that we have new Battle Royale game which name I cannot remeber. Those games aren't considered as e sport. So how in hell Rust can be e sport then when it lacks of basic thing?tl dr Game is still in alpha since 2013 poorly optimized and yet they release stuff for which you have to pay.,Rust

The core game is extremely simple and balanced even in it's alpha form.Yes it's harsh and you will get murdered a few times on most servers. My List of Key things to do to enjoy this game 1. Find the nearest pig and crush its skull with your rock. #1 need is food first off2. Stay off the road. You are asking to be murdered3. Don't go full retard on the first person you encounter. Generally they can be helpful (although good chance they will kill you for pretty much nothing)4. Make a friend. More than any other game RUST is all about power in numbers.,Rust

Legacy rust was really fun then they came out with rust experimental because legacy rust was apparently a jumbled mess of code. The first versions of rust experimental SUCKED REALLY BAD. There were no airdrops for a long time there were no explosives. The building system was BROKEN. You could break into someones stone house with 2 people using pickaxes. Blueprints weren't in the game anymore the GUI was ok. But then it got better. They fixed all those problems the graphics and lighting system is the best it's ever been now. There's tons of explosives and different types of ammo and the building system has been remade quite a bit and I think it's at a really good point now. The only thing I think was a questionable choice to impliment was ladders... I remember when that came out. Boy did it suck. If you want to play a game with intense battles high risk and lots of resource farming Rust is your game. It's in a really good state right now. So buy it if you're up for the challenge.,Rust

Some is going to kill you. No I dont mean right as you are logging off I mean after you've logged off quit the game and went to bed or picked up another game. That is the dumbest I have ever heard of. It doesn't make the game realistic it just makes it ing dumb. And if you think dying while you are not even logged into the game is a fun I dea then you are ing dumb. If this kind of isn't fixed in the full release then I will have to find some way to get my $20 back. Even if it means finding the stuidio that makes this peice of and demanding it back from the games director personally. Untill then ing this game.,Rust

You load into the game which tankes forever then pick your server you are then randomly assigned an identity which is locked to your steam account that you get no control over this includes both gender and appearance because they qoute""feel like to much time and money is wasted on it"". Now then that being said you spawn in and are almost always meet by other people and killed for no reason other then they can. So you have now died many times over but have finally found your window to start building up so you get started building up a few supplies when all of a sudden your shot and lose it all for no reason and this is asuming you can find an area not already occupied which is near impossible. After going through this struggle you have finally found an area to claim as your own nad start building it up cool right well no because your now going to be killed and all your destroyed when you log off.

2016-08-11,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,From the a gameplay point of view its all wrong. The balancing will create some very frusterating moments.I think the addition of guns ruins it for everyone expect the people with the guns. Allow me to explain You can be just chopping away at the tree when out of nowhere you will be snipped from a cross the map. There is literally no way you could have seen it comming or at the very least fought back.Personally I think weapons should be kept at a medieval style. With spears bows and even muskets. However full blown Bolt Rifes are a step to far.The reason I think this is simple it gives you a chance to fight or flee. Right now if someone has a gun you can't do etheir. There is no chance of escape and no chance to fight back. However if it was ballanced correctly you should at the very least have a chance to escape and maybe even fight back.Anyway so while the gameplay I feel is very unbalanced how does the rest of the game compare? Tech wise it looks pretty good. The view distance is alright and it gives me a Farcry 3 feel. However it does not run smooth at all. I have a GTX970 and on Medium settings I get 40 FPS. It has a slight stuttering issue aswell.Anyway some people might have a lot of fun with this but unless you are sure you'll have fun I cannot recommend it.,Rust

2017-07-07,0,0,1908,True,Not Recommended,Have over a thousand hours spread across accounts. Safe to say this game is addictive fun intense and satisfying all at once.Only pitfall is hackers but thats being fixed now.ABOVE IS MY PREVIOUS REVIEWEdit Im going to have to not recommend this game as of now. The games direction has swayed from the fun arcadey pvp shooter to the clan focused naked killing style of the current. The component system did have its flaws as did the XP system as did the old BP system however all had their own pros. This new BP system essentially promotes clans as whoever can get the drops really gets the first major server changers so essentially whichever group has more numbers wins. This can be said for the other systems as well however the other systems allowed solo's duo's and even trio's to actually experience late game. OLD bp's was similar to now but not as bad as there was no grind for scrap. XP made everyone grind for levels regardless and components allowed people to just farm for gear so everyoneg got a go. Now I might just sound like a salty person who's died to groups or whatever but believe me im not. Ive had my time roaming around when I was at the top of my game dumpstering everyone I saw and rolling around in groups or raiding the little guys I was at that point and at that point the game is ing fun. But thats the issue the people I was killing and the people that we or I was raiding didn't get to enjoy the game like I did because they were always outnumbered or couldn't spend as much time on it as I could or whatever the reason. The reason is simple as to why this game is going the wrong direction for me personally and for alot of other people the game is tailored to groups and the game isn't for casual gamers. That is the reason I cannot reccommend this product if you can look through those pitfalls and go through the steep learning curve the game is for you.,Rust

2016-04-12,0,0,524,True,Recommended,"So let's get started.Although this game is currently in ""Alpha"" it is extremely addictive and of course exceptional when it comes to Survival. It meets aspects such as fighting for your life building a home to protect yourself from fellow players or aggressive animals and not only that provides players with a whole new aspect of the word ""Survival"". Many other survival games have zombie aspects to them but usually you don't need this to meet the genre requirements and the Rust Developers have proven this point worthy.I would like to add that I have spent countless hours running my own server as well as a consitant player within official servers to wide spread my game experience however with the amount of time I have spent it has come at a great cost.For example the games graphics do not meet a standard such as your Call of Duty or your Guild Wars 2 but it meets a standard that I like official in your face and straight to the point. The combat system has its flaws but eventually I see it becoming very modernized and easy to operate. I can say countless bad points but I'm only focusing on one bad point here The Game Developers need to be more active with their player base!We see a lot of updates posts and community updates but personally I would like to see them run the game from a gaming aspect instead of being a typist bunch of developers this would intrigue my interest a lot more as not only are they developers but they endure the same excitement and interest we do in their own game.A part from that this game is 9/10 for Excitement 9/10 for Update features and support 7/10 for Developer involvement.I really do look forward to spending countless more hours in this fantastic world you've created guys!",Rust

It's more akin to an ""old pvp server"" game from 15 years ago when they sort of went like this. Those who were around when it stated who like nothing but to grief hack and kill noobs stayed around and well do just that. The devs being of the same mindset then catered the game to that sole goal. That seems to be what has been done here from all the talk. Many many other descent games for normal players of the survivale genre (Or any other really) that you could find and enjoy. This one is NOT it. Don't waste your time because that is ALL you'll be doing.

2016-07-07,1,2,24,True,Not Recommended,you rust. No really im using this unironically. you rust. I used to run the game with beautiful graphics and have a steady 50 frames per second.

2016-04-09,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,Definitely balanced for PvP so if you don't like playing with/being murdered over and over by power tripping thirteen year olds you're in for a bad time. A lackluster building system complete with a very very draconian decay system (which means your buildings after x hours without you being around them will begin to take damage which you must use resources to repair). They also removed the zombies which were actually pretty fun and replaced them with like one bear (I've never seen any more than that). They also completely 100% randomized your gender race and physical features which some people think is fine but I personally loathe. It's always a good thing for your players to feel ownership of their characters (especially in a dangerous sandbox like this one) and for them to randomize that aspect after all this time is bizarre and upsetting.In fairness there's nothing vastly or deeply wrong with it (aside from that completely arbitrary character issue that Garry has made very clear he's not budging on) but it's just unsatisfying on almost every level. The guns lack a feeling of heft or value after you bust your to craft or find one. The combat feels like it hinges mainly on MLG bunnyhopping and does not reward the clever player. The building is fun... until your real life takes you away from the game for a few days and you log in to find your walls collapsed and your building looted. Cannot recommend in its current state.7 Days to Die is better.,Rust
2017-01-28,2,2,75,True,Recommended,Some people raided my base I was alone.My turret managed to kill 2 people and I killed another one with my Python the enemy kept teleporting on each other so it seemed like an endless battle.The turret managed to keep them at bay for sometime so I took my time and build a campfire by the raiders dead body. Then I started hacking the corpse and putting human flesh to cook I started eating and told the raiders next door that I was eating their friend via voice chat.A few minutes later they stormed in confused and shot me from all sides I counted 11 of them against me.Me and a turret managed to hold a whole group back for 30 minutes and eating their corpses.Cannibalism works and those raiders will have psychological trauma for the rest of their lives.,Rust

I know its very new game but i can't load into any server (Steam auth verfication) I have read that this is steam's issue and i do not believe that because i can load every other steam game i own without issue. Rust devs are blaming and pointing fingers and also notice that the devs are breaking more than they can fix I.E. Hotfixes after major updates. I suggest this be taken off steam and retired.,Rust
2018-01-28,0,0,161,True,Not Recommended,This game used to be great before it turned into the steaming pile of crap that it is today. Literally impossible to start on any server because all the materials have been mined trees cut down food harvested and wildlife hunted. People log in daily to do all this at the respawn times. So if your new or considering purchasing this game now then be prepared to die constantly from starvation or players who have much more than you ever will. This is just a death simulator. Not to mention playing this on anything above the absolute lowest settings will result in massive lag no matter how great your rig is.Log in.Explore until you start getting hungry.Search for food.Find berries that only add 2 hunger for each berry.Run out of berries.Starve to death trying to find more berries.Expect hours of this.,Rust

2018-01-28,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,So.I don't like this game.That's the main thing I have to say about it It kinda sucks in a lot of ways.It could definitely be improved there are plenty of things about it that are easy to fix but there are also some that are less so.Now I should also mention that this style of game isn't my favourite by a long shot I've tried a few and I suck at them but hey why not try another it totally wasn't just for achievements plus I've had the game for years. In the end I always died before I could get very far only once getting a shirt only to starve to death a minute later and once getting a full set of clothing and weaponry only because I stole most of it from some poorly hidden crates in the bushes.Now what I really hate about this particular game so much can be summed up by three things The communityLoad times and graphicsCharacter appearance.So. Start with the easy one. The community is toxic as h*ck. perhaps they're okay when you get to know them and I've noticed a few people being nice but for the most part everyone is an to you especially if you're a newbie. Or a 'naked' because apparently the rust elite are so exclusive they use their own lingo. This isn't really something that I expect to change people can suck sometimes and this game is designed in a way that makes that more obvious.As for the graphics and load times well... I have to say the game is darn beautiful at the highest graphics settings. However this is offput by the fact that the load times are unbearable. And by that I mean despite a fairly high end (though perhaps a tad old) pc it took more than a half hour to load into a game and Rust remained on the verge of crashing every time I moved my mouse freezing and then taking a second before I could even see where I was. And let me tell you that is not the way you want to be playing this game. However on lower graphics settings the loading is far more manageable but... well the visuals suck. It's a trade that must be made in all games I suppose but Rust makes it very pronounced. This could probably be improved over time but I doubt it's considered a priority by the devs.Finally we have the characters. This one is very simple. You have absolutely no control over your character in the slightest. You spawn in naked and the game has already decided your skin colour gender and proportions and refuses to let you change them. Now I understand some games like forcing you to look a certain way but that makes sense because you're playing a predetermined character. In Rust you play a nameless silent protagonist and yet still have no control over their appearance. I myself spawned as a woman and while that isn't that bad it's a lot less fun to teabag corpses that way. immersive or enjoyable to be forced into playing a character when there literally is no character to be forced into. I'm not asking for much here just a few tiny options like gender and skin colour in the advanced options or something.On the other hand I'm sure that playing the game further than I bothered with makes it far more enjoyable possibly meeting nicer people and being capable of killing things. And it has definitely improved a lot since I last played it which must have been years ago by this point. I think I actually originally stopped playing because of the old radiation system.So to cap it off I don't recommend this game. I personally disliked it and most people aren't going to be bothered to play it enough to enjoy it. However if you think you might be please go on and read some positive reviewws. Maybe this is your style of game and you'll enjoy the later game aspects that other players talk about.,Rust

First Week Experience My first week in Rust I meet a guy in a big metal base on the side of a beach.He showed me how to build a small cube base.Some guy camped my base for four hours that night.He killed me then gave me a revolver to defend myself with.About nine hours later someone was pick axing my wall down.The wall went down.I panicked.I shot all over.I killed him.It was the guy who gave me the gun.Friend for life right there.Then I ventured out into the world.Met some group made up of a bunch of Canadians.They welcomed me into their group.(I play with that group to this day.)That guy who showed me how to build a small shack built another base called Fort Wheatley.People running around the server would ask me about Fort Wheatley. I had no idea what they were talking about.Venturing across the waters that separated the mainland from the desert I saw it.A giant base with my name on it.Its like a castle.Walked up to the base.People with guns came out.Asked who I was.""I am Wheatley.""very loudly.""KING WHEATLEY!"" they shout.They welcome me in.There is a memorial to me.They give me access to the base blue prints resources and all.Every time I walk by these guys kneel put their heads down and say ""Hail King Wheatley.""I have no idea what all this ""Toxic Community"" stuff with the rest of these reviews are.

2015-07-18,2,10,185,True,Not Recommended,I love this game so much it is an amazing survival game and I would say one of the best ones out there as well. this game is one of my most played games on steam and usually is the only game I play now other than C&amp C when I rage quit on Rust which is why I'm going to not recommend this game. The first reason is the hacks there are so many people cheating that its not even funny. I had a naked break into my armoured base without using explosives or anything he/she just took the back wall right out and when I attempted to kill him/her they wouldn't die and therefore I was beaten to death with a hatchet. I have come across that with of the servers that I have played on. If it isn't the players that are cheating its the admins. My most recent server had very bad admin abuse. The admin would tp players into other players bases and just let them kill everyone and they did this for quite a while and probably still doing it on that server. If you are weary about buying this game don't let me make you run away this game is amazing in its own ways. You can/will find some servers that are just amazing and you will not have admin abuse or cheaters. As of right now I wouldn't recommend it to new players who have never played these types of games because you will rage quit as soon as you get killed and lose all your things.,Rust

2016-10-10,0,0,2554,True,Recommended,Rust. Well. There is alot to say about Rust. 1) The game looks good and is aesthetically pleasing if you have a good PC and can run it on good graphics. It has a nice feeling to it and the ambient environment is awesome!2) The community in Rust is generally a bit ''toxic'' but you can find a friendly chap most of the time who is willing not to blow your head off. To avoid the ''cancerous'' community of rust when you start playing the game i recommend sourcing a friend with a decent amount of hours (200+) to help you get started off and familiar with the game due to many people complaining about getting killed straight off the beaches as a 'naked'. 3) The wide range of servers on Rust is pretty amazing you have the vanilla servers which are great fun if you are playing with a few mates. You have the type of 'minigame' servers that are fun to waste a bit of time on. And the modded servers that are relatively fun if you don't have the time to start of on vanilla. All in all i do recommend this game providing you are prepared to get off a little bit as you get started off due to the skilled player base of many players on many servers in the Rust Community. Hense i ask you to play with a few experienced friends yourself. Hope this helped! Have fun surviving ),Rust

2016-06-25,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,I purchased Rust way back when it first came out with the intention of playing with some friends. Originally it was a very simple survival game but has since come a long way. While still in Alpha it seems like it could get better. Pros Start off as a Naked guy with a rock and a torch. Gathering materials isn't too daunting and the threat of dying early game is real. While it still needs work there are alot of small things that make the game interesting. ( Cannot drink still water but can drink running water) Building and constructing has few limitations and can be fun. Has a simple and user friendly interface that can be learned in minutesCons Do you like playing with delinquent 12 year olds who constantly cuss and blow up chat.. On EVERY SERVER? Making some progress in the game? Have a nice established base? Naked guy with rock comes and kills you Start all over.

However i must state that the feeling you get when you actually happen to achieve something in the game happen it to be finding 10 bears and get a lot of fat from them or by building the coolest fortress is beyond any feeling you get in any other game i must say.Overall I really love this game and hope more people get to enjoy RUST at full potential. My suggestion for any new player is to find a group of at least 2 people that are more experienced than you and ask questions! Remember that having fun in RUST is not exclusive to only group play but when you get the idea of most things such as gun recoil and game mechanics even a solo player can have fun.Good luck in your adventures reader!

BUT... if you do have the big balls and do spend 50 100 hours grinding to get better you will see that this game is actually SOO fun. When you get better you will see that fresh wipes acually start to be fun and not totaly cancer you get way more pvp u can bully ppl who just got the game so its a circle of cancer u can hear the screams of salt when u kill someone who is than u and mabye if you really are bored and want to find the thicc salt then kill nakeds to hear them cri getting a gun wont be so hard end game you can start to raid ppl or if your not rly into pvp or u just want to troll ppl roleplaying can be fun and you find many strange ppl and mabye friends that you would never have irl cuz ur fat and ugly. to conclude when you really commit to this game then you can have a fun time and ppl in pvp which is the most satisfying feeling ever. I know this sounds super cancer which it is but thats what i love about this game i can play rust after being abused and by my parents and just take it out on some poor child in rust so i can feel like im powerful in a videogame. jk. But it if fun being cancer once and a while just to make ppl cri im not going to lie and you will get awarded immensely if you put hours in this game.

( loved the oil quarry tough if there is one thing that drawed my attention to this game it was the oil quarry) I was so happy when i bought it than few months later i looked at a game which just wasn't a game anymore but more of a job. I even was eager to study for school again than getting mentally torured of all the changes and the constant killing when i spammed. That is why i am writing this review as a real thank you to the developers by ing it up so much i didn't up my life honestly after 2014 or so that is the only con i can think. what i love about this game though is that i bought it for 10 dollars and earned over more than 25 dollars for game stuff which people bought for over 6 dollar a piece lol. Which proves my point that it was more of a job than a real game. not worth 30 dollars hate the developers tone to people when the want to suggest something!

2018-06-23,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,On the surface Rust seems like a very fun game. It seems like the minecraft we always wanted with the gameplay style of Fallout and the crafting and exploration of Minecraft. Unfortunately Rust is not that game. Rust has a learning curve that is so effectively brutal that one must wonder if the developers are sane. If you are not playing with people who somehow are already established in the game the probability you will be killed in the first 10 minutes of playing is likely if not certain. This game deals out death like no other that I have played making Dark Souls look tame by comparison. If you have a dozen friends all on the same server all working together then you will have fun slaughtering everything in sight. If you do not you just wasted your money. There is one thing about this game that strikes me as insane beyond all other parts. The Rust community has a ratio of 1 decent friendly person 100 psychotic sadists who should never have anything more dangerous than a butter knife. These people are as primitive in the mind as the player is when they start out in the game. To the point where these people would be arrested in Europe for hate speech and harrasssment. Maybe the developers will try to tackle this issue. The odds are that they will not. Never have I played a game with such rancid lowly creatures masquerading as human beings. Yes this game is supposed to be brutal these jackals take it to the nth degree in terms of how sadistic they can be. What is even worse is that many of the players are in the 12 13 year old range God only knows what this will do to their minds. At any rate this game should be avoided until the devlopers can fix the learning curve. Otherwise it will continue to be a bloody gory mess.,Rust

2017-05-12,0,0,268,False,Recommended,"RUST The Game That Escaped Early Access So what are my impressions on Rust after 200 Hours? The community will disagree but I believe 200h is more than enough time to get a feel for Rust. Rust is a survival PVP often compared to ARK or recently Escape From Tarkov but if you've ever played it you will develop a love hate relationship like I have. Not everything is peachy in the beginning not everyone will trust you and you shouldn't trust everyone. The main point of the game is to survive of course. But more so than anything get AKs as fast as you can and kill nake just kidding. Rust puts a spin on wilderness survival by introducing PVP and Minecraft esque elements. Doing anything even with groups of people can be difficult. Be warned this is not Hello Kitty Roller Rescue. This is the Dark Souls of survival games. This is not a pretty game My first time playing Rust was alone. I won't sugar coat my terrible start. I didn't even know how to get stone! (In it's current state as of Feb. 8 2018 I can proudly say there should be no confusion for the literate to learn how to aquire stone now. As should be.) Coming from being a solo I can say it is tough. People will want to take advantage of you they will mercilessly kill you. They will try to ruin your day. But that's a hurtle you need to get over in Rust. The best times in Rust I've had so far are from being naked and going from 0 to hero. Rocks to Guns. The magic in this game comes from the players. The Most Fun I've had in a Survival Game The magic comes from joining a server with nothing to lose and everything to gain. You take out your rock bash fellow naked's heads in for their bow + arrows and begin hunting big game. Or you ask if anyone needs a slave and get sleeping ""bagged"" into their home. Allies aren't made everyday and you are most likely going to be targeted on approach to fellow Newmans but once it works the magic happens. Before I made any pals on this game I had made basic bases much like dirt houses in Minecraft and I learned the most about Rust from my allies. They taught me how to play better than they could. Soon we had been through entire server wipes together and were a dangerous crew. It feels so good to be one of the most feared or notorious in a server. You don't get that by simply being toxic to your fellow Newman however. You must work for it. A good way to work for it is making shops trap bases defending raids or raiding against geared players and recycling loose items at monuments. A Grind The grinding aspect of this game is something I can get behind. Building 3.0 brought us upkeep which essentially increased the amount of resources you need to thrive. It cut down on Zergs ALOT since they can no longer construct server wide bases without some serious manhours. Trust me it isn't hard to put in time and get alot out. You will LOVE the game when you win and HATE losing. The more work you put in the more comes out. To get to ""end game"" loot is not easy. If you dont want to put 10 hours or more into a game in one week this isn't for you. Rust is for the dedicated. More so than any other game I know of right now. Usually hours of work can be gone in minutes this is normal. Just know when you're on top you have it all to lose. Can I run it? TIPS AND TRICKS I have 8gb of ram a Ryzen 1600 and GTX 760 and run it fine. To everyone saying they have problems I still can't stress this enough. Look at the minimum specs!!! If you own anything less you won't have the whole experience. It doesn't take a NASA computer to run but anything made in the last 5 years with 5 year old or newer parts should do. SSDs and RAM size helps loading time a SH ton. My old PC with an FX 4100 AMD CPU could barely run this at acceptable frame rates even on low. Maybe a *small* upgrade could be the key. Old i5s run this quite well. Even better than any AMD FX CPU. NEVER DISABLE ASSET WARMUP!!! It makes loading faster but creates stuttering. This is a super CPU intensive game too. I know they're pretty but disabling shadows/shadow effects can help massively no matter what part bottlenecks. And almost all the loading into servers except asset warmup is network intensive. I have under ideal conditions 3 5 minute load times into any given server. Final Verdict I firmly believe anyone can have fun in this game. Fun doesn't always mean success but success is nice. You will love and hate Rust. But for all it's worth if a server doesn't work out for you there's always another one. Rust is a great game. The interactions you have with players make the experience. If that experience is not ideal move away. You will make alot of friends and alot of enemies. Cherrish all of them. Although a bit of salt is optional. Is it for you? Well there's always steam refunds. Also a PSA be n i c e to your fellow Newmans.Thanks for reading.",Rust

Sometimes I die and my head comes out of my butt as well.Second Edit I made some friends. They often kill me and others for fun. We spent about 15 minutes chasing each other around killing each other with rocks and torches. I would thoroughly enjoy doing this again and again.Also the bears are on crack. Legit on crack. I watched a bear run through a rock appear on top of a mountain and jump down. Two hours later I went by and the bear was doing the same thing. Four hours later I decided to check back in.

I'm guessing bullied kids in school or alcoholic/drug addict parents. And RUST is their outlet. Oh well better online than from a hotel in Vegas with an actual gun. Way too toxic for my liking.

2017-04-29,0,0,498,True,Not Recommended,Just cannot recomend the game in its current state. The devs are absolutly worthless implimenting changes and undoing them the next week when reddit cries about them. They are adding skins and ing around with worthless trash such as chairs and tables. The devs have explicitly stated that this is a PvP game more so than survival. Well guess what the combat is absolute dog Primitive/low tier wepons are usless 9/10 times. Constant nerfing of weapons after devs rage when they die RNG aimcones and recoil systems. All this leads to it being impossible for a skilled player with lower tier weapons to take out somone with gear. Even after repeated head shots. It takes 3 ing seconds to pull out certain weapons making them even more usless.Also performance. I used to play this game on beutifull earily getting smooth experience and good fps. These days is just impossible to take combat serious when there are random freezes and micro sutters and people rubber banding all over the map..,Rust

2018-02-01,0,0,219,False,Not Recommended,Game is fun until you get to end game then nothing is very mysterious anymore and you realize you've done everything and I find I have a lot less motivation to play.The game is about to leave early access and is missing quality of life elements that make the game frustrating i.e No overflow crafting inventory and no sound notifications that you have begun crafting and no sounds indicating crafting is finished. These things may be intentional and that makes it even worse.Base defenses are to strong and the second tier of defenses requires higher tier weapons and explosives to infiltrate which makes it pretty much pointless to raid since you wouldnt get anything worthwhile. This mechanic makes many servers reset the map and character inventory every week to keep things fresh which I think is a bandaid to try and make something broken fun.I've played most of the survival games on and off steam and this is about 3rd on my list many of the survival games are stuck in a constant developement state so deep that quality of life fixes and completion of in game systems never get worked on giving the feel of a half finished game. Rust unfortunately doesn't escape this.If you want to play a survival game where you like to build this isnt for you as bases will be wiped every week. If you like to raid for resources and loot this game isnt for you because you wont get anything that outweighs the investment of cracking into a base. If you like building sandcastles on the beach for six days only to destroy it on the seventh day for no other reason than to build it again in another spot you could have fun with this game.Update I'll admit im a filthy casual when it comes to playing Rust. There are folks with thousands of hours in Rust and love it. Rust is a lifestyle to some and those people are amazing at the game and exhibit a great deal of skill and I respect their ability. But it you aren't one of those players you'll find the game fairly difficult.,Rust

The game in the past had a version called Legacy it was nice and ok and very good optimised but without any 1080p graphics but still ok. Now that thing is a thing of the past as they released a poorly optimised 10 frame rate running garbage that is so filled with bugs and unplayable because of the hackers that this worths only a refund. So if you have only 30 mins over 2 hours or bought this game 1 year ago like me when it was very funny then you will be stuck with forever so you might as well uninstall it and forget it.,Rust

Although Rust is still in alpha very few games manage to pull off such an amazing survival game. This game is still in alpha which means there is more to come and if it is awesome now then it will be even better in the future.,Rust
2014-01-25,0,0,222,True,Recommended,The game is very good it has a lot of potential and could one of the best survival games available!It's still in APLHA stage but besides the bugs and other things (like draw distance) it is worth every penny!The game is challenging and is best played with friends.It's an absolute MUST BUY for people who like a challenge or want some alternative to games like e.g DayZ!It's a 4/5 in my opinion one of the better games on Steam's Early Access.,Rust
2014-01-21,1,2,214,True,Recommended,A brilliant game Astounding longevity even at this early alpha stage. The multitude of gameplay mechanics creates a diverse experience whether you just want to survive build a base raid others kill zombies or collect weaponry and crafting knowledge. I can't see the game being as much fun playing solo but I guess that's just preference. The heart of the game in my opinion is the team play.Glitches are minor to non influential and lag issues are small yet irritating. When polished this thing will be a masterpiece.An epic that can only get better.10/10 (Also censor.nudity false is hilarious there is nothing like crouching and sorting through your inventory to turning around to a face full of man balls!),Rust

Building forts with your friends and developing friendships with local settlements will give you hours of enjoyment. The game is a 10 and it's just now in Alpha. I've been waiting for a game like this to come along. It's like DayZ meets Minecraft with the best of both worlds and it cuts out the bad. The game is a little buggy (Which is expected in alpha). That being said the game isn't a copy cat of anything. It takes survival elements and puts its own spin on them. It's addicting well paced and incredibly customizable. VIVA LA RUST!,Rust

The game itself is fun for about an hour then starts to get repetitious and grindy. This is attributed to not only the very nature of the game (it being a survival game and all) but the fact that there is simply not much to do. You can hunt animals you can get resources you can build a house and the list stops there. The main reason I have so many hours on this game is simply messing around with friends hence if you do not have a party you can play this game with I would struggle to recommend it to you.

2014-05-16,0,0,85,True,Recommended,At first this game is totally frustrating and induces fierce rage. I first spawned outside a hut with nothing but a rock and a flaming torch. No instructions on what to do I selected the rock and began hacking at a tree. As I was chopping away a naked man (with his vulnerables hanging out) clubbed me to death with a rock.Next spawn was a little better I collected loads of wood and then proceeded to waste my time bashing at a cliff face to gather rocks (this doesn't work btw). After a good ten minutes I noticed I was getting hungry so I went to look for animals. I found a wolf. He savaged me and I died losing all my wood in the process.Third spawn was a little better I gathered wood (again) but could not find how to gather metal or stone. So as night drew in I found an empty (doorless) hut where I camped. I could not see so I lit my torch this was purely so I could see but served nicely as a homing beacon for every ing dangerous thing in the area. First I beat away a radioactive bear then I 'just survived' a zombie attack before finally being blown away by the shotgun of another player.Forth spawn I fell of a cliff after getting too close to the edge (fair play).Fifth spawn I wandered into a city and heard a clicking noise. I was complaining over chat about someone being a on the mic but it turns out this is the sound of a radioactive area. I died upstairs as I found a tin of beans!Sixth spawn I went back for the beans but was over powered by a naked man with an axe.Seventh spawn went really well. I collected lots of materials (unhindered) and made me a wooden shelter with a DOOR! Yes! Finally some progress!!! I lit a small fire and it was all feeling worth the pain... until what I thought was a knock at the door turned out to be another naked guy with an axe. He smashed the door in and stole all the stuff I'd taken ages gathering.Eighth spawn I just ran... and eventually starved.Ninth spawn I built three houses in a remote part of the map. All was fine until I got cocky and attacked a bear that fight ended very badly and was over quickly!Tenth and last spawn I found a really helpful guy who showed me how to use blueprints craft more effectively and how to generally survive. He taught me gestures that showed if I was aggressive or friendly to other players. I walked confidently over to a guy we saw and knelt down as sign that I was not going to harm him. He executed me with a rock and took all my stuff.Definitely going back on line tonight 10/10 !!!,Rust

2014-01-11,0,0,28,True,Recommended,9.4/10Rust is one of the top games on Steam. With it's survival aspects just like DayZ but yet slightly better seeing people hitting each other with rocks. Rust can be one of those games when you either be killed on sight or you kill people on sight just like DayZ. Taking people prisoners on this game is quite halarious when it comes to trapping people. I've seen a person battle out a bear then die so I took his loot and run. With zombies out of the picture it can be less fun but this game's potential is amazing if you get to try it. It's worth the $20.,Rust

2016-01-14,0,0,700,True,Recommended,My 500 hour rust review I purchased this game when it first came to Steam. I played 200 hours on legacy and enjoyed every bit of it. Finally legacy died down and became just another game. Even through hours and hours and hours of amazing times with friends.When new Rust came out it was quite a drastic change. One that certainly had it's ups and downs. There were plenty of issues with it. A lot of people quit the game. A lot of people said it was ruined and ignorantly have still never come back.I can say the following with much confidence This game has become one of the BEST games of all time. I have spent the majority of my time in this game since it's DRASTIC turnaround to greatness. The changes have been great. The improvements have been insane. The game is truly my favorite game right now. And that takes a lot for me to say.To all of the people that have left this game and are maybe thinking of coming back PLEASE do it. The weekly updates to this game are absolutely amazing and you can follow along with Garry Newman and the dev team at http //www.playrust.comPros Best survival game on the market first off. Amazing base building that allows you to create whatever your heart desires. Weekly updates that CONSTANTLY expand the content never allowing you to get bored. Balance constantly changes and always seems to get better. Graphics on max look pretty outstanding for a survival game. Community/modded servers allow for you to find the PERFECT server for you and your friends. Things like faster gathering TP even deathmatch servers etc. Gunplay requires skill and with the mixture of bullet damage that isn't too insanely high as well as medical options as medkits medical syringes bandages barricades to be placed on the spot really allow for the player skill to sustain fights in situations. Raiding is the ultimate game of friends V friends / clan V clan pvp. You won't ever experience anything quite like it. Live map map.playrust.io for any server (I believe any server). To keep track of yourself and friends. Fairly optimized game. Don't know anyone who can't run it. I can go on and on and on....Cons Graphics on low look pretty bad (What game doesn't?) Losing your gear and base constantly CAN potentially be frustrating but restarting is all part of the fun right? The changes are not final and there are some things you might like that MAY be removed at some point The learning curve to be serverwide competitive with other larger clans can be quite large. With building and combat. (This issue isn't an issue for me but maybe for some.) KOS is the only way in Rust. But remember you bought a hardcore PvP survival game. Servers can be laggy and cause desync (Just look for another one.) Really can't think of any other cons right now.Overall this game scores an EASY 10/10 with me. There's no other game just quite like Rust out on the market right now. And games like h1z1 Ark Hurtworld 7dtd etc.. just don't come close to competing with the experiences you get from this game. Thank you Based Garry. Rust is truly amazing.,Rust

2014-09-17,1,1,43,True,Recommended,i love this game its realy interesting.i love how u can kill animals and craft stuff.its like mc but its not square. i give it a 97/100,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Great game after recent updates. Runs smooth as hell now,Rust
2014-01-07,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I'm not actually much of a fan. I think this game needs a lot more work put into it. The landscape will randomly flash and it looks like you're falling through the world. It is some what difficult to find resources like piles of wood and boulders for stone. If there would be more camps or storage units for supplies it would make a big difference. For me the $20 they are asking for would be a fair price if the game was done.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,101,True,Recommended,NEW REVIEW 50/50 not worth buying right now as its quite buggy (no animal sounds so you spontaniously just pop to a dogg with no sounds attacking you from behind) and their is a ton of content missing and broken gameplay...Not sure if the developers care about it..if asked I will go into more detail.Don't pay more than $10 for thisLegacy Sucks...not even worth loading up entire Rust communities died because that game was so broken.NOW the new updated version is interesting no more wood piles resources are easily farmed and found which means its quick and easy for a new player to get started...being raided is still rough but some houses are OP meaning you cannot even chop down someones door now...whats the purpose of a base building game where you can't chop down a wooden door with a axe or kick down a door frame?Larger detail in items better looking world character animations are much better.Is it worth it buying the game now? Yes but only if you have multiple friends playing it...loads of fun except for the developers screwing us now I can't play Rust at LAN parties with friends anymore...I could use Steam Family Sharing and mutliple people could play together but now it just kicks people out...which has ruined my expirence now as we have all moved onto other games because we can't play together on my clans Server.,Rust

2014-06-30,0,0,95,True,Recommended,Rust is a very enjoyable game. I highly reccomend playing on a server with not that many people. That way you dont get slaughtered at every corner. The best part of this game is how you kill an bear and get chicken breast. i cant wait till they add different meats. but its a great game to play with or without friends. a few problems but it is in alpha.,Rust

2017-06-23,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Absolutely atrocious. The only game I've ever experienced constant crashing from one minute in. Spent an hour attempting to fix it but would constantly crash not only Rust but also Steam and even made my Blizzard App crash as well. Not worth the money in its current state.,Rust

2017-06-15,0,0,957,True,Not Recommended,Yay! Want to be forced by a SJW dev to role Trans dice to play an often crashing and ultra low FPS still in alpha after years game? Then this is the one for you!! Enjoy key and spawn glitches! Squads of hackers on poorly run servers and more! For only $19.99 you to can make sure the developers enjoy life and dont actually finish the game!! Yay for marketing! Enjoy this game with your mouse firmly in your for best results of course.,Rust
