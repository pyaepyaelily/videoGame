2017-09-25,0,0,377,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous Grand Theft Auto games. As far as driving goes the vehicles have been greatly improved with Rockstar running more complex physics on them. The cars can even hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game particularly the Midnight Club series compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky boat like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game but that doesn't mean that the melee combat won't be fun as it as been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons there is now a Weapon Wheel which is similar to the one featured in Red Dead Redemption another game made by Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto V draws inspirations from many different Rockstar titles in the past including Max Payne 3 Midnight Club Manhunt and Red Dead Redemption.There are many unique features in the game one of those features is that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists in the game the other two are out living their independent daily lives and you will be surprised by what you find the characters doing when you switch back into them. Another unique feature is that the character swapping feature is executed in a Google Earth styled manner and was displayed during a Game Informer demo which was showed to have ran smoothly and without lag. The PC PS4 and Xbox One versions present an exclusive feature the first person mode The whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. This gameplay mode presents a whole new way to play the game. Cars have detailed interiors different from one another shooting is like that of an FPS game.New activities have been added such as yoga triathlons jet skiing parachuting tennis golf and scuba diving. Random events have also been added to the game and can appear any time while the player is exploring the map. The mobile phone has returned from Grand Theft Auto IV but is now only used for calling the player's contacts surfing the web and quick saving. Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle (which Rockstar recommended you do in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome of this effect depending on where the player is at they will get different reactions from pedestrians).Rockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in East Los Santos and the same people can reappear in Rockford Hills working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. Some minor mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day such as a sprinkler system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like Morningwood.The map is larger than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption combined. After some calculations by members of GawdAlmighty.com that would equal to around 27.5 square miles/71.2 km2 when land and sea are combined.,Grand Theft Auto V

The level of cheaters in GTAO is also horrendous as it really ruins the experience.Also getting money has become incredibly hard to do unless you're willing to do some pretty heavy mission grinding and that is if you get the missions done.All in all it's fun but you'll get bored soon enough.I demand steam to give me a refund.,Grand Theft Auto V

Controls felt unresponsive and awkward kind of like you're supposed to play with a controller of some sort rather than a keyboard and mouse. Auto aim feature is a joke no real reason to competitively try and beat other players when this function is on. UI is counter intuitive. Again feels mapped for a console rather than a PC. Spawn system is .

2016-12-24,0,0,1053,False,Not Recommended,Its GTA unless you've been under a rock for the past 20 years you've probably got a good idea what your getting and the game its self is a work of art and is Excellent but here are my bad points some of which really ruin the experience.The loading screens I bet at least a third of my game time has been taken up by loading screens feeding me adverts while I wait for the matchmaking to commence...The rewards apart from the latest heist most of the rewards are pretty mediocre specially when the time to load the missions(or get back into the world after) is taken into account making it a lot more time consuming to make any real income or to just get the basic fun factor of the game.Timers part of the rewards complaint I guess but these have made me turn the game off and walk away so many times I bought the car business let me sell however many I want without a 20minute cooldown between each sale you even have to wait if your sale fails! I had to go and steal them all I don't see the need to limit my fun selling them and once again ruin my game experience and if the timers were removed the rewards part wouldn't be so bad...Leader boards I don't understand why most of the people on them have not been banned with all the 1second race times! they should be scrapped! Stat recording/viewing on profiles should be reconsidered as well since R* can't manage cheaters very well it would be less incentive for them the explode lobbies if they didn't have a k/d to pad out and keep track of...And back to Timers! they don't even reset when you leave the game for a bit and return please end this madness lazy people will still be lazy people and buy your sharkcards and you'll end up with more people playing for longer instead of just logging in selling a car and then ing off to do something else because the cool down for no reason has spoiled the game.To the people that say well sell a crate while you wait I don't want to do crates I don't want to do coke or weed or guns I like selling cars in free roam and these timers are only in place to try and increase sales instead they players off and ruin what should of been one of the best experiences online. Saddest part if we got a little more for our money and the game wasn't ruined in my opinion by the above I would of probably bought a shark when Doomsday came out because it really was great content and that deserves our support. But crippling our progression to try and entice us into buying cards no thank you and it will only end in people in the end leaving the game and your brand.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V as its commonly reffered to has endless replayability with a campoaing that goes for tens of hours and other events that will keep you attached to the gtame for what feels like forever. It also has a high amount of customization with a detailed car customization a h8uge range of clothes haircuts tattoos and gyms and other activities to increase your skill or ability in certain areas. As well as there being an amazing single play mode there is also and online multiplayer mode. GTA Online is an equally as fun mode where you can group up with your friends in 16 player lobbies and do lots of cool and fun activities from grocery store robberies to races to different jobs and even full scale heists which takes time to set up. GTA V is one of the best games ive ever played and would highly recommend this game to anyone who can afford it or run it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,11,18,97,False,Not Recommended,I am glad that the development team decided to go all out on this port and put themselves in the shoes of their characters! Watch as they rob you off your money when you realize that this game is as buggy as a rotting corpse. You will get problems such as crashing due to 'Failed Initialization' Saving failed Rockstar services are currently unavailable and the classic 'Request timed out'. Then watch them help other companies rob you more off your money by requiring a ridiculous amount of memory that a poor man's 8gb RAM cannot handle. Then if you feel like they haven't molested your wallet enough watch them drain the life out of your credit card by selling you ridiculously expensive 'shark cards' that will quickly go down the drain after buying your first high end apartment and luxury car. Or you can grind your way through the heists which is plagued with glitches random headshots troll eight year olds and... lahhhggggggg. But hey at least they promised to fix it later right? Right?But if multiplayer is not for you then feel no despair for this game also sports a single player sandbox with an engaging story line. You may play as Michael de Santa an American dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money or play as Franklin an African American dude with a disfunctional family and rob people of their money. But if those two feel too tame for you you may plas Trevor Philips a crazy Canadian dude with no family and rob people of their money. Feel free to feel anxious about the heists that the game promised the players will be free to do however they choose. Then feel free to feel betrayed as those heists hold your hand through a scripted set of predictable events that you totally have no control over. But if those heists don't do it for you there are fun side activities like parachuting racing and the extremely weird Strangers and Freaks side missions that feel like they ripped off from Saints Row. Annnd there are also some action packed activities like doing yoga towing cars for a living and watching movies by yourself!Look at all the properties you will only be able to buy at the end of the game when you're finally rich due to the money you get from all your heists unless you play the stocks market. Watch how Rock Star teach you how to make it big in the stock market by killing your competition destroying the products of your competition or downloading an app that tells you exactly what time to sell your stocks.So join Michael Trevor and Franklin in turning the city of Los Santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson torture and drugs. Or create your own ugly character and join a million other people turn Los Santos into a hell hole filled with robbery murder mass murder genocide homicide arson drugs and laahhhhggg. Give Us Money V! Oh look i'm about to finish Pacific Standard! 1.25m babyyy... wait what? Failed Initialization?! F***! F***! F***! Fix this s***! You shark selling c***s! C*** sucking g****rds!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-08,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,"I am done pretending this game is okay it's not and people only like it because it is ""Edge theft Auto"". Let's start with the Online aspect. It's an abomination not because it is nopt a fun mode well I guess that is why. It's not fun because the community is well you thought the community on ""Call of duty"" was bad? This AMPS IT UP! No one does missions they simply go and kill low level characters with Miniguns and the other OP weapons Rockstar decided to give their jackass online community. Please either make the weapons open for everyone and quit making players have to level just so they can get some overpowered weapons. They can get tanks and bomber jets. Which equals your game being ruined. The community is the RUDEST I have seen since ""Counter strike GO"" sexism racism hackers and much more.I shot a guy in the head with TWO clips from an AK47 before he died I WAS POINT BLANK SHOOTING HIS HEAD and it took two clips to kill him. The hacking is REAL in this game You can NO LONGER mod which was the only saving grace to this garbage franchise. 3/10 for the online. To me the story is the typical ""Let's be criminals"" mantra and that crap.I can't even beat the second mission it's just uninteresting without mods. 3/10 for the edgefest story. Rockstar was MUCH EDGY with this game. Don't buy this unloess you are max level online if you plan on playing online. I know I will get thumbs down but thios game is just. The online would be fun if not for A.) The community.B.) The hackers.C.) The trolls who DO NOTHING but ruin the game for others and laugh like the subhuman mongrel they are.D.)

2015-06-15,0,0,162,False,Recommended,Really don't see why people are complaining about this not being on sale during the Monster sale. This was just released and most new releases dont get discounted during steam sales they did extend the extra ingme money with the Shark cards which isnt a bad thing. This is a fantastic game that the PC community waited a very long time for. Rockstar did an incredible job of optimizing this and it looks and plays great even on lower end PC's. Singleplayer is really fun with a great story and with 3 main characters it never gets dull. Online does have its challenges with the assorted griefers out there but if it gets annoying you can always find another session or even play solo in the online campain and still be able to level up and make money. Only complaint i have is sometimes it does get a little laggy online but its torrerable. Big thanks to Rockstar for finally bringing this to the PC. If your a GTA fan this is a must buy if you never played a GTA game before this is a good one to get you hooked on the series. Highly recommended!,Grand Theft Auto V

The plot is so awful. A beautiful world and everything is so so so so so dull until Trevor arrives on the scene. Who cares about Michael and his family home. You want to shoot his kids and this is GTA ffs. You can't shoot them? No one would put up with their crap. What a Franklin only really here to cling on to some old San Andreas Grove street roots. And I hated Grove Street. Trevor is just ... well you'll see. But story mode is playable. Without a doubt. It is a great way to see this sandbox and how beautiful it is. Flying over it looking down at the houses. You will see that the guy who was copy and pasting house models was fired. It would be hard to find two similar houses in Los Santos. The detail is rather incredible. And I completed this twice on PS3 before coming to the PC version and seeing even more extras to detail it is impressive.But... loading....

Entering Solo Online.... what even is solo online... loading....Failed to join server....Joining friends server .... getting server info..... joining server timed out....Loading.... bored.... joined friends server... finally we can start to play online...You may of gathered there are plenty of load screens. But once you are in you can play for a time and have plenty of fun the amount of missions / heists etc is where this game does excel and keep you from boredom. Because there is nothing more stupid than being in a game where someone is in an armored car shooting at you and you can't do much back. But you will play with friends / crew members and then you will go to freemode to take a break and muck about or restart some missions because all you are being offered is death matches and races but you won't be in the same server and god knows you are going to be seeing 5 loading screens before you can get back to each other or not at all.Or you will be in a loading screen forever like limbo while you wait for everyone else to come out of theirs because yours seems to be hanging until they have all made it back to a server...And this has to be why the connections are so bad and you are desyncing so much watching people plough into car after car but they swear they have hit nothing the entire time except that wall where finally everything resyncs...The whole character transfer idea is awful. What A hole thought that up? Maybe in 3 months allow that when some people have gone from level 0 100 or w/e. But to let people start at 100+ so they everything? unlocked? Way to ruin the playing field. Saw one guy at level 1000 already.One thing I think is missing is crew cribs. I mean why would you want to all have a different appartment I would rather one crew crib where you have earn ya money and do it up rather than Rockstar making a few ""IKEA"" furnished homes. Of course then they would have to make a Bed Bath and Beyond Walmart where we could buy or steal goods from.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,0,0,152,False,Recommended,"The only reason I'm buying this game is because it's actually have large modding community and currently the best GTA game Rockstar has ever produced I was heart broken when I heard that they banned modding and OpenIV slightly relieved when they just recently unbanned them because of fan backlash this left me speechless because this is the first time I aware that Rockstar/Take Two doesn't have a very friendly terms with the modding community and the majority of the GTA community as I thought they would be. From what I played that's true of almost everyone said that this is the best and most ""realistic"" GTA game that Rockstar had produced the content are very polished and you can spend a lot of time playing it further more being the very better and improved succesor of GTA SA and GTAIV and the story telling and other new mechanics and features are absolutely great and refreshing. But the only reason I became addicted to the games is modding I've been playing GTA games with various mods since GTA SA and GTAIV various mods that change the script and models of the games for your personal pleasing(although I prefer lore friendly mods so I don't go crazy on changing models. The mods personally I'm using usually are mods that make game more realsitic like Euhporia natural motion Overhaul Mod or NPC's of Lost Santos mod. It's not just an addition it's an extra polishment to the game that you always needs the moding in PC games has been my thing for TES series(Especially Skyrim) L4D2 Half Life 2 Garry's mod and other Soucemods it adds endless possibiity and endless more hours of addictive gameplay contributed by the creative and talented communities of gamming and modding that's why Steam created workshops for some games just for that reason(in fact some games are created because of the creativity of modding like Team Fortress 2 being the very succesion of a Quake's mod but that's another story). Anyway GTAIV and GTA SA being 2 the main foundation of GTAV(also with other Rockstar games) GTA SA being the concept and features while GTAIV sharing the Rage engine and features with additional original concepts that our latest GTA game itself excels combine into wonderful speciment of what we called ""Grand Theft Auto V"" even better that GTA SA GTAIV and GTAV both having a very large modding communities and mods. As for GTA Online haven't played it yet so I can't make a review on it I'm not expecting anything from it though.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,2,9,2338,False,Recommended,LOVE this game! The Singleplayer campaign is worth it alone with enjoyable characters fun quests and the ability to just roam around and do what you want. The hilarious character of Trevor Phillips is reason enough to play a lovable psychopath with a heart of (tarnished) gold and the BEST dialogue.Online has its issues with the modders/cheaters/script kiddies(skiddies) always one step ahead of the anti cheat program but it is still a blast to play. Whether you enjoy pvping or PvEing with others it has everything Heists Races Death Matches customizing your own vehicles and weapons and more. They're always adding fun content from Bunkers with weaponized vehicles to Hangars with meticulously detailed aircraft.And don't believe the people crying about false bans. It simply doesn't happen. Just skiddies crying about being banned for cheating but not owning up to it.BUY THIS GAME!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-15,0,0,333,False,Recommended,"Let me start by saying that I'm sort of a paranoid. When I saw all the claims on steam reviews about the ban I told myself I couldn't risk buying this game that I will somehow get banned. So then I started investigating as the computer scientist that I am and realised many things. I even went to the point of writing to RS themselves to ask a few questions about their system and make a few clarifications. Most of these claims are false. While false positive did happen (rarely) RS recognized their mistakes and rolled back the ban. All the ""trigger"" from the automated system are checked by a human check statistics and check how money the person makes compared to missions play time and many paramaters. So trust me all those claims on steam about being banned for nothing are falsed. They either modded themselves or begged modders for One of the best advices I can give you is lookup on the net as there is a list of programs's overlay that might trigger a false positive althought they are probably working on a fix for that. (Some programs includes Discord's overlay MSI afterburner's overlay FRAPS (and other recording programs) and a few others)Now GTA V is a great game. An awesome game sandbox style with a lot of freedom and many hours of replay value. But when you jump in the online world the awesomeness of GTA V really shines. With litteraly HUNDREDS of things to do constant updates and fixes and EVERY update being free it's understandable why it's one of the best title out there. Okay you'll find the occasional griefer or bored high level who will just kill you for fun but you can easily overcome that by changing sessions and there is many nice and helpful people around.

2015-06-15,0,0,69,False,Recommended,It took me just under 40 hours to complete the main story with a couple of side quests done (all of Michael's and a few for the others) which is a pretty decent amount of time. The story itself doesn't feel as involved as with previous titles however and the pacing is something that I didn't really enjoy. For example you don't earn any meaningful amount of money until the final heist of the game which you can then invest via stock market manipulation doing assassination side missions. To me good pacing would've had half of the story trying to earn and the other half having the characters already made something of themselves. Getting a pile of money at the end of the game after the story and turning it into a bigger pile of money just isn't very enticing as there's no drive.That said it's still a solid Grand Theft Auto title with decent graphics (minus the forced blur during cutscenes regardless of settings) and lots to do. If you like sandbox games with a little story on the side then this game is definitely for you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-02,0,0,59,False,Recommended,"Preface I do not play GTA Online thus this review has nothing to do with that aspect of the game. This review only concerns the singleplayer portion.Pros + Massive detailed gameworld+ Three playable switchable main characters+ Wide variety of weapon clothing and vehicle options+ Heist missions though few are quite enjoyableCons Limited opportunities to earn money Most of the gameworld feels under utilized Story begins strong but degrades quickly ""Kill 'em all"" ending feels rushed and isn't as satisfying as it should beThe Bottom Line After nearly three years I finally sat down and got through this game once and for all and while there's a lot to like here I can't help walking away from it feeling a tad unsatisfied. All in all I'd quantify GTA V as having two major strengths but three significant weaknesses enough to put it behind GTA IV in my opinion.Right off the bat the player will be floored by the world which you're thrown into it's massive and I don't think there's been a game since GTA V that can match it's sheer size and scope. Honestly at first it's overwhelming and those who like to explore will spend countless hours doing just that. However it's not just the world's size that's impressive but also the amount of detail but into it whether we're talking about the city of Los Santos in the south or the rural northern region. It feels alive and is probably one of the most ""real world"" game environments I've ever encountered.The player then explores and sees this world through the eyes of not one protagonist but three an entirely new mechanic for the Grand Theft Auto series. While this can be a rather tricky way of going about things Rockstar did well in giving each of them a unique personality and flair that will appeal to every player. You've got Michael the ""retired"" Tony Soprano esque master criminal who tries to balance his desire to get back into the game with protecting his family and trying to be a better father and husband. Franklin then fills that role of the stereotypical hood with ambitions for something better. Finally Trevor is just psychotic and provides most of the games more absurd and comedic elements in many ways Trevor is the personification of the kind of person concerned parents worry their kids will turn into from playing Grand Theft Auto. In spite of their vastly different character types they work well together and really keep things interesting especially the relationship between Michael and Trevor.Yet while those two major elements make the game what it is there are areas that leave me wondering whether or not this game may have been a little too ambitious for the developers...Despite the game world's aformentioned positive aspects the reality is that between story missions side missions and activities the player only really gets a chance to explore or see a small fraction of this massive environment. This of coarse leaves most of it under utilized and creates a sense of wasted potential. On an entirely different note while the game sports a rather wide range of things to spend money on the player has a limited number of opportunities to actually earn any. Out of the small handful of hesit missions only two or three actually give the player a significant amount of cash and a majority of story missions give you nothing at all. This leaves only three other avenues of making money meticulously trading on the in game stock market buying property or spending an incredible amount of time doing odd jobs like driving a taxi or tow truck.The in game stock market is really only worth fooling around with in conjunction with Lester's assassination missions but those are of coarse limited in number and offer a total payout still isn't significant in the grand scheme of things.Buying property is also rather useless. The amount of money you have to spend to purchase property is incredibly disproportionate to how much you make from that property. For example you may spend $600 000 buying a place but only make $800 a week off it.Finally the third and final major flaw of GTA V is the progression of its story. During what I would call the ""first act"" where the player is introduced to and gets some time with each individual character the story is tight and works very well. But once all three characters come together things fall apart quickly as we move from one thing to another with almost no rhyme or reason. Characters come and go events and actions feel like they have no impact and at least one of the game's endings feels entirely rushed and unsatisfactory despite it being what one could call the ""good ending"".In the end GTA V is certainly a marvel. Rockstar delivers an experience like nothing else out there in only the way that they can but the reality is that there were missteps with this installment some major and some minor. The game is absolutely worth playing but in my opinion it's not as strong as the previous title in certain regards.Score 7 out of 10 Mr. Raspberry Jams",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-13,0,0,153,False,Recommended,"Single Player 10/10Multiplayer 9/10One common problem is online. I have probably spent an hour in total looking at loading screens because the game can't check if there is an open space before trying to add you this isn't a problem if it has a ""different aiming mode"" which it checks before and if you say no you instantly get put back on the same spot you were before. Cunning Stunts (nice wordplay ) ) has one problem which is most players tend to see how much they can do over other racers. If they sort out these problems this game would be perfect.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,1196,False,Not Recommended,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa in this game you wake up in the cryo vault and you have to look for your sister sean.Many examples of discrimmination are shown within these riots against blacks. Most of these major black communities were destroyed due to an unsupported accusation against one man. cruelty inflicted on african americans. . This novel showcases a few fictional instances of discrimination within this time period to give the audience a taste of racial inequality. Although racism and discrimination seem like a thing of the past it is still a prominent issue today. While we do not have extreme violent acts comparable to past events such as the riot in Rosewood in 1923 slavery nor any active discriminatory laws racial discrimination is still an ongoing issue. In a survey roughly 61% of Americans overall believed that more changes needed to be made to achieve racial equality. However 88% of blacks believed that more needs to be done to achieve equality opposed to 53% of whites. This shows that the demographic of blacks believe they are treated unfairly as the data shows a high percentage stating that equality has not been achieved. This enforces the idea of racial discrimination still existing today as no other group would know better than those who are inflicted with racial prejudice. Statistics also show that African Americans are three times more likely to be killed by the police than whites and 30% of these fatalities were unarmed compared to 21% of whites. In conclusion the evidence in my research shows that we still have much more to go until we can achieve equality.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-22,0,0,1045,False,Recommended,Singleplayer i d really reccomend. But multiplayer. If you re some bad a$$ Veteran of gaming history Community compared to you are little kittens.Here s the case Some kid accused me of ha**ing just cause i constantly point blank headshot him and his friend 10 seconds from eachother in a team deathmatch. (Pistol)Then they had to grab snipers and RPGs to even the odds but that didn t help counter the odds against my heavy pistol (1911). The kid literaly stalked me into lobbies for revenge.Kids have some really big alttitude isuess in this game. I m starting to think they re having some sort of autism.Hell it even began with these feminist gamers.(The Hell with me if those were feminist at all). *Maybe dudes acting like feminists. Yes mai friend rumors are tru in guming most of em are males actually probably from LGBT region servers*.I was really expecting mature community... But here s one thing. How in the hell do monkey period teens get this stuff. I heard most of them get it disscounted from those sites like Penguin etc...GTA V community is dead... All you have left is these monkey period kids which you can beat with one finger.Then they go all like (Hackur Hackur Hackur). They need education and PC ban. Ruskies are okay but a little on edge sometimes. The rest of the community is dommed generation.Trust me collecting mature friends here is hard. Cause they re rare. I m kinda looking to form them all up then hit up a full lobby of the Dommed ones &amp Ruskies. Light em up. Show em what age is this game meant for. Teach em a lesson.Gunplay is pretty simple.... like totally simple it s got signs of console ripoff But even with mouse aim. Mouse aim yes simplest tool. These people. You got no idea how many times did they miss point blank with a shotgun Even an assault rifle. I can simply walk up to them and double tap R to bash em a little old fashioned way. Jeez these kids.Need Rifles with Optics Flashlight Grips Extended magazine and some other special needs of help Because they have inability to use weapons properly (Autism in general).The only thing these kids are effective is with sniper rifles and RPGs. They can t even fire with ironsights.And they get really angry once you start owning the lobby match. Like did i murder their braincells?Hell i even let the kid win one on purpose out of his many defeated rounds.Tank battles are the easiest it s like playing WOT for Babies. *( Autism edition )*Choopers &amp Planes can be a challenge.Boats are relaxing.And Races are buggy. Sometimes unplayable.Because of the P2P system.Long story short about P2P.There is no dedicated server.It s intregrated and being weighted on each player in the lobby.So if one of them has an bad internet. You will get the same result my friend... Not like Capitalism More like Communism.P2P will be the rise of Putin. Brace yourself Trump.Oh and the adversary modes And Overall all the modes in GTA. Are... I didn t ask for this... Why is it here? To much autism. It needs realism to it. Not a kindergarden playground. A real balanced playground. Actually the newest adversary modes are quite interesting but still lack realism to it. The older ones thought the racing thing and stuff... Forget it. It doesn t exist. And public lobbies. Players approach me like i have peasant vision. (Which i don t).Then once they fail at it they just keep chasing me with countless attempts to take me down.Oh guess who has to gain kills for the team? Me. Yeah this game can be totally dependent on you and sometimes less on your team. Second Case Those Pro Body armor to the teeth dudes who once start losing really bad then exit to keep their KDR in place. Hell what does it matter if one has Bad KDR? Your fame is hurt? You gonna cry now? Step up and fight man... this is kindergarden game and you ragequitting on it like its DayZ to you.About P2P system The servers intregrated. Meaning everyplayer getts a background check and server they are currently in cannot be protected from ha**s. Oh and yeah they have a microtransaction log.That s how they spot a ch**eater. If they spot that you got more than you have earned which bots ussually do they automaticaly punish you. But the server itself has no such protection and is basically valnurable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,165,False,Recommended,"Couldn't keep away from this game forever could we? Certainly ing can't in the city I live in! The entire place is practically gift wrapped in adverts and posters for the thing they almost outnumber the blokes in singlets and flip flops calling each other ""cant."" I had to go down to Melbourne for a bit and I was faintly relieved at not seeing any there until one of the trams rolled by absolutely plastered with the logos like it had gone at full speed through the last EB games convention.You know what I noticed though? A lot of the posters I've seen consist only of the head and shoulders of one of the characters with no attempt to sell the game or make any reference to its content just the title underneath 'cause they figure that's all they need. ""Here it is"" they announced grandly throwing the sheet off the swill trough and jumping back as the pigs all thundered madly towards it. Yeah I see what you were getting at now Amnesia!So GTAV then. The fifth Grand Theft Auto after 1 2 III Vice City San Andreas IV Chinatown Wars and all the other ones adding up not being one of Rockstar's strong points. GTAIV was of course the game that taught the world that gritty realism and tragic character drama have their places and that place is not the same place as the place where you can pile up all your dead prostitutes on the side of the road and then ramp off them into a big fire. I know you aspire to write stories with some complexity Rockstar and that players insisting on selfishly trying to have fun in your game must be very frustrating but you kind of brought this on yourself when you decided that ""Tw "" would be a funny name for an internet café.GTAV tries to cunningly hedge its bets by constantly swapping between three different protagonists in the hope you'll like at least one of them. But that smacks of gambler's fallacy to me it's entirely possible to toss three coins and have them all come up tails or indeed for two to come up tails and the third to shoot up your dog's and give your dog bowel cancer. Franklin is probably closest to being the protagonist protagonist 'cause he does the standard GTA straight man thing where he rolls his eyes exasperatedly at every random weirdo who thinks that flagging down passing pedestrians is the best way to put out a contract hit but meekly follows their instructions anyway like a passive aggressive husband. Michael by comparison is a very active aggressive husband who retired from bank robbin' to spend more time screaming at his family and breaking things. And then there's Trevor who seems to be an attempt to represent the standard mode of behaviour of a GTA player in that he's a filthy amoral psychotic with the innate likeability of an incontinent honey badger in a house kitchen an hour before the health department inspection.But my major beef is that none of these characters are likeable and it's not because they you know kill people and lord knows I can't throw stones in that department at least not 'til I've cleared the basement out. They're just poorly written and inconsistent which may reflect the fact that their dialogue was being written by enough people to choke a sarlacc. Franklin just comes across as whiny and Michael having realized that all his ill gotten wealth has done nothing to bring him happiness seems to think that the logical solution would be more ill gotten wealth!To that end we have the heist missions which is the big new feature after taking fat dudes on dinner dates didn't exactly ignite our pubes last time around. And it's not a bad concept you plan a robbery mission and do some recon and vehicle stashing tasks before the caper itself. Well I say ""plan"" you ""plan"" them in the same sense that you ""plan"" a Sunday drive down a one way street because like all the missions they bear the increasingly omnipresent Sandbox Paradox total freedom when outside missions and when inside total instruction following simulator that fails you out of ing nowhere because you got in the wrong car or went two feet the wrong way and the game just felt like things were getting weird. The extent of your input is picking which of two pre determined package tours to use and what crew members to bring. Their stats increase as you use them but since each one is only available for like two heists apiece in the whole game it doesn't mean a whole lot.The protagonists also have RPG style stats incrementing away in utter pointlessness levelling up your flight skill can mean the difference between planes handling like both your wings are stuck up a sumo wrestler's and handling like the sumo wrestlers put on slightly aerodynamic hats. I suspect that this is all preparation for the mechanics of GTA Online and how cunning of you Rockstar to hold off unlocking that until after I've submitted this review and stopped giving a two dollar blumpkin about the game. Well the joke's on you! I just moved house and my internet wasn't hooked up anyway! Bet you feel stupid now!But digressing back towards planes for a moment why did I have to go through a plane flying tutorial after a story mission in which I had to fly and land a plane? Had the sumo wrestlers expressed some dissatisfaction with my performance or is it just that this game is a mess? And not the ""potato salad molestation charges"" mess that was Saints Row but an engorged mess of unrelated and clunkily tutorialized features. Lots of story threads but no strong overarching one. Mostly ""Character A pisses off Organization Y somehow and fends them off for a while until Character A slaps himself in the forehead and goes 'I just remembered I'm a murderer! Let's just murder whoever's got a nark on and then have a bath in his wife!'"".Well just to appease those champions of emotional stability who have been burning crosses in the front gardens of unimpressed games reviewers I won't say there's no fun to be had. It's got some colour back into its cheeks and generally feels less like a fat old sheepdog has fallen asleep on the physics engine. I cringed a bit when it brought in buyable properties but they unlock more missions and gameplay so there's a point to it other than just soaking up unnecessary money as is the case in other sandbox games. There's not much that particularly made me go ""Christ who thought that was a good idea?"" like that dinner dating business last time. But then again there's also nothing that made me go ""Christ who thought that was a good idea? Because they were totally right to think that and I want to kiss their big soppy face!""There's nothing that excites me that I can point to and call ""the defining moment"" it's just a whole load of people doing stuff which I admit is a fairly weak argument World War II was just ""a whole load of people doing stuff"" but at least getting your leg blown off gives you something for the next letter home ""Dear Mum remember when my dance instructor said I had two left feet? Well I've managed to redress the balance somewhat. P.S. ING HELL AAAAARRRGH!!!"" Yahtzee",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-02,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,I played now for 6 hours in total. All what i did is going from A to B. In between listening to some mission NPC dialog.. Dialogs that only are synched in english. Uhm i dont understand all and have to read the subtitles while i am driving the fast cars.. so i can concentrate on nothing.After finished a mission i am on the edge of the map and have to drive all back for starting a new mission. Again go from A to B.. The missions are still the same drive a new vehicle maybe shoot to something.Sorry but i had far more fun in JustCause3 than on this game.Finished another mission.. Ok lets look on the map ah there is a letter for a mission. Lets drive again to there (.. go from A to B..) .. Finally arrived then the message appears You must be Character blabla to start the mission .... ragequit. The game want me to change the character and drive again all the way to point B.. no thanks.Then ok lets try this question mark on the map. Side mission. Now the game wants me to do a race by foot against an annoying screaming NPC woman. Ehm.. boring. And annoying.Oh there was a weapons shop. There i bought a new pullover and it was auto weared. Then i went to a mission and the pullover was removed and i had again the oversweated ugly blue/gray default main character tshirt. Hm.. customization right?Population In the settings i have the most on high and the population on the highest. The world looks dead as hell. Very very few people are walking around the streets..For what should i tune my car. There are already a lot super fast sport cars on the street to steal. So why should i be interested to upgrade cars?..What is this game fun for. Driving from A to B? Make t on the streets? This game seems only to be made for teenagers. Back in the days i played through GTA3 GTA Vice City GTA Stories from liberty city GTA4+addons and had much fun. But on GTA5 The superlative perfect game did not take this lv up like the past games did back to the day.I played the previous titles on console. This im playing with the XBOX controller. But the controls now feels clunky and all seems sluggish when walking around.The only thing that i enjoy at the moment are the characters/stories in the main missions. EDIT After 5 more hours the thumb still remains down.Online Mode First time logging in i cant move and no buttons react.. Rage quit..The next day I was automatically joined in a Race Lobby (very confusing UI by the way). Uhm i didnt want to make racing but ok lets give it a chance. I hoped that the human counterparties give me some challenge. But no.. All could not drive the car like normal people and went to crash on almost every NPC car. In a dead city (again i setted up the popularity on max!).So i fast became 1st place and finished with a very very big leading distance. Uhm.. this is not fun.Physics Driving vehicles feels so stiff compaired to GTA4 and lower. Making the car roll on a crash is very difficult now. It does not feel like GTA.Why im still playing?I gave the game some chances due to its rating. And when i started to play with Trevor (after a forced long boring A to B gameplay with the other 2 characters) the game becomes better due to more action and a damn crazy new character. Why not from the beginning so?!But at the end this game for me is far overrated.PS Instead of giving this review thumb downs tell me what i can do to have more fun in this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I had to use Wifi ( ) then I got home ran to the computer as fast as I could and turned it on then it loaded for 10 seconds and said ""Launcher stopped responding"" and I'm good w/ computers so I tried to update the drivers and all the reccomended stuff for like 3 hours and nothing.

What at first glance appears to be a 2 D sidescroller ripped straight from the pages of the Paper Mario universe soon turns into a 3 D action adventure that defies all video game logic. Fusing 2 D and 3 D perspectives not to mention RPG and platformer elements the game slips back and forth between dimensions. The action sprawls across eight worlds filled with traps puzzles bizarre mysteries and items that often draw themselves out of thin air. Oh and just because Mario's in the title doesn't mean he's the only star players also get to play as Peach and Bowser.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-01,0,0,704,False,Recommended,"NOTE EDITED 01/12/2017 with a GTA Online review at the bottom of this. GTA V is something that redefines gaming. Not having it in your library would be a big mistake as it's now very affordable and most of all totally patched up and good to go. The best part of it the thing that makes it difficult to go back to real life is that everything feels real. Most open world games are heavily scripted or full of emptiness or even both. What makes most of TES games quite boring after a while is that you don't feel like you're part of a living world a world that evolves without you. NPC routines are well knowned since TES Oblivion but never before has it felt so realistic. There are literaly thousands of people living their lives in GTA V and everything you do has a direct influence on their behaviour. In a realistic way not just as in ""please get out of my house"".Now the missions are what makes it coherent. The storytelling is excellent as well as the characters' acting. It's far better than most Hollywood movies.That's what it is in the end the game gives you the impression to live a blockbuster. Changing skin as you hop from a character to another could have been annoying but no all three of them are really enjoyable and I guess that most people won't consider it a turn off when they'll have to switch to M T or F for some new occupation.GTA V is full of variety full of fun every minute you'll spend playing it it's honnestly a gaming masterpiece that my only regret is to not have bought sooner.As a conclusion I didn't even try GTA Online yet and have no real interest in it. People who gave terrible ratings to the game because of servers being broken don't seem to understand that the essence of this game stands completely elsewhere. Being able to play with friends is certainly a plus but the sole fact of it having you postpone any kind of real life activity just for the sake of another highway race is what makes the GTA licence the state of the art in videogames since the release of its oldest iterations. The pro's simply obliterate any kind of complaint about its lack of this or its too much of that.A final word of warning this game is for ADULTS. And adults that don't fear seeing graphic violence prositutes prostituting bandits banditing and guns killing people. If you're not into living a movie like Payback from the inside move along to Just Cause 3 a good game that justifies any violent action by pouring some liberty sugar on it. GTA Online review OK so after I finished the game quite quickly to be honnest I thought I'd give GTA Online a shot. Because that's a turn off all the new content so far only concerns the Online part. No you can't buy more than a few places for each character in GTAV. Once you're done with it only the Online game will bring you new stuff. At a big BIG price.Morons. That's the main price to pay. GTA Online is like the best MMORPG ever but filled with morons. Only one out of a hundred players seems to listen to the instructions for a mission. ""Go silent and stealthy"" turns quite fast into ""RUSH B!"". You got it. So you'll spend most of your time watching stupid people doing stupid things with no sense of roleplay at all. And start missions over and over and over again. Till you can't bear them anymore.Otherwise it's quite fun. The heist setups are hard and could be a real challenge as in GAMING challenge if they were not played mostly by people who seem to be challenged by life. People rarely communicate while it would help a lot. No one seems to understand what the ""say to team"" button stands for.Oh and the servers are unbelievably crappy. It's infinite loading times disconnections and hookups all around. Not to mention lag when your team's from eastern Europe or USA while you're in France like me. We're all aboard the same f**ked up train.But all in all the game mechanics are incredibly fun. Oh sure you'll spend more time willing to kill your teammates slowly and painfully than actually playing. But anyway it's strongly addictive. Sincerely I don't even know why really but as soon as I'm done with this review I'll start the game again. And rant a lot.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-08,0,0,312,False,Recommended,What I really like about Grand Theft Auto is that it has a great free roam gameplay. I'm not a fan of the story mode but I do like it I really like the Online Mode though. You can play with your friends and do what you want. You want to infiltrate a military base and steal a jet? Then go on ahead and I advice you to play with your friends. You can go crazy on a rampage killing everybody and ramming npc's over while you see them fly off. But there are still bad things about the Online Mode. There are always hackers who could just troll you especially with Money Drops and you could get banned for something you didn't do unless you ask for it xD. Also you need a lot of money in this game if you want to fulfill the potential of Online Mode. It willl take some time doing it but also you need to level up fast if you want to unlock mods for guns and cars such as the minigun rpg GT Wing Spoilers and other sorts of stuff. You could also play a lot of different mini games such as the one part of the new Smugglers Run DLC which is Motor Wars. I particularly favor the Deadline Mini Game myself. Guess thats about it and even though this game costs a lot I'd say it is worth it. If your on a budget you should wait for a sale because there is a chance you could get the game for half the price.

Luckily R* is releasing new content quite often so you'll never be bored.I've not played much campaign but I can say that a lot of people have good things to say about it. The three main characters are apparently quite easy to relate to even if you aren't a retired bank robber (did you see that guy on reddit? dang)All in all a solid game with a ridiculously fun multiplayer.

(4670k 8gb of rams and gtx 760) There's modders like in every GTA O but RockStar is doing verything in their power to enforce justice online. Which is good but it can also make the game dull. Sometimes modders do make the game interesting with snowball fights to the death or just flying in a car they're driving. Unfortunately just like there's good modders there's bad modders. They're are some modders that go godmode and kill everyone or frame users and kill the lobby in the name of a random user. (Modders aren't easy to comeby.)

To many kids on the pc version and no real skill players since most hide in a armored car like Cowards then talk sh** after they kill you. This is also coming from someone with a 4.03 K/D rating and thats all with REAL skill mind you. Hahahahahaha i didn't know being a Coward hiding in a armored car or truck made any one good but okay ill let these little 15 years think what they will. To those who say K/D does not matter are the ones who suck bad or have a low K/D rating so to feel better they say that. don't be jealous please.

2017-09-04,0,0,549,False,Recommended,A truly amazing singleplayer and multiplayer experience.Though many reviews you may read for this game will tell you that this game (or at least it's multiplayer) is bad I have a different opinion.Story ModeGrand Theft Auto V's Story Mode is honestly one of the best and most in depth campaigns that I have ever played. Not only is the story interesting the side missions will usually leave you eager to play more of them. The ability to play as three completely different people and make them work together in so many different situations is also something I believe was pulled off very well.It will keep you interested for quite some time.GTA ONLINEGrand Theft Auto ONLINE is an excellent concept and has (for the most part) been fulfilled in my opinion. Though I will admit I can see where some people are coming from when they claim that the prices are outrageous it just gives you a reason to enjoy even more of the game. Though GTA ONLINE can become rather boring if you're playing alone getting a few friends to play along with you (or making new ones) can make the game far more enjoyable to play.From doing street races and low level Contact Missions for your fellow (AI) criminals to becoming a CEO/President of your own Organization/Motorcycle Club. I believe GTA ONLINE still has a lot to offer players whether new or returning. Plus there are still more Free DLCs to come!It should be noted that other reviews will complain about a great quantity of modders/cheaters/hackers within GTA ONLINE or being banned from GTA ONLINE for no apparent reason. I (nor any of my friends) have not met many hackers especially within the past few months bannishments have never been an issue for me (or said friends) either. Though I'm not saying this hasn't happened to others I don't believe either are likely to happen much anymore as Rockstar has been trying to correct their anticheat and autoban services.ConclusionAll in all Grand Theft Auto V is a great purchase in my opinion. Though it may be better to wait for a discount if you're looking to find an excellent singleplayer and/or multiplayer experience Grand Theft Auto V could be the game for you!,Grand Theft Auto V

Want to join a queue for this full session? Boots you into a different 1 player session instead of keeping you in current. Want to join a heist? Game stops at gathering ""GTA Online Info"" forever.. then fails to join. Frustrated and want to kill yourself? Game silently deducts from your bank account but says it costs $0. Quick join? Nobody running any activity in all of GTA. Hosting a good well paying job? Nobody wants to join you. Good at any co op activity? You'll get a garbage team and fail 10+ times.. then everyone will leave. Want to afk and think you get 15 minutes idle time? If you lock windows to do it the game kicks you for being idle in 30s. Bookmark a job? You won't find it unless you browse to the exact specific category. Think you'll get better rewards if a job like a race is harder to win because there's more people playing it? Want to store a vehicle into a garage or sell it? Garage/shop suddenly blocked from entering by a random irrelevant event that started. Doing good in an event? Suddenly booted into empty public session and event cancels out. Granite bushes and street signs while street lamps snap like twigs. Voice chat best turned off.And last but not least.. I'm afraid of playing because hackers are able to actually remove your money from the game permanently and/or raise your level to 1k+++ so you get branded as hacker and get banned.An okay game if you've played 500+ hours. Otherwise you're just food for other players.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-14,0,0,75,False,Recommended,This game is very well done rockstar has outdone themselves with this game. Although if you are going to be playing multiplayer WARNING There are alot of hackers that spawn you money and then you cant do the game legit. This game is a hefty download and I would not get pc edition if you have a crappy computer. I reccomend you use the ASUS ROG with a 970m nvidia graphics card and a intel core i7 (message me on steam for my computers full specs) I have 0 lag in multiplayer using my laptop. I would not get a alienware if you are going to play games though it may look cool but its not. Besides from the awesome lighting that the aliemware has it cannot drive or do almost anyting in GTA 5 online and in singleplayer. It lags alot when you drive a vheicle and go fast it also lags when you start to shoot something or see a lot of explosions. Overall I would give this game a 9/10 because it does not get good gameplay if you are playing on a crappy computer.,Grand Theft Auto V

So they're after me.. Good thing I can hide in a building After this guy came for me in a jet I came out and then shot him with a homing missle it hit so his jet was on fire and went down fired another round he ejectedHe parachutes down tried to kill me I shot him he must of crash landed and died parachuting so I got a kill.Then with great haste I got on my helicopter and flew away.He respawned on the mountain and is now stuck up there but he got a good view of me flying away.There are no cars or nothing up there so he legit is stuckSucker gotta walk. And no one got the briefcase from me so I won a 11grand10/10 would strand people on a mountain again.Cons I would mention would be bad flying system. Long loading times. Bad match making system. Not much to do in free roam so can get boring. Heists don't really pay enough and if a person leaves the entire heist fails and everyone gets kicked which is annoying.Servers seem to be plagued with modders right now.But cons aside if you're a GTA fan I do recommend this game and stranding people on mountains.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-05,0,0,236,False,Recommended,DRINKING GAME! take a shot whenever I say GTA 5I recommend this game thats all I gotta say. If you wanna see my expirience with it then read on brother!This review is for people who have played GTA 5(take a shot) but spoiler free if your a rebelGTA 5(take a shot) has been around for ages. Everything to be said about this game has been said. So I decided to write about my expirience in GTA 5(take a shot.)For starters GTA 5(take a shot) has its own sort of charm but hadn't charmed me like the previous games in the series.The 3 protagonists in GTA 5(take a shot) are very interesting characters though I admit Micheal was probably the least GTA(take half a shot) material. The character who embodied most of the GTA spirit was Trevor. Trevor was a psychopathic funny and mad me sad on his last 'Strangers and Freaks' mission.As a speedrunner GTA 5(take a shot) is probably one of the easiest GTAs to speedrun however quite dull which earns it the monika 'KYS SIMULATOR' as in a speedrun of GTA 5(take a shot) you take advantage of the 'skip' system which lets you skip whole portions of a level.GTA Online is well...OK. Once I connect to GTA Online its quite alright...Until some random Polish kid starts screaming at you then mute everyone incoming. Playing GTA 5(take a shot) with friends is fun. For a period of time I used to play in the over world robbing gas stations dodging cops and all that classic GTA action. However I couldn't go 5 seconds without some going guns blazing at me only for me to sigh and riddle him with bullets. Alot of people complained about hackers in the PC version. But I haven't met any. GTA 4(Don't take a shot) had quite a simplistic multiplayer. But it was good to around in with your friends.The heists in single player were fun and had alot of diffrent options. However I hated the onlie heists as there was no option apart from chosing roles and cuts. The people I got put with were and couldn't play it at all!Overall this a good but flawed gamed. There is alot which I dislike however I put alot of time into it and gotta recommend it even though alot of my expirence was quite bad mkay?Now i'll say GTA 5(take a shot) a couple more times to make you so drunk you'll like my review and then die.GTA 5(take a shot) GTA 5(take a shot) GTA 5(take a shot) GTA 5(take a shot),Grand Theft Auto V

On top of that dispite the game being out for years the creators never balanced anything. anything new is miles better than the old stuff. so unless u waste your life playing or pay to win someone else will always have the ""advangate"".For example a tank can be bown up in 2 rockets. newer insurgant cant be blown up but instead u have to shoot through the smallest holes to kill the driver which 9/10 times is impossible.Finally the prices for things like cars are ludicrous you have to grind and grind just to buy one thing. i find myself being more angry at the game than i have fun. and ive been playing since release.",Grand Theft Auto V

Modding was stupid in general I never cared about openIV or other like that and I still don't care about them now that they were shut down. In fact thank you TTWO for shutting them down. Sure ""OpenIV was a modding tool for single player "" but other players created hooks so they could be used online and ruining people including me from doing missions online. All the people upset about how these modding tools got shut down were probably the same asshats that would join an online server filled with 30 people and dropping bombs atop their heads and just cause total devistation. GTA V was one of the only games that had an Online feature and supported modding in Single player mode. That's the problem people could easily get online with mods. I saw a fellow idiot's review ""You take our mods we take your income."" Sit the down Gta V is nearing 80 million copies sold and the game being sold at a constant $45 their total income from this game alone grossed $3 billion. Sure you can threaten them by not buying any of their services but I honestly don't think they care. As I'm typing this there are 60 thousand people in game lol.

It has a well written story which has an excellent pace and you never become bored. You always want to know what happens next. All the missions are fun and the graphics are purely beautiful. The controls are the best ever. This game also has a lot of detail. For example the three lead roles (Michael Trevor Franklin) all have different phones. Michael has and iPhone. Trevor has a Microsoft. Franklin has a Samsung. The game also does a great job of telling each characters personality. If you don't know yet Trevor is basically a psychopath so he has a broken phone screen a messed up trailer drugs snacks and other weird stuff on his bed and he has a beat up car.

If you got some money left over wait for a sale and you'll atleast spend 50 hours on this game.The online is like ehhhhh. It's addicting for sure which is why I'm still playing it but with no friends to hang out with it's boring as . On the Xbox 360 I spent 800 hours with my mates and it was a blast but I come to PC can't transfer my old character and basically that 800 hours is lost. I wasn't too thrilled.

2017-07-06,0,0,705,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is one of those games that will and did make a huge impact on the video game industry. One of my favorite games by far across both singleplayer and multiplayer.GTA Story Mode for me was incredibly fun for me. Players got to see a new perspective towards GTA games and Rockstar overall more than one main character. All of them tied into the same story incredibly different personalities and different pasts. GTA Online is a different story for me as I can imagine it for all of the other players. I found GTA Online just as addicting as Story Mode despite the modders and hackers and those out to ruin other peoples' fun. I played this game on the 360 and continued to the PC I loved and still love this game. If you're willing to look past the modders hackers and all around s in Online get this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Put on your headset prepare your mic and play with a few friends and let the hours just roll away. Do a VIP CEO heist job racing or killing other player in the session if you and your friends are bored and want to do random stuff after a heist job. It's brilliant. If you don't have friend and play it alone you'll get bored fast because for money you need to grind the hell out of it.

2016-08-15,0,0,155,False,Recommended,"Single player mode is extremely fun and overall a positive experience. It was story rich and truly a sandbox game with each side quest different from the other. Graphics are stunning however for some reason my resolution was 3??? X 2???? but one day it just changed to 1080 x ???? and I couldn't change it back ever since. That made the graphics look a lot less crisp. There was a thick line and everything looked... off. But overall I have positive vibes toward this game... Now on to online mode...Online mode... Where do i start. The concept of gta online is a great concept but way too good to be true. Firstly half the people playing are whiney+salty leauge players. I start a heist a level 2 pops in and yells ""GIF ME 30% I NEED MONEYS"". Then we have the people who purposely troll and die on heists thus making us all restart. And dont get me started on the grinding part. To really get high up in this game you need to grind.... a lot. The pacific standard heist on hard gives 1.25 mil ( if you give everyone else 0%). It takes about an 1hour and a half to set up if your lucky and takes longer to finish the heist if you have crew members who refused to listen to you and buy heavy armour. And then we have queueing for heists. Unless you have friends to play with it is absolutely hell. Player joins player leaves. Wrapping it up I feel like GTA V was an incredible game for 60 bucks. Ive played about 80 hours on the game so far 75 cents/hour if you sum it up. If you only are going to play story mode go at it! But if your buying it because you saw some youtubers playing online..... keep your expectations low.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-26,0,0,333,False,Recommended,Still one of the best games ever made. Graphics still looks great maxed out at 4k next to more modern games with loads of customisation options to get it running really well on any pc with a 2Gb or greater card albeit at lower resolutions. (8.8/10 next to modern titles)Audio sound track is as expected with GTA nowadays nice variety and apt! (a solid 9/10)Gameplay enough free roam to keep you going in circles for a loooong time and enough 'mini' games etc to keep it fresh for a long time. (another solid 9/10 no real pushing of boundaries on this one)Story and characters 10 in my opinion entertaining hillarious (trevor vs the fence!!) the main story arc is a real page turner and you get to pick how it plays out.Recommended to everyone!!!!Compulsory Warning If you are male female undecided young old living deceased alien terrestrial red blue black white grey or some or all of the above then at least some of this game will definately either offend or tickle you!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-24,0,0,358,False,Recommended,I highly recommend this game for the story mode. Its insanely fun and beautifully done. One of the best games ever.As far as online I have spent plenty of hours online and it has given me so much entertainment. The thing is this issue with modding software. It happens way too often where you are in a server and someone is modding and causing problems. There is nothing you can do but report the suspected person or join a new lobby. This is highly frustrating that we have to deal with it on a daily basis in almost every server. Not very fun to lose a big sale because 6 random vehicles spawned on top over you and everyone in the server. This has RUINED the online experience!!!!Story mode is amazing and definitely worth playing worth the money. Online is very good if you can tolerate the modding that happens. Or the kids begging for free money. These are huge negatives for me in the online and I just returned with the new DLC after a long break. I recommend this game now for the beauty and story but I warn you the online experience will vary and you will likely find yourself jumping servers frequently to avoid modding and griefing.

2015-04-17,0,0,46,False,Recommended,"Ok so the story is pretty much well known considering its been out for two years. And finally it releases on PC with beautiful graphics and optimisations. The game runs flawlessly on my system. My spec are as follows.i7 4950kEVGA 780ti SC acx 2.016gb of Sniper Ram 1866hzRoG Maximus Vii heroSSD 250gb1tb HDDCorsair Graphite 760TH100i Corsair Liquid Cooling ExtremeMy computer is somewhat of a beast and runs all these 'next gen"" games flawlessly without any problems. I was worried that this game would have terrible optimisations as most console ports are badly done but this caught me by surprise constant 60 fps and does not drop. I have experienced during a few cut scenes that it drops to 30 fps but I believe that this is a glitch and only happened on two or three occasions. I highly suggest to pick up this game. The price considering its a two year old game is a bit ridiculous and they should of made it at least $60 in my opinion considering the age but alas can't have everything your way. Highly suggest the pick up. GTA V online is where this game falls. Long loading screens wether you want to play with your friends finished a mission joining your friends session the loading screens are plenty and very long. I don't find online peticulary interesting nor fun to play. So take my 5 cents and do what you will. I would probably just finish the campaign and screw around in that. I loved the idea of heists and they finally brought it out but to my knowledge its for four people so unless you don't have four friends to play heists with its a pretty useless DLC (In my case don't have friends that play computer games but are console peasants).

The game is great online and offline the time you spend on story alone is worth the price tag. Yes there are cheaters online they will ruin your fun unexpectedly yes there are random players who just play to kill you even if you are fresh out of tutorial and you are a level 1. With that being said there are communities/crews you can join so you can be the one stomping on the griefers and have majority to kick the cheaters and the try hards. Now ignoring the online aspects of interaction with others online jobs provide fun challenges its better with friends of course and some jobs require more than 1 . . .

2015-11-03,1,1,103,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto I loved Grand Theft Auto San Andres back when it was released on the PS2. In that game there was some questionable things such as woman on the streets for lack of a better term however that was easily avoidable. Grand Theft V Game is great visuals stunning however I have to not recommend this game. I do not recommend this game because the developers went too far with the sexual themes. These developers have to know that young audiences play this game they should not of put the sex scenes and all the sexual comments typically made by trevor in the game. It was and is 100% unnecessary. Now to all of those who will refute this with the age old arguement ""but its ok to shoot and kill peoplez!1!?"" This arguement has no wieght to it. In 95% of all video games your character is killing some sort of monster/ bad guys. Same principle in Grand Theft Auto with the guise of police outfits or civillians. Games do not need to have a ""porn"" like element to the game. I know a lot of people disagree with this view and that is fine. This is my review.

AND i have a gtx 980 ti and a 5820k 4.3ghz with 32gb of ram so the sluggishness is not because of my computer. this may be ""entertaining"" for the first playthrough or at least most of it. but after that meh.if you ONLY had 60 bucks (plus tax) to spend on ONE game I'd choose MGSV over GTAV.was this even worth the 60 bucks? sure 50 hours i suppose i could argue it was worth it. but was it as enjoyable of an experience? no not really. especially when i compare it to the feelings i've felt playing something like MGSV. i STILL have positive memories of scenes and cinematics from the game. i even remember some of the melodies from the soundtrack.

2015-05-06,0,0,15,False,Recommended,I have this on PS3 and PS4. And if I had an Xbox360 and XboxOne I'd buy it on those too. I now own it on PC as well and I am being absolutely sincere when I say that the PC version is THE definitive version of Grand Theft Auto 5.If you're worried that it might be a horribly optimised mess like GTA IV was when it was ported to PC just set those worries aside. Rockstar really have outdone themselves with this port.Now it's not all sunshine and rainbows If you have 75 cop cars 36 police choppers and 12 tanks on screen all shooting at you at once you're going to get a bit of lag (whatever your system specs no doubt) but you'll get a hell of a lot more mileage out of the PC version than ANY of the console versions by a long shot. Setup your Xbox 360 controller (or PS3 controller with MotionJoy) for car and plane controls and you won't know any difference from the console besides the better graphics and the fact you can finally pop off enemies expertly using the keyboard and mouse controls. The gamepads will always be ready for action so you can seamlessly switch from keyboard and mouse to controller when jumping in a vehicle.If I could recommend one upgrade it would be a video card with 4gb of memory. The GPU isn't the main issue with GTAV (unless you pile on the extreme post processing settings which you don't really need anyway) it's the video memory. Having said that you'll need more than 2gb of video memory ONLY if you intend to use HIGH or VERY HIGH texure qualities. Normal looks fine if a little blurry and is about the same level as the consols use this suits me fine. Point is I'm running an ageing GeForce GTX670 and it has no problem keeping up with general gameplay although I haven't had any wanted levels that might lead to the scenario I described above as yet. For general gameplay in which most people are looking to do story/online missions a 670 or comparable GPU will have no issues running this game as long as it has 2gb of memory or more.,Grand Theft Auto V

Trevor Philips who is a mental redneck living out in sandy shores Michael DeSanta who is a father of 2 and a husband struggeling with his past in the life of crime and Franklin Clinton who is a gangbanger who is just trying to get by in any way possible. The game has 3 diffrent interesting endings but in my opinion there is only one true ending. Find out for yourself by playing the game!Rating 8.7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,128,False,Recommended,GTA V Good game for those who like open free roaming sandbox games however do NOT trust all the reviews saying this game is bug free. At first (I mostly play online) there were no bugs AT ALL until I hit level 8. Then it started as you can see in the list below Upon death camera would freeze on the death screen preventing you from seeing where you were going after you respawn. Heist sequencing bugs out and cutscenes play in the wrong order. Random disconnections due to an unknown error on the server. Game CRASHES due to Rockstar games social club errors.Pros Open gameplay and TONS of activities to do. Lots of ingame content. Game looks beautiful and runs smoothly (well optimised). Controles are good however flight might take abit of getting used to.Cons Game can feel like a grind to unlock more stuff and earn money. After you complete all the activities a few times the game can feel boring. Initial loading takes a LONG time I've had to sit and wait for the game to load for about 1 2 mins (and that is with an I7 4790k 16GB RAM at 1600mhz and a GTX 780 TI 3GB). Ingame loading takes a long time about 30 secs to 1 min. People will randomly leave your server in mass waves leaving you on your own. Transition from loading to playing is cool at first but the entire thing takes up 5 10 seconds and becomes monotonous after awhile.MY recommendation If you enjoyed previous GTA's then I would recommend you wait till around May June 2015 to buy this game so that most of the bugs are fixed. If you did not enjoy previous GTA's so much then I would recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

In multiplayer you can make the character that you want but then the game is stripped of many role playing actions that single player has and is instead an arcade gallery of mini games to play in instances outside the open world there is very little in the open world that you can do while just traveling around other than robbing stores.,Grand Theft Auto V

Worth every penny and i've bought it multiple times (x360 PS4 and PC).If you report online cheaters R* will even send you some money from times to times.Oh and the SP is quite amazing as well. I heavily modded my offline game for LSPDFR and it's like R* intended the game to be modded. It becomes an entirely other game but you have to remain offline.Bottom line both SP and MP are freaking nice.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-01,1,1,542,False,Not Recommended,THE WORST LOADING SCREENS EVER!!!! R* SUUUUUUUUUUUCKS!!!! I have a 4690 and a 980ti and I have to play in SAFE MODE (tiny little 4 3 window) because ROCKSTAR refuses to fix there servers!!! Don't waste you time on this one guys. and ROCKSTAR SMARTEN THE F*** UP!!!edit I was definitly frustrated when I wrote this but the loading screens are a HUGE issue with this game. another issue is R* fired one of the better guys that was leading one of the update crews. He was the one coming out with the updates like the motorcycle clubs and the executive stuff so all thats left is the team that adds different game modes (races deathmatches) so dont expect a casino opening anytime in the future.... R* is also moved on to the new Red Dead game so I really dont expect much more dev. on GTA at all....All in all pretty fun game to play around with friends but I'm tired of big time developers like R* who program everything around constant grinding just to get the next car that you'll get bored of...

2017-09-15,0,0,469,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V dominates the third person open world shooter genre and with good reason. Its story is simple enough to keep players who are interested primarily in action engaged and has enough nuance to keep those in it for the story and action involved as well. The graphics and visuals are just stunning and make the game even more enjoyable I highly recommend this game sadly I can not say the same about Grand Theft Auto Online. GTA Online takes most of the fun out of the game giving you very repetitive missions with almost no reward. Just stick to single player you will be much happier.8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-10,0,0,137,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece with perfect voice actors to hilarious yet intense gameplay this game really offers it all.companies like Rockstar CD Project RED and Bethesda have pushed the boundaries of open world over the years and shown that quality is defiantly superior to quantity. I'm glad to see Ubisoft take this approach with the next installment of their assassins creed franchise.The three characters Michael Franklin and Trevor are an amazing trio all with different personalities and backgrounds. The world is open for you to explore and do what you want you can rob stores run marathons race cars play tennis explore underwater Practice yoga play darts collect parts mod cars and skydive and that's only a few of the many things GTA v has to offer.The main story takes you all over the world robbing banks killing private army's and a bunch more cool stuff! When you do a heist you have multiple choices on how you want to execute the mission you can pick a loud or subtle approach pick crew members on their skill and more importantly their cut depending on the choices you make things can go smoothly or horribly wrong causing crew members to die or worse...I highly recommend this game to everybody this game was released in 2013 and still enjoy to play it!,Grand Theft Auto V

While other main character is being stress induced old fart fighting his way out of his family troubles.Game's good plot's good graphic good.Online on the other hand Started a session got ran over by a tank the moment i respawned.Gave it another try Got shoot up by 6 people in a biker gang. decided to quit started a invite only session got bumped by a police officer got two starts and shoot up to death while being named a moterf***er.

Then came the patch for fixing the usernameissue it did fix the usernames... BUT I lost all my story progress. Ok fine it were only a few hours nothing I couldn't play again. But today I wanted to play with some friends we randomly disconnected and then every time I tried to join one of my friends my game froze and crashed. THATS what I call a AAA title aka.

The gameplay itself is very good having a story to follow makes it even better.The multiplayer part of the game don't even bother the cheaters are in almost every single ""lobby"" that you join sometimes they literally with your character forcing you to go to rockstar support make a ticket wait a week for them to respond help you go back ingame 5 minutes later same issue so you have to make another ticket with the same issue. The cheaters can take away all of your weapons / ammo / cars / everything you did in the game and not get banned they can and will get you banned by dropping money on you ""bs you can't drop money anymore"" cheaters still can normal players can't. However once you do get banned you have to go to rockstar support AGAIN and explain the situation wait another week only for the same thing to happen 5 minutes later after you start playing the game.So TL DR if you don't play this game in ""solo"" sessions all the time you won't have a good time and don't even get me started on the loading screens.Honestly rockstar should at least refund people for the cost of the online part of the game since it's so bad.",Grand Theft Auto V

There's more content than you can shake a stick at and hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay to enjoy whether in story mode or playing online. People are upset because the game developers want people to play the game as intended instead of changing it drastically for entertainment purposes. Look at what OpenIV has done they changed the game SO much that now there are hundreds of people bad mouthing the game simply because they can't modify the game to their liking anymore. If OpenIV hadn't come along and tarnished an otherwise flawless product GTA V would still be a gleaming example of what a game should be. Instead it is losing players and the reputation of GTA V is being damaged beyond repair. Here's a big **** You to OpenIV for causing this.Sincerely A True Gamer,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,0,0,527,False,Recommended,"I'm reading all these reviews about how Rockstar told Open IV to stop modding and what you guys are saying is a little ridiculous. Maybe you guys don't understand or even see how many people mod in GTA Online. You wanna talk about modding getting out of hand? Have you not seen the modding in game multiplayer at all? That's out of hand. Yes I know Open IV is used for single player mods but you do realize you can use them in multiplayer too right? I think Rockstar is trying to do what's best for their game and eliminate the people that use modding to ruin online multiplayer for the game. At least it's a first step towards that. They tried making bans for people who use it in just multiplayer but that wasn't working. It was still easy to mod the game. So I think they should keep going to keep modders out of multiplayer at least until they can find a way to fix it.""The single player is very fun and the multiplayer is enjoyable with friends however it is let down by hackers that have made multiplayer unplayable depending on the server.""""so many hackers...""""Awesome game! Good Gameplay and Graphic.Now you can go in GTA Online with less Hackers. Hope They bann more Modder Pages. GJ Rockstar )""""It's a very good delightful game. In other ways a very good game to play with your friends! Although I would love the modders to gtfo because they always get me banned. PRO TIP If you want to play with your friends online go in a invite only session.""You shouldn't have to go into an invite only session because people are ruining the experience for others. I applaud Rockstar for taking a stand and forget anybody who tried to ruin multiplayer by modding it. If anyone is to blame for Rockstar doing this it's not them it's the modders in multiplayer. No matter what Rockstar did they still tried to find new ways to mod it. So the modders forced Rockstar's hand. Stop getting mad because they are trying to do something about it.",Grand Theft Auto V

Hackers will spawn items money and even objects onto you and kill you as well.

Do not even buy it find it somewhere rent it or borrow it!JULY 4TH UPDATEIt has been a growing game and now totaling at 64.5 GB of massive data originally it was 45 GB at launch. The game has just been dumping more and more space onto your system but the results are still bad.We still do not have a Lobby System that separates modded players and legal players. This is a feature that ""Dying Light"" inherited and let me be the first to say it is VERY effective! Rockstar's method of instant Ban Hammer will be its own undoing. Shark Cards? Forget it do yourself a favor and pay 10 Dollars for a Modded Character from PS3 and transfer it over. Not only is it undetected its untracable due to the fact that PS3 version is highly out dated! Don't spend $100 dollars on a few million dollars to rockstar when you can get over 250 Million and 500 Level Ranked character instantly and have everything unlocked! It isn't worth it anymore!Does this mean I support hacking? No I don't support a team of incomptenant developers sitting on their scrunchies dishing out useless updates that don't solve their own problem.This game would get a 10/10 if it had the following Lobby Separation System when using mods online Modded Lobbies/Non Modded Lobbies.

Graphics are great driving feel is fantastic the level of detail put into the game world is very impressive. Having 3 main characters that you switch between keeps the game fresh and the dialogue between them and between NPC's is extremely well done. Trevor is a lunatic!

All fitting with his character. +1If for some reason you are reading this and have not yet played GTA 5 on console or PC you should highly consider getting it. I'm currently 36 hours in and approximately 50% completion. I'm not rushing myself through the story just going where the wind takes me. I understand there is currently some pushback against the removal of modding in the game.

Some games you can figure out how it creates the quests it creates or what triggers what action so it breaks immersion. GTA never lets you draw the line. The mechanics are seemlessly intregrated to make the game feel alive. The gameplay is as fun as ever and every mission is diverse and engaging. The random events and people around San Andreas is fantastic. It is so unique that you will feel empty after finishing it 100%. The aesthetic is beautiful the city feels alive the desert feels deserted and the forests feel lush. The graphics aren't breathtaking but the game is well optimized in my opinion.Online is a grindfest with running around everywhere but if you have friends you will get more fun out of the coop missions and heists than you will get from other ""full"" games released by AAA companies. It functions as an MMO where you grind for days to get gear you want and everthing costs 10x as much as in single player. Some people might like the races the pvp matches the carnage or the co op missions but it definitely not for everyone.Oh and there are hackers. Tons of them. I haven't seen many myself but my friends and other people have seen a lot of them. I suggest private lobbies. There are guides online that will help you get in a ""public"" private lobby where you can actually play the game.Don't read other peoples' reviews.

2017-05-31,0,0,204,False,Recommended,"This is probably one of the best open world games you will ever play. This is an example of what you should be getting when you buy a triple A title and I have to say that over the last few years standards for gaming have dropped a bit. We are all too willing to accept buggy unfinished messes and pay for games that never should be released at their current state a few years ago. Do they even have quality control at steam anymore? Watchdogs II and witcher III Just Cause 3 and probably most things from Bethesda would be some of the exceptions as well as some nice indie gems.GTA is a series that just keeps raising the bar for gaming and storytelling. If you gave Rockstar a film budget and said go make a gangster movie. It would be in capable hands rockstar just know what real gamers want kickass characters that actually make you want to play them. I'd say the guys at rockstar really enjoy rap and films like godfather goodfellas casino and heat snatch lock stock sopranos etc. And you'll find a lot of these actors reprising their well known roles throughout the series.If only Rockstar would embrace modders instead of trying to block them it would be perfect. Just ditch trying to sell us multiplayer and keep both singleplayer and multiplayer seperate entities and give singleplayers what the multiplayer have as well as tools to add elements to the singleplayer experience maybe a map editor and give me the option of playing WITHOUT social club. Unfortunately in multiplayer you can't rely on people playing fairly and it wrecks the experience for those of us who do and ends up nerfing the whole mp experience.The radio stations in GTA V have some neat tracks to accommodate your vehicular mayhem and the world of Los Santos is very cynical and sometimes accurate depiction of a vain souless morally bankrupt society hell bent on self destruction which comes accross in radio adverts and billboards but it means as trevor you fit right in and I find myself playing him most of the times his one liners are hilarious. ""If you say so!""Vehicle handling and car customization is the best of any game to date the sheer handling of cars and the weight of them gives gamers a real feeling that your stuck in the movie Heat.Physics is top notch and weather your manuvering a massive air plane or nimble jet they all just feel right with each one having it's own mass. The inclusion of the rockstar editor is great and Iv'e done a few movies with it tagging multiple clips for import into the timeline could be a little easier though.Just buy it. For the massive ammount of awesome modders out there with mods like SP Garage Heists in SP ramp spawning to name a few this game is worth every penny even without mods your getting a lot of bang for your buck with hundreds of hours of fun gameplay here.CONSMore ramps and marked ramps on the map. I've always found a severe lack of ramps in GTA and I would love a huge island dedicated to just stunts although this has been achieved in modded games. I find hitting ramps at full speed and watching the slomo camera to be one of the best experiences in GTA. RECOMMENDED B1trider",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,2,3,0,False,Not Recommended,"I went through total hell with this game and it would take me several hours to write down exactly what went wrong and what I had to do in order to fix the problem... So I am going to give you the short version.Needless to say I (just like so many of us) have waited about 2 years to play this game. Rather than buy it for either my PS4 or Xbox One I chose to do the time and wait until this supposedly much superior version of GTA V is to be released for the PC. I waited and waited and waited until the day had finally come for me to experience the GTA universe in 4K resolution at 60fps! Naturally I pre downloaded it which forced me to look at the ""V"" icon sitting on my desktop just daring me to double clikc it. When the moment of truth arrived I double clicked the taunting ""V"" icon and was rewarded with a ""disc error"" message asking me to uninstall and reinstall it. I did which took roughly 3 5 hours. When I was finished all I had to do was log in to my good for nothing ""Rockstar Socialclub"" of which I care absolutely nothing about and happily begin playing GTA V. HeHe... man was I in for an unfortunate chain of events that would take me 24 hours plus some to find a solution to my dilema. Not to my surprise there were an extaordinary ammount of other unfortunate souls experiencing the same problem. According to all of the forums that I had read the last day and a half there are several different problems that are keeping GTA V from either installing or launching and to each one of those several different problems there are several different individual solutions to fix the problems. Understanding what was ahead of me and what I had to do was judt mind numbing. I was going to have to try each different fix and hope that one of them fixed the problem I was having. I got right to it... some fixes I tries several different times. Like making a different admin account for Windows Live... I tried that one... I actually made 8 different seperate Windows live accounts all of which I had to create a new e mail for (talk about time consuming and boring). I also tried several file change ups file rearrangements and other different fixes that people said would work. Finally aftera whole day of sitting at my computer and waisting time I had determined that I wouldn't stand for anymore of the bull $hit that I was putting myself through. I grabbed my keys walked out of my house (slamming every door behind me) got in my car and raced like a demon to my local Best Buy to purchase a physical copy of GTA V. It didn't help when the young girl said that they were out of it and I had to drive 9 miles to the next closest Best Buy. After I had the box in my hand I quicky returned home and opened the box only to realise that the game was 7 discs... SEVEN DISKS!!! There goes another couple of hours (or it seemed like it anyways). Finally when the game finished I logged into Rockstar Socialclub (with a new account to be safe) and crossed my fingers. It worked but now I had to wait another hour for Rockstar to upload a new update. When all is said and done my solution of buying a hard copy worked. GTA V is absolutely gorgeous at 4K resolution and 60fps... Only when it decides to work though. I have a high end system that well exceeds the suggested specs... Majorly well exceeds! My system runs perfect. I 3dmark my rig every other day and manualy defrag each hard drive every 2 days. I download all of my music. movies and anything other than games on my laptop. I have never had a problem with any game running at ultra or super high specs... NEVER! GTA V is the first game that has given me any type of trouble. Believe me... When the game is running it is beautiful and unlike anything I have ever experienced in a game. The are no glitches and it runs smooth as butter. Like I said... This is when it runs. GTA V decides to crash on me a lot. It usually happens right after I complete a mission when the game trys to auto save... Boom... Like clock work! Usually I'll play a mission it will crash. I will replay the mission it will save. I will play the next mission and it will crash again! Its a pattern! As for everything else... The controls are tight (almost too tight in 1st person driving mode) Super sensative The wind blows and you are moving across 3 lanes of traffic! 1st person feels like it is right at home. It's comparable to good fps titles. The graphics are amazing and anyone with the capabilities of 4K res at 60fps is gonna be in video game heaven! everything looks so real. Especially the lighting and shadow effects. The pier at night is extraordinary with it's glowing neon boardwalk. I am sure that when all of the bugs are fixed that this game will be well worth $60 but right now? Unless you are a complete diehard GTA fan and do not care about hassles bugs and glitches as long as you get to play GTA V even a little bit I wouldn't but it. I am a diehard GTA fan so to me it was worth it. Ill continue to play through the crashes and eventuall it will hopefully be fixed. Thank God Steam refunded me my money back though! If that didn't happen I would have been extremely heated! I do understand what it is like now to spend money on a game and the game not working... At ALL! I will no longer judge others who gripe and get really mad when something like that happens. It was an awful experience that I hope never happens again. You just feel so damn cheated and jipped. Like no one cares that you spent your hard earned cash for nothing. It's a feeling I will never forget.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-20,0,0,9,False,Recommended,I'm leaving a thumbs up even though it won't do anything against the overwhelming tide of hate toward the publisher and misguided anger toward the developer. The truth is that the game is still fantastically entertaining and fun. I played it like crazy on the Xbox and got it on sale after upgrading to a gaming PC.What the angry reviewers should be upset about is players abusing the support for mods in the online area of the game. It's not like take two's goal was to limit players enjoyment of their product their decision was based on the opposite protecting players who go online and legitimately want to enjoy the game. The people who ruined it for everyone are the people your childish outrage should be directed toward.As for a review of the game The multiplayer offers a huge amoung of gameplay with entertaining and fun characters and enough diversity in gameplay to keep it fresh for the majority of the story. The multiplayer is intensely fun as well with races deathmatch gunfights custom cars and a vast selection of weapons. If you think the multiplayer would have been better with people breaking the game and ruining your good time then I suppose you should pass on it until Take Two lets those tools back into the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

It was just an awesome action packed fairy tale of a repo gone wrong a jewelry store heist and a mission to fight the FIB and Merryweather. I chose ending C for the final mission. I couldn't kill my buds. When they pushed Devin down that bastard cliff from the hell that he came from I realized that was the end. (Yeah when I saw the credits.) I was just devastated. I just sat in my chair and watched the credits roll by. That was it. I just felt empty like the list of story missions left. What was I going to do now? I thought the campaign would be long as all balls like GTA IV or maybe even a story as long as Just Cause 2 or something. But no it was just gone. And the rest of the stuff I had on GTA V undone was just Strangers and Freaks. It was over. $60 to feel sad. Worth it. And after all that...I just felt...I had to do something about it.

2017-06-26,0,0,36,False,Recommended,So for anyone who wants the game but is unsure about getting it now thanks to everyone ing at Take Two for getting rid of modding I will review the actual game not the media surrounding it. At full price the game is worth it. You will have hours upon hours of fun in the story and open world of the game with one of the best stories I have ever seen in a game with loads to do like missions kill contracts and jobs with three great characters that each have their own special ability which makes playing a mission with all three at once swapping between them really awesome. Once you have finished the story and even the side missions you can still do things in the world lile the many Easter eggs actaully go hunting as there is wildlife such as deer in the forests or explore and create chaos and destruction. The online is next. Online brings all the chaos guns cars missions and world of GTA and let's it go wild with regular updates that give more missions vehicles and weapons like a yatch tommy guns the latest cars and even the ability to create your own business empire or biker gang. These are all done with the chaos of other real people around you! Finally modding. Modding has now been kind of unbanned now thanks to Rockstar telling Take Two to basically calm down so you can mod in single player. These mods are great and almost everything is possible from train constructors to Ian man jesus to turning into prostitutes! The list goes on (I've even seen a fishing mod and a truck driver mod). Permanently fps is also good as the game is quite easy to run. Lastly online progression is grest and unlike previous GTA titles progression saves and you can have houses cars and a character that is linked to your rockstar account through all platforms of the game. These are all the positives with GTA 5. The negatives are few but worth mentioning Which are basically the first person sucks to be honest and the fov for it is bad a the highest walking around with a controller feels bad (not from a pc master race perspective but it always feels delayed on the pc and multiple consoles i have played it on on different monitors and tvs) online is full of s who kill you for no reason although there are private online lobbies the activities you can do are limited and because of online character progression you can't mod online at all. Finally money isnt the easiest to get unless you have 3 friends who have high end apartments to do the hiests with or spend ages grinding online missions. Shark cards are the only micro transaction you can buy and its real money for in game money. Finally the loading times are long. Like really long so if you have an SSD use it!To conclude if you liked old GTA titles or like the look of this game then it won't let you down with its awesome story great amount of content beautiful world and good online with regular content drops. No fake trailers all is what you can do and its great to experience. Yes there are some downsides but no game is perfect (this is pretty close) and yes my time in game isnt the highest but offline steam hours and the hundreds of hours in the ps4 version may re assure you that this game is worth spending your money on especially if you have three friends to do the hiests races drug raids car theft bikers missions and blowing up then going to the beach on a BMX after a hard day of destruction and riding the big wheel. When you have this game 98% of the time you are laughing having fun and the 2% is the complaining and long loading times. Mainly the 2% is the loading times.Well i think that is all of it so go enjoy yourself in GTA and i hope no feminist comes and has ago at you for hitting strippers with baseball bats... or was it running them over?

2017-06-30,0,0,663,False,Recommended,"Having mixed feelings about this game is an understatement. Grand Theft Auto 5 is an amazing game... if you are playing mainly singleplayer. GTA 5 has an amazing story mode with memerable missions and characters it has a huge living world from downtown Los Santos to Paleto Bay this game showcases a world you want to be lost in. That being said there is a Mature rating for a reason this game pushes the boundries on what is acceptible and what is excessive when it comes to explicit content. That being said it is normal for a GTA game to do this I think people should thouroughly looking to this sort of content beflore buying. Besides that I promise that this will be a story you will never forget.Online Oh OnlineGTA Online is a completely seperate part from the games story where you make a character and play in a fully multiplayer ""expirience"" the main problem with online is its money system. Rockstar seems to make everything expensive almost out of reach to a casual player who does not want to endlessly grind heists to make money. Now you could just buy shark cards which allow you to just buy in game money but this on top of the 60$ (unless on sale) price tag you pay at the start. Its not worth it to play for online no wonder there is so many hackers.Modding NOTE As of now modding is at a stand still I do not know what is going on but last I heard was that Take Two (Rockstar parent company) had banned an essential tool to mod GTA 5 if modding is fine then read below if not just skip it.Modding is amazing in gta 5 just as its been in other gta games mods are relitively easy to install and open limit less oppertunitys (no steam workshop support but easy to install) you can add veichles new models weapons anything is possible.Conclusion I am recomending Grand Theft Auto 5 because of its amazing story which could be on its own and still worth it. The endless fun you can have in this game is something that should be enjoyed by everyone. Online is terrible it is a cash grab way to squeeze money out of gamers with more and more expensive updates whatever happened to a single player DLC? If modding is working then it is another reason to get the game as it provides even more gameplay to this beautiful game. 9/10 Story Nothing short of amazingOnline $hit avoid at all costsModding Endless fun to an already amazing game",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-09,0,0,291,False,Recommended,Despite the immense amounts of negative feedback this game has received recently and the cancerous YouTube communinty that surrounds it. I'd say this game is still worth purchasing if you like to play with friends online. It has fun gameplay a vareity of different activitys to do and not to mention an amazing open world. Even if multiplayer isn't of any interest to you you can still play the amazing single player aspect of the game. And with the return of modding after the whole fiasco over its legality that is there even more content to enjoy. Overall if you are in a position to buy this game I suggest you do. Thank you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,0,0,174,False,Recommended,GTA V is a really chilled game and if you have some friends who are willing to play a lot of heists and missions or just destroy everyone in the map with their tanks then you should definetely consider getting this game.Even if you have played offline and you finished the game you still have the option to play online and compete against other players get money buy properties clothes etc...GTA V has one downside however the loading screens are really slow and players do get bored of the game due to that factor.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-31,0,0,150,False,Recommended,Update This game is very agravating when trying to play online. The little bit of it I have managed to play seemed ok but it kept disconnecting on me. In addition the game crashed and locked up in the online mode. If it could keep from disconnecting/crashing and requireing reboots several times a hour it might be fun. As is the online is frustrating junk. I recomend the game for single player mode but if you are only interested in the online mode don't bother it sucks.This game is amazing. I only have a few gripes.1) The side view mirrors and rearview mirrors don't actually reflect anything which makes driving in first person a little more difficult. 2)Selecting the weapon type and then selecting the weapon in the type is a little overly complicated and slow.Now that is done what is awesome1) First Person VIew!2) Keyboard and mouse control. This is the bet controling GTA game ever.I'm having a blast playing the story mode in single player again before playing the online portion. The control is precise enough that the game feels like a FPS now. This is the gold standard for open world games now.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,5,5,186,False,Recommended,Grand theft auto 5 is a game that came out late 2013 and was comerically successful with 800 million dollars and over 11 million copies. While the media made gta 5 look bad which of course it is it's 18+ but that didn't stop the amount of sales and money Rockstar and T2 earned. Grand theft auto 5 is much different from the previous titles with 3 playable characters! This was a huge difference considering you played as one character in previous games. The three characters are called Trevor Micheal and Franklin. The 3 characters are very unique and the story is action packed! You rob trains and banks you also interrogate a man while you torture him! Believe me this game's story feels like one of those action movies where sh*t goes down!Grand theft auto 5's gameplay is same old same old but with a new change. Each character has a unique thing they can do for a minute. Micheal can slow down time to shoot heads easier Trevor can become invincible to protect him during fights and Franklin has a slow down driving time which also makes you turn sharper during the use of your unique ability. Police starts have also been reduced to 5 instead of the classic 6 but don't worry the AI for police is much harder than gta 4's donut munchin' pigs these policeman will try to stop you no matter how many of them drop! Another thing in the gameplay is first person for the newer copies for Xbone PS4 and of course PC. The first person is fun for stabbing people with machetes!grand theft auto 5's multiplayer is quite fun you can own a moterbike club office and now a bunker! Let's not forget about houses. GTAO has great hiests you can do with friends for that $$$ and RP if only I knew what JP stood for... But there's always bad in the good and there's no exception for GTAO. GTAO experiences alot of modders script kiddies if you will whom download script hook and mod menus to make your visit on GTAO living hell. You can expect them to drop money on you to ban you for modded money blow you up steal your weapons steal your GT and blow everyone up under that name so people report you they just HATE fun.Overall Grand theft auto V's single player is fantastic! I give it 10/10 great for replayability! I can't say much for GTAO without modders I give it a 7/10 as it is fun but it's basically the same as singleplayer but with other players. But with modders a 5/10. They just make it terrible and even then it's Rockstar's fault for not investing in better anti cheat software to keep them out.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-16,0,0,73,False,Recommended,I absolutely love the story and multiplayer aspect of this game. This is one of the best games ever. There are so many moments to be made online and offline.

2015-05-26,0,0,53,False,Recommended,All the way from 2007 and still going strong. When I say ''going strong'' I usually like to think so in the community workshop and hat section. But on a serious note this game is absolutely sensational and what's the best of it now? Well it's totally free and definitely deserves the quote ''the most fun you can have online.'' PC Gamer.The game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against each class kind of like a ''rock paper scissors'' thing. The fast Boston talking and even more fast running Scout to the towering minigun wielding hulk of a Russian man Known as Heavy. Though every character class usually represents a soldier in a common FPS' of some sort what I love about this is the fact that Valve has openly breathed life vibrant personalities characteristics and nationalities into this rag tag bunch. I also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories named after the witty puns possibly the slight descrimination and referenced culture of that said character. Really brings out the comedic flare of the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in with entertainment.Another great thing to note in this game is the fact that it's holiday themed. Either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday down to the newly cashed in fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both Valve and the original creator at hand. Halloween Christmas Easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the game's growing campaign and community.I definitely recommend this game. Not just down to the fact that it's free but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive making the game overall timeless.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-14,0,0,140,False,Recommended,By now I think most people know how GTA plays so I won't go into that too much. What I will say is the online and offline play offers vastly different but excellent gameplay opportunities. The online multiplayer is one of the better sandboxes on the market that you can enjoy with friends. Freeroam around the entirety of the map and get up to all sorts of shenanigans with dozens of players. You also have the option of playing matchmade game modes like standard DM TDM races and a whole slew of special game modes. Some of my favourites Stunt races where you're basically on hot wheels tracks and hunting pack where you have one player playing as the driver of a car that'll explode if it goes too slowly and others trying to either stop them or get them to their destination.The single player campaign still remains one of my favourite stories in a while because it really makes you feel the fantasy of planning and pulling off major heists. Some scenes feel straight out of the Italian Job or Ocean's 11. The characters are memorable and not always for good reasons. You'll figure that out yourself pretty early. These are not nice people. There's a reason why this game has sold so many copies. Give it a try the next time it's on sale or you're drunk and want to spend money. You'll be glad you did.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-15,0,0,1634,False,Recommended,"Wow. Holy fkn wow. Wtf is wrong with you people? There is literally NOTHING shady about what Rockstar did. They are not greedy corporate fat cats trying to con their PC customers out of their hard earned money. If any of you actually even glanced at the bundles being offered as part of the Summer Sale rather than just regurgitating the mindless uninformed braying of the masses because it's ""trendy"" right now you would see that Rockstar is actually going out of their way to participate in the Summer Sale even though the game has only been out for 2 months and can't really be offered at a discounted price. They didn't raise the price of the game to create the illusion of a sale and rob us all. The game is simply not on sale because sane business practices dictate that it CAN'T be (yet). But in an effort to once again show their support for the PC community they're offering new customers a FREE Great White Shark Card. That's 1.25 million GTA$ (a $20 value) which is a wonderful head start in the online mode. Rockstar even anticipated that some gamers wouldn't care about free GTA$ so they offered not one but TWO additional bundle options where new customers can get an older R* AAA title AND still get some GTA$ all at no extra cost. They didn't have to do any of this just like they didn't have to put so much extra work into making the PC version of their game the ultimate version. They could have simply released a version identical to current gen console versions with 4k support and it still would've been a top seller. I see a lot of you posting that you are ""done with R*"" and that you won't be buying any future R* releases as you add to the cacaphony of pathetic herd mentality whining and zealous false accusations based on someone else's unfounded opinion that even if it had merit does not negate the fact that this is one of the greatest video games ever created. However I don't think you'll even have to worry about following through with your threats and angry promises because there is no way R* will be releasing the definitive version of their future games on PC. We'll be lucky to even see half ports after the utter lack of gratitude or appreciation they've received from you clowns with your over developed senses of entitlement and complete inablitliy to think for yourselves. Yuck! You should all be ashamed of yourselves.THAT BEING SAID Why the sucking are hackers still running rampant in GTA Online? This issue is not a minor nuisance Rockstar. GTA Online is nothing short of broken and totally unplayable until this madness is resolved and since Online is almost inarguably the #1 reason to buy this game this should absolutely be your top priority. Who cares about DLC releases if you can't even play the game? If GTA V has to lose all support for community created mods/content for the time being so be it! If the current wielder of the R* Banhammer is too timid to do what needs to be done hand it off to someone who is not afraid to teach these hacker fools a thing or two about a thing or two! Rules is rules for fk's sake! Unless of course they're not in which case you should just say so so us few remaining honest players can stop waiting for a return to the good ol' days and try to scrape some enjoyment out of joining the lawless freakshow madhouse that the sandbox of Los Santos has become with mods/trainers of our own.I suppose since this should technically be a review of the game and not a rant I should mention that even the last gen version of both Online and Single Player receive a 10/10 from me. With all of the improvements extra layers of polish and additional content that the PC version brings to the table the only suitable rating (pre hacker plague or post hacker purge mind you) is ""Masterpiece."" Even if you've already put hundreds of hours into this game on a last gen console like I did I still highly recommend you buy it on PC as well especially if your rig allows you to turn on all the bells and whistles in the graphics settings. Bravo Rockstar. You've truly outdone yourselves this time. Thanks for the love and the awesome game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-15,0,0,717,False,Recommended,"What to say it s GTA after GTA IV being a severe step backwards (compared to S.A.) V is a good step in the right direction. GTA online is fun although it could do with more complex missions because Heists aside most missions are pretty generic and repetetive... with a few friends alot of fun non the less... hopefully R* Games keeps on adding stuff and not just vehicles but missions that go more towards the story mode missions...maybe they could transfer those to the online mode... On the technical side I am amazed how well it runs on my overaged PC (Athlon II x4 640 8GB Ram GTX 470) and still looks beautyful on ""normal"" to ""low"" settings... I can only imagine how stunning it will look when finally my new system arrives by the end of this year... TL/DR GTA as GTA should be with the addition of an (improvable) online mode that offers quite some fun for a few friends... p.s. hackers are there but luckily you can avoid and pretty much ignore them if you so wish...",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,0,0,163,False,Recommended,Rating Awesome 8/10GTA 5 as its predecessors its a high profile game where Rockstar clearly spend lots of time and money to create an ultimate gaming experience. However there is couple goods and bads that i will point out in this review and hopefully you guys can make your own mind wether the game deserves your hard worked $$$ or perhaps its better to spend it somewhere else. I will make couple references to Watch Dogs as comparisment where appropriate. As most of the future GTA 5 PC players most likely played that game which set a really good standard in my opinion when it comes to open world games in this genre.Graphics 8/10R* did a great job to create good visual effects. Settings plate with lots of variety of options will leave you speechless. Starting where you can regulate density of cars pedestrians to even tessalation or antialaising. Anything rain snow sunshine looks extremly real and you will be positively blown away.On the downside even that it is a high quality decent graphics a much better been already shown in other similar game Watch Dogs in my opinions which frankly require a much powerful rig to run it on high settings than GTA 5.Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is very stable and realistic. I used to play a lot Watch Dogs in the past and Watch Dogs was a very dynamic game where you literally could go full commando mode very high paced combat movements driving parkour skills etc. I dont have the same feeling here in GTA 5. As said earlier the game is very realistic that feels like a time slows down a bit while comparing it to WD. It still maintain the same pace as GTA 4 had so people who jumped straight from GTA 4 to GTA 5 will feel like at home. But as a GTA fan i certainly found no issues with switching. The combat however looks very simple i seriously think that R* could use mechanics that were present in Max Payne 3.But then again...who would buy MP3 then...Atmosphere/Story/Feeling/Screenplay 7/10I dont quite find myself well in GTA 5 world. Although there is a strong interaction and history between a player and ingame characters the game lacks some kind of signature touch that were present in for example Alan Wake or Max Payne 2 (both made by Remedy and MP2 with R* partnership) where actually developers created a world that was highly interactive such as stopping by a screen to watch a video scary music played etc. I really miss that here. But i guess its me. For all others who came purely for action robbing banks and ranking up in crime society it will be a heaven.Music 10/10Both in game radio stations cutscene and ambience music and sounds are great. Huge variety of genres to listen to R* never failed here. Amazing job. And of course own mp3 radio station. Cant wait for Frag Radio plugin )Final thoughts As a next installment in GTA generation the game delivers the high quality game which you will enjoy for hours. I hope my review will be me helpful to you to decide wheter you should get the game. But i will say this That game should be on your bucket list for sure.,Grand Theft Auto V

First person view Vast open world and a lot of random sh*t happening in game. Cars are fun to modify 3 Characters Online multiplayer I find the graphics a bit better than PS4 version (which i have played hours and hours on) Rockstar Editor and Director mode are really fun to use to make random videos and clips Keyboard and Mouse seem more fun to use than the Controllers. No more ""SUPER AUTO lock on"" in multiplayer mode if using keyboard. Sessions can be played with other players who use the keyboard and mouse. More fun in shoot outs when there is no lock on function The game itself has life and constantly has something for you to do and pushes you to want to do stuff.Cons MODS The reason I bought this game was mainly for the crazy and even stupid mods and after reading tons of reviews on getting banned for modding and perma bannnn on online mode. I dont even want to risk it. After seeing that rockstar apparently is trying to get rid of modding entirely What does this mean? that MODS in game even in singleplayer will result in some consequence? (correct me if im wrong) The point I'm getting at though is these mods are amazing. Some of them help make the game experience more real and ""fuller."" For example the FOV mod talk going around the forums Creating FOV mod will allow more options for the FOV which will make the FIRST PERSON VIEW!! feel real. As mentioned in one of the forums driving in firstperson would be a lot better if you could see a little more off the windshield and maybe even the side mirror. Maybe rockstar should view this kinds of mods as what improvements could be done within the game Better FOV a little bit faster cars AN ACTUAL USE FOR THE GAS STATION BESIDE ROBBING THE STORE... HAHAHA. Maybe a collaboration between rockstar and players could allow us to use mods under their supervison. Maybe submitting possible mods to rockstar and they choose whether to allow it or not is another way. Maybe even allowing or creating a separate server for mods or even an option that allows you to create a session with mods on could be another way to allow for mods to happen. Maybe rockstar can place a punkbuster kinda thing on servers that detects players who use cheats that affect like that stats and healthbars damage ammo etc. ....just giving some ideas that could help... Idk if any of these are possible but its really disappointing that there is this difficulty with mods. OVERALL It's a fantastic game but what could make it even better is being held back by some dispute on modding content. The mods from old GTA games were amazing and I'd love to see that again in GTA V. to some extent this whole dilemma pushes me to just find a pirated copy of the game and use that and mod it like crazy then hope that some private server is created to handle the GTA online mode eventually which allows modding via submission to the ADMIN or what not...",Grand Theft Auto V

This game is beyond any rating as you can see from all of my favorite game reviews it is beyond any rating possible. I played and made it to 100 % on every platform except for PC . So many hours I've spent getting my 100 % checklist all the collectibles exploring every single corner of the game it is just amazing.So many good memories from this game I even skipped school when it was out on PS3 and would fake a sick day just to play it. ing amazing how they've done this game.I have done everything possible in this game. Covered every corner of the map on foot in the air and even underwater. Got a platinum on my PS4 which is my favorite platinum of all time and the proudest one I have. So many hours of my life are dedicated to this game and it's worth it every second.The game is greatly optimized and have one of the best graphics available at the moment. Rockstar took care from what they did to L.A. Noire and GTA 4 and made it the same way they did to Max Payne 3 which is optimized aswell. Great gameplay stunning graphics and effects great sounds and music in the game and radio also do not forget all the online features and free DLC's that come out as an update.Rockstar you really did a great job here and I am going to re write history once again on PC ),Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-23,0,0,1031,False,Recommended,"all of the people who are talking about rockstar's ""shoddy sales practices"" are out of their minds. let's be real here this highly anticipated release on the PC platform made its debut just 2 months ago I wouldn't put my game on sale either and many other game developers also did not choose to participate in the summer sale. rockstar went out of their way to do something that they didn't have to do and threw a normally $20 shark card (worth $1.25m in in game currency) in with the purchase of a full price game for the summer sale. i encouraged my friends who had not purchased this game to do so now while the shark card was still part of the sale. there is nothing wrong at all with what rockstar did y'all are just a bunch of greedy gamers.with that said over 230 hours i've got in this game over the past 2 months (a large majority of that time spent in online mode but i've more recently begun playing through the story mode) allows me to make judgement of my opinion of this game of which I opine that the game is incredible. rockstar has honestly hit a grand slam with everything they've done for GTA V. the car selection and customization is impressive and allows us to express ourselves exactly as we please. the world is large and i'm finding new things about the map every time I play. the heists are fun and rewarding however I wish there were more (as of when I write this there's only 5). missions are fun to do when you can't find anything else to do and when you get tired of those (at least as someone who spends most of their time in online mode) you can always fall back on story mode where you can either play through the story or just mess around with the giant open world. i plan to put many more hours of gameplay into this especially with all of the free content that rockstar is providing us (ill gotten gains part 1 just released a week or two ago with insinuation that there will be more installments in the future). never change rockstar i expect you to effortlessly continue to impress me.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-17,0,0,29,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is infinitely fun infinitely great and massive in both single player and multiplayer modes. If you have a capable PC to run it then it should be the first game you need to buy. Runs smoothly at 60+ fps on my 1080ti with all graphics settings set to ultra at 4k resolution and I'm sure it runs well on 1070 and 1080 cards too. The single player story is mind blowing and unforgettable. You can play multiple characters in game not just one. This game is Rockstar's gift to mankind and should win many more awards on top of the 35 it already won! The only thing it's lacking at the moment is native VR (virtual reality) support. I have a HTC Vive and would love to play it in VR.,Grand Theft Auto V

After 800 hours in game I still find little jokes by the devs. Pay attention to all the little details in the game. From billboards to conversations by NPC's. The game is stuffed with funny moments. Oh yes and there are cars. Lot's of super awesome cars. Big cars small cars fast cars slow cars sleek cars ugly cars. Anybody can find their own dream car in the game.GTA Online is still receiving new content for free. Since release there have been several large expensions. Lots of new cars and lots of ways to earn money. Some players might be a bit overwhelmed with the current range of stuff you can buy. For those players I would advise to just take your time and play around untill you know what you want. There is a lot to chose from and you will need to focus a bit to make sure you can effectively earn more money to buy all those sweet cars.Community can be a bit toxic and the game actively encourages griefing. The Single Player is a bit lacking Online is where the fun is.Edit Oh yes there is currently a storm going on as the publisher decided to end the possibility to mod the single player game hence the downvotes and silly comments.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-11,2,1,198,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. I play it on med/high/very high on a GTX 780 and an i5 4690k and get a constant smooth 50 60 FPS. The game's online features are constantly being improved and new content is added very often. My only problem is the hackers. They will do god mode for example and just go on a rampage. They also throw countless bags of money at you which takes the fun out of the game. The single player. Oh my god the single player. It is AMAZING. You take the roles of 4 characters. Michael DeSanta Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips. Each one of these characters has a different backstory and their own special traits. Michael for example can slow down time while in a gunfight to turn the tides of a firefight. Franklin can slow down time while driving which can lead to some pretty awesome stunts. Trevor can go on a rampage with increased health and damage and just mow through his enemies. I could go on but I don't have that kind of time. Hands down the best game I have ever played.10/10PERFECT SCORE!! D,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,429,False,Recommended,Looking past some of the crashing bugs of the game GTA V is an amazing game in my opinion. The graphics are great the story mode is pretty interesting as well. GTA Online however is amazing. I love the newly added heists in Online as well as the vehicles I also like the fact they brought in the first person mode from Next Gen. I feel as though GTA V was a serious improvement to the GTA series. The three players in story mode (Micheal Trevor and Franklin) added to that. There's so much to do in GTA both story and Online that I don't think it could be covered in a single year. It was well worth the $60 and the 59.1 GB download. 10/10 For me.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-23,1,1,490,False,Recommended,Let me preface this review by saying that in no way is your experience of GTA going to be ruined by the option of buying shark cards. Shark cards are just useless things you can buy for a little boost if you want to but are nearly useless and a waste of money. Money that you can easily earn through doing heists and adversary modes.Now that that's out of the way let me list some pros and cons.Pros (single player) Extremely well put together Voice acting is incredible (they even got real gang members to voice some of the in game gang members) Consistent storyline one that makes you feel like it's almost real and happening right now. Immersive characters. I honestly felt oddly attached to each character by the end of the story. Cons (single player) Sometimes (kind of rarely) AI may glitch out during a mission and cause a mission failure. Saving the game can be very clunky and odd to do at some points. Pros (Multiplayer) Very very fun with friends and fun making new ones too. Easy to pick up and learn you really can't be outmatched by a high level player as long as you're skilled and have a gun. Very fun and rewarding heists. The most recent heists to come out the doomsday heist was extremely fun in my opinion and really showed what R* can do with this heist concept. Easy to level up and earn cash if you're doing heists and adversary modes often. Endless replayability. Cons (multiplayer) Sometimes hackers can be a bother whether it be by turning on god mode and slumping you or dropping unwanted cash on you. This can really just be avoiding by joining a new session. Barely any cash can be made unless you're doing heists adversary modes and running supplies so if you're planning on hopping into online and getting some good cars and stuff instantly you might wanna be ready to grind a little. Pros (general) Beautifully put together world amazing graphics and attention to detail. You don't need a great computer to run it. I used to have a nVidia 840m (kinda eh gpu) and could run this game at medium 50 60 fps. Gunplay driving and flying mechanics and controls are smooth and responsive. Cons (general) Sometimes walking and climbing mechanics can be odd but that's easily overlooked and not that big of a deal. My final review Single player 9.5/10Multiplayer 8.5/10Gameplay mechanics 9/10Graphics 10/10 (it's a 2013 game that looks better than some 2017 games ffs)Replayability 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,326,False,Recommended,"despite the issue with the removal of OpenIV this is actually a fun game. Without mods it has enough single player content to last you a while. If you decide to dive into GTA Online I learned that the best way to make money is to play with friends and play normally. Don't focus on buying multiple houses as you will learn fast that you can live out of a CEO Office. People claim that it's hard to make money but when you're playing with friends running missions and laughing at the stupid ways your friends died in game you don't realize how much you're making. Those giving negative ratings are following the mindset that OpenIV becoming illegal are doing so because it's their main source of fun. People like to be creative with what the game can do with mods but you can't change the mind of a multi billion dollar company by sinply saying ""We don't like you anymore.""I recommend you get this game. Have fun with it make some friends and don't stress over other players.

2015-04-20,1,6,308,False,Not Recommended,Made PC gamers wait two years and pay $60 and the game runs like 10/10.In detail The game is extremely VRAM hungry and has a few settings that eat up almost all the VRAM leaving no room for anything else making anybody with 2 GB or less VRAM play with PS3 grade textures and minimal render distance. IF you do turn it up to high settings you will get 60 FPS but with a lot of frame drops and if anything explodes or shoots at something the game will lock up until everything is over.In conclusion Overpriced poorly optimized overall the technicals of this game are very poor. you Rockstar.Edit It appears that the game has a memory leak issue right now. I will stick by my opinion until the leak is fixed.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-11-23,9,34,174,False,Recommended,"Tell me did you ever dream of a game called ""Simulator of Life"" in your dreams? No it's not about glamorous Sima are you dreaming about a game that would be a copy of real life with all its capabilities and freedoms? Where you can wake up watch a couple of minutes of TV then put on a suit and go to work then go to the bar skip one by one and finish the day with a beauty company. And tomorrow everything will turn completely differently. Surely yes. GTA5 a fundamental continuation of the series which is a perfect example of joint creative work of designers scriptwriters and programmers. Obviously the task of the authors was to transfer the user on the other side of the screen where the player gets so involved in the role of the character that he does not distinguish himself from it. GTA5 put everything in its place once again demonstrating to everyone a real sign of quality. Developers from Rockstar unconditional leaders and real geniuses in the field of the concept created by them. Each new part of the series raises the bar to a new level is it really that after GTA5 there will still be unconquered heights?

2015-06-11,0,0,61,False,Recommended,What can you say? ITS M*****F***** GTA V WHY ARE YOU READING THIS!? GO PLAY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!Now for the rest of us who have purchased and already enjoyed this game on a console but are pondering is this worth it? No f*** no you've already played this game so unless you get lucky and catch it on sale this game will NEVER be worth the money if you've already bought it once. In my opinion this is simply an ingenius preplanned scheme of RockStar's to turn the success of V into a sort of crowdfunding exercise for their next titles. Now cynicism aside should you still do it to treat yourself? Probably.Chances are my reader if you thinking about it then you're thinking about it for the same reasons that I did. End game graphics for all versions of V(so far and yes they are something to enjoy especially in first person on the PC) features not seen in even newer console versions(don't quote me but I think someone mentioned to me wildlife or something is beefed up for the PC version for one example seems like it compared to PS3 at least but then so is everything else) as mentioned above but worth its own spot First person mode. Real game changer(obviously) for the title and especially if you're like me and went from PS3/360 to PC. The first person mode of the game is unique for what it is and a great addition to the game that really does warrant at least borrowing the title from someone to play it again all in first person. Finally I have to mention multiplayer. Multiplayer along with the modding community can not be challenged on the PC it is an entirely different beast of a game once you're able to just type a message to another player for example in a heart beat. So not only is it FAR more convienent than the console counterparts of the game but from my experience so far it is way more stable( probably just due to a PC running it) and performs/loads a lot smoother as well. In short the experience online is not just a frusterating mess that I'm so used to I actually have to remind myself not to bother going for a coffee break when I'm joining a friends map. Performance wise as well compared to GTA IV's history this game shows none of the same symptoms that plauged IV's enjoyability factor. It looks great runs great and I haven't had it crash or lock up on me once(yet). I can also confirm that on both ATI/Nvidia bit older and brand new components the above statement holds true. Oh and in case your wondering when you transfer your character over it clones them from your old console. You can still go back and play with friends just nothing crosses over progress wise between different platforms once you've transferred.,Grand Theft Auto V

This game is just tons of fun off and online mod even when it comes to single player it just wouldn't be right that they took it down but i'm glad they resolved the situation and brought the mods back. Otherwise where would youtubers go for fun on Gta. So thank you Critics and fans for resovling this situation,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-24,1,1,696,False,Not Recommended,unbalanced AI with auto aim and rapidfire burst at certain times that immediately kill you without warning and online is OVER POWERED! with heavy weapons and cheap perks like quad damage. not really a fair game like gta 4. if they tried keeping modders out of gta 4 like they were trying gta v (not working btw) then the gta 4 would be alive still and much more fluid and fun. gta v lacks the sand box roam around like previous gtas. you dont wanna die because it secretly takes away 500 from your ban k account and does not matter anyways because you are soo fragile in this game you die by falling or getting tapped by a police car. not to mention 1 shotgun hit from AI is an instant kill on you. i just feel like rockstar does not do anything to balance out the game and combat in free aim and weapons are stupid in general. why? weapons like mgs and ARs kick too much to get accurate shots even with grips. the dot just bounces everywhere. and the fact that everyone uses RPGs and sticky bombs in deathmatch just proves it yet makes deatmatches unfun and unbalanced with RPGs and stickybombs and heavy snipers. let alone the SMGs have a range limit. far away police helicopters or players are less likely to die with an SMGs even if you get clean headshots. so for the fact that SMGs have clean aim. its ruined by the distance taking away damage. but not on AI. they can still drain your health from 300 feet away with something like an AK 47. so in my opinion. since the weapons are unplayable and other players can run around and stickybomb you as soon as you get out of bennys garage. i dont recommend this game. people will say passive mode. but why couldn't they make a friendly free roam like gta 4 and red dead redemption? we begged for it for years and it still has not arrived. its because they added stupid spits between aim assist which require different servers. and they would need way more servers for a aim assist and friendly free roam. they should have made it like red dead redemption though. in red dead redemption you could just select your aiming choice IN friendly free roam. passive mode you get screwed over because when cops shoot at you. you cannot attack back there for your a animal getting hunted down basically. unless you turn off passive mode and risk a player jumping in to try to kill and annoy you. and dont say go into private sessions because that is not an excuse of why they lack friendly free roam. point is because of these types of things gta v is boring for me. and when i see another rockstar game released like gta 6 or RDR 2 im jumping on there and unstalling gta v. maybe if they fixed AI auto aim range and made the characters more buff to withstand bullets. AND had friendly free roam so players cant randomly attack me when im relaxing. then id enjoy this game. but for now its a wreck. not recommended in MY OWN OPINION.,Grand Theft Auto V

As i play this game properly in both single player and online ( Doesn't use mod at all ) And yes there are still hacker in this game but everytime i encounter i will either leave the server immediately or use nvidia shadowplay to record it to prevent i get banned or at least have evidence to show them So if i get banned 'falsely' rockstar will ban the motherfxcking hacker as well. Use your common sense then you wouldn't get banned. And for the case for those people who use those like discord blablabla...I wouldn't said it is completely your fault but seriously tho this game allowed you to use mic why would you even need to use those? You could even choose who to talk also in the interaction menu. Are you really that lazy to change that small thing? About shark card? I get it when i bought this game with the summer sale. I got it immediately. If you don't have thats your problem and do you even tried to email or contact them with provided evidence? If not dont complaint here. You are just wasting everyone time reading your stupid review. Lastly for those who complaint the community is toxic or whatever Just get good bro. Thats all i can said.

Loosen the pancake and turn it over by tossing or flipping it with a palette knife. Cook the other side for about 30 seconds until golden.

In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg.2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6.

2015-04-18,1,3,56,False,Not Recommended,Not as great a game as GTA San Andreas which has much better writing mission design wit music and most other things. GTA V is designed more to be a make your own fun game with the story and missions being more filler esque. That doesn't appeal to me as much as having the story be the main affair and made to be awesome. I want to be taken on a detailed and exciting adventure not just be given the environment for one and have it be up to me to find something interesting to do with it. Minigames and free roaming doesn't compare to scripted story telling. GTA V feels like a greatly diminished design from GTA San Andreas. I think that Rockstar needs to shift its priorities and not expect to get a free pass on its story quality.Also with GTA V the mission design has the player criss crossing the map every next mission in the most annoying way. In GTA San Andreas available missions would develop in an area close to the player. In GTA V the player has to backtrack long distances between each mission. And the missions in GTA V are bite sized largely delivery type styled. They're often pretty boring. GTA San Andreas' missions are all kinds of different things and they're pretty well thought out.GTA V is OK but if someone wants exciting story and missions GTA San Andreas is a superior source and I recommend GTA San Andreas whole heartedly. GTA V is pretty mundane in comparison.,Grand Theft Auto V

Dont waste your time swearing or raging thats what they want.

You do meet nice people who dont mind showing you around and giving you a peep at what you can get WAY down the line. I suggest approaching people without a gun drawn. If they kill you you can always have a gun out next time you meet them! If you approach unarmed I have found a lot of players dont want to be ""Tryhards"" and would rather mess around in game with you do a mission or something together.

2017-06-28,0,0,1,False,Recommended,I'm going to post something against the grain of these other reviews and say that GTA 5 is well worth it as a game. I do not own it on Steam but I own it through PS4 and Rockstar's own client.Rockstar has done right by myself and many others for the length of time I have played and despite the costs of newer DLC items they have always been courteous and willing to help. Sometimes their Customer Service can fall short but that is true of all companies.For those complaining of modders that is the unfortunate nature of PC gaming. That isn't to say they couldn't do more to prevent it but I cannot speak to the difficulty of attempting to do so.If you are looking for a game with an entertaining single player and fun online for what it is this game is well worth the money. If you happen to own a console I highly recommend getting it on one of those instead to avoid modders.,Grand Theft Auto V

After you finish the sleep inducing intro to the story and are able to save I recommend jumping right into multiplayer where the fun is really at. I have spent almost ALL my time in multiplayer from the moment I could get away from the nightmare that is single player. IF you want a good story driven experience then I recommend going to Saints Row where you can create your own character and really play the a fun and funny story. Looking for an amazing sandbox coop (or PvP if that is your thing) game for you and your mates I suggest you pick this up immediately. Despite the bad single player I give it a 9/10.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-06-28,0,0,783,False,Not Recommended,Do not buy. Rockstar is keeping this game online only because of shark cards which are the most worthless microtransaction ever and the community is almost as toxic as Battlefield and COD. It was fun up until after the Execs and other Criminals update. It went deeply downhill as GTA became nothing but a cash grab for Rockstar. Another point to add is the time it takes to get to a high level. I had over 1000 combined hours on Xbox 360 and PC on this game and I now just got to level 120. Plus rockstar makes you pay out the for any new content added to the game causing people to line the developers pockets even more with the money spent on microtransactions.2 years ago I would've recommended this game now it's just a shell of its former self. My verdict is don't buy unless under heavy discount.Update After hearing about the OpenIV takedown I feel that I should share my opinion on it as well. It just created a bigger reason on why you shouldn't shell out any money to the developer. In fact this is the only game I would actually support someone buying off of With the removal of mod creation tools I feel that Take2 has decided that the only language that they will speak is money. If you found no enjoyment in GTA Online prepare to feel no enjoyment of single player as well after completing the very short story that the game has to offer.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'll preface this by saying that I've never been a fan of GTA Online even before all this recent nonsense when down. It felt like a sloppy sloppy experience.However the single player campaign is ing great. The characters are funny and well voiced. The heists are IMO a really neat twist on the traditional missions. The visuals are fantastic. And there's a buttload of content.So if you're a GTA fan and you want to play a great new entry in the storyline get this game for sure.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's still a fun game. You can fight it out with futuristic tanks normal tanks APC's stealth helicopters attack helicopters fighter jets bomber planes flying bikes flying cars and half tracks all while running multiple multi million dollar industries that you use to fight other industries to the death.

And so if you're buying the game for no reason other than to mod it you are probably going to be disappointed. And that will likely remain the case for just about any other title. Just because it's coming out on PC doesn't mean there will be open and free mod support for all who buy in.""But they had mods for GTA IV!"" That was then this is now. Welcome to the next generation. There are some of us like myself who waited patiently for Rockstar to release this game for PC and are digging in to the experience with glee as it is all fresh content for anyone who hasn't played a GTA title since IV was released in 2008. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF CONTENT. I've played the game for 62 hours in 2 weeks...and I'm only just scratching the surface. Still scratching while the hackers and modders huff and puff about Rockstar's desire to keep their intellectual property well theirs. I trust that they don't want to ignore the potential of the modding community that surrounds GTA for PC but as it stands the game's singleplayer and multiplayer interface in a certain way very interchangably and that is a major impasse for modders as they are basically handing out the very tools that allow cheaters to do what they do. I sympathize for anyone who received a ban for ""just using mods in singleplayer "" but a few bad apples will always ruin a good time for the lot and this is a great opportunity to sit back think about it and consider how to approach your game time in a manner that not only sustains great games but treats your fellow players the developers the publishers and everyone else with the respect that you know you want to be treated with too. I hope Rockstar made themselves clear with this statement as I honestly would not mind one bit if the escalation of this punishment is a permanent ban. Clearly I have nothing to worry about why should you?",Grand Theft Auto V

Do you start with the innovative structure that gives you three independent protagonists you can switch between on the fly? Maybe you talk about the assortment of side activities you can engage in or the tremendous number of ways in which you can go about making your own fun. Or perhaps you dive right into the game s story problems or its serious issues with women. GTA V is a complicated and fascinating game one that fumbles here and there and has an unnecessary strain of misogynistic nastiness running through it. But it also does amazing things no other open world game has attempted before using multiple perspectives to put you in the thick of cinematic heist sequences and other exhilarating multi layered missions like no open world game before.,Grand Theft Auto V

Epic missions 3 characters to play as Leveling is a nice addition Plenty of side quests to do Lots of collectibles First person changes the game for the better Lengthy storyCons Repetitive mission structure for most of them Heists are lacking Not enough customization Driving could be better Game is too easy in some places/too hard in others Some variety in gameplay Unlikable characters overall/no charm to them Beats you over the head at times Holds your hand other timesOverall the single portion of this game is fantastic on PC and well worth playing once or twice. But after you're finished you need to find ways to create your own fun. Time is limited and with so many games to play you can't fully enjoy everything Los Santos has to offer.

This is Rockstar's first time doing an MMO and while GTA Online has it's moments it doesn't bring anything new to the table and frankly is too grindy. They know this and expect people to buy their overpriced ""Shark Cards"" for in game money. It's well optimized for most modern hardware and ""runs"" on lower end stuff with some user patches and tweaks.The soundtrack is something I listen to on a regular basis when I'm out and about especially the Punk and Rock stations. The hip hop is nice and the EDM sounds great. Soulwax is a great addition to the GTA world.So at the end of the day I do recommend this game to anyone who loves open world titles and wants something different from Saints Row Sleeping Dogs and Watch_Dogs. Something that grounds the rules in reality but goes outside the box to create memorable moments that will leave you with your jaw on the floor.Controversy aside Grand Theft Auto V is the best GTA yet.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-09,0,0,65,False,Recommended,The harm video games cause can be evaluated by several criteria and the most obvious among them is the negative effects they can have on physical health. Though the proponents of video gaming claim first person shooters and real time strategies sharpen reflexes increase concentration and muscle coordination in reality teenagers who spend an ample amount of time playing games experience effects that are not so beneficial.There is a possibility of the loss of sight. Spending hours on a computer or in front of a TV is one of the main causes of blurred vision among youth. In addition sacrificing healthy physical activities in favor of video gaming may become a risk factor for obesity. Gamers often do not want to interrupt their playing for meals. They eat right in front of the monitor and their rations often consist of products that can be easily cooked or eaten immediately such as crisps chocolate bars crackers or other fast foods. All this definitely does not contribute to the proper and healthy development of a young growing body.Mental health can also be affected by engaging in video games at a young age. This suggests addiction and inappropriate behavior. It is a well known fact that many gamers (especially fans of online games) suffer from addiction which is no less serious than narcomania or alcoholism. For instance in August 2005 a report surfaced about the death of a 28 year old southern Korean gamer who had spent 50 hours playing a real time strategy game (BBC). For another significant example one needs to look no further than July 2012 when a Taiwanese teenager fatally collapsed after a 40 hour game session (Crawley). Cases like these are quite numerous and happen all around the world. They make additional arguments to the negative evaluation of video games as an activity which brings harm to young people.In its turn inappropriate behavior can be caused by violence in video games. According to research children and teenagers who play violent video games tend to be more aggressive. They confront their teachers and peers more often and display a decline in academic achievements. Such psychological deviations also do not implicate video games as a constructive and useful occupation for young people (Crane).Individuals who spend excessive hours playing video games may lack the capability to distinguish between reality from fantasies. Video games often offer simplified and conditional models of environments relationships friendships and rivalries. Gamers use these models to learn to interact with the world around them and they often lack skills that would be developed by real life experience instead of the simulation (Crane). Therefore it can be implied that another negative effect caused by video games is the inability of social adaptation on the part of the gamer.It can be concluded that video games are a form of entertainment which is not suitable for children and teenagers. This assessment is based on a number of negative consequences that excessive video gaming causes. Young people who spend an inexplicable sum of hours playing video games are observed to be prone to sight loss and obesity. In addition they tend to be more aggressive than their peers who do not play video games and they experience difficulties with social adaptation. Also video games can lead to addictions that are no less serious than alcoholism or narcomania as evidenced in recent media stories reporting on deaths among inveterate video gamers. This collection of facts contributes to the negative evaluation of video games as an unwholesome activity for children and teenagers.,Grand Theft Auto V

The main storyline is a nice addition considering that you actually take your time to do the main storyline without being sidetracked from crashing into and hitting random people on the streets. In all honesty it's decently immersive and I enjoyed playing the game while going thorugh the different characters. The variety of cars whether it's sports cars or sudans is very large. The numerous improvements you can make on the cars are also a great aspect of the game. However some negative things that I would like to mention is that GTA does not have the Steam Cloud system. Basically if you change computers you have to start all over again. (you can transfer files though so it's not that bad just a slight inconvenience)The bad thing about singleplayer mode is that all the cars that you collect are not insured meaning if you lose your car then you lose it permanently. For multiplayer though you can get your car back simply by calling on your cellphone. Another thing that I did not like about singleplayer mode was that it lacked what multiplayer mode had like buying apartments buying more garages for cars etc. It seems quite open world but it lacks in simple parts of life like buying houses and land. Some buildings are not accessible but it isn't an extensive amount of buildings that it negatively affects the open world view of GTA.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-03,0,0,123,False,Recommended,"This game is FUN. Do not let these negative reviews psuade you. Those reviews are there just to get mods back and personally I'm happy for that and it worked. The game is good the people that made the negative reviews knows its good. Gameplay The gameplay overall is smooth. The gunplay is epic. The way you drive the cars/planes/helicoptors are so smooth you will find yourself just driving/flying around the city for no reason what so ever. The only con is that the ragdoll mechanic is messed up. Sometimes you can just walk into a pole and all of a sudden you'll ragdoll for 5 minutes straight.Story There is no real story to be honest. It's funny as hell though. You'll find yourself dying of laughter because of what the characters do. Sometimes you'll also find yourself saying ""That's what you get dirtbag"". Overall the story is about a 6/10.Online Online is literally the other half of the reason why Grand Theft Auto V being the most selled game on steam. It's big like really huge. You'll stay in it for hours and hours trying to grind the stuff you need. You'll even make a few friends too. The missions online though are a bit short. Heists are worth it definently. Cons to multiplayer are 2 things. Take Two is activision's little cousin. They psuade R* to basically make end game online a shark card fest. After 10 hours or so you'll find yourself doing EVEN MORE grinding then before. Thats because Take Two want you to buy shark cards. The other con is the community. Sometimes you'll join a lobby filled with people killing others on sight. You'll join modded lobbies sometime. Its almost pure rng to be put into a decent lobby.Modding Modding is fun as hell I am not that experienced in modding SINGLEPLAYER that much as there's a lot to do. Picture Garry's Mod had a better superior long lost cousin. That's basically GTA V when it comes to modding. You should do it when you start to feel bored.Overall this is probably one of my favorite games. I love the singleplayer. I love online. I love R* (even though they can be complete morons sometimes).

In most cases I like to drive down a ing mountain in my sports car and still make it without it exploding on me. I could go past a mountain to catch up to my teammates when I was away for a while. I could play golf and tennis. I could scubadive I could find there's no easy mode to fly a plane in this game like it is in other games which creates a sense of realism to it.Pros Had the highest hype train in 2015Variable third and first person views which most games don't have.Beautiful illustration of graphicsA rather curious wellput storyline always noting to you that in every GTA game there's always a betrayal which competitors don't really do such as Saints RowGTAOnline feels realistic about a town riddled with crime and chaos it's City Survival Simulator technically. Although no one's trying to survive but it gives you a frantic case of a city sprawling with gangsBut as with every game there are consCons Money isn't easily made unless it's by stocks and doing a heist as Michael. When the player is given about 7.5K in cash their instinct is to see what they can do with the amount of money they have compared to FranklinGTAOnline is riddled with cheaters and trainers at the moment where even a newly made friend can be a hacker that has a mini SMG that shoots out 40k bags of cash just to get your attention and telling you to take it.Playerbase is unusually aggressive but then comes a wise choice of pick your crew and group carefully as even your own teammates can turn on you simply for being in the same limo.Those cheaters and trainers? They get RP and cash boosts and what not. They also occasionally have the ability to drop a nuke in Los Santos and murder them while pinning someone else for the blame.Regardless to say though. I still personally prefer to play the game every now and then. Although what I'm spouting for the most part is blasphemy this is still just my opinion of the game. I'm not a professional critic after all.,Grand Theft Auto V

So many things about this game are superb from the fine details of the mini games that feel like full blown games you could buy in store or online to the feeling of never ending openness that the main game gives you.There have been a few complaints about the lack of Mod support and allowances online but personally I have come into contact with a few online modders while playing and they just suck the fun out of it. I would prefer it for the wider field of vision etc but I can understand why Rockstar have blocked all users who choose to use any mods. Hopefully in the future they will create a list of approved Mods that you can use online which won't tarnish the play for other non modding gamers.9/10 definately recommend,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is a bad enough port from PS4 and Xbox do an update to fix the random stutters that happen for no reason. I go from 200 fps to 20 within seconds and shoot back to 200. also would be nice to look at grass without my gtx 1070 saying ""nah fam you dont need to look at this."". It just causes my FPS to bomb its self. Please do performance updates. Other wise too many online stuff that dont really make it fun its still a good game.",Grand Theft Auto V

No logs no error codes no nothing.My account name also doesn't have special characters or anything all my drivers are uptodate I don't have any exotic system setups etc. etc. . Yes all my other games run perfectly. This is simply a terrible exception handling. It has never happened to me before and I can only advise people to wait with their purchase. It happens for too many people who pre ordered and pre downloaded. This needs once again typical Rockstar style a couple of months of fixing and then maybe I will be able to play the game I bought months ago to finance their early beta.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,176,False,Recommended,"Take Two decided to bring ""politics"" into gaming so I am keeping my negative review about GTA V here.If already type a negative review about the game here are more reasons 1. Loading times take up to 10 minutes for online.2. You will constantly get disconnected from game sessions (another 10 minutes and can reach to 30 minutes)3. Lag. If you didn't get disconnected you will experience a weird lag where the enemy will have infinite health. You can run him over and your entire team can shoot the NPC but it will stay alive.The game has been out for years yet suffers from issues that games should not have online.However if you plan on playing it on singleplayer the game is very solid. It also has great modifications like Skyrim once you complete the game however the community's attempt to keep the game's survival like GTA San Andreas is challanged. Edit I am giving it a positive review as I mostly gave it negative regarding Take Two's attitude. Rockstar has nothing to do with it at least not from what I saw. Despite the issues above the game is good. Put the politics aside Rockstar proves over and over again why their games are constantly good. For each next installment they bring new technology and features to their game and it never feels ""milked"" or same.Unlike Vampire the masquerade bloodlines which has mods to fix the game GTA V has mods to ENCHANCE the experience and not repair it. The community is a dedicated and loving one and you surly can find something about the game that will appeal to you.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-26,1,2,281,False,Recommended,Well after playing for a while i wanted to post a review on this game.So GTA V is a really good game singleplayer is good could be better if you add some mods and mess aroundHowever the multiplayer has its ugly and good side the good side is you can play with your friends have fun f around and all that stuffThe ugly side is there are hackers BUT i never had a bad experience with a hacker most people here getting banned cause they're asking for money from modders which will get the banned. if you are wondering if you should buy this game then yes! If you ever find a hacker its as easy as it sounds just find a new session. Don't ask for money Rockstart has said on their FAQ if you get money without asking (in the chat or messaging the hacker on the phone) you are good.If you do get some unwanted money from a hacker and you want to play legitematley well then create a new character spend all the cash on some stuff then delete that character and then go back to your main character.

I feel bad for the people who are reviewing and raining fire on a good game from a good series and being obtuse about the actions of Take Two whom of which should be raining fire on their customer support if they honestly cared rather than leaving ""reviews"" that measure up to nothing more than petty comments and disliking a game they probably won't stop playing anyway.All in all it's a worthwhile game and I apologize on behalf of the good community for these sputs of pointless reviews.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,35,False,Recommended,"First and foremost ignore the majority of the negative reviews as they don't pertain to the actual game. If you want an unbiased answer as to why the negative reviews are happening scroll to the bottom. TLDR version of why PC gamers are a salty bunch and through their actions are only hurting themselves in the long run. Also since I'm giving this a positive review my review will probably be downvoted into oblivion. Now on to the review of the game itself! (I've played this on PS3 and PS4 as well so my hours don't properly reflect the amount of time spent playing this)For those that somehow haven't played GTA V yet the game is a fantastic game and has a huge array of things to do with the many different tasks and side objectives ranging from interesting to utterly ridiculous. In a good way of course. The three characters you play as (Franklin Michael and Trevor) are all very different with each having their own storylines that intersect at different poinst throughout the game. The game world is large with missions ranging from a simple street race to yoga to intricate heists. The heists are very fun and are what really makes the game as a whole. If you don't feel like doing the many illegal tasks you can do other things such as foot races golfing tennis hunting among other things. The single player of this game is very fun. As for the online play there's a near infinite things to do at this point. You can do player created levels to beat your opponents in a sky race climbing on ridiculous junk towers as well as online heists. Or if you want you can just harass everyone else. The choice is yours. If you haven't played this game and you enjoy open world titles other GTA titles or third person shooting titles you should play this game. It's incredibly fun with a huge amount of things to do. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up.Now the reason why there's the obscene amount of negative reviews Recently Take Two took down the modding outfit called ""OpenIV"" that allowed mods to be made and played on GTA V. The modding software is meant to only be allowed to be used in single player but a workaround or a modified version of the client has allowed them to be used online. The developer of the software named GooD NTS stated that the Cease and Desist (C&amp D) was an going to happen eventually as the modding tool fell into a legal gray area. Both Rockstar (developer) and Take Two Interactive (publisher) have reason to believe that the tool was being used to ruin the experience of the online portion of the game and allowing mods into the online space which is not allowed. They also took down the group/website named ""Force Hax"" for the same reason with the difference being that Force Hax is a paid for online ""hack"" system. Rockstar has since released this statement about the takedown of OpenIV Take Two's actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.The other reason is that due to recent malicious mods most likely the reason that these two different modding tools were sent C&amp D letters many people have been banned from online play. Though many of the people most likely weren't using the mods themselves if you join a lobby with someone using ""hacks"" in the game the other players in the lobby could also be banned even though they themselves did nothing wrong. So understandably many people are very upset about this for completely logical reasons. You should not be punished because someone else in the game was doing something they weren't supposed to be doing. Rockstar/Take Two reportedly have terrible customer service when it comes to people being banned from online play. I myself have never been banned but it seems as though many others have been. Whether the reports are true is unknown. There's the ubiased facts about what has happened and why hordes the negative reviews are being written. As I said in the TLDR PC gamers are a salty bunch. Also the reason I say their actions are only hurting themselves in the long run is that due to this outcry and attack on both Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive the negative side effects will most likely happen in the future and cause future titles from Rockstar such as Red Dead Redemption 2 to never be released on PC. When it doesn't come to PC you have everyone who joined in on the efforts to hurt and harass the two companies to thank.",Grand Theft Auto V

One of Trevor's missions made me feel as if I was in a movie but with the full interactivity of a game. The world is so big and so realistic. Sometimes it's a comfort to just explore it.

2016-06-01,2,1,26,False,Not Recommended,i kinda feel that the only thing that was really improved other than the graphics was the sleeze. It 's like because of all the refrence by comedians and youtubers how cool and funny it is to sleep with hookers and then kill them in gta games. Rockstar said hey lets give the public what they want and make all the characters as sleezy and lowclass as possible. One of the missions have you video tape people having sex while hiding in the bushes. Another mission your having sex with a herein . It 's just to prevelant and it seems like way too many missions your doing garbage like that. Yea the graphics are great the cars and guns are great but I just wanna do the stuff i can 't do in real life like blow stuff up and shoot cops. I like all the previous gta titles way better. There is really nothing new and innovative being done with this gta title. This game reminds me of a will ferrel or adam sandler movie. The first couple were good when especially when your young and stupid. After this many releases of the same with moderately increasing lewdness on every title I find myself realizing that rockstar games and I have nothing in common and won 't be spending anymore time and money on them.,Grand Theft Auto V

If this ban on modding benefits the online play and community good. It sucks you can't mod your single player but give it time someone will figure it out and then we'll go through all this again.

I do i think some games need at least 150 or so mods to be playable.. DI agree it would be great to have a supported modding scene for GTA5. So many talented modders who are able to do more than a wheelcart to carry your cash around. I'd think that the obvious reason for ""no modding we game make"" is because they are making money with the current way how you can obtain items. BUT! I have enjoyed this game a lot. It's fantastic. Storyline kept me on it the whole time. I love to ride on those mountains with my dirtbike and then make some mayhem where ever it may surprise you!

I can't get 4 people I know online and in the same heist at the same time either. Half the people I meet don't speak enough English to co ordinate with anyway. I've done all the heists at least once but I regret now not doing them more at release when there where more high level people doing them with pubs. Now it's all low levels who insist on playing on Hard then die a few seconds in. Most people I know have stopped playing entirely. There's some 20 30 names on my social club list but never more than 2 on at a time and always the same ones.I think this game was meant to suck actually. In the same way that mobile games do this game isn't meant to be satisfying unless you're buying shark cards chasing the idea that if you buy everything in the game you'll finally be having fun only if you get to that point you find it's just as empty as before only now you get an attack helicopter that is near useless blowing up after one hit. Heists just make it where instead of needing shark cards you need people who take the game seriously. But no one takes it seriously and most people stopped playing because of hacks lack of mission variety or just the overall grind. And I think this is what R* wants I think it's by design. They want those people who will drop $100 on shark cards. The rest can play single player they don't care if they play online at all they've bought the game and unless they buy a shark card they're nothing but a drain on server costs from that point on.I am not looking forward to GTA VI anymore based on this. The single player maybe. Not the online. All I wanted from GTA V was an online co op campaign just like Saints Row does flawlessly but in the GTA universe. They took out gyms cluckin bells and gang backup and for what? For a dumb storyline about a jerk who has a jerk family a nobody who is just a rich nobody by the end of the story and a psycho who was believable right up until he started parroting about not calling women bad names (but ing them then killing their boyfriends in front of them is totes fine!).Also why is every black GTA protagonist a complete punk? CJ spent 80% of San Andreas getting dogged on by his ""friends"" and somehow still didn't see that they didn't like him Frankin hangs out with crackheads and losers who do nothing but mistreat him. Are they afraid that if they portray a ""strong black man"" who isn't a punching bag it'll be seen as unrealistic?So much stupid went into making this game. There's just as many touches of brilliance but for everything great there's something that makes me just want to uninstall and say it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,337,False,Recommended,From Rockstar's side on the whole modding side of gta I believe that they are right as well as wrong in some ways in this situation. I believe that they have complete right to have the modding site OpenIV taken down for the reasons of gta 5 online. I am one of the midnight realse players of this game so i have been playing it ever since the beggining back before there was a online and now a days i can't stand playing online anymore with all the players that have been too lazy to play the game the way it was ment to be played and work theirselves up the system like the rest of us but insted cheat their levels and money ingame. On the other hand I myself do use the OpenIV to mod in cars and LSPDFR for SINGLE PLAYER ONLY so I myself am not happy to see it get taken away. Therefore in the end even though I can no Longer player modded single player I myself am glad to see them finally cracking down on the online issue and hope when the dust settles from this that they may reallow use to mod single player again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,543,False,Recommended,This is currently not a popular opinion but I'm going to try to explain my perspective best I can here.Grand Theft Auto V is a fantastic game I say this as someone who's been faithful to the Grand Theft Auto series for quite a time even before Steam was a thing. Although released in 2013 I would argue Grand Theft Auto V still stands to the test of time even four years later. The singleplayer experience is expertly crafted and if you enjoy narratives and appreciated previous installments I have no doubt you'll enjoy this one too. The characters and story interacting together in a detailed world really is a great experience. However Rockstar has gotten a lot of flak over the past few years from the community in the Online aspect of this game. Long loading times are still present even on good machines and there have been many times I've experienced bugs of some form at least every other play session but I never found this to be absolutely game breaking. It's frustrating but I find that if you're with friends which is where the online aspect of this game truly shines you can look past it.It's my opinion that the community has become particularly hateful due to the developer cracking down on modding based on recent reviews both in singleplayer and multiplayer. I don't necessarily agree with them choosing to get hamfisted on the singleplayer aspect of modding but I think the crackdown on multiplayer modding has been a tremendous relief and ultimately necessary.I've always been a legitimate player of this game since the start I remember when modders weren't rampant in the online lobbies. When they started appearing in droves a year or so into the life of the game I used to avoid them when I saw them ignore them get a new session etc. But being teleported to locations locked in place forcing your character to dance and being dropped loads of cash I eventually put my efforts to rest they seemed unavoidable.With the Gunrunning Update my modded cash was removed which I actually /appreciate/ very much I still had my legitimately earned cash to spend on the new content and I haven't seen any modders since then. It's my hope that it stays that way. I will never purchase Shark Cards and I think it's a copout to the consumer but Rockstar is a business. All of these updates have been free. Resources do not come out of thin air regardless of how large the studio might be. I have personally seen people's perspectives change on a dime from the one I hold now to entirely hating Rockstar just because their modded money was removed expressing their hatred of the Shark Cards but buying them anyway just because they don't want to work for their stuff.Buy Grand Theft Auto V if you want a singleplayer experience and only buy it if you have friends to take with you into the adventure that is the Online world.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-13,2,16,0,False,Not Recommended,Day one day fricken one doesnt work. I would say this is unexpected but that would be a lie considering the issues the xbox version had. My problem with this one is that year+ after a game has been out and you know they know what is required to get this up and running. Countless delays and 4 months sitting on pre order now its telling me my code doesnt work? The game I have payed full price for not once but twice is telling me moment one of release that my damn cd key doesnt work... BRILLIANT. So now I have to wait for support to uncrash itself which is going to easily be a week worth the time. I would ask for a refund right damn now so I can buy it again but it appears that the social club also went ahead and deleted my everything. So overall pretty much history repeating itself. Buy this game at your own risk. A smart man would wait till they actually get this game fixed you know after the third %$ing time its been released.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-21,0,0,130,False,Recommended,This game is pretty good. However you can't mod it anymore as take two has decided to basically ban mods. What that means is you will only be able to play the game in vanilla form. I am upset about their decision as I did use some mods including the LSPDFR mod and the Redux Mod. So basically if you are into vanilla gaming then go buy GTA V. If you are planning on buying GTA V for modding then stay away from it as you will not be able to mod the game at all.Update 6/24/17 OpenIV has been brought back up. I am not kidding. Rockstar and Take Two decided to bring back Single Player Modding! After over 70 000 people signed an online petition to bring back modding they decided to bring it back.

2017-06-15,0,0,385,False,Recommended,I will start off saying most of my game knowledge will be from GTA Online but I have watched the entire single player campaign twice and confident enough to state an opinion on the game. The game always had a great cinematic feel to the game and pointed out some great discoveries through satirical context and the personality of every living (and perhaps brutally murdered) citizen in Los Santos. As odd as this might sound I've always been curious of any player's end result at the end of the main campaign where it records everything you've accomplished typically of carnal pleasure and kill quotas. I enjoy through observation and I will use that as an opportunity to get to my real point. This game (online especially) has amazing memories that you the player achieve through your actions where one day you're fist fighting on a moving bus with another player to then immediately transition to that same player screaming in agony as a heist's escape plane shreds them from head to toe after you fought off an entire prison complex's security force. Eventually though as free content flowed into the ocean of code for GTA the creativity in most players dropped one end because a grind would ensue that many people just simply do not have time for another end because something as taboo as ONLINE modding suddenly is the only excuse to play the game. Due to some news at the time of this post Rockstar and Two Star are at considerable fault for allowing something of that scale to remain untouched as long as it did and caused honest reviews and thorough critique to overwhelmingly cease the community preferring to put a game they had enough passion for to comment on burn to the ground and anyone new to GTA should invest time in videos released between 2015 2016 both singleplayer and online.This game is not for people who prefer a much more casual form of entertainment through the online platform but the original content of the singleplayer is absolutely amazing and price efficient for that content alone.

I've spent countless hours fitting some new clothes together to go for the most classy or the most ghetto thing I could combine together with a great hairstyle and some great tattoos.ConclusionI've played this game almost 200hrs now and I've enjoyed every single minute of it.I would totally recommend GTA V to any of my friends since its so diverse yet you can make it as complex as you want. And almost everyone can play it with almost every GPU.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,180,False,Recommended,The whole Take Two banning mods thing is ridiculous and stupid. But even without mods GTA V is still four years after initial release the best game I've ever played. It will give you hundreds of hours of ridiculous fun and extreme gameplay. While the story isn't the most replayable thing in the world it is still extremely captivating and interesting. The gameplay is a HUGE leap from Grand Theft Auto IV and even Red Dead. The driving shooting and overall mechanics are all fluid and realistic. I got GTA V not two long after it came out on the 360 and only just recently upgraded to PC. But my overall time played has to be in the several hundreds just because of how fun the game is. The comedic take on Los Angeles has its moments of charm but it doesn't take away the personality of the NPC's like GTA IV did. While GTA IV did a good job at representing a large global metropolitan city with grey as it's main color GTA V did an amazing job representing a touristy beach city and also a backwater hick country behind it. GTA V is the ony game I can play when I'm bored that I can just steal c fast car and circumvent the island of San Andreas on the coastal highway just listening to the radio and chilling out. If you like action roleplaying games great characters mayhem and destruction and fun mechanics and you haven't checked out GTA V you are missing out. There's a reason this game still costs $60 four years after launch because it's such a great experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-29,0,0,1277,False,Recommended,"The story mode of GTAV is very good firstly the missons are for the most part not repetitive and being able to play as different characters helps to make each mission more unique as each character approaches them differently. There are also many side missions / objectives which can be completed even once the main story is done. I find that story mode is a good place to buy and to try out vehicels before buying them on GTA online.GTA Online is the best part of the game in my opinion there are several different ""areas"" which you can complete missions for. Firstly you can become a CEO and get involved with selling cargo vehilcle cargo or completing special vehicle missions with friends. Secondly you can become a MC president and complete biker businesses or missions ivolving various businesses you can buy accross the map through the biker club. Rockstar are constanlty adding new features to the game such as the gun running update which is coming out soon which makes the game still interesting even several years after release.One of the biggest issues with GTA online has to be the community. There are far too many hackers in games who just spoil the game play and even when no hackers are around there are always players in chat asking for modders to give them money which gets rather irritating. Although items in game do cost a lot of money so buying shark cards is normally a must to get an enjoyable excperience it should be rembered that rockstar dont charge money for DLC specifically like many other companies do so paying for money to excperience the new content is basically just paying for DLC in an indirect form. Rockstar support is also something which is lacking you always seem just to get the same automated message each time you report a problem however this is probably the same accross most games so it is not a negative of just this game by any means.Finally some of the vehicles in the game just shouldn't really be in the game vehicles such as the Hydra are just too powerful in their current form which unless you are driving around in an insurgent means you get killed all the time I think vehicles such as the Hydra need to have limited ammo and should have to restock frequently to make this more fair.Despite these complaints it has been one of the best games out over the last few years and because of the regulary updates remains enjoyable many years after release.Gun running update Well so far the new gun running update is the best DLC so far it is an extension to an existing MC Club or CEO office business. All you need to get started is a bunker which are fairly reasonably priced from just over 1 million GTA$'s. Given that it appears so far to generate a lot of money to pay for its intital cost. The bunker locations are in Baine county which makes sense so i excpect many missions and activities will take place towards the north of the map which is good given its been poorly populated and uses recently with most activity going down in the city.The second largest purchase as a bunker owner is the Mobile Operations Center this is a large truck which can be customised to hold another vehicle in the back (from the update) along with a command room. In this room players can man turrets or start missions from a computer screen. This truck serves little purpose for a solo player but for teams seems very functional and is helpful to have a portable base of operation once in the city since the bunker is far away in the blaine county area.I haven't had the funds to check out any of the new vehicles but they all seem fairly useful in game and can be transported by the mobile operations center they are however fairly expensive but this price goes down once missions have been completed.Like in my main review this DLC is faritly expensive however it is free so the cost of buying shark cards is just payment for the DLC in an indriect form which makes it more reasonable. People need to understand that not all in game content is needed for the DLC there is no need to buy every car and every bunker upgrade it should only cost aroud two to three milliion GTA$ which isnt bad given the price of most other DLC's and the fact this content can make back that money fairly quickly in game.The only negatives again are the community and support. When loading up the game you are given a message from rockstar asking you not to cheat which is all well and good but they do nothing to stop hackers in game. Even when you contact them to ask for funds received by a hacker to be removed they don't bother so I think the anti cheating system lets down the online quite a bit. In terms of the community I joined a game only to be vote kicked by 4 other players who wanted the session to themselves (I was causing them no harm) things like this are very annoying and not isolated incidents.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game online is litterally unplayable becuase of how easy it is to hack Theres people complaining about the hackers and how its unplayable soon as they take action people complain about them stopping modding. Blame the kids that use the mods in the wrong way. Theres plenty of games that dont have mods that have good reviews this doesnt deserve bad ones becuase of Take Two. This is a really good strong game with more content than most others of its genre and more being added every month. The only downside is the amount of money you need to buy new vehicles but thats mainly because of the amount of people running around with 90 billion dollars. Buy the game if you want a good game to play Dont buy the game if you want to mod it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-29,0,0,187,False,Recommended,Everyone's hating on the game for the mod banning but to be honest there wasn't much of a choice. Modding got out of control on GTA Online and they had to do something. Regardless GTA V is definitely worth the money. The story mode is phenomenal and the amount of detail that was put in the game is amazing. The online aspect is impressive and the heists are great even though it's annoying to wait for people to join and when a troll joins your heist just to leave and start everything over. Overall even after four years it's still one of the most impressive games I've ever seen.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-28,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,First of all the game it self looks all nice. But the game play is a bit boring. First i though it was okay till i found out that i couldnt play together with my friend. She told me it was because we didnt finish the tutorial. I still haven't figured out if i have finished that tutorial or not. I got a few missions first that i finished. One race event and the other one that i didnt understand. The other play kept shooting at me for some reason and that made him win. In the end i decided to drive around him till he eventually left the event. That kinda made me win. After that i didnt got any phonecalls anymore and random events are showing up. Wich all are kinda boring.... all about shooting and other stuff. I stole kinda every car or bike that i could found near me but after a while driviing around with a goal... i got bored with that as well. I had enough money to buy a house or something but the game didnt let me. because i can only buy a house if i get a call from simon. Who ever that is.All the missions are multi player what is okay but with some you have to shoot the other player or something. Also there are not a lot of race events it is a bit about shooting with a pistol. I geusse it is okay if you are into that.To be short i find it overal boring. i think it would be more fun if there was a goal in this game besides stealing stuff.,Grand Theft Auto V

Lots of salty reviews here to deter people from buying the game. Thankfully Rockstar are now taking an active stance against in game hackers/modders that ruin the online experience for everybody by griefing people constantly. To myself and most genuine players this is a welcomed move. Looks as though a few people have spoilt it for the rest of the creative modding community which I agree is a shame.

2017-06-21,0,0,126,False,Recommended,To all the people hating on Take Two for taking down the mod menu support You are all a bunch of hypocrites! I use to play this game online quite a bit and just about every time I would go online there would be someone using a mod menu to screw other players over. They would use these menus to gain an advantage to drop themselves money for things that took us legit players a long time to earn to kill other players to put ridiculous constant bounty's on other players spawning vehicles that they should not have this is to name a few things that the mod menus did to ruin the online experience. Now that the menus are gone the online world should be a much better place to play this game with friends. Does it suck that you can't use them in single player anymore.... sure. However this does not make this game a bad game nor does it take away from the accomplishments that GTA V has made since it's release oh so long ago. GTA V is a great game and will go down in history as one of the most in depth fun crazy adventure open world games of all time.

Players killing each other for fun or literally chaos (Jets and tanks all over the island and bombing players). You might meet modders.

You can share those opinions and to an extent the multiplayer is ruined by hackers depending on what type of multiplayer you are doing. If you are doing the random servers where you just run around and shoot other people and buy stuff you're probably going to have a bad time because of the hackers. My advice is to check out some RP mods and servers if multiplayer is really what you are after. It is hands down the most engaging experience I have ever been a part of in the gaming community. Besides that the single player alone is well worth $60. Technically it is worth way more than that if you have put hundreds of hours into single player considering a 2 3 hour movie at the theatre costs 10 bucks. You just got hundreds of hours of entertainment for $60.Back to the RP servers. Just try them out. You will become addicted again and you don't need to worry about the hackers. Just my 2 cents after reading recent reviews. Rockstar cannot fix the hacking problem at this point as the game was released years ago and their efforts are fully invested into GTA 6 at this point.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-06,0,0,858,False,Recommended,I've never been enamoured by the general theme of GTA carjacking murder prostitution racketeering etc. but the open world and play options make it a must buy. I think GTA V is the best so far as there's so much going on you can easily become hooked and totally immersed. The missions are good and choice of weapons excellent. Often I find it satisfying just to wander about ride some bikes drive cars and ride on the train shooting up whatever takes my fancy and have the cops pursue me. Talking of which the police AI is a bit samey and could do with a fix with some variation in future GTA games.Am a bit miffed that the prime characters are all male. What girls can't rough it?Playing on max graphic level the visuals are fantastic with amazing attention to detail this is what really makes it for me but then I'm a bit of a recluse and like to completely escape into a different environment for a while. The sea has realistic waves and swell the landscapes are interesting and the city buzzes with activity. As for playing online I only do so with a friendly group that invited me (thanx!) as outside of this there are cheats hackers and numerous moronic idiots that ruin the experience. It gets a lot of complaints on the forum.Minor game downers for me are 1/ the ludicrous helicopter flight. The machine is all over the place rolling and swaying like it's on a rubber band and 2/ the driving position inside many of the cars is like being a dwarf because you can barely see over the dash/steering wheel. Who's responsible for this? Have they ever driven a motor vehicle?There are some fun cheats you can employ which enable you to get into places that attract wanted levels but I started doing this only after twice finishing the game. It has a variable ending depending on choices you make. The game is a bit pricey but compared with many others I think it's worth it for the amount of interactive fun you can have doing anything.,Grand Theft Auto V

There is plenty to do both multiplayer and singleplayer. The world of San An is lovingly crafted down to some extremely fine details. Gunplay feels great both thirdperson and firstperson (using Free Aim anyway) Story mode is well done imo.

2015-04-14,0,0,1723,False,Recommended,"Honestly disregard the negative reviews...People zero bombing a game because of a launch bug where they couldn t play online right out the gate...Let's get one thing straight...for ANY game releasing to PC that is online expect to no be able to reach servers the first 10 45 mins because of the HUGE overflow of players trying to do the same thing you are...That is not a reason to down vote a game because you couldn t go online instantly. *GAME REVIEW*This game is an amazing port. WAY better than GTA 4. The gameplay is clear smooth and pretty much flawless with updated drivers. Single player is the same as next gen but way more detailed. There is so much more detail in the world around you. The textures shadows and sun shafts are simply jaw dropping. If you have a good gaming computer buy this NOW. If you don t stay with console otherwise you will end up like the other negative reviewers. *END GAME REVIEW*Another thing about people complaining about the ""unpacking""...I don t know what you're talking about. I didn't have to wait for an unpack at all. I literally preloaded downloaded the patch that dropped release hour and hit play and it worked. I guess for the people giving ""Pissy Reviews"" on the unpacking get a better HDD/SSD and CPU and quit your complaining.For the people saying ""The game isn t launching."" or ""OMG i have LONG load times""...once again get a better computer. Don't complain about load times when you're playing on an $800 or less ""Gaming"" computer. My load times were a minute tops to get into single player and about 2 3 mins to find a populated lobby. For the people complaining about the Social Club just...shut your mouth...it's Rockstar they are a Company aka business that is here to make money. Just like every other company you get mad at because you have to use their launchers or interfaces to play their games they are businesses there to make money. Plain and simple. For those crying about low frames at HD res...update your damn drivers before whining. Nvidia released an update prior to launch and AMD just released a beta patch for theirs 6 hours ago... Go ahead and download them.

Sure it's hard work but It's the payoff that keeps me playing the game. Sure Players will have to think of new ways to do MAchimea but That's not what gave GTA the thrill is it? No the Thrill was True open World and your own Character with a Backstory you can make up liek a wild Goose! I mean have you seen that Character Creator? It can get pretty messed up all the way to a Zombie or looking liek an Alien! My point is Mods didn't make GTA V what it is. It the Community and the Gameplay Mods give you everything no work Where's the feeling of Reward huh? You don't get it! many players think Mods are the way to go But I grew up with Games that had no mods nor did i ever mod a game Iilegally like most of the haters here. Yes I am looking at all of you haters! Now I will not level with you guys like i would normally on other Reviews No you don't Deserve to get level with the legit and True gamers those who hate on games because they have no mods are not true gamers nor Deserve to be caleld gamers because being a gamer means you earn the right to be called the top! You earned the Achivements legit! Not by way of mods or cheats. The Way of the Gamer is a Sacred thing to me For players to be hating on a game that I legit beat and topped on Console makes me SICK. Just because PC is the orginal doesn't mean it's the best at Games. You guys thinking of yourselves while Console gamers? they have no choice in mods or not they have the mods pre set. In all honesty you guys should be thankful that PC allows mods and furthermore if a company deems mods iilegal then don't get all Bunched up thinking of only yourselves why not take what you learned and help newbies?

It was messing with money so I support Take Two all the way. Messing with players microtransacted money is a crime. If I was a publisher or developer that would make me so damn angry trying to combat it. This was their best option against it. I'm sure we'll get a fix later on. Rockstar might even make a modding tool where they have control over it.Also these negative reviews will do nothing. We all know GTA 5 is a great game. What you get when you buy it is amazing. This is like calling a Boeing AH 64 Apache helicopter horrible because the military took away your ability to add on extra crap and paint long slongs all over the exterior.

I would like to play the game the way the developers meant for it to be played online. The fact that 8 out of 10 times you'll find yourself in a lobby with a hacker really sucks. If this crackdown helps get rid of those hackers I'm not against it.I don't really understand the people who complain and justify hacking because it's too difficult to attain things otherwise. Things are better when they are hard to get. It's makes those things more special to have. Maybe you don't have to have every car plane and helicopter. Maybe you could just work hard and get the things you really want.https //youtu.be/mqXU89aU8_8,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,Buyer Beware This is a information for those interested in the DRM functionality of this game. I have nearly 1200 games in my library and recently went on vacation to an offline location where I was unpleasantly surprised with the mandatory online requirements of a few games that had no reason or labeling other than a one time key activation. This is not A debate post I will not go back and forth on the quality of the game as the quality is meaningless if the game fails to function under its own requirements or the fairness of this issue. It is clearly unfair as it is not presented to the buyer and if it was it would still be unfair as much as a car not being able to crank without being connected to its manufacturer. Trust me it's a selling point on an outdated broken concept. DRM of any kind is a virus those that cripple a purchased product is theft.OK rant out of the way! This Is about the simplicity of the FACT GTAV does not work offline indefinitely yet GTA IV does. Or that DOOM as an ID/ bethesda product does not function offline indefinitely but their other products like wolfenstien does. MGSV TPP does not while MGS GZ and revengeance does and finally FFVII does not yet FFIX and the others do.Again this is NOT A DEBATE about the semantics of it all but a FACT of information that needs to be given to any potential buyer of these products. YOU WILL HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE A CONNECTION. They will function offline for a period of time. As with any software that is purchased I think the FTC should force not only the type OF DRM like Denuvo to be labeled but the function of said DRM and what information it collects requirements and the system resources it uses.Fair trade laws do in fact apply to the video game world especially for proper labeling of products and functionality as well as fair contractual agreements are still a legal obligation.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-04,0,0,78,False,Recommended,The 4 year experience review!!! GTA5 as a single player marks a legacy of the Super Gta Franchise of sandrease liberty and Gta 4 The multi player is really good but only for those who Want to buy the game money or really have some good Friends to play with online. Saying that let me first tell You why that is so rockstar has given an incredible Customer support plus a ton lot of features on the online Part which no other game that has such a great single player Campaign does. They have to pay those developers who Bring new things in the Gta online every month that is whyShark cards were introduced. GTA5 has incredible graphics Even a lower spec pc can run it as it is highly optimized The story is awesome the characters are good murderersWhich one expects in a Gta game. No laws exist in single Player. But in the multi player they do because ones freedom Ends where others freedom starts all players are equally Important that is why they discourage players from killing each other. Think you are flying a plane and out of nowhere some one kills u That is why they discourage harassment. The game is a whole Package that is why they don't make Gta 6.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-19,0,0,1046,False,Recommended,With the Mod menu finally being taken down let me back up and explain my position. I am all for mods when it doesn't effect someone elses game. If it is only being used in single player its great you are only effecting yourself and enjoying the random mods like becoming the hulk or magneto random stuff like that. When you bring the Mods onto the online you are having fun but for those who don't want the mods you are ruining the game for those players.Now with the Mods having a heavy crackdown on the players who use them the game is starting to proceed again in the GTA fashion that we remember blowing stuff up on even playing grounds Rank actually being used to the advantage in which it is supposed to rather than this rank 3 with a CEO/MC and MOC and flying around with a Hydra blowing everything up. Clearly not earning their equipment and exploiting their gifts making those who have invested their time into this game seem not as fun or desirable to play.This game is amazing it carries its same GTA vibe since GTA 3 get in cars blow stuff up jump off stuff range of weapons. If you are a GTA fan this is still the great game you fell in love with all those years ago but with a twist thanks to the people buying shark cards free DLC/ UPDATES to the game adding new content. Just a shout out you don't see new content free in a game anymore you can just look at Destiny as a prime example of that along with many others. This is not a rant i enjoy this game as you can see i have played quite a bit and the new MOC add on is amazing with its new range of vehicles and its new weapon modifications bringing a new twist on the old obsolete weapons.,Grand Theft Auto V

It doesn't feel dynamic like the physics are bad actors. Unconvincing at best.The start of the game at least is riddled with crappy cutscenes. I got so bored of them that I didn't bother with missions after the prologue I just went rogue in the huge sandbox world.I wouldn't recommend it at all at this price and I will never ever have hopes of a game as good as San Andreas from Rockstar ever again.Thumbs up on the First Person though.Oh and the best part?

To be honest I think it's a bit childish that people are going to the extent of leaving negative reviews just to spite the devs. It makes me genuinely dissapointed in the community. Sure people love mods. They add to the game and show off the creativeness of the community however just because a certain tool is being shut down the toxicity of the community is being shown.

2017-06-17,0,0,30,False,Recommended,For all those writing reviews based on an ETHICAL issue rather than based on the quality of the product thanks for undermining the entire review system. Now for a proper review to compensate Graphics Visually stunning and definitely worth having a higher end system so you can enjoy the quality of the effort put into the graphical fidelity. Performance Definitely not for an older PC but it performs very well if you have a recent CPU/GPU combo. There's a lot going on in these games so it can be more resource intensive. DLC Rockstar releases free to all DLCs for all who have bought the base game. Primarily funded through the in game cash microtransactions it's pretty awesome that they provide these DLCs at no up front retail cost for us players. Ultimately the game is a blast if you play with friends ignore the pitchforking of all these negative reviews as the game is great. They'll forget about it in about 2 4 weeks and it'll be a non issue. If you haven't played GTA before it's worth playing it's a great game.,Grand Theft Auto V

The majority crybabies who are ing and moing about the recent decision to end OpenIV are the ones who are more to blame for cheating in a non cheating zone. I just hope you great devs at Rockstar games would have implemented a better security protocol to keep the hackers offline that is all either by having designated moderators or Volunteer members who could be given certain access to help maintain the online expereince.

2017-06-22,0,0,504,False,Recommended,"The online game is the best open world multiplayer I've ever played. It's a difficult game to classify because it does so many different things so well. It's an auto racer flight simulator role playing game and first person arcade shooter. It has scores of multiplayer missions brawls and races as well as a series of four player cooperative ""heists"" that serve as a fully fleshed out online campaign. If cooperative play isn't your thing there is more than enough open world player vs player action to keep you entertained as well as random server events and challenges.The campaign is also decent if long. I'm not really a fan of switching between protagonists seems gimmicky to me but it's still a good campaign. If you're a modder think twice before buying this game as Take2 is shutting down the modding community with legal action. But for most of us this is a five star title and you're missing out if you don't experience it. It packs everything the GTA series has to offer and takes it to the next level.

However Rockstar and Take two interactive just shot themselves in the foot with the new anti hack systems in the game. They (for the most part) got rid of hackers by permanently banning them.

2017-06-20,0,0,649,False,Recommended,"I would like to help a good cause by making a positive review on the game.With recent addition of gunrunning OpenIV modding tool was successfully banned by ""The Suits"" along with other major modding. Thos others hardly modding tools. Let's be honest the actual usage of those is hacking and as such they should be treated.Without the modding tool the game as the whole is to be recommended as the main title says Grand Theft Auto V review. It doesn't show the last update only so it means it's for the game as a whole. And again I am happier with those tools banned. Would I write a review for the latest update only it would be as the whole neutral. Something was taken something of similar value was given. When you encounter a hacker he'd start adding money to your account and other crap. I would say ""Okaay someone gave me a lot of money great. Oh wait what will I do now? I can afford everything."" And in that moment the game looses the meaning. What's the point of playing the game without playing it right? Without goals to achieve etc. etc. You would encounter a hacker every 5th session I expect it will be much much less often. So in the end I would rate the last update as positive.Thank you for reading.UPDATE Rockstar has launched a contest for their own new GTA editor. I hope it will replace the banned ones with better integrity against hacks. )08/23 2018 UPDATE Good news fair players Take Two Interactive Software Inc v Zipperer U.S. District Court Southern District of New York No. 18 02608. There the US federal judge Louis L. Stanton of the Southern District of New York ruled against the hackers by prohibiting sale of two major hacking tools.Also a night club update with flying bike mk2.",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar didn't ban modding but thier publisher did because it uses a injection system which can and is used for hacks on multiplayer. Multiplayer used to be great untill you get teleported around cars blows up by someone looking at it among countless other things that go on. Don't blame rockstar they are trying to fight for ""modders"" about working a solution out. The reason I use quotes around modders is because when you are in single player you are a modder but as soon as you come into multiplayer with that crap you become a hacker/cheater.

But THIS is much worse even then Old Gen.Realy require to play at low graphic for about acceptable FPS waste to much space on HDD mouse lag (realy delay after moving mouse). This is on about avarage system PC.Need to activate and register on 3rd patry services to play.Rockstar do you demand Steam users own NASA Super Computers to play this game? (like all developers)STOP MAKE GAMES WITH HIGH SYSTEM REQUIERMENTS!Non technical part controlling on PC is realy confusing SO MUCH BUTTONS! Why? 2 triggers 2 sticks 10 buttons D pad enough. But when you are on foot may be aiming with mouse is easier (with gamepad there are 3 stages of aiming free aim bot hard aim the hardest aim) but when you are in car driving is much difficult. I dont tell about flighting plane or helicopter it is realy confusing.What's for now? Ask for refund and keep playing on Xbox 360 which is realy better then this.,Grand Theft Auto V

For those who said ""they banned mods but no hackers"" well take two took care of that and took down 3 of the biggest hacking tools for gta online. so stop complaining about no mods because rockstar actually enjoys mods it's just take two who doesn't I give this game a good rating because it's a good game so can you stop giving a negative review on a game that has plenty of content even without mods?

Regardless the game itself is what's being reviewed from winning rewards and it's massive console fanbase.

The online portion is fun too just make sure you have friends to play or it can get kinda lonely and not fun. A lot of people are complaining about taking away their mods and what not but it doesn't take away the fun factor of the game. In fact getting into a game with some invincible dude not killing everyone and stealing your money actually makes it enjoyable who would have though?The single player is well done and well written. Once the heists kick in the overall enjoyment of the game skyrockets and is blast to play. The overall tone of it is perfect (unlike GTA 4) and the characters are entertaining. If you haven't played it do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's super fun. the online portion is like playing an MMO without all the grinding.

2017-06-19,0,0,70,False,Recommended,The whole openiv thing has been a big deal there arn't anymore mods for gta 5 anymore but let's be honest they are going to bring mods back they just are. I am sad i got the game for the pc a week ago i had it on xbox for alot of time. i was exited to mod with openiv but now i can't. The people that blame rockstar thogh are wrong. rockstar loves mods they support them they can't decide what take2 does and take2 are the mod killers. People who started posting bad comments because of take2? They arnt doing any good. take2 owns rockstar and 2k rockstar loves mods. writng bad comments hurts rockstar too and rockstar likes mods. So here is a comment on the game not take2Gta 5 is an amazing game the single player is tons of fun with a long and interesting story. with tons of things to do you could put a long long time into single player and not get bored. In my opinion online is where its at. Online there is so so man things you can do! Own a company while runninh a motorcycle club and also a bunker. go on a skydiving race or team deathmatch it up with some random people. You can also play with your friends and punch them in their face for them having more money than you then steal the mone they dropped. Gta 5 may be one of the best games out right now so don't not get it because someone told you to not get it. Modding may be fun but gta 5 is still tons of fun too.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-13,0,0,205,False,Recommended,Nice game what else can I tell?I got this game a day before it released first on consoles. I got it for my PS3 waited 2 hours in line and it was definitely worth it. Played about all night. It was fun.I played all GTA series starting from the first one and ending with current one. A lot of things have changed I would say.Main reason to love this game is that it represents San Andreas (from GTA SA). Used to love it and still love that game.Good graphics physics gameplay and so on. This game is definitely awesome! Especially since it was released on PC. So many mods HORRYSHIET!Yet every DLC you get for free! FREE? YE ITS FREE! Unlike BF4 or COD or any other game.So is it worth buying? Hell yeah it is.Like look at this. Pizza usually costs 20$. Say you buy two pizzas and lots of Soda. How long will this last you? Probably two days. GTA will last forever! So buy it god darn it!PS Rockstar why the hell you changed the price to 79$ right when summer sale hit and make 25% discount? Jew much?Thats not cool.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,1,4,907,False,Recommended,Well the gam is fun i would recommend that you buy the game. But thats if you can get past the modders and trolls in the game but there are easy was to get away from both and just be in a session with you and you friends and do you ceo or mc work but i mean rockstar and take two just pulled a gun to their head with the new 100% no mods meaning online or singleplayer i mean i could understand online of course because thats where they make their money. but single player was where people went when the got fed up with people online and still wanted to play the game and when you do 100% completion on the campaign then theres really nothing to do so mods were an escape from that limit. Also i see people complaining about the online being grindy well i only got a few things to say about that and its that it is supposed to be grindy and time consuming its ment to be hard to do thats why they make it so others can destroy your shipments and product. now dont get me wrong i get when i worked half a day with my friends to fill all my large warehouses and we go to sell and that one prick is waiting there just to destroy my shipment having wasted mine and my friends day but you know sometimes your not supposed to care about the money and your just supposed to have fun with your friends go do some races me and my friends go do deadline adversary all the races and all the other missions available and we have fun doing it and you know whats funny. its that by the time we get off weve earned a few million by the time we get off the thing is to not pay attention to the money and pay more attention to your friends and as i said if you want there are ways around being in an open session and doing your shipments with no one else in your session i mean its temporarry but you simply disconect the gtav.exe from any of the hardware or just disconect your internet for about 10 sec and reconnect or resume the process.Even with all the bad things within this game I still play it because me and my friends can still find enjoyment out of it and thats what every game is ment for is to have fun not sit there and obsess about money and getting the best cars i could care less about having those cars but do i have them yes because ive had the money for them and just decided to buy them and was i able to buy every thing for this new update as soon as it came out yes because i didnt focus on money because the trolls knew who to hurt the best and that is those who are only trying to make money and occasionally a random person so...i recomend this game to all and i hope you have fun with the gamejust remember dont take it to seriouslywell thats more than my two centsjust have fun and thats all i have to saywell other than if youve read this far thankyou for reading and have a wonderful dayEveryone is complaining that there are no single player mods (I didnt like this either). The reason they said no mods at all is because people would have their mods on in single player and then leave the mods on when going into multiplayer. This is the Rockstar comunity of users fault for modding online and forgetting to turn their mods off.,Grand Theft Auto V

My wife stopped playing the game because of modders. The people saying they only use these mods in single play I think are full of They ruin the game for those of us that want to be fair. I for one welcome the banning of all modders. Whether it be singleplayer or online.

Recently there's been an influx of negative reviews almost entirely because Take Two has (in a move to help curb the modders) forced a mod maker to stop distributing their mod. I've never used the mod no one I know has used the mod yet some of them are leaving negative reviews just because it's the thing to do right now.It strikes me as disingenuous. These same friends leaving negative reviews continue to play and have a good time. Oh well. If you truly ARE looking at reviews debating whether or not to purchase the game I (and probably the majority of people leaving negative reviews) would suggest you do! The story campaign is a great time but GTA Online is where the game truly shines.

Story Now a new county of GTA is come with a bigger map i ever know yeah but i still thing i love san andreas And it came with a new 3 badass character Franklin Michael and Trevor to give you new adventure like never be in pass gta series before and rockstar present with a 3 new story characters in campaign with a 3 story of there main own chracter or mission team with so many side mission and secrets you can enjoy! GTA V Story is telling about Thief Bank Robber Family and Friends so GTA V story is very good to play it but it too short than GTA IV but i ok with that.

Fake and made to be noob friendly Online is one big crap fest SP missions are not bad but definitely not better than the ones in IV There is no Niko. That's a bad thing. Vehicle upgrades are meh.I'm sure that if I took more time to think about all the bad thing about this game i came up with them.Just get IV.. it's way better than V in every way except graphics ofcourse.I still can't believe rockstar took so long to deliver this wanna be GTA.Let's all hope GTA VI will be much better.

Also worth noting that it was Take Two not Rockstar that slammed the ""stop or we'll smother you in your sleep"" C&amp D on the modders.

2017-06-20,1,2,449,False,Recommended,Personally I've never really modded. In the end Rockstar owns the rights to the game purchasing the game does not give you the right to modify it. Given the situation and percentage on the community that hacks in online constantly breaking the rules of gta v online with not too much repercussions... I wouldn't be venturing very far to say that this is Rockstar saying enough is enough. Even if openIV was only for singleplayer it's disrespectful to dislike a company that has given so much content and entertainment to those that play it. My actual review of this game is that it is one of the best modern multiplayer and singleplayer games. It looks amazing and playing through the story is fulfilling. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone you can't go wrong with a rockstar game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Neither Take2 nor Rockstar will make any money from it It's more likely that this will consume ressources at Rockstar.As a (gaming) company you need to make profit to make further games. It's not an altruistic community that is just there to make life more convenient for you they need to pay bills wages etc. Also espacially for GTA5 you really can't complain about ""abandoned by developer"" or ""servers don't work anymore"". They provide top notch service for their own product(s).If you really think that you have contributed to the modding community enough to critizize a company for blocking 3rd party software on their own servers well noone's gonna stop you.But then don't complain that RDR2 or GTA6 will never happen because Rockstar games is out of money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,402,False,Recommended,Rockstar truly are rockstars. I've been playing GTA since the original top downs and they just keep getting better. The campaign of this is fun and well varied but the shining star is the multiplayer.I've been playing this since release on the 360 the amount and quality of updates and free DLC far surpasses any other modern game I've played and they keep on happening! The variety of activities available in online both in free mode and missions is amazing there is something for everyone here. The recent Gunrunning DLC has prompted me to write this review.Personally this is my favorite car game at the moment it fills the void left by the lack of a true successor to NFS Underground 2 strangely enough. I love collecting the cars modifying them goofing around with them going on cruises and the racing ain't too bad either for arcade style play. I do prefer non contact racing people can be ramming jerks but that's a individual player issue not a design issue very thankful to have options. Speaking of community I love the random car meets that happen in online folks are pretty cool around here (and yes it's fun sometimes to have a few moments of vendetta against griefers). The more recent vehicles have more customization options which is always a good thing I'm frequently impressed by what they are able to work into such an already complex game. The lowrider hoppers are fantastic the trophy truck is an actual tube frame racer with body panels and long travel suspension that functions as it should there's even a donk. A well deserved shoutout to the specialty water and air vehicles they're all well done. Oh and of course this is GTA going on a rampage is fun though I sometimes wish 5 stars brought out tanks. There still are the lovely antics of a GTA setting with the absurd radio commercials and in lore media crazy characters crime related debauchery the whole enchilada. Rockstar hasn't lost their way and I'm happy that GTA is still GTA. I don't play games as much as some other gamers but this is easily one of my favorites. I frequently choose to play it instead of many of the hundreds of other games I own. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

Leaving a bunch of bad reviews wont do all. Especially when you do it on games that have nothing to do with GTA 5. Grow up. The singleplayer is good multiplayer is a bit grindy but with a couple heists you can get most of the stuff unlocked (content wise like CEO/Biker stuff). Not going to give everyone a bad name but there are alot of people leaving bad reviews just because they can't use OpenIV to cheat in multiplayer anymore. Those that are doing it because of singleplayer mods I get it. But at least keep your ing and moaning to the game in question. Spreading it to games that Take Two has even barely breathed on (KSP for example) is hurting nobody but those developers.

I personally wouldn't have cared much if the reviews weren't all like ""Rockstar has always treated us like this is the last drop"" or ""GTAV is ruined now.""Literally off.I'm the last person to defend billion dollar companies most of the time. And let me get this straight I'm against the actions taken by Take2 against OpenIV. But to go ahead and actively try to destroy the reputation of arguably one of the best games of the last decade is not at all warranted. Rockstar Games has a track record of making some of the most high quality games in the industry for the past decade and a half with GTA IV Red Dead Redemption and GTA V receiving a lot of care post launch to the point of giving us some amazing standalone DLC in IV Lost &amp Damned IV Ballad of Gay Tony and RDR Undead Nightmare. For Red Dead and GTA V they even gave us loads and loads of DLC for free. Rockstar also has been very friendly to the modding community with GTA San Andreas IV and V being just as famous for its modding community as for its singleplayer and multiplayer content. I highly doubt Rockstar agreed with Take2's decision to C&amp D modders to begin with which is now basically proven with Take2's lift of said C&amp D. Rockstar and its undeniably high quality products shouldn't be demonized for decisions their publisher made.The game is still amazing mods or not. Even though I'm definitely a cheap bastard I definitely think I got way more than my money's worth out of the $120 I paid for the experience over two platforms PS3 and PC.

2017-06-16,0,0,1029,False,Recommended,"For those people who are looking at the score and thinking ""mostly negative""? this is for 2 reasons. Take2 games (the publishers on GTA 5) removed a user created mod that got round security issues in GTA that allowed modders to come online and destroy the community.So before this mod was removed you would have a lot of people saying the campaign was great great story great characters etc but then say that the online part of the game (the reason why i bought the game) was full of hackers who would just kill everyone in the lobby in a single click making online unplayable unless your in a friends only or invite only and then you can not do everything....After the mod was removed people are now giving this game poor reviews due to the fact this mod was removed.So its got bad feedback from modders and none modders due to the timing of everything. So here is my option on the game mainly focusing online.I personally was not a fan of GTA SA probably because by the time i got to play it i was used to 1080p graphics however I did play a lot of GTA 4. So when GTA 5 came out (on Xbox 360 and PS3) I got the game and I loved it. The campaign as said before is amazing. They removed the realistic car driving and replaced it with something everyone can use. The game feels more flewed and they really used the map. So when it was announced for PC i was one of the ones who preordered the game.I was a bit disheartened when i needed to complete the prologue however the fact I could transfer my GTA online character over from Xbox I was then happy again. I was blown away at the graphics on this game even at low settings and even more at how the GTA Online game mode uses the GTA map so well (you really do use all of the map with most of it in the city).I am sorry to say there are microtransactions in the game however these are completely optional as they only give you in game money something that you can easy get in online mode.The community has always been mixed with some people just getting on with the GTA life and others who will chase you all over the map trying to kill you over and over again so when you turn to passive mode they go away and bother someone else.The online mode even free mode is extremely fun as there is so much to do with freemode challenges that appear a lot ceo jobs etc. and once you have done all of that there are the original minigames with new ones added every so often there are 5 different heists and more.I have managed to sinc 280 hours into the game mostly being Online. And I didn't have any friends who got the game on PC too so it should be even better then.This game is a port from the console however it stacks up very well as a port (as long as your not on a AMD based processor that's is FX series or lower Ryzen processors i'm not sure). And if you do find a hacker do exactly what you would do on any other game and report then and then move to a different lobby. I find a hacker 1 in every 20 lobbies it seems. They can be annoying but they are in every other game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,2,12,488,False,Recommended,"Let me preface this with Not all modders are bad. Some of them actually used Open IV for what it was intended for making awesome player created content. But as they say a few (or a lot in this case) bad apples spoiled the bunch. If you've been on GTA Online in recent months the unscrupulous modders have gotten out of hand. Every session had modders who would drop explosives on everyone in the session killing them or toggle Godmode or teleport everyone to one spot on the map and blow them up constantly or disable your weapons or delete 500K of your money every second or crash your game. It was getting ridiculous. You couldn't find a server without some modder ruining the fun for legit players. SMH at all the modding people throwing a temper tantrum like a 5 year old would and leaving these reviews. You did this to yourselves. You have forced Take 2 and Rockstar's hand. Please don't give me that ""Nuh uhh I din du nuffin"" bullcrap. Sharkcard sales are Rockstar's cash cow. I don't blame them for what they did. The modders were effing with their business. Where do you think all the FREE DLC comes from? GTA5/O is a great game. Top 5 game of all time IMO. Don't listen to these whiners. I just hope Rockstar and Take 2 can clean up and ban the cheaters from this game. If the past week is any indication of cleaning up the servers then they have already done a great job.

Furthermore they only stopped the usage of ONE mod tool that they found to be against their terms or dangerous to their IP...and need I say one of the best video game IPs of all time? Let the player base (100k+ at the time of this review on Steam alone) speak for itself non of the 35k negative reviewers stopped playing the game! And why is that? Simple...This game is fantastic. From the story to the multiplayer it is literally a damn near perfect game. On top of that all DLC is accessible to everyone and literally everything can be bought with in game cash. Who the hell could ever complain about this game? It's a blatant example of how to PROPERLY make and support a game.Playing the game as intended is incredible. Even after 170 hours on Steam and exponentially more on console I ing love this game. The constant stream of content to the multiplayer makes it endlessly playable. Asking someone NOT to experience this gem because of the support of ONE mod team is absurd and an irresponsible use of the review system.Instead of asking you not to support this game in some childish little protest I'd rather ask you to make the purchase on your own merit and based on the following Do you enjoy well designed and polished video games? Do you enjoy incredibly voiced and written story that is refreshingly entertaining even still in 2017? Do you enjoy open world and ever expanding multiplayer content? Do you enjoy character and vehicle customization on a deep level in all game modes?If your answer to any or all of those were YES then you will enjoy this game. Period.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yea no you're the problem with the gaming community not take two and not rockstar. Grow up. Those considering it its one of the greatest games of the past decade the reviews its whiny 13 year olds who don't understand business and its god damn 50% off The content of this game especially online is probably worth well beyond 100 bucks its price never passed 60 bucks and now its only 30 for the summer sale?

2017-06-17,0,0,215,False,Recommended,Honestly It's a good game. These people crying about single player modding are just big ol babies. They release free multiplayer DLC on the regular the game runs well it has a good single player story and kind of a good multiplayer one. There's plenty to do by yourself or with your friends. Removing mods for single player doesn't make this any less of a good game. The biggest issue the game has though is hackers in multiplayer. Every once in a while you'll run into someone who spawns a male hooker on your face and forces them to face you but you switch lobbies and keep going about your business.All in all the game is a solid 8.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,106,False,Recommended,"Don't trust the negative reviews.

I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this and everyone saying it's wrong to say so because they refuse to accept the reality of the situation.Thank you for stopping a mod / program that allowed people to bypass the security of the game especially online. All of you who are sending flak to the developers for stopping a hugely faulty issue let me tell you why.1) All of you are saying that there are a lot of hackers in the game. A bunch of those people are actually modders who used OpenIV to mod game files and allow themselves access to GTA 5's developer console / menu allowing them to do anything they wish in both online and offline.2) The creators of the mod OpenIV never cared about online play. They knew that online was a thing and a huge part of GTA 5 they knew that they had the option to restrict it for online play and not cause issues for Rockstar. They picked not too they released it without thought and allowed people to take it and start doing half of the things you see online.3) Rockstar is left with two choices. They either let people continue to do mods at the expense of their game other peoples enjoyment and their gaming experience. Or they stop this mod dead in its tracks and cut off a huge line of cheats that people abuse online.They picked the second option. Yes there will still be cheaters or hackers but not in a greater number anymore. You guys are all whining and crying about losing mods. They never said modding is illegal they never said people still can't use mods. They merely stopped a tool that allowed straight up access to Rockstar high level developer stuff including online stuff. You should be thanking them and come up with ways of doing mods WITHOUT having to use a software that includes cheating.,Grand Theft Auto V

DO THE JOBS TO MAKE MOENY. 7. Enjoy them game as you always have when online. 8. Get over yourselves. I do regret the loss of single player mods I have never personally has any installed but I have played some before and enjoyed them.

To the fools whining that they dont get to cheat online any more just please shut up.As for the game it's self it's pretty good and I'm gonna be honest the Shark Cards could use an update If I'm paying over 100 bucks for a shark card I should get at least 15 million instead of 8 million. Most car's and gameplay mechanics require more than 8 million bucks just to get them.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game is the epitome of game development. I enjoyed GTA 3 and IV on PC and they were beautiful and stunning at that time but something about GTA V has got me feeling like Rockstar has raised the bar past even Valve's original Half Life BLASPHEMY! .Pros Stunningly realistic. Rockstar spared NO expense when it came to GTA V! feels looks and plays like a true living breathing city Attention to detail is second to none Gameplay mechanics and controls (keyboard mouse and/or controller) are fluid and optimized Story is so much fun you might play it twice (or more ...)! Evading police is actually more than possible now and fun! seemlingly limitless replay valueCons High 'Grass' or low FPS your choice! Police are telepathic and that detracts from the realism at times ... Even with extreme hardware system(s) still lag with Ultra 'Grass' Non destructable environment (I'm being petty) ...

You get out of the BMW and help yourself to the Ferrari.Then after circling around for a few minutes you decide you want to get on a motorcycle for a change of pace. You help yourself again to another bike.After the bike throws you off and you can't find it you climb into a tesla and cruise around in the pure electric car.Once again you have wrecked the Tesla in a crash. You then find a beautiful Maserati and take one out for a spin.And you somehow manage to crash it while robbing an armored truck. Once again you are ride less until you settle for a Ford GT.Finding the GT to be too common you hijack an Aston Martin to get that James Bond feel.And you crash it too.Then you fancy your eyes on a Bugatti. And take it. And now the cops are after you shooting and wrecking the Bugatti until you get wasted.And you wonder why the cops didnt chase you earlier.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-04,0,0,117,False,Recommended,This is the GTA game that does everything and gets everything exactly right. It is a ing masterpiece especially with the movie maker and much improved graphics over the weaker console versions. Buy it. Buy it now.The plot? It approaches the low side of Scorsese or Tarantino quality in terms of crime drama. The graphics? Amazing. The sound? You know.The gameplay? Absolutely superb nearly flawless with one serious issue which I will explain.GTA V was unfortunately made first and foremost as a console game. If you don't have a good controller the combat can be difficult and the driving can be painful. The game is best played with a controller but I found it advantageous to switch between controller and mokey depending on the situation.Sniping? Machine gunning government goons from a stationary position? Go for the mokey. For everything else there's the controller. The insanely overpowered autolock ability in and of itself is crucial to your survival in combat so get used to it the gameplay was not scaled back to be normally playable without it. Unfortunately the game makes no allowances to keep you from targeting comrades with it which is just stupid in this day and age. Trying to play this game straight mokey is really difficult I don't recommend it.In virtually all other ways this game is perfect.,Grand Theft Auto V

Even if you can only go up to medium this game looks great if you're not picky with your textures.The gameplay and feel is spectacular with it's responsive driving with weighty feel (until you flip your car and can easily turn it back up right with ease which isn't necessarily a bad thing) to it's top notch gun play all wrapped together with a damn thrilling story and multiplayer. I honestly feel I do not even need to make a review for this game as everyone already knows how good it is either from friends or YouTube videos I just felt like I should make one after packing in so many hours into it.PCMasterRace/10,Grand Theft Auto V

IMO mental state is stupid as it goes up even if you want to have fun and say run over civilians like in SP.Load times are the second worst part of the game connecting to online is a ing nightmare and takes the longest amount of time possible. It doesn't help that your friends are not in steam instead they're supposed to be in the SOCIAL CLUB. Good luck opening that if your steam overlay is opened with the HOME key. or actually good luck adding anyone because the social club is so amazingly cryptic that its hard to even find friends you know on it!Finally the worst part. ALWAYS ONLINE DRM. THE MODERN DAY WAY OF SAYING YOU TO PAYING CUSTOMERS. SO YOU CAN'T PLAY SINGLEPLAYER OFFLINE YOU NEED TO CONNECT TO INTERNET TO PLAY IT OTHERWISE THE ROCKSTAR SOCIAL CLUB WILL DENY YOU ACCESS TO GTA V FOR NOT CONNECTING TO THEIR SERVERS.4/10 for its servers the game itself isn't bad but its not worth all this money when they are giving you something from last year essentially.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-05,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,This game is generally fun once you have achieved most of the things that you needed like having tons of cash but it gets boring when you play solo as it takes a very long time to grind. If you have friends to play with you all the time sure this game is for you. But if you're not that kind of player unless you got this for story mode then GTA won't be as exciting. The story mode is a dynamic experience with well fabricated story as well as pretty much mission impossible in a game.There are some features I want to make clear that might not make your experience as great in online Customer service is absolutely useless Buying Shark cards is a waste of money Some of the community isn't that friendly.Anyways I suggest getting newer games as this one is getting incredibly outdated and god knows when Rockstar is gonna work on the many glitches instead of giving the game more loads. But that's just my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-04,0,0,648,False,Recommended,Offline gets old without mods.Online is fun if you or someone you know can inject the bank with a big load of money. Otherwise it's the worst grindfest I've ever participated in and that's before mentioning the people who will give you trouble for no reason at all it only takes one rocket from them to ruin the last five hours of your efforts.This is a fun casual game when there are no griefers around and if you take the enjoyment very very slowly. Not as slow as the grind takes though try to just discover one vehicle or two every day with the ton of money you've got from the mod menu. There's a lake fairly north in the map with three or four streams stemming from it go for a jetski run with a buddy or two. Take up some Motorcycle Club or Organization jobs on occasion to spice it up a little. Pick up the mini events in the lobby and see if you can manage the longest wheelie or furthest flight upside down.On the note of mod menus there will be many people who abuse them but on occasion some will use theirs to kick griefers or abusive mod users. Not everyone with a mod menu deserves to be reported.There's an obscene number of toddler minded people out there. Do not waste any time or effort on them. Report vote to kick and refrain from speaking to them. Anything you say can and will be thrown in your face with absolutely no reason or logic behind it._All in all yeah. Skip the grind via modding the bank buy and play with things slowly and stay on your toes with griefers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-10,0,0,156,False,Recommended,I'm loathe to recommend this game but recommend I will..but it has to be stressed that the recommendation is only for the SP mode. The SP mode is pretty awesome stories missions graphics are well done and I found myself genuinely being bothered for the characters (even if in reality they'd be sociopathic nightmares to one degree or another). You don't really get it from the advertising blurb but the main missions are pretty extensive (70+) with plenty of side missions most of which are not too shabby.Thanks to the good SP experience I decided to venture into GTAO. What a mess. GTAO lacks proper information as to how to navigate their system so that you're not constantly being bothered by others and Rockstar has intentionally made it that if you try to limit your online experience to solo play then it's pretty miserable..with repetitive missions and absolutely tons of grind (unless you pay of course). The only other options is that you go into public sessions with passive mode on but that limits what you can do..or that you tweak things to go into a public session then get yourself thrown out into a public session on your own (i.e. solo public sessions) though that is both annoying to do and frowned upon.Just to make things *more* miserable for the new players there's no balance in the public sessions and some of the vehicles / weapons for those who paid / played more are so incredibly OP as to make Saints Row blush.I'm sure if you have a few friends to play GTAO and limit it to them only it's a much better experience..but unless you do avoid avoid avoid..and stick to the SP.Edit I should mention that this was played on Proton / Linux doing so does impact framerate add occasional stutters and some instablity compared to the Windows version but was very playable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-12,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Better and Better!I haven't played this on PC as much as i have on Xbox360 or even PS4. but my gameplay all together would be astoundingly high. this is easily the best GTA game yet with a super awesome campaign with almost too much to do and with modding its SOO good. the PC version is Sexy as hell! and first person is really enjoyable (going ape with a hatchet) lol. BUT... the BEST thing is multiplayer its one of the best RPG Racing FPS/3rdperson shooter action masterpieces all rolled into one very sweet package. you will never be bored and if you are you're doing something wrong. customisation is wicked combat is very competative and smooth. and if you play with friends its even better. storming free mode with a squad of loyal Phycopaths is just too good. The only bad thing is everything on multiplayer is expensive to a almost free to play standard but is fine really because the campaign is worth the initial purchase and if rockstar wants to make multiplayer slightly free to play with there FREE dlc then fine. Its just Brilliant!!!!!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-15,0,0,134,False,Recommended,What can I say? The game has just about everything or at least something for everyone.Best played with friends especially if you want to complete heists without lobbing your monitor out the window in a futile display of infantile rage. This rage will almost always be directed at one of two things.1) random people are terrible at communicating cooperating and just being helpful in general. 2) computer AI has some amazing accuracy and range capabilitiesGraphics top notch but might require some tweaks in order to find a balance between performance and qualityControls It's GTA. Nothing new here. Mouse + Keyboard for shooting/on foot a controller for some vehicles (chopper planes) seems best. If you want to drive AND shoot at the same time (accurately) mouse + kb is good. If you're just driving controller.Story it's Rockstar Ridiculous dialogue characters plot. Voice acting is amazing. Sheer amount of crap you can do in the game world that doesn't involve the actual story... just amazing.Online Be prepared to wade through griefers hackers morons etc. But don't let that discourage you massive amounts of hilarity and fun can be had when you get into a good game with a group of people that don't base their fun off of ruining everyone else's experience. Freemode is filled with this.You really can't run out of things to do in this game.. whether online or off Races (car boat motorcycle jet helicopter bicycle) tennis matches golf games arm wrestling darts skydiving/parachuting off roading armed robbery gang attacks deathmatch survival last team standing missions against AI.... You get the picture.The best part of the game is that some of the most fun you have is just PLAYING THE GAME. No clear objective no goal no job.... just messing around and letting your imagination run wild.Money well spent.Note LOTS of loading screens and online is really frustrating at times as you're always getting booted or your friends are. Can't connect half the time and again LOAD SCREENS. Srsly it's still a good game but.... wow is this poorly done.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,78,False,Recommended,The game is a blast. I have tried it on two different systems. One is an older desktop with componants that are several years old and the optimization allows me to play the game with default settings and it looks good. On my new gaming laptop it plays flawlessly at the highest settings with no detectable lag.. I have never seen graphics and details like this in any game. Everywhere you look there is detail. The world looks very close to real. The online portion is more robust than i thought it might be. There really is so much to explore and do in this game I can see myself racking up hundreds of hours on it. Is it worth paying full price for it? Yeah I would say it is. I would also recommend using a game controller. I went and picked up a logitech cheapo for 20 bucks just for this game. Crank up the graphics if your systm can handle it.

I definitely like the storyline and was a bit sad when I finally finished the game.I personally wish the story mode was a bit longer but none the less I do like the ending I got.

The downside are the current drivers they aren't too get yet. It may take another month for AMD to release better drivers. Performance is good but stuttering and fps drops can occur they are rare though. There is also an issue with system ram. If you play for about 2 hours your ram will start to fill up. This maybe a slow memory leak. It sucks for those who have less than 8GB. Hell I have 8GB and this ram issue occurs within 2 to 3 hours of play.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have 4 other friends that have issues with me IE crashing huge lag online freezing losing items losing random cash missing saved cars and clothes stutter and framerate drops. Funniest thing is....there is a store to buy cash for online play...and I pray no one is dumb enough to buy it due to the fact that cars clothes and guns randomly dissapear rendering that real life cash for cash purchase the biggest mistake anyone could make. Usually I am a huge rockstar supporter but after my 5th crash today in solo (offline play) and uncountable crashes online...i want to take this digital purchase and smash in over my kne drag in out in the street ...and shoot it in the damn face. 60 dollars wasted at this moment and i hope/pray Rockstar or steam fixes this heap on donkey,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,331,False,Recommended,"Best game i have played for years and years...I am so speechless over how good a job Rockstar did on this game.I am beyond any doubt convinced that EVEN if games of this genre don't apply to your ""type"" of gaming you will bow in honor to how well this game is made. I will admit that even tho i never really played any of the previous titles in this franchise i must admit that they have done a better job for each release over the years... Atleast according to a big number of my friends that HAVE played all the prequals.Seriously no cons at all here and i can say that with confidence specially since i have completed the single player part and thrown a decent amount of time on the multiplayer part wich is if you don't mind me saying a FULL game by its self.I have gain such a respect for Rockstar that i might blindly and with out checking any reviews by what ever next game they develop. That is to say if they keep up the level of quality and content as they have done with this game.Like i said before the game is so good that even if games like this is not your cup of tea (usually) then i think you should find a way of trying it out so you can see what the hell im talking about or just trust me and buy the game if you have the correct speccs.If you somehow still are in doubt then wait a little while more and check out youtube for NEW pc only videos where people will be showing off the movie creator software that was included with this (PC) release so you can see what fun this game really brings to the table.I already felt like i got my moneys worth when i finished the single player campaign and before i even touched the multiplayer part. And wtf? Where are the bugs? I did'nt see a single bug even tho im sure there are some xD.DO NOT let the 4354 negative reviews effect your judgement in ANYWAY since they ALL are the result of people not able to install the game correctly due to and i quote from steam ""Some customers are experiencing issues Installing or Playing GTAV due to a Windows User Account Name error. Click here for details on how to workaround the issue.""There for there is no real bad reviews about this game ).100/10 Insane replayablility",Grand Theft Auto V

The only big difference First Person Heists and a whole lot more epic stuff. GTA V on Steam is the best way to experiance the fifth installment of Rockstar Games trademark franchise with First Person mode you can for the first time in a GTA game explore the city of Los Santos and the metropolis of San Andreas in the best way. First Person mode is the best way to experiance Grand Theft Auto advanced graphics settings a dynamic control scheme for the PC community above a whole other wide range of features. Rockstars epic definetely deserves a 10/10 and a recommendation for download.

Now for my review of GTA 5 on PC The game isn't much different besides a few details most of them minor. ie more haircuts and horn sounds. Some nice new weapons added. The graphics look great but I guess that is individual to your rig. I really thought first person mode was going to be more than it is. Your view is restricted in first person also walking in first person is much different than in third person. it's more like a rushed tap dance. That being said it's a refreshing addition and many of the visuals have been tweaked to allow it. ie getting hit by a car beating someone up.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-23,0,0,237,False,Not Recommended,This is one of the best games I've ever played and is quite possibly my favourite game ever. So much about this game is just perfect (while there are multiple annoyances but the gameplay for me is just so outstanding that it really makes up for it. And the online is just amazing if a bit difficult to get money and RP. There is a lot of grinding involved unless you want to by shark cards (which are way overpriced). Although the grinding can be fun if you switch up the missions frequently and play a lot of heist with your friends. All round I'd probably give this game a 4.5/5 just because while it is probably my favourite game ever it certainly is not perfect. That award probably goes to Portal. UPDATE I was just banned from the online for no reason at all. Only for ten days but still super upset. I do still recommend this game as it is insanely fun but Rockstar support is The y won't answer a thing they say and they immediately closed my support ticket. UPDATE WHAT THE ACTUAL TAKE TWO YOU BANNED MODDING WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH YOU AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I seriously want to die. Take Two is screwing over the game with the microtransaction infested hell hole that is the online and it's awful. The single player was and still is fantastic but the online is screwing over the game so badly. Especially now that Take Two essentially got rid of all the mods for the single player. This is a super move and I would not recommend buying this game unitl OpenIV is back. This is such a thing to do and I hate it and you should too. It's just another way to force the grind and microtransactions on the players. And it's even worse when you realise that GTAV is the 4th best selling game in the world and has made billions yet they're still forcing money out of the people who have already spent $60+ on this game. t. Do not buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Generally the minigun seems to fire better now although I did still see some frame rate drops during the Paleto Score. Overall it does seem that this patch has improved things.The latest Ill Gotten Gains Patch (1.28) has introduced momentary freezes that drop the frame rate. It also makes the chain gun virtually unusable due to frame rate drops when firing. Otherwise I've really enjoyed the game to date.

2015-04-29,0,0,493,False,Recommended,"When I first got this game the moment on PC I was expecting a bit of a buggy mess but actually it's a lot better than I thought however you need a Rockstar Social Club in order to play single and multiplayer. There were some glitches here and there but doesn't pop up far too much. I managed to beat the single player without much problems whatsoever. However I beaten this game on console so I am more familiar with the controller in comparison to the keyboard. I'd recommend playing on controller mostly because some controls with some parts of the game that would be troublesome.Besides the bonus is that you get extra weapons once you are a returning player so if you link your Xbox or PSN account to your social club you get extra weapons However I should mention right now there was a glitch but I was the only one who got the ""all in order"" and ""loyalty"" achievement which gives you an extra 2 million together. The other three should've got it but they didn't. In case you don't know it's the achivement if you get all heists in order with the same players. you get an extra 2 million. However the first heist only allows 2 while the rest allows 4 players.I'd give this a 7/10 for multiple of reasons. First being that this takes place in San Andreas but the map is only one island I was somewhat felt let down that it was not the same map as the PS2 classic remade in HD sort of deal like GTA IV was taken place in Liberty City. I would love to get an apartment from Las Vegas pyramid building. Second being some parts needs to be fixed Hydra fighter jet with GTA Online needs to speed up when landing gear is away Radio needs to have volume enabled so I can listen to self made music more better the loyalty and all in order achievement needs to be fixed for the other players who didn't get it beside myself Third being The single player doesn't have difficulties but the checkpoints somewhat made it far more easier in comparison to the other games didn't feel as much classy and challenging as the games before..Anyway the game is fun and a lot of room to mess around with and having a lot of fun with money.. Oh I should mention that there is Microtransactions in this game that if you spend a bit of real money in exchange for a lot of in game money for GTA Online.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,309,False,Recommended,This game is incredible! Not only is it optimized for PC but the graphics and pretty much everything have made the PC version a definitive version. However there are a few quirks for this game at least for me. Also keep in mind most of these problems are specific to online. First is that the stocks for bawsaq in story mode seem to be broken (not moving) for now but I believe it will be fixed in a new update soon. The second is that transferred characters have a few problems on them notably the lipstick problem. However it can be fixed through a simple trip to the barber shop but even then it is an inconvenience. Those are pretty much the only problems. Overall this game was worth the wait and delays considering how polilshed it is. I do however believe that we will be seeing new features as well as performance optimizations from Rockstar in the next few weeks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"Took me four days to get it working but when I did I was and wasn't disappointed. I WAS disappointed by the graphics and shadowing. The shadows for me at least were pixelated and horrendous. The shadows went through typical textures and just was a massive turn off. Since there are so many shadows it's really hard to ignore them. They were so gross I just had to stop playing. Hoping that when I play it next the game fixes itself. I know for sure my computer should be able to play it with ease. As it can play each other AAA game out there without breaking a sweat. But for some reason GTA V is just like ""LOL you Suck my I ain't workin' for you"". The graphics for me at least were exactly like PS3/PS4 with no noticable difference. As the GTA series is my favorite game series alive I am going to recommend this. But a lot of people have been having problems. So be wary when buying this game.

2018-01-21,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,It's obviously not the players who are the problem. It's Rockstar.Everyone knows what to expect when you put thousands of people in a free for all without any structure or purpose. It doesn't take a tactician to know that it's going to be utter chaos. Money is all but meaningless in GTA because of Shark Cards and lax penalties for cheating. In fact the only penalty I see in GTA is the penalty on players using passive mode wherein they can't even use weapons to defend themselves against NPC's.There are such easy fixes like 1. Bring back the GTA4 style passive lobbies.2. Allow a hardcore (realistic) mode that excludes all explosives except regular grenades and doesn't allow you to shoot out of armored cars.3. Create more meaningful reasons to kill NPC bad guys and more co op events instead of all competitive.4. Release some social structure DLC's like gyms pool tables cards clubs maybe even basketball or skateboarding so that the world is more immersive and less boring5. Get rid of those ing planes!There are many other games out there besides GTA5 and not one of them is even close to the toxic cesspool that Rockstar's created and instead of fixing their problems and giving NORMAL people a reason to play they just isolate the normies into private servers and add things to make the game even more toxic. Rockstar is a multibillion dollar company. It's not run by morons. They're doing this on purpose.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-19,0,0,773,False,Not Recommended,"Now this game has had mixed over its long life but i want to take a look at it over the years as a whole. GTA 5 on release was great things were balanced money was hard to get but was balanaced out as things wernt rediculously priced. I think the most expensive car was 1 or 2 mill at most. Now we look at today and the first thing you notice when you log in is the shark card and spend money shoved in your face. The game is so focused on wanting ""YOU"" to spend money to get in game items. Things have increased dramastically in price which is fine but which isnt fine is how hard it still is to get money. Rockstar has a problem with giving out money. Every method of money making that comes out that is efficient is either fixed or patched. One of the biggest ways to make money when i used to play was the pacific heist and after they patched the easy way to grind it i quit. Next i want to talk about the biggest issue since the game realased 5 years ago cheating.... Cheating is a big problem in the game and rockstar takes no actions to counteract the problem other than banning people which is extreamly inefficient as cheaters will just keep cheating. When you take a look at cheating as a whole when modders can drop you 200 million dollars why would you ever buy shark cards? Im gonna be completly honest your better off having someone drop you money as you dont seem to get banned from other players dropping you money. As rockstar seem to not give a you might as well. Better yet nce you do get banned you have no way to talk to rockstar (just like steam) everything is automated bots! Once your banend your done!",Grand Theft Auto V

It spends too much time in some places and not enough in others.GTA IV was a hallmark of excellence in its social commentary.San Andreas retained that excellence in that same regard while being an over the top experience.Vice City was content to be a throwback to the 80's mob movie much like MGS 3 was to the James Bond franchise.GTA III was one of the first open world games ever made and rightly regarded as a te al wonder.GTA V has none of these accomplishments and very little focus in regards to what it wants to be.GTA Online works because it's very difficult not to have fun causing mayhem with your friends.The mechanics are polished the DLC adequate but there is little to no spark in the final product.No glimmer of artistic mastery that made Red Dead Redmeption so poignant.No novelty that made L.A. Noire so unique.Nothing that its predecessors brought to the table to lift them above and beyond the call of duty.GTA V is a great game but not a hallmark of its generation.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,I have to currently write up this review with not recommended. Pros .First person is beautiful and works great..Frames really are 60frames per second even with old computer hardware..The game world looks really aliveand that's about where I end my positives because of the Cons listed belowCons The BIGGEST issue is optimizing for frames per second is one thing. They completely forgot about optimizing for VRAM. If you thought Shadows of Mordor used a lot of vram. Or that Dragon Age Inquisition had bad performance. You have not yet enjoyed the horrors of getting in a car in GTA5.Frames drop to 10 15. But not because of fps optimization but because the hardware they claimed could run the game gets horribly bottlenecked by the vram cost of driving. This happens on even cards that meet the recommended settings. Not just the minimum. The game crashes constantly because of this issue. To make matters worse. That vram is still and issue even with reflections that look like they came right out of n64. Until they change this sadly this will remain a negative review even tho I'm sure the game actually would be great if you could play it. Having to buy a 4GB card to bypass the terrible vram usage is just not okay.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-19,0,0,83,False,Recommended,Overall GTA V is among one of the best games out on the market between its story and massive online mode. Modding on PC exsists which can make the game better if that happens to be your thing. One downside is that online is a massive grind but can be rewarding at times. Its a great game especially with friends or with random people. If they can cut down on the amount of hackers I think online mode will be better off.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-18,0,0,889,False,Not Recommended,"DISCLAIMER! You don't have to agree but hear me out. This is coming from someone who has played both online (console) and offline (with mods on PC).I bought GTA 5 on PC to use mods only offline being fair to those in online lobbies.I say no to this simply for the singelplayer as myself i like modding OFFLINE! and creating custom cars characters etc. I don't bother with online because of overpriced cars clothes and other unrealistic material. I love GTA 5 but the updates are so annoying especially for a person like me who wants to mod just offline and have fun alone. Sadly ""take two"" is trying to take mods out and force us to go online. This is really absurd considering that mods keep the offline portion of gta alive and well at this point i think i just might uninstall this game and forget about it at this point. Sad to say but i see Red Dead 2 being another opportunity for ""take two"" and their silly money hungry antics. Note that this coming from a person who played online on xbox also so i know the struggle of grinding constantly online to get money that goes very quickly just to keep doing heists that don't even pay much (take two's mission for shark cards). This is why i came to PC to play this game and be left alone offline but unfortunately this didn't work. i never played gta online with mods on PC because it's unfair to players just having fun in lobbies. Anyways yeah if you thought about buying this game only for mods (for offline purpose) that ship has sailed and is sinking right now as i type this. As usual have a cozy day/night where ever you're from and carry on as you were.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,424,False,Not Recommended,This game its community and Rockstar themselves are absolutely awful. Let me tell you why.I played this game since it came out on PC and clocked in over 400 hours most of it online. Things were great when the game was new. Hardly anything was expensive everything was fun easy going and easy to obtain. Then once prices for everything skyrocketed hackers were introduced. They did everything they could to ruin the game for everyone else. For me they got me banned three times aka permanently. The prices for anything ranged from $25 to $10 000 000. The average price for anything ranged from $3 4 million. Even if you grinded a fast and high paying mission it would take you 2.5 REAL days of non stop grinding just to get a car. I was harassed and tortured and manipulated by hackers who destroyed the game. I never did anything to violate anything and yet I was banned three times for other people's mistakes. And now I am not allowed to go onto GTA Online EVER. I lost everything all 400 hours of my online grinding and I can't even try to get it back without paying another $30. I sent Rockstar emails I submitted tickets I talked to support and they all refused to give me any sort of sympathy at all. They all refused to restore my account or even give listen to my side of the story. Rockstar robbed me of $60 and I am proud to say that I will never buy one of their games again and will never support them. They've lost a loyal customer who has been with them since GTA 3. I strongly suggest that if you're even planning on getting this game please don't. You will be very disappointed. It is a complete waste of money and time. 2/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

An excellent open world crime drama that will lead through countless hours of random run ins of the law side activities and sites to see.

If this is your first time playing this game on PC (which is the way to go for this title) then you are in for a treat with it's up to 4K visuals and smooth 60 fps gameplay. Epic soundtrack for all tastes and the list is endless of the detail the developers have placed into this project. GTA5 is a masterpiece of it's time and should be worth the time you place in. Rockstar Games has gone above and beyond to bring this title to the PC crowd which has been long worth the wait. This is a must own title especially if you have been on board with the franchise for a long time. If you are new to the series then you are in for a treat.,Grand Theft Auto V

The Online multiplayer is by far the best of the series. At first it is confusing how the lobbies work but you get used to it.My only con about this game is the incredibly lengthy loading screens.

2018-09-23,0,0,410,False,Not Recommended,This game can be incredibly fun when you are not being terrorized by a cheater or hacker. But you cannot play online for more than a couple hours before you encounter someone employing cheats such as driving/flying vehicles which cannot be damaged. Or spawning a toilet and campfire onto your character's waist (which kills you from the fire). Or taking control of your character while you are playing. Or suddenly killing you with a bolt from the blue where magically no player is given credit for killing you.In theory you might be able to avoid the cheaters/hackers by playing in a Friends Only server. But Rockstar does not let you do anything interesting like run your businesses while in a Friends Only server. So you are stuck playing with random strangers which means that you WILL encounter a cheater/hacker before long. Heck when you go online it is likely to put you into a session which already has a cheater/hacker in it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can consistently maintain 60 fps on max settings with a rig that I have had for 2 years (Specs at bottom). I can't even recall having this game crash on me yet. The story for this game is set to be a classic as expected from Rockstar. You can see characters develop through the game which is something you would only come to expect from good movies. The controls take some getting used to but overall seem efficient. I am rating this game as V/V.

2015-08-09,0,0,2336,False,Not Recommended,Single player is very good just can't say it for multiplayer. I have been wating for a good MP GTA game since the mod to GTA SA back in the day and GTA V has that potential but not the security of it. Lobbies are filled with underaged hackers and modders who more or less control the whole outcome of the action. There are min. 2 hacker on lobbies most of the time. They can take your GamerTag and use it to frame you for cheating and getting you in trouble with R*. If you have a bounty on you a hacker will teleport to you location and shoot you and then disapear or will teleport you to his/her location espacially if youre in a plane or chopper and then kill you. R* looks to be more forcused with getting more money out of paid gamers with their recent updates to the game then making a decent Anti Cheat software for us legit gamers who enjoy the fairness of the battle.Until this issue is resolved i would only buy this game for SP only or buy the consol ver. for MPOff topic Beside their lag in Anti Cheat they are also pulling off some shady marketing stuff to make it look like you are getting a good deal. A piece of advice DON'T BUY SHARK CARDS you are then supporting a company that has already gotten back there expensis within a week of the consol sale preorder and are now squeezing PC players for more money after purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,179,False,Recommended,10/10I am incredibly impressed by Rockstar with the release of this game. After all the first day release issues that many companies have had lately this game has none. Playing beautifully maxed out at 1080p locked a 60fps with no issues. I couldn't ask for better. Oh and it looks amazing console users should be envious. I wish I had a 1440p or 4k to run it to see really how great it can be but im am very pleased with 1080p. I did notice one issue. When i run msaa there is a pixelization error at the bottom right corner of the screen. A small square . Running 2x Msi 3g gaming r9 280 in crossfire. Also AMD released a new crossfire profile for GTA V but it doesnt seem to be utilizing both gpus to there max. Im only getting about 55% on both.Still hugely impressed Rockstar!!

2018-09-26,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,Loading times. Connectivity.Cheaters. Even if this horrible clunking machine wasn't released in 2018 it is currently 2018 and there are far too many good games out there to be wasting time loading up GTA V. This is a game I might have gone through hell to play fifteen years ago when this sort of thing would be unique enough to warrant the waiting and patience especially in comparison with other games of the time. As it is no other game I can think of comes close to the horrible optimisation this title seems to possess. Sure many people don't have these problems. But then if half the players do that doesn't make it okay. That makes it pretty in the eyes of a lot of people who fork out for a loading simulator. (You know what I even bet there are people out there who wasted their two hour refund window just waiting for this game to load.)Also just as a side note I did manage to load in a few times it was fun for a little while then got tired putting up with those three things I listed right at the start of this review. And after that I absolutely do not consider the payoff to be worth the pain. Rockstar you gotta do something. Update the engine or whatever.

2015-07-20,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,"Singleplayer The story is fine but boring and extremely forgettable. The usual ""edgy"" stuff like in previous iterations is still in it but it was badly executed. Most characters are pretty onedimensional or predictable that doesn't help either.Let's be honest you're playing this for the online mode. Multiplayer Even though there are regular patches to the online part of the game the core gameplay consistently remains the same. No big changes. The gameplay mostly consists of random mean players hunting you down just for the lols. The ""passive mode"" they then talk about locks you out of a huge chunk of the content. What bothers me the most are the shark cards. Funny they called them that cause they're pretty predatory. Effectively ""Macrotransactions"" asking you to shell out way too much money for way too little ingame currency. If you ever want to drive in a decent car or have a decent apartment you pretty much have to grind for several hundred hours or shell out another 100 bucks.I'd rather have the updates as paid DLC and the money payouts rebalanced.TL DR This game made me have a grudge on R* Games.",Grand Theft Auto V

However... They should not have added in flying bikes with rockets and all manner of stupid vehicles with gadgets and gizmos.Couple this with microtransactions to buy in game money to spend on ridiculously priced vehicles and you're looking at a form of pay to win gameplay.I say this completely based on the fact that when you're just simply messing around driving a car and minding your own business some little child that attacked his parents' credit card for online bucks decides to blow you up endlessly with a $4m flying bike.The addition of microtransactions demolished the entire prospect of ever having an in game casino because it breaches into actual real life monetary value gambling.Also the payouts on jobs decreased and this means making money from gameplay takes a day and an age even with businesses.I continue to play this game purely because I enjoy rocking around with my mates until we encounter the children of the world fueled by their off shore parent's accounts.Would've been nice not to have these elements in the game but hey ho Rockstar have to keep making money somehow to pay for all this free DLC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-18,0,0,73,False,Recommended,NOTE This review is totally based upon my thoughts and only my thoughts. I'm not bias therefore this review will be raw and straightforward. Story I've owned this game on multiple consoles and recently purchased it on the PC. I guess you can say since owning about 4 copies of the game on multiple consoles is overkill. However the story is something that is special about this game. You get 3 different prespectives which most games can't solely focus on. Rockstar Games for sure nailed this game with a solid 10/10. At times you will be laughing since the characters (Franklin Michael &amp Trevor) are hiliarous in numerous cutscenes. I would without a doubt say this is one of the best Grand Theft Auto games in the series second to GTA San Andreas (over 200+ countless hours logged). Graphics As this game can be super graphics intensive even with the medium settings on it's still a wonderful game. I'd totally recommend having at least 8GB memory for this game as this game is a memory hog (totally worth it though). As my currenty configuration (i3 6100 + 1050ti 4GB SSC) on a 2560x1080 21 9 Ultrawide monitor I'm happly recieving 70 145FPS. I'd say on average around 90FPS. That's pretty solid. This game on the PC is totally worth every penny comparing to the consoles version's this game on the PC blows them away. 10/10Dislikes I don't really have any. This game is totally perfection. I honestly can't wait to see the next GTA cause this one it self is stilling copies left and right. Enjoy the game! It's there for a reason. EDIT As of 2/18/2017 there is a deal where you can get GTA IV &amp GTA 5 for $29.99. That's a steal!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-31,0,0,81,False,Recommended,"It's a great well made game that's clearly had a lot of time put into by people who know what they are doing. The campaign is a good mixture of funny and enticing and I'm looking forward to putting more time into the single player. Despite this it's not the best GTA ever made. I personally prefer the style of the other GTA's (San Andreas comes to mind) where you only play as one character as I believe you feel more connected to that character as they go through a story line. It wouldn't have been the same if you could actually play as Ryder or Wu Zi back in the day.The online is great fun the first few days of playing it with my friends was nothing but hilarious however once the excitement passes and you need something ""more"" to keep you playing I feel GTA V falls behind other somewhat similar games such as Altis Life on Arma 3. First of all as someone who preordered I received enough money as a gift to buy the best appartment and one of the best cars. After doing a few heists I could then afford the best car. Umm now what? Mindless races and missions are fun for a while but it could be so much better if there was more to spend your money on. Barely a month after the game came out and I haven't wanted to play online for a while.Overall I can see why many people love this game and definately recommend you to try it.",Grand Theft Auto V

The ganes doesn't fail to express how large the map is. Flying and driving taken to another level. Now I see why it was needed to add planes to the large list of player controlable vehicals. 10/10Multiplayer Another work of art but not as flawless. Leveling takes time but not too much time. Higher level stuff requires better performance for more cash. But with Shark cards they threw that out the window. As long as you can't buy ranks from them the game will keep you occupied even if you have a large wallet. A large problem that as of now (5/31/15) there is an outrageous amount of hacks being used (traininers cheat engine DLL injectors Process Memory Edits ect.) Every other session I join has a hacker. Mostly them either blowing you up every sec making you commit suicide or spamming bags of money over your head. Though this can ruin the experience for most people if you find 3 friends to do all the heists with you will be fine.

If you're thinking of buying the game or returning don't bother. No one will do Heists with low level players. Missions/Survivals/Races/Etc are all dead the only way to level up is Heists or soloing. You won't get into the former so have fun doing the latter. By the time you reach level 100 RDR2 RDR3 GTA 6 etc will all be released. Just save your money.

Best play with your friends or turn off your mic cause some lunatic kid will throw a tantrum if they hear you talking in game.

2018-08-06,0,0,220,False,Recommended,REVIEW Its very important to take this game as it is. An amazing singleplayer experience and an almost eqaully great multiplayer experience once you let go of the need to have and own everything. The main gripe a lot of people have is that there is so much content and it costs so much that they wil never be able to experience it all. Forget what you know about all the doomsday heists and owning a nightclub and simply have fun. Through doing this you will gain the money to buy cool stuff in time however if your always focused on it then you won't enjoy one of the most well made games of the decade. Just play the game and progress. Who cares if what you buy pales in comparison to other items in the game or that might be released. Just enjoy what you have and GTA V online is fun.TIPS If you want my advice play races and VIP missions and then get a company. It opens up a large revenue stream and has fun missions (import/export not cargo missions) You will earn money over time. If you have friends then divide up who will buy what so you can unlock all the content quicker.CONCLUSION Singleplayer is beyond amazing with a great narrative interesting characters and great gameplay/missions. Multiplayer is fun aswell as long as you take it as it is and enjoy it without thinking about the next seven million dollar investment. The community is fun although they do troll a fair amount and hackers/glitchers aren't very frequent. If you do run into one just join another session and alls well that ends well.RATING9/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-09-25,0,0,49,False,Not Recommended,Good single player story with lots of stuff to do until you 100% it and then decide to play online as online is the only mode that is still supported with this game. Then we come to why this review is a downvote which is the online experience is awful in its current state every lobby is filled with ethier trolls or hackers that can't be killed or have unlimited money and cheats and will kill you instantly with said cheats along with the ability to kick you from lobbies. Combined with the crappy customer support that bans players that dont even cheat and will not negotiate the ban even if it were to be a mistake. The online is also ruined by it being designed around shark card microtransactions as everything is so expensive and you earn money so slow you almost have to spend real world money in order to unlock any new features that are added in a reasonable amount of time. Final Verdict If you want a good singleplayer game get this on sale when its less than $15 $20 and if you are wanting a good multiplayer experinece just skip this game and spend your money elsewhere.,Grand Theft Auto V

In fact it's ing game breaking. Disable it.Other than that good game. Great story and the MP is legit minus a few things.1 Tanks/Jets No need for those. A tank does not belong in a game like this. Same with Jets. That is not something a gangster is just going to know how to fly/drive. It's stupid it's broeken and should be removed. The tank especially because it's near impossible to kill someone whos in a tank without spending a ton of money on 10+ rockets/bombs. But of course Rockstar has to pander to the demographic of terrible players just like CoD and OP weapons because they want a bigger fan base so they add easy mode features.2 Modders holy modders Modders aren't anything new but it would be nice if Rockstar stopped being lazy as and actually did something about them. Either you're getting dropped from the sky to your death insta blown up or they are dropping a ton of money to you and instead of banning them Rockstar will just reset your entire account. Level cars guns crew rank every last bit. Not just money.3 Community Completely toxic. Rockstar for some reason didn't think to just make a mode where there's no PVP. No instead you have to disable all fighting ability and have no guns (boring) so people won't kill you. Oh you want to use your guns to do something like rob a store or do a gang attack? Too bad because if you disable passive the people following you around waiting for you to leave it will just shoot and kill you anyway before you can even access your weapon wheel. (Because tar decided that there needed to be a 10 second period after disabling passive where you can be killed but cant use any weapons again dumb as .)REVIEW EDIT Finance and Folony Update Tips It's ing broken. Rockstar is so hung up on micro transactions that they won't fix their feature thats been out for literally half a year. If you get a delivery mission where you have to fly a plane and drop packages just ing leave the lobby. You lose a good chunk of cargo (and money) but not all of it. If you don't there's about a 90% chance that after a delivery or 2 it won't show any more markers or wont count the deliveries you make.This is why my entire High School my entire work place and my entire friends group have refunded this game and aren't buying the next one in the series. I am probably going to uninstall and just advocare a boycott uyntil they actually listen to the people they are robbing (in real life of real money with micro transactions). ing fix your You are turning into EA and are going to come close to ""worst developer ever."" As of right now I am changing my reccomendation to ""not reccomend"" until they ing listen to the players and fix bugs they are making.

2016-12-13,0,0,544,False,Recommended,So I see a ton of people saying that they're getting falsely banned so I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in. It's never happened to me but I did hear of at least 1 reason as to why people do cop the hammer. On screen displays such as MSI Afterburners the show stats of GPUs CPUs and the like. Ensure you disable those before you play the game.Now then the actual review.The Singleplayer is a masterpiece plain and simple. The story is compelling bar a few missions and the world is large and full of things to find and do random missions given to you by random people who you can sometimes do and 3 characters to play with each with their own strengths.The Multiplayer is sheer chaos. Hackers run rampant beggars beg the hackers for cash to the point of madness trolls &amp griefers run wild attempting to ruin your day many MANY wrong people get banned and everything costs way too much. IF and that's a big #$%ing IF you can somehow get past those downsides the online mode is awesome. Same Singleplayer world but with your own custom character with businesses to run Night clubs to own and dance in (as of the latest update) heists to complete and too many explosively weaponised vehicles to choose from if you can afford them either with Mummy's Credit Card or by grinding for potentially weeks to buy them.If you aren't turned away at this point by the horrid #$% mentioned above buy the game on special. You should experience the Singleplayer Campaign and maybe attempt the online if you're brave. I wouldn't grab it while normally priced just due to the fact that Rockstars customer service and trashy Business Model are an affront to gaming itself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-04,0,0,335,False,Recommended,I only bought it for the online. I played quite a bit on my brother's PS4 while waiting for release/payday. The pros and cons (online only) Pros Cars That feeling of having several pixels of power and the sound of your car as it zips by everything Missions are fun Ownership has meaning Soundtrack is pretty good Tons of ground to cover and fun to be had World feels aliveCons Hackers. Unfortunately this is functions in conjunction with the next point Counter intuitive menu system. While it has all the standard stuff and such there is no place to report someone who is hacking/harrassing/etc or it's not readily made available Command input in chat is also counter intuitive and when I try to go to world chat I can't figure out how Framerate drops can lead to some hideous scenery Payouts for jobs are unfortunately underwhelming when weighed against the overpriced stuff in the game. Either Rockstar has no grasp on the cost of things irl or they simply want to jew people out of their actual money. Rockstar I got bad news for you... Some players don't know what the Hell they are doing and unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a system implemented that prevents you from getting the idiots. Some cars are absolute garbage and unusable early game lose their appeal late game because you're driving a Sabre Turbo with maxed out everything. Overall a 7/10.

2016-02-13,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,After playing the game for a few hours heres what i thinkPossitives A acceptible story i find enjoyable in the singleplayer.Some interesting features like robbing a store for money and the new FPS (first person mode) (Could use more variety of stores to rob though)Good variety of cars and modifications. Planes Boats and Choppers included.Graphics are acceptible.I like the new content and support R* is trying to give the game. New guns cars features and missions.The map is interesting to explore and heck out the sites now and then.Good customiseation for your online characters clothing to make him/her look quite unique from others which is very nice.Cons For the game to come out on PC and everyone be exited to mod the hell out of it...be wary. I belive some of the new updates previously mendtioned can break some mods and is really annoying to the players and modders to rework the mods to get them to work for singleplayer and R* needs to try and be a bit more accepting to the SP modding crowd.The Online is.........pffft dont get me wrong the online mode really shines when playing with friends on heists and can be good fun for you guys. it isnt much of a mode that you would play yourself though due to some a**holes and hackers who want to ruin your fun. R* needs a good way of stopping hackers and a**holes from harrassing the good players that simply just want to have fun.The spawning in freeroaming can be unfair at times if you get killed it leaves you open for a group of d***s to gun you down constantly and then activate passive mode and get called a p****y it can feel very anti social at times sepecially when there are objectives to tell you to simply KILL players who are just minding their own bussiness.And the best part of the game...the crap loading times. R*'s online mode was f****ed up at launch and it has improved BUT the loading times suck in this mode where its so grindy by yourself to just get that one chopper you love. UNLESS you buy their microtransactions the shark cards.Why would R* need more money after their success i have no idea dont bother with them its not as fun just buying in game money than it is earning it yourself R* doesnt deserve it through these things (even though it is very grindy i feel) i want to earn that badass chopper or jet through hard work not just buy it through microtransacions so people can just buy a hyrda and kill people in freeroam it kind of creates a Pay to WIn sort of gimic which im sure no gamer likes.And then there is this hacker problem I keep hearing about online. So far i havent seen any prove of any hackers yet maybe im lucky but I would not be surprised on the console versions i have seen hackers though so yeah i actually have seen some now I think about it. R* try and make your game fair for people who just want to have fun so we dont have to deal with thats damn b***s***.Sorry guys I like the game and the SP story but after that since some of R*'s updates can break the mods I heard it feels that even if you dont like online but you want to mod they screw that up so online would be the only thing that gets new content (Did i mention some vechiles are restricted to only online mode?). I find online fustrating to play on my own because how the community is (i am not saying you are all d***s im sure a lot of you are good people to play with its just i always get that one p***k in a attack chopper or laser jet killing evryone) If your hear for the mod you might have some enjoyment if it works just dont update the version of the game since it could corrupt them unless the mod authorse update them but if you intsall alot of mods like i do it will be annoying. The online more worth it? Despite what i said about it Yes actually (when it works) with friends or a good social group to play with (Just check out FunHaus on youtube they are awesome people to play with however there group might be full ( im sure there are over good groups that would accept you if they are nice) playing online on your own NOPE its just hell on your own.I personally would not reccomed this game unless R* fixes some of the problems with the updates breaking mods (they said themselves they were not against modding) and fix some of the online issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Repleneshed hope in life...I have put my final consensus first below it there is my initial release glimpse and my mid way review as well I would reccomend taking a look at them both for further information. There is also a video of GTA Online gameplay that I madeFinal Consensus In an age of commercial bound developers striving for profit over content replayability and fun I found Grand Theft Auto V. After giving up playing Watch Dogs from the disgustingly poor plot and unremarkable characters and finishing what I thought was a much better game at the time Shadow of Mordor in under 30 hours I was begining to believe that I was growing tired of video games and that it was time to put down the controller for something else. Fast forward a few months later and GTA V finally releases boy was I HYPED for this game. Hype aside after downing 8 hours in one day and finally hitting the sack the only emotion that I felt was dissapointment dissapointment in the entirity of the rest of the piece of gaming industry. Why you ask? Grand Theft Auto V was obviously crafted by the gods who else would release a game then completely redo it within 2 years changing nearly every mechanic about the game all for benefit? Who else would include a massive island (comparable to some Hawaiian islands) of content riddled with alleys forests subberbs factories deserts mountains and so much more meticulously detailed to the point that I was practiacally foaming at the mouth (Not many games are you able to look into trash cans and see every single article of trash). My god I havent even got to the vehicles... It seems like every other week there is an update that includes at least 3 4 new vehicles on top of the massive list of vehicles already available. Not only that but they released an entire MMO completely seperate from the game with complete character and vehicle customization an entire storyline with a HUGE amount of content and multiple events and social details... all included with the game FOR FREE. I haven't even skimmed the surface of what this game holds and I've sunk 85+ hours into it already. Content wise I would compare this game to Skyrim however it is FAR FAR FARRRR more detailed in terms of environment dialogue story creatures vehicles BUILDINGS PLANES CHARACTERS VOICE ACTING!!! Compare this game content wise and quality wise to any game and they pale in comparison. For instance The Witcher 3 (although the story is as good or better than GTA V's) has a massive world and great RPG elements and many enemies... it still doesn't have half the content of GTA V. I've beat that game in around 40 hours doing many side quests adventuring etc. GTA V on the other hand took me a whole 85+ hours to complete just the main story alone it was so much time that I had to cease playing so that it's greateness wouldn't taint my view of Shadow of Mordor Fallout 4 Dying Light and even The Witcher 3. I have to give this game a 10/10 because it is my favorite GTA game of all time (even above my previous favorite the original San Andreas) and it is by far one of my top 10 games of all time. First Day of Release Six hours down in one day last game that did that to me was Far Cry 3. Easily going to be one of my favorite games! Ill post a more detailed review when I get more hours into this!Update 6/18/2015 This is a great game by far some of the best graphics (if not THE best graphics) I've seen in a game. The story is rich the world is massive and there is TONS to do in it and the multiplayer is fun (yet frustrating in some aspects). One of the great things that Rockstar does is encourage players to get 100% completion (trough some special rewards) and this easily pulls me in and makes me spend large quantities of time playing. The multiplayer is especially fun when played with friends over skype etc. but can be frustrating when played with random players. Trolls are prevelant in this game as well as hardcore noobs which can easily cause a magnitude 10 migrane after failing a one hour long heist for the 20 somethingth time (LOOKING AT YOU PRISON BREAK). As a side note on this plane/helicopter pilots are the WORST!!! After making it through wave upon wave of enemies on the ground barely scraping through with near zero health with the finish line in sight after approximately ONE HOUR of gameplay suddenly the game stops and throws a massive depressing and extremely annoying failure sign at you because the pilot decides to try and do a barrel roll into the ocean at this point the game restarts from virtually the begining (minus a small car drive) and makes you redo the entire heist because someone can't keep their in their pants. It is because of this that I recommend to all of you PRACTICE your piloting skills so that you can do that aspect of the mission yourself and avoid the tragic fate that becomes of most heists. I will share a personal video below of a fraction of the instances in which this trolling has occured https //www.youtube.com/watch?v RDKjlThvCB0&amp feature youtu.be,Grand Theft Auto V

I try to stop running he keeps running and right into the police officer where he dies. FRANKY JUST CROUCH GODDAMNIT!Game requires you to disable GPU when hitting start and then enabling it before the games starts so it isn't running with integrated card.No matter how amazing your GPU is. If you play for almost 3 hours straight it will start having terrible errible lag and not stop.Also the game is having some startup issues that they had over 2 years to work on should this have been released NO! Should people have been more pateiesnt yes.Pro's No game is perfect but every game has it's up sides as well as the downsides.The game is beautifully animated and the graphics are pretty great.The game has a very nice well thought out story with amazing characters whether it be terrifying Trevor or Depressed Michael it's still a great game.THEY ADDED MORE CARS! With teh addition to new cars this game is even better than ever.The new director mode and movie maker is pretty amazing and user friendly. Takes some time getting used to but it's still very well addition to the game.The run down Yes Grand Theft Auto is a great game it was just rushed. And the fact that they had 2 years to make an un startable game is pretty dissapointing.... Also i never got my pre order bonus........Everythings fixed thats an old review,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-24,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V series is Rockstar's open world sleeper hit. In the midst of the glamorous city known as Los Santos three protagonists are wanting to fufill the American Dream. Franklin a reforming black man wants to be separated from his less than progressive criminal culture Trevor a personification of Grand Theft Auto players everywhere is a pyschopath pervert and perp all in one wanting to lead a business and is a follower of the Altruists and Michael a man trying to escape his criminal past and his friends. The game has been improved in almost all departments including gameplay graphics tighter but unrealistic driving a ton of new vehicles and content and a huge conversion of how missions play. The gun variety is mostly strong but made somewhat mundane due to the handling of all weapons being the same little variation in recoil and stability of the weapon used and can now be played entirely in a dedicated first person mode in the enhanced version which is sold here on Steam this helps immersion greatly at the expense of reducing flexibility in movement.Modifications for GTAV are less than appealing for the multi player but are plenty for singleplayer (Take2 has returned their decision on restricting mods) and the options menu is detailed and thorough with an exceptional amount of customizable features to their game which is a delight to see but this game is still rated negative for many other problems. Major Criticism SP Gameplay is very hit and miss gunplay is not nearly as bombastic as it was in GTAIV or GTA SA.. NPC's auto aggro if you stand near them which is idiotic antagonistic and unrealistic. Cannot throw objects like GTAIV which could be used to ragdoll opponents. Severe lack of coherent narrative and mostly empty other half of Los Santos. Notably poorer scripting. Dan Houser does not know how to write intelligent characters at all proof? Michael engages in cuckoldry with a Latino man with his wife then proceeds to be ok with this behavior who he lets lest he get divorced. Franklin is a token black character with no nascent personality and remains the middleman in the latest entry. Trevor is a forgottable one trick pony character emphasising all of the mannerisms a common GTA player would do.Many of the minor characters deliver lines in bland rather expositionary expressions and over extend their lines. They do not deliver lines of any memorable kind or affect the storyline. The personalities are not as nascent as they were in San Andreas or IV. A lot of old characters are killed off who were from GTA IV further hurting the bond I can associate with the game. The game's atmosphere feels that of a cheesy 80's sitcom cheap and tacky rather than representing a world of corruption under the guise of a free life it feels forced than natural. On GTA O Worst multiplayer community I've seen in years of playing. Not so much as communication but rather the skills of players on premades who do not work as cohesively as one might imagine. No mods or dedicated to them online (thank you Rockstar for telling modders with a big middle finger Poes Law be damned). Aimbot lite as a form of aim assist you know it would be nice to be matchmaked with someone who actually can aim manually Rockstar!The single player and online modes itself feel unfinished as the rural parts of Los Santos have no new cities to discover and the missions are mediocre (as in spoon fed mainstream hold your hand bullshít and are semi linear). Cops are ridiculously overpowered with pinpoint accuracy and extreme persistence than before. Animals can also ""call"" the cops on you no joke. In any of the hiests expect frequent mission failures griefing (inside/outside of Passive Mode) drop outs and empty sessions.Single player content is remarkably short for the price and is designed for emergent gameplay but it fails at this due to the linearity of the storyline and it's designed around this awkward system which must be followed to a strict parameters which makes long missions not fun especially heists (SP/MP). Customization feels tacked on and doesn't influence statistics like it did in GTA SA taking away from the immersion of building your template character of Carl Johnson into avatar of your liking Trevor Franklin and Michael can't get fit fat or really skinny or change essential parts of their skills or utilize the statistics for making the game more interesting. No Casino estate is available in the game to gamble and purchase as property. Exploration is far worse than previous GTA's laking the ability to enter buildings like that in GTAIV.Rockstar North also has a track record for being incredibly shady including shark cards which don't get processed banning players for the actions of the modders scandalous pricing even after purchasing and confirming Shark Card purchases refusing to lower the price of the main game after 3 years and that includes DLC for online. There is no DLC for the single player experience in this game meaning the single player content is remarkably shorter than the multiplayer proof? Check all the DLC for the Singleplayer and compare it to Online's boisterous collection.The loading screens are a major problem especially online with incessant and incredibly long on a rig that can run Battlefield 1 Crysis and modded versions of many CPU/GPU demanding games on Maximum/Custom settings takes no less than 30 to 1 minute to load...but on GTAV Online this goes up to almost 3 4 to an ASTOUNDING 10 minutes on a Goddamn SSD! An additional extra dollop of time if you get kicked or someone in lobby by some idiot that decides to leave after failing a mission 5 to 20 times. ""Exceedingly Postitive"" as a ranking on the Store Page is deciet the game is a worse version of GTAIV and lacks the charm the modder's version of this in San Andreas of Online was far better handled than this.",Grand Theft Auto V

The scope of this game is just unprecedented characters have true depth the gorgeous open world is teeming with life and activities and the storyline covers a vast range of exciting topics. Hilariously witty and crazily epic GTA V tells an emotional story of betrayal greed and struggle that every gamer must own and experience at some point in their life.Rating 1 A masterpiece. An essential purchase for everyone.2 Great game. Highly recommended to most people.3 Fairly good game. Recommended mainly for fans of the genre or when on sale.4 Poor game. Not recommended but has a few merits.5 Awful game. Would not recommend to anyone in their right minds.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-14,0,0,483,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is my top game for number of hours played because it is an awesome open world sandbox of fun. The game has single player offline storyline and a multiplayer online mode. The single player has a series of main missions and several side missions which can account for many hours of gameplay. Since the game is open world it is easy to get lost in exploring trying new vehicles or exploding random parts of the world.The multiplayer game is a game with a game within a game within a The open world mode has mini tasks as well as a choice to play hundreds of mini games. There hardly seems like a limit to the game with the number of different modes and matches you can participate in.Rockstar consistently adds new content (vehicles clothing game modes new gameplay etc.) on a monthly basis. I could hardly describe the number of different objectives and game modes within the multiplayer online mode of GTA 5. Some of my favorites are the heists motorcycle clubs deadline mode kill quota vehicle vendetta stunt races and the user made rockets vs. insurgents.GTA 5 is a blast of a time with friends and it feels like a few dozen games in one.,Grand Theft Auto V

The crux of the game is these 3 characters and what happens when they meet. As a hardcore GTA fanatic this game managed to surpass my expectations. After experiencing GTA IV on PC and what a crappy port it was I had lower expectations for the sequel but when the reviews from the PS3 and X360 versions started pouring in I was ecstatic and waiting for the day when it would be ported to PC. If you're fan of GTA this is one not to be missed. The mod community is so much fun and I always love trying out new mods. This is a 100% thumbs up ),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-18,0,0,385,False,Recommended,I found GTA V to be an enjoyable experience I found GTA Online to be both interesting and fun to play though just like any other online game the grinding just doesn't feel worth it even more angering was the ability to purchase shark cards to skip all the wait after having already purchased GTA V. I also found that GTA Online has many feautres that I felt should be added to singleplayer as without the storyline singleplayer seems quite barren and once you are rich there seems like there is nothing to do which is highly dissapointing. Back to GTA Online I felt GTA Online was constantly rushing me to blow millions that I didn't have yet pushing me torwards shark cards for example the phonecalls you get every time you login asking you to purchase something as well as the emails telling me it's the deal of a lifetime yet I get it every single time I login. GTA Online also genuinly seems like it tries to make ways to make money boring and repetitive without being too obvious. If you remove the blatant Shark Card advertising the constant modders annoying legit players common internet trolls the mundaneness of singleplayer the slow loading even on a top of the line PC and the constantly rising prices of GTA Online I would say GTA V &amp GTA Online were enjoyable experiences that will definetly have me coming back for more though I do wish Rockstar Norh would listen to its fans for once. I do not belive GTA V (Including GTA Online) is worth $60. I would pay $30 for GTA V (Including GTA Online) which I did. Do I recommend this game? Yes.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everyone has a great gaming computer and fast internet connection so it's definitely unreasonable that the loading time is so long. Bad online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-02-16,0,0,195,False,Recommended,Bought it at $50 for a 180 hours of Realistic 3D mayhem which is located in Los Santos (California). Such masterpiece work of a game. GTA Online is free to play BUT it is PAY TO WIN (or Pay to Enjoy) everything cost money and money can be earned by purchasing with REAL MONEY. Good thing Hacking was an option.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now users like myself have lost 30+ hours of gameplay due to you not using the features handed to you on the dominant platform of PC gaming.Anyone that hasnt upgraded to Windows 10 just yet make sure you go out of your way to back up your save file for this game.

2016-02-16,0,0,84,False,Recommended,Good game Good story. Nothing really remarkable though. LA city has been extremely simplified and reduced in size. Too much focus set in multiplayer leaves singleplayer somehow not so relevant. It is simply not fun to go around the city and take a walk or call a friend NPC like in previous games. Minigames are simply not fun enough. 8.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Characters are distinct and react the way you'd expect them to. Graphics (especially with some of the mods) are amazing. Never really got into the online aspect. Tried a bit but as a newb felt a little overwhelmed. Might be nice if next time they give some of us players that are not great with PVP a few more options.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-15,0,0,634,False,Not Recommended,The best way to describe this is as one giant meh. The fun times in it are awesome and full of dubious stunts and crazy times with friends or that rare awesome rando. The bad times are much more common on the other hand whether its being trolled by people using mod menus people in lobbies begging for cash drops the game freezing or crashing trying to load in after missions or while simply modding your vehicle in the mod shop. In any other game these frequent crashes would not be an issue but in a almost six year old game compiled with long online session load times its just absurd. If you have a group of three other friends than i strongly suggest this game if you have access to a large sum of money to buy in game cash buy this game if you want to hack or cheat and troll and get away with it buy this game. If you want to enjoy GTA like you used to stay away because this isnt that game.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you want my advice give the s# t up.""I'll make it known here what I've told everybody else Grand Theft Auto V is absolutely amazing memorable and worth the ticket price for the Single Player Campaign alone let alone the Online aspects. The Evolution of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) hit a high note with GTA V's release boasting an Amazing Soundtrack Incredible Graphics and an insanely Action Packed Intense Cinematic Story Campaign.Grand Theft Auto V also comes packaged with Grand Theft Auto Online an MMO esque Los Santos. Rockstar Games keeps the online portion alive &amp active with Constant Updates Ban Waves of Cheaters and Occasional Rockstar Hosted Events. Personally I believe over the years of it's release it has become ""too much of a grind"" and has lost a lot of general enjoyment but Rockstars recent updates (as of 2017) have really brought Life and Love back to Grand Theft Auto Online.After release Rockstar Games talked of additonal Single Player Content but these plans have since been abandoned/not spoken of since which leaves me and many others disappointed. People want more content because the Single Player Campaign was simply stunning and superb.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-30,0,0,67,False,Recommended,Great game but public lobbies can be chaotic with modders and griefers making money is kind of hard with all the cool stuff like the cars guns and planes (to name a few). Another thing is that try to get friends to play it with you because from what I have seen PC is more toxic and unfriendly than PS4 or Xbox but it may be different for you. It's a fun game and if you are thinking about getting it just do it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-24,0,0,840,False,Not Recommended,I'm editing my review from positive to negative.The first couple of weeks the online was great. Some griefers here and there but that's the name of the game. Fast forward just a bit and the lobbies started filling up with cheaters. They fixed this issue for a bit maybe half a year ago but the issue is back.You are lucky to find a session without any cheaters. Everything in the game has gotten really expensive to boost the sales of shark cards (Rockstars microtransactions). It is nice to see them still support the game with new content drops but it is really hard to enjoy the content without a working anti cheat system in place.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-29,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,"Incredibly long loading screens an inflated economy modders and hackers all over the place NPC's eat bullets like its their friggen breakfast you uncontrollably go into a ragdoll with no way of recovering whenever you go up steep slopes there is official main menu that acts as a central hub for the game instead you only get the initial load up to a hub that you cannot go back to without restarting the game. Why is that important? Because their servers are so garbage that often times you just cannot get online and it will unload all of online and then reload your singleplayer instead of bringing you to a main menu thus doubling the already long laod times. Its rediculously fun when it works but that is so rare the game isn't worth more than 15$.Edit Sorry for any confusion this review is primarily about ONLINE. The main game is fun though in my opinion does not have much replay value.I have also discovered that you can get automatically banned for varying increments of time with NO explaination. I can only assume I was banned for recieving money bags online since I've heard of this happening and I did not cheat/exploit. Rockstar states on their website that they ""will most likely not respond to most messages regarding bans"". Great customer service. Fantastic.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-09,0,0,70,False,Recommended,'Ruining Your Fun Makes My Fun More Funning!'Singple Player Good game in Single player the story was well written for the characters the missions were challenging and entertaining. Few bits of missions that were very irritating with multiple deaths but once figured out you could get past them.Multiplayer Great fun if you can get a lobby that isn't full of 14 year old trolltards chinese spammers(no idea what they're saying it's just a bunch of squares) and guys that spend a of money to cheat in the game. Soooooo never. Everything you need to do in the game requires in game money to set up. You go out to try and make that money? Some chucklef**k comes along and screws that up. Got a shipment of crates to take to your warehouse? Some asshat in a chopper comes along and blows you up. Running to chase down an NPC in a gang fight? Some cheater locks your character in place and drops sticky bombs on you then teleports to your respawn location to do it over and over. Want to do this in a private/invite only server? Nope Rockstar says 'F**k that'. Any of the money generating activities are locked out.Long story short a great SP game by Rockstar with huge MP potential marred by the genetic detrius that should have been eliminated by natural selection/competent eugenics program.I recommend this only for Single Player since Trevor is amazing.,Grand Theft Auto V

Just ignore the bodies!Let's face it is there anything cooler than heating up the coast in a muscle car at sunset while ""Carry on Wayward Son"" from Kansas is roaring out on the radio? Little or nothing. GTA V gushes over with details it literally throws them at you but in the end it's the comparatively small moments like this exhilarating trip along the coastal road which make a big whole out of it.GraphicsThe leap from Last Gen to Current Gen was powerful the one from the new consoles to the PC is not so huge anymore. At least not if you don't happen to have a 4K capable system at home. Nevertheless GTA V looks best on a PC. This is mainly due to the higher farsightedness and the crisper textures. As already mentioned with a good middle class computer you are well equipped to enjoy Los Santos.GameplayEverything should have been said about the plot by now and more than once. But for the sake of completeness and for all those who have lived under a stone in the last years here is a quick outline unlike in the predecessors we experience the story of GTA V with three different protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor all criminals.Trevor and Michael are old pals (Michael calls Trevor his best friend at one point) who pulled off bank robberies together years ago. Franklin is a little crook who happens to cross Michael's path. Michael disappointed by his son sees Franklin as a kind of replacement offspring and takes him under his wing. During the course of the story the three slide deeper and deeper into a swamp of gangster and private problems out of which there are three possible ways out at the comparatively unspectacular end.Some of the missions we complete with all three some with only two protagonists often we are on our own. The latter especially at the beginning when the fates of the three have not yet intertwined so closely. Which of the three characters we control depends on the situation sometimes we decide for ourselves by simply switching to the protagonist of our choice. One of the core pieces of the game are the large scale raids which are always preceded by a planning phase (spying on a situation) and then a procurement phase (vehicles gadgets) before they finally get down to business according to previously defined plans A or B. The game is played on a large scale.An early example the robbery of a jeweler can be carried out with brute force of arms or with the support of narcotic gas through the ventilation shafts. The choice of procedures alone increases the replay value of GTA V enormously. But also smaller variables contribute to this like the fact that some missions can be initiated by one or the other character and thus each have a different beginning.GTA V is often accused that there are hardly any highlights and too many missions run according to the pattern ""go there complete the task run away"". Basically this is true but the missions always carry small and bigger unexpected surprises in themselves. The fervor with which Michael Franklin and Trevor fulfil their destinies and tasks as well as the trenchantly drawn side characters leave no chance for boredom. And those who are looking for a little distraction from the everyday life of a gangster will just throw themselves into one of the numerous secondary occupations such as tennis golf triathlon or going to the cinema.Trevor on the other hand should repel and upset most players from the very first moment. Rockstar already takes care of this in his introductory scene (after about four to five hours of playing time). At the latest however with the sufficiently controversial and extremely long torture scene it should become clear to everyone that the developers want to deliberately provoke with Trevor. I think this has been done more than successful!ContentMassive open world with tons of main missions side missions and stuff to do. Additionally you can mod and change the game to your heart's desire.Recommended?Unrestricted buy recommendation for everyone who loves crude humor and action. And the open game world and physics effects invite you more and more to a funny rampage.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-25,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Brilliant game in so many aspects. There are endless things that you can do in this open world and it's variety of environments leaves you in awe. My only one wish for this game is for mods to be available on the steam workshop (as I have limited knowledge installing mods) and for modded online servers that allow for even more unique scenarios and roleplay with friends. One other thing I would love since they went to so much effort to create such a variety of hobbies that you can participate in (tennis golf etc.) is that they including some hunting/fishing minigames for the next game they create. Apart from this I'd say it's the near perfect game one of the best games out there. The driving mechanics are really fun while maintaining some decent realism (when flat on the road) the variety of things you can do and replayability is beyond any other game I've seen and the gun mechanics/aiming is decent as well. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-18,0,0,130,False,Recommended,I am not into multiplayer so I don't know about bans character deletes by rockstar. My review is for single player. For single player story and attention to world creation is great by rockstar. Activities are nice too. But this is rpg and there is pretty much no scope to impact story based on your actions 95% of the game progresses regardless of your choices in a fixed way you can merely change partners in heist. There is pretty much 0 side questing. Despite being released in 2015 for PC the graphics animations look dated AC 4 had a lot better graphics and it was released an year before. After taking so much time to release for PC and charging full price 1.5 year after initial releae you'd expect rockstar to deliver value. Overall it's a decent game but you cannot ignore glaring shortcomings I mentioned above if you are into RPGs. It's hard to recommend at it's full retail price of 60$. 20$ 30$ might be good price for this.Edit Changing the game to recommended for it's current price ( 25$ on my store). For less than 30 bucks you get a very decent Action game experience. Still not sure whether to call this an RPG.,Grand Theft Auto V

Then you have to factor RNG of the pubs whether or not they do stupid things and cause the whole mission to restart repeatedly and get increasingly frustrating. All those cool stuff i mentioned cost alot of money which is incredibly difficult to earn in game without investing lots and lots of hours. *****Game takes FOREVER to load. You can start the game take a shower have dinner take a come back and the game could still be loading. Maybe even take a short nap too. And this is if your computer is decent. If it's not that good then don't even bother buying the game. While there's lots of stuff to do some of them do require you to do missions in a public lobby and you always have to factor in random players hunting you down just for the thrill of it. It's worse if they have weapons and vehicles to use against you that you have no access to but if you are able to fight back then it shouldn't be too depressing.TL DR GTA V Grand Theft Loading after five years they still haven't found a way to improve it all rockstar has done in their patches is add in new stuff or put up sales they should really consider doing something about that loading time.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can press ""M"" and in the options you can set yourself up to be in ""Passive Mode"". That means people can't kill you shoot you run you over blow you up knife you hijack you or otherwise inconvenience you. The downside is while in ""Passive Mode"" you can't use weapons can't punch or mug citizens get involved in random events or participate in server events. You can however steal cars go into stores start or join missions/races/death matches/etc... So there are plusses and minuses.Over all my single player and on line experiences have been great and I think the game was well worth the money I spent to get it.

I've played a fair bit of MP which is fun and can now see where all the new DLC and content has gone but really disappointed that RS have just neglected those fans of the SP experience.10/10 for story gameplay and content obviously0/10 for story DLC,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-02-23,0,0,225,False,Recommended,Let s cut to the chase GTA V is one of the best games ever go get it immediately!Now if you want to know more let s expand it a bit then.The game is fun and really solid in every way the controls and playability are well implemented and responsive.On the technical side it has some really stunning and beautiful graphics and effects the city looks gorgeous and the countryside desert zones woods beaches mountains etc. are just amazing.The sea is what impressed me the most IMO it s over the top it feels very realistic and when you stand near the shore you feel video games will never be the same again if a virtual sea can be this overwhelming. It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it.I m very happy with this version yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless. As a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do it feels huge!Coop is really fun and amazing with lots of unlockable missions races heists sports shopping activities and a lot more to do plus they keep adding more and more content.The story mode is well developed and it has funny characters (in their own GTA way). The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be in a rated M GTA). At first I thought the idea of having 3 characters simultaneously was strange and probably not good but when you play it you realize it works really well.Gameplay wise driving is well implemented intuitive and feels natural shooting swimming running and moving around are too. The game is cool as it is on 3d person already but it adds the bonus of a 1st person experience you can switch on the go and it s really nice too. And with so many types of vehicles ground air and sea and a lot of guns at your disposal it never feels repetitive or boring. I love clothing and shopping I have spent hours in the clothing stores shopping is fun!On the sound department the effects are stunning and I love the soundtrack! a lot of GTA V songs now are part of my personal playlists. In general a lot of attention was given to every little detail. This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth. I absolutely love it.So once again if you don t have it yet what are you waiting for? you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this.See ya in Los Santos!,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm not impressed they have some bugs to fix/squash Fallout 4 is my new crack this game I'm regreting buying but it's way past the refund period. so to any lil punks that only play to have fun other people off through means outside of regular shooting bombing and other wise normal gameplay good for you you've killed something that was fun. My thumbs up is for the main part of the game NOT the online. that part is BS.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-03,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Incredible graphics and story. GTA 5 is my favorite game of all time. I got it on the 360 and then on the XB1. Always held off buying on PC because it was too expensive for me considering I beat it twice but with the steam summer sale I had to grab it again. Not a huge fan of GTA Online but it is still a very impressive multiplayer mode considering all its expansions and having the open world to explore.Highly recommend!,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-03,0,0,184,False,Recommended,"CONS Load times Oh my god I hate the load times in this game. In Online they can range anywhere from 3 20 minutes and thats normal! Sometimes you can get upwards of 30 mins or more wait times! There are some bugs with loading times too were it will just keep perpetually loading without finding a lobby. This happens more often though when you are entering or exiting buildings with warps. I also hate the unskippable start screen on GTA V it's just makes the process of trying to get in the game that much painful.Grinding Many people when they start to play GTA Online play for maybe a couple months and then quit because you have to grind so much to get any of the cool vehicles weapons etc. Trying to get money in the game is hard enough but leveling up is even harder.Modders/Cheaters and GTA Online Anti Cheat In my opinion probably the worst part of GTA Online. I'll talk about the anti cheat first. Well it's crap. It makes Valves anti cheat look like God's gift. I'd say a good 1/6 or 1/7 people in this game are cheaters/modders. Sometimes I don't understand how they are able to explode everyone in a lobby and not get atleast suspended. The worst part is that as many people of you have heard people who don't cheat are being banned or suspended for no reason by Rockstars anti cheat. Now lets get on to the modders themselves. Most of the modders dont do much and are usually just driving around in expensive vehicles or whatever. There are a handful though that like to just grief the server killing anyone they see. And if they off about something they may explode the entire server for as long as they want watching everyone suffer. And sometimes they can do the unspeakable and mess up someones account for good. One of my friends was playing GTA Online when he was put in a bad sport lobby all of his properties and vehicles where taken away and he couldn't do anything to get it back. He contacted rockstar support but they didn't help either (more on that later). Then theres the once in a blue moon ""nice"" modder that basically gives everyone money drops.Rockstar Support It is horrible they have this copy and paste response for everything. They never actually have someone reply back to you. Like I said earlier when my friend's aaccount got hacked he submited a ticket to rockstar asking them to fix his account but they gave him a message saying his account was manually deleted even though he mever deleted it.After this he submitted another report ticket but this time with video proof. He got the exact same copy and paste message saying he manually deleted his account. He gave up from there becuase he obviously knows that most of the Rockstar Support team ar bots.Menu/Settings Changing your settings in this game is probably the worst out of any game I have played. When changing some settings to optimize the games performance you have to restart your game evertime and it's just a pain because you also have to go through the start screen which takes forever. Then if you want to run a benchmark after it finishes you also have to restart your game. So if you are trying to optimize the game you may have to restart your gay 4 8 times.Controls I don't have too much of a problem with on foot controls but aircraft and heli controls suck. You use WASD to either rotate the aircraft on helicopter ot use rudders on planes and to accelerate and deccelerate. You use numpad keys 4568 to steer the aircraft in a direction. This is already a problem for people without numpad keys like people with smaller keyboards or people with laptops with no numpad. It seems easy at first but the control feel clunky and unnatural especially with helis as it can be hard to land correctly with out crashing. It would of been 100x better if they used mouse to steer. I always keep a controller plugged into my pc so whenever I have to use any air vehicles I just use that becuase it is way easier to control on a controller.PROS I don't have much for this but that isn't bad because these couple pros are the main things I enjoy about this game.Gameplay Driving around in cars blowing things up. THE GAME IS FUN. There is so much to do in the game! You can have races you can play deathmatches do heists with friends. You can do whatever you want! I have gone hours on this game without getting bored becuase there is so much to do and explore.Graphics Nothing to really say the game looks great for a game from 5 years ago and has aged well.Replayability Since the game hs so much to do I usually wind up messing around with my friends in a lobby. The game always has someting new to do and thats the reason I keep coming back to it. Overall right now I rate this game a 7/10You may criticize me for this review becuase I only have a little above 100 hours on this game (At the time of this review) but I used to play this all the time on the XBOX One and later transferred to PC. I know some aspects of the game are different on console but most are the same. So I hope this doesn't degrade the credibility of this review.",Grand Theft Auto V

All though the shark cars and money cards are WAYYY over priced. And I wasted my haed eraned cash on it.

2016-12-25,0,0,759,False,Not Recommended,"Postive ReviewThis is a great game for singleplayer and multiplayer for the PS4 and XboxOne great story for singleplayer I love it I love Franklin Michael and Trevor. Especially Trevor he makes me laugh and choose only him when I want to go a rampage and kill as many people as I can. GTA Online fun as hell as long as to get into the right lobbies. I got banned twice for modding which was my fault but Rockstar only banned for 2 weeks each time I finally learned my lesson and have not been banned since I go into closed friends servers mostly because there's a lot of modders and cheaters in the public servers. I do not recoommend GTA V for the PC to many hackers and modders. Pros Great story Rockstar did a great job making it. You get to switch between 3 different characters You get to own businesses and penthouses in GTA Online Fun game to go on a rampage with Trevor Get to do a lot of different heists Great game of the seriesNegative Cons Little kids trolls cheaters and bullies on GTA Online. ""I've loved playing this game all the time I have 100+ hours into it just on PC until today the greatful day that I got ""Banned"" for GTA Online. Sadly enough this situation has made me not want to play the game any more and Rockstar has bothered replying to my ticket that I sent them. Another thing is that when this game came out for PC I sold my Consoles and invested $1500+ to be able to play the game maxed out. I really don't care about the stupid Single player because I've beat it with my brother on Console so when it came out on PC it gave me a way to play with my Friend online but now I can't I will be deletting the game and probably won't ever be on it again. Note to all who want to buy this game You can't trust anyone online or be willing to help them because they can report you can if RockStar finds anything in your record you can be banned for 14days forever! So keep that in mind when buying the game."" Snow Eira Do I rerecommend this game for both single and multiplayer yes yes I do. After doing more research and thinking I do not put the blame on Rockstar I put the blame on their publisher Take 2 interactive. Please do not let any of the negative Not recommend reviews taint your view about this game. All of them must have done something to get targetted and banned. Get the game and see for yourself if you like you have the right to do so.

Hang out with your friends in your favorite game where you can literally do everything you want. Like a triple A garry's mod.2016 Just like promised free DLC! Well... free. You have to grind a lot. But nobody gives a because everyone spends hours and hours into this game and now that heists are coming everyone has a chance to get easy riches and at the same time have fun! I mean come on it's a heist! Everyone loves heists!OOPS cancerous kids appeared! They're ruining the game by friendly firing in heists ramming in races and exploiting the CEO update! Eh but nobody cares since we can make private lobbies with friends. We don't even have to worry about single player ""Events""!OOPS! For some reason maxed out graphics look like now! Reflections are black and not even mods can fix this. Oh well let's wait for a patch.2017 OOPS! DLCs are now exclusive to GTA Online! Which means GTA V Singleplayer has been completely abandoned! Oh well that makes it more rewarding to get the cars in GTA Online also because we can create private lobbies!OOPS! Creating a private lobbie now causes one of these six things to happen!1) Get banned for cheating or cause your friends to be banned for cheating and be hated by them.2) Get disconnected.3) Crash and get your character corrupted AND saved to the cloud so there's no way to recover it.4) Your friend will be too focused in the grindfest to give two about you OR they will be bored of this game because kids ruined it.5) A kid hacks into your private server and starts shooting rockets at your car and making meteors fall from the sky then he gives you 900000000000XP to get you banned again.6) OOPS connection problems! Now you're only going to play in Strict NAT public servers with 'bad sports' enabled only full of modders and ""9000000000 XP 69696969696969 $"" deathmatches.Did i mention Rockstar and Take Two now got a policy to NOT disclose the reason you got banned? Oh and did i mention that modding this game in single player now also gets you banned? Yeah! Also cars cost 3 million now and are completely exclusive to GTA Online which means you are now forbidden from having fun in singleplayer! And you cannot even steal low tier sport cars in GTA Online. In a game called GRAND THEFT AUTO. Let that sink in.2018 GTA V Launcher has stopped working. On every pc i have. No matter how many times i format. Tried advice from 12 different forums. GTA V is dead. Only way left to play GTA V is getting a pirated copy and modding it. But even then any version beyond 1.41 will cause the GTA V Launcher to crash.Thanks Take Two.

2016-01-19,0,0,232,False,Not Recommended,Short and honest A singleplayer that lacks real depth (unless you install mods of course) with an Online mode that basically forces you to either play hundreds of hours to buy a car or spend real money so you may flex on these online nibblets and actually have a chance in defending yourself.Game is so so it works and runs okay ish on medium budget PC's. Just don't get it for the Online Mode. You've got problems such as The aforementioned money grind the following microtransaction problem Hackers that drop all the money some people spent months grinding or worse even real moneyGlitches that wipe your online save and leave you with nothing A kind of boring gameplay routine Online Freeroaming mode would be fun if people who have a lot of money didn't have an advantage.In the end the main focus of this game is the Online mode which really isn't worth it.If you're in it for the Singleplayer experience maybe with a couple of mods it is still worth checking out though.Don't forget though make up your own mind.Read reviews to get an idea of something don't adapt to the reviewers opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,"Update 16.06.2017 you Take 2 you Rockstar.You are not getting any more of my money after this Долгожданный (во многих смыслах) релиз от Рокстар на ПК наконец удался. После серии отвратительных релизов они всё таки смогли не подвести хотя бы один раз. До чего мы дошли приходится хвалить за казалось бы банальные и обязательные вещи _ Вкратце об игре это GTA. Если вы не знаете что это такое лучше поиграйте в GTA III Vice city и San andreas. Если знаете но с подозрением относитесь к серии после отвратительного GTA IV не сомневайтесь и играйте в V игра стала больше лучше веселее.Описывать геймплей как то не с руки поэтому просто пройдусь по плюсам минусам.Плюсы Три разных главных героя. Интересная система которая по началу слегка раздражала (тяжело сосредоточиться и вжиться в персонажей постоянно переключаясь между ними) но потом начала нравиться. Великолепный реднек Тревор это точно шедевр. Франклин практически классический ""правильный парень с района"". Майкл самый дурацкий персонаж но даже у него были свои моменты. Визуальное оформление. Ну или как там говорят... ""графон""? Я честно говоря не особо упарываюсь по текстурам и количеству полигонов но общее графическое оформление горы вода виды из самолётов и с мостов закаты и просто спортивные машины всё очень гармонично и красиво. В продолжение предыдущего пункта вид от первого лица. Вот уж не ожидал что мне это так понравится. В результате примерно треть игры по времени я использовал вид от первого лица. Очень интересный опыт. Единственное что FOV из автомобиля от первого лица выглядит как будто бы персонаж дальнозоркий карлик и управлять машиной (особенно на холмистой или горной местности) просто невозможно. Но в целом очень круто. Эффект погружения мать его. Жду не дождусь когда я буду играть в GTA VII на Окулус рифте. Радио. Всегда было сильной частью всех серий GTA и тут с дизайном радио всё очень хорошо. Реклама очень в стиле этого мирка где рекламируют не электронные сигареты а электронные трубки с креком и героином а основная марка импортного пива PissWasser (Вассер это вода а что такое писс я думаю можете догадаться D). Talk radio это фактически отдельные несколько часов юмора которые можно слушать вне игры. Дополнительная мишура в игре есть но она не навязывает себя абсолютно. Можно проигнорировать 50% контента пройти игру до финала и остаться довольным. И не нужно возить своего брата недоумка в боулинг слава всем богам за это. (NIKO IT'S YOUR COUSIN...)нейтралочка Сюжет есть и слава богу. Физика вождения у меня не вызвала особых чувств. Наверное потому что я не разбираюсь и вообще не очень люблю гонки. Тюнинг туда же хотя он вроде как норм. Размер карты. Как ни странно карта мне показалась довольно маленькой. Или может... неразнообразной что ли. Хотя объективно она вроде как больше чем все предыдущие карты. Не знаю тут непонятно.Минусы Стрельба в игре сбалансированна под слепых инвалидов играющих одной рукой. (Ну или консольщиков примерно одно и то же). У двух из трёх героев ""спец. способность"" делает тривиальным любой замес в игре. Пушки (которых очень много. Штук 30) различаются весьма слабо апгрейды оружия однотипные редкие и стрёмные. Разницы между стартовым пистолетом и супер топовой пушкой примерно ноль. В голову всё убивает с первого выстрела. Баги всё же были. Один баг например я так и нашёл как исправить и из за этого не могу продвинуться по одной второстепенной сюжетной линии. Инноваций почти нет. Да три персонажа. Да вид от первого лица. Тут не поспорить супер. Ну собственно и всё. Всё остальное уже было и в принципе не то чтобы сильно хуже. Для игры с названием ""ВЕЛИКИЙ УГОН АВТОМОБИЛЯ"" маловато угона автомобиля. Не обычного бытового ""дай сюда свою рандомную машину"" а каких то миссий с этим связанных (их в игре я нашёл ровно 2 из сотни). Каких нибудь очень красивых уникальных автомобилей не хватает. Как то так. На мой вкус маловат упор на собственность/бизнесы/деньги. Нет я понимаю что игра не про великого регионального менеджера макдональдсов но всё же даже в vice city (или SA) с этим было гораздо интересней и лучше. А ещё можно торговать акциями.В целом не играя в GTA ONLINE я уже поиграл в GTA V 55 часов и я думаю что это хорошая длина для сингл плеер игры.Если бы не было GTA IV то эта итерация серии была бы 10/10 инновационным шедевром. А так добротная работа над ошибками от Рокстар и 8.5 9/10",Grand Theft Auto V

However running at recommended specs (760 &amp FX 6630) I didn't find it to look any better than the PS4 version other than the addition of 60 FPS. And actually SOME of the textures look worse than the PS4 version (this is at normal texture settings).

2018-09-15,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Offline Yes it is a great game with a great story line. It is fun and engaging yet at the same time it allows you to explore the massive map which by itself give you hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of gameplay. Overall the offline part of the game is incredible and offers a lot of fun and replability.Online It is a great mode that the game offers and it is the main reason why I can spend many more hours playing. So far I've spent most of my time online and it's been great. The people can be toxic at times (i.e blowing up everything causing incredible lag) but you can always run an invite only server. I've heard of random banning etc. but I haven't experienced this so far. Conclusion A good game and should be on the list for nay PC gamers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-15,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"Note I feel like I'm going to stir some crap up by saying this is a bad game. It's not. GTA V Story mode is a good game with a lot of fun gameplay mechanics. I wish the same could be said about GTA Online. Heck I wish there was a different section for reviews for GTA Online. So I can tell you truly how bad that is without on the Story. But for the sake of trying to make a clear explanation I guess I will have to divide that section up myself.GTA V Story Mode I really liked playing as all three main characters in this game with all of them having different unique skills special abilities side missions and things to do. I love the ability to switch characters at any point in the game and it shows them doing something while I'm not controlling them. Like they actually have some sort of ""life"". The gameplay mechanics isn't that different from previous games of the franchise which makes it easy to get into although I do wish they added more into the base game to allow for a more diverse experience and more actions or controls in game. The graphics well I guess they are pretty good. Not 2018 good as of today's standards(of when I am currently reviewing this game) but still good. I enjoy the variety of weapons and cars and the ability to mod them is pretty great allows you to change up the game a bit. You can add extended magazines or scopes or supressors to the gun of your choice which is a nice touch. The police do tend to get a bit annoying like I do one little thing (that even i don't think is illegal) and I get a 1 star which isn't great when you are trying to get somewhere while also have to hide from the police. I also enjoy the small activities like playing darts golfing going drinking or ""taking a hit from the bong"" in the game. Kinda gives you that feeling of freedom to do what you want. I do wish they had more activities which I imagine might be hard to program in but still possible. Like playing basketball surfing skateboarding or rollerskating. I mean they put GOLF and TENNIS in there so I think it could've been done. I kinda want the game to feel like you aren't restricted. And by that i don't mean MORE options for crime I mean more activities. The story overall was a great one and was executed well with some level of character progression and a lot of fun scenes. Franklin and Lamar are my favorite duo just because of the funy stuff they get up to. Trevor is just...insane but he allows you to just play it like a mass murdering psycho which at some points you would want to do because it's pretty fun. Michael was also great a different experience to the others with him having a crazy family while also trying to stay retired but can't because of all the events that happen in the game. Eventually it would reach the point where these three have met and pull of multiple heists growing more ambitious and larger. But...no spoilers. So GTA...great game.GTA Online GTA Online...is a mess a total disgrace from the story. Constantly bothered with twenty hundred calls from these npc's about having to buy something with money I don't have. Well money that I should've had if my character wasn't deleted simply because I haven't play GTA Online for a year. The growing amount of updates that add all these new things to the game sounds fun but actually isn't. It's a process of grinding for long periods of time to which at the end of it you won't be left feeling very satisfied. Even with all these new things it still has many problems starting with the players. I know i know GTA Online play with others in a crime game allowing you to do whatever the hell you want. And some of that freedom allows you to kill other players. And it gets annoying if you want to do some things without being bothered by others.That's the thing you can't do anything without other people interfering or helping. You can't do heists by yourself(because you need others) you can't do these stupid pickup missions by yourself(because you are playing in a open lobby) and some of the open world activities you can't do by yourself. Because not only do they require ""more than 1 player"" but some of it is also all open for the taking. You want to go steal that slow truck and bring it back to base for a mission that YOU started? You are bound to run into 10 others that will take it away from you because it alerts them of what you are doing. And they will constantly ruin your day. Not their problem they just want to have fun and kill some noobs. But I don't want to be killed...like a noob.Thank god they have a solo mode for the online. A solo mode that is stripped of most functionality that you would have if you played with others but still better than constantly earraped by children and killed by others and hackers. I mean a lot of these updates and activities require you to be some sort of VIP or CEO which would need you to have more than 1 million. Sure you can grind that out OR you can buy one of those SHARK Cards that Rockstar keeps shoving down your throat every 10 minutes. But even then SOLO MODE doesn't allow you to do those activities because it doesn't allow you to be a VIP or CEO in solo mode. So...whats the point? Should I just play in isolation? Well...I guess I could still go around and do stuff but just not allowed to do those new updates. Unless you enjoy being constantly killed while trying to deliver something with others in your way in normal online. But it's just...not fun. I guess this ends my review. Story mode is great. Online is trash. Opinions are opinions. Multiplayer is not the way to go. You want to kill others virtually to feel good about yourself? Go ahead. But nothing will beat a good story in a actually good game and the Online just ruined it.",Grand Theft Auto V

There's endless amount of fun and endless amount of things you can do. Singleplayer has an average length to it. Multiplayer could last years with 8000 levels to get to and all the dlc they add. You could be doing jobs for ever. But most importantly the one feature the blows out every open world game out of the water are... MODS! So basically you can think of anything and there's probably a mod for it. Loads of mods for singleplayer and multiplayer are out and it's truely amazing.

2018-10-16,0,0,103,False,Recommended,After a couple years after the release I finally bought and finished this game. As someone who haven't played GTA IV I really like new physics of the characters and cars. I also love that the cars can take some beating now so it would make sense now to upgrade your car.The story mode is great. I recommend buying this game just for the story. The attention to the details is amazing. The dialogs are hilarious and believable. Now the online. There are a lot of game modes you can explore from a classic deathmatch to Tron like hyper bike challenges. Only that can be a lot of fun. However personally for me these game modes are better played in other games. The free roaming mode though is quite boring unless you have friends to fool around with. In order to get the fun gear and vehicles you need a lot of in game currency. Sure you can do missions and other stuff but the payout is nothing in comparison to the price of access to the interesting content. And that's is the main problem the online portion was designed with micro transactions in mind. You can get yourself a CEO office MC club to get access to the best money making options. But this is very tedious. The cheapest CEO office is 1kk which in real world money is 20$ CAD. After that you need to buy a warehouse which costs 1.5kk. And after that you'll get access to special missions to make more money than standard jobs. The core gameplay mechanics boring and it gets stale after first couple times. It feels like work. Moreover that the game spams you with calls from NPC suggesting you to buy this cool night club quite often.Overall I recommend this game. The story mode is great and online can increase the perceived value of the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can say that I have played over 700 hours of just singleplayer after finishing the story.I decided to try out Online because it looked interesting and I can say that it is a pay to win experience. Hackers were everywhere and I was okay with it as long as they didnt bother me but I had realized that if you weren't willing to either hack or pay for Shark cards then you probably weren't gonna get anywhere in Online without working your off.

2016-02-25,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,"The single player game is fine but if you're looking to play GTA Online don't even waste your time. You've probably seen multiple complaints of hackers and are thinking people complain of them in every game. No you really don't understand you will get lucky if you find a server without one. My favorite excuse is ""well they ruined the game by making it P2W"" except most of these modders could just give themselves unlimited money but they don't do that they kill you instead either out of anger because you killed them or just cause they can. ""It's the toxic community! they keep killing me""...there's a passive mode that makes you invincible if you don't want to participate in PvP. These people literally kill you just because they can. It's so madening it's unreal if it wasn't for the modders GTAO would actually be fun.If you think it's okay to hack in order to kill other players whether you're mad at the developer or mad you don't have the skill to kill another player do real gamers a favor and don't play online games. I hope that for every hacker someone breaks into your home and breaks your hands so badly you live with the most agonizing crippling arthritis that no medication can seem to dull the pain rendering you unable to even use your hands nor sleep to escape the pain so nobody has the enjoyment of their game ruined by you again. The game has options for you to avoid PvP completely if you don't like it yet you still decide to be the biggest pos on the planet.

I would even go as far as to say that it is the best sandbox single player game yet.BUT....when it comes to the online part it sucks!! Not because the gameplay is bad no the gameplay is excelent. It sucks bigtime because of its stability issues.Getting disconnected and having the game crash while having the time of your (gamer) life is annoying. But having the game crash 6 8 times every time you play a full heist with your friends.... that just makes me ragequit the game and wish i could kill the damn thing.So you should buy this game for a super SINGLEPLAYER part but do not expect much from the online part stability wise.All in all I dont know if i should recommend this game or not.Oh and Rockstar sadly show themselves as true capitalists by offering shark cards ingame money for real money.

2015-04-20,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Just another open world RPG. Only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that can't be changed. Skills level up by doing stuff like running. There is a main story line and a couple of side quests. But no boss fights only trash mobs the whole game. You can buy a lot of items but they don't have stats. Weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. There's only one kind of armor that isn't even visible on the character.Good thing so far there are a lot of different mounts to ride. Some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry.Setting could be interesting if you're bored with fantasy.,Grand Theft Auto V

(i barely managd to get an infernus and an armoured kuruma)6. deathmatch is ruled by snipers and miniguns.7. pk crapheads wont allow to even freeroam outside of passive mode.while thats there the offline mode is just too good....its got a great story great side missions tv and movies are a must watch in this one easy access to money and cars. no shitbags that follow you everywhere cops go much easier in offline mode and above all the gratest reason for getting this game is mods. the community is just so vast and good that you will thank yourself for not playing online and enjoying the pure bliss of a modded game.so whats my final verdict?online 2/10offline +12/10 play offline. stay away from the salt and cancer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-19,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,WARNING The following review contains !!OPINIONS!! Part I Introduction and Core Gameplay Review Let me start off by saying I played GTA V first on Xbox 360 with at least 200 hours played on that platform. When I first got into the storyline and the game world I was stunned by the size on the map and the beautiful graphics. It was a very good looking game for a 2013 game and the previous generation of consoles mind you. The gameplay was solid it was what I came to expect from a GTA game. Driving from one place to another to do a certain task with dialogue in between it was all too familiar to me having played GTA Vice City San Andreas GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption extensively in the past. It was the core gameplay I was accustomed to and loved! There were a few minor flaws or shortcomings with the game physics having regressed surprisingly from the state they were in GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption with the Euphoria game physics and what not. These were just minor flaws in the game physics and or gameplay but these minor details did not bother me too much as they were negligible. The game was still fun to mess around with as was any other GTA or RDR in the past. Killing everyone on sight or getting cheat codes and spawning a combat tank or helicopter was still a ton of fun for a while. In conclusion the core gameplay mechanics of GTA V were still fun like its predecessors so there isn't a lot to complain about on my part. With that being said let's move on to the storyline shall we? Part II Narrative and Characters Review Awful just awful end of review... ha! I wish I could just say that and be done with it but there is somuch more to say that I will not be giving you the reader enough justice if I kept all this disappointment to myself. This is the one and only biggest reason as to why you should absolutely not expend those sixty dollars. Let's begin with the protagonists. Rockstar did a very bold and corageous move which I applaud to try a different approach by introducing not one but three protagonists that you can actively play as at any time you choose. This gives a fresh perspective that we had never seen before in a Rockstar game but it does NOT come without consequences. Rockstar had to develop three different points of view intertwined into one single storyline. THIS is the major flaw here and where R* games failed miserably. The character development or lack thereof of these three protagonists and the characters around them is just unbelievable no other word to use or way to put it. Let's start with Michael the ex gangster or criminal turned protected witness. He is first introduced as a sadistic and depressed character with a family that clearly does not give two craps about him nor respects him in any way. That's about it for Michael De Santa's introduction. Next we get introduced with Franklin the totally not forced CJ clone (beloved protagonist from GTA SanAndreas) that is the stereotypical hood gangster that all of the sudden wants to leave that life behind by doing more crimes and getting rich. Oh Rockstar the story is going great so far! So the two resentful buddies Michael and Franklin immediately sympathize with each other and decide to leave their criminal lives behind by getting more money aquired by committing more cimes.... makes perfect sense to me. Also somehow Franklin sees Michael as some sort of father figure. That's right the resentful black hoolum sees a white dude living in Hollywood Hills as some form of father figure! Way to go in story telling Rockstar! The worst part is that nothing else develops that is about it for Michael and Franklin's character development. There are no more twists and turns we get three forced protagonists for the excuse to make heist missions. GTA V's storyline felt like Rockstar decided first that they just wanted to make the protagonists do heists as the main feature in the story and THEN they decided to to create eveything else (inclusing the protagonists and other characters) around this idea. That is an absolutely FLAWLESS story telling strategy by Rockstar Games! Am I right guys? Am I right? (SARCASM INTENSIFIES). Am I forgetting someone? Oh yes! Then there is Trevor.... not much to say there. Rockstar attempted the 'comedic relief' by creating Trevor's character. At times Trevor can be very funny yes but then they ruin it by making him attempt to be a serious character in certain segments of the story. The end result is Trevor being a very inconsistent character that the audient cannot sympathize with or relate to..... just like the other two protagonists! That is the single biggest flaw in the story in GTA V the fact that you as a player can never in any way relate to any of these protagonists or supporting characters. The fact that none of them progess into anything else makes it even worse. In addition as much as the protagonists are unlikeable and forgettable so are the villains. If you played the GTA V story more than two years ago I challenge you to name more than one of the antagonists. I am willing to bet most people won't even remember one of them and that is because of how weak and forgettable their characters are. In the other hand the satisfaction that I got after killing Vlad or Dimitri in GTA IV makes it a great story on its own. Seeing how Nikko Bellic struggled as an immigrant with the illusion of the american dream makes us all immigrants and even people that were born here in the U.S sympathize with his character. Conclusion and Verdict To summarize the gameplay mechanics and graphics were ok the storyline and awful characters made it one of the most disappointing games of this era of gaming. I cound go on and on about how the map is huge but mostly empty and how insanely boring the yoga mini game and most other mini games are but why bother. All in all I give GTA V a 6 out of 10 just because the core gameplay from past GTA games did not change much and that is what made it any good. The rest is all said and done at this point. I would recommend you to buy this game unless it is on sale for 20 dollars or less. When it comes to GTA Online I never played much of it but the reviews are not great to put it lightly. Thanks for reading my opinion and have a wonderful day.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-22,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,I ve been a GTA player since I was 8 years old and I used to mod the hell out it. It s been a part of my life for a long time now ever since GTA San Andreas. Ever since T2 made a move against mod makers rockstar has left a bitter taste in my mind. All of the sudden everything started to come together. I ve never been a fan of the multiplayer in fact it s atrocious boring gameplay. But since Rockstar has grossed more than a hundred million dollars from shark cards each year they ve become extremely lazy. All new content is Online exclusive to add insult to injury Rockstar tries to stop you from spawning these DLC vehicles through a trainer in SP by disappearing them tempting you to buy them through the use of shark cards. A long awaited unannounced leaked SP expansion was cancelled a few months ago and a lot of the Online exclusive missions were going to be SP only. This general greediness and hostile attitude to the modding community has made me not recommend this game to anyone really. The story in GTA V is mediocre at best the gun play is ok for the most part. But it s not satisfying and it gets really boring unless you use mods. The car mechanics are the real kicker here they re bad. The handling is terrible the collisions are terrible it is terribly downgraded which leads me to believe that Rockstar cut out a lot of content in order for consoles to have a chance at running the game. The multiplayer... wow what a horrible piece of waste. It is the true definition of pay2win.Honestly this is a good game at its core but with the standards of companies like Rockstar it s average at most. GTA V will require you to use mods in order to find it engaging in my opinion because otherwise the vanilla game is underwhelming. It s safe to say that I won t be buying anything that comes from Take2 unless there s a major change in their greedy attitudes.,Grand Theft Auto V

But since being released for PC Rockstar and Take Two have put up road blocks to the modding community. Including recently sending a Cease and Desist to Open IV. DO NOT buy this game on PC if you intend on enjoying mods in Single Player. DO NOT buy this game on PC if you intend on enjoying their own multiplayer either.

2016-11-22,0,0,1201,False,Not Recommended,"Revision The latest DLC has drastically changed the experience and feels like an outright cash grab. Previously you could participate in the new online activities with a moderate amount of effort. CEO activities for example could be paid for by completing 2 3 heists and their setups. The barrier to entry on this update is easily 5x that or more. You need to drop at least $1.1mil on a bunker $1.25mil on a trailer (because your upgraded bunker coming in at an extra $2mil is otherwise useless) and another $1mil on a specific section to your trailer to be able to actually modify your guns. If you want to play the missions add another $600k to the trailer for the mission having module. That's right!.. The new weapons in this update come AFTER approximately $3.5mil of other crap purchases and missions come after $4mil. Once you have everything though you can look forward to $75 250k upgrades and $30 80k accessories for half a dozen weapons and a bunker that earns about $30k per hour. New vehicles come in at $1.5 2.5mil before their DLC specific mods ($200 500k+)And just to keep it interesting... AI and AI police are joined by players on nimble fast flying rocket bikes complete with homing missiles! Gone are the days of enjoying anything but the fastest vehicle avaiable and good luck outside of the city. Hydra griefers are sorely missed following what it possibly the stupidest addition to any game. Add in one hit kill explosive sniper rifle rounds fired from rifles with thermal scopes that somehow distinguish people from hot rocks and other in sunny California and we finally find ourselves with a truly pay to win environment in GTAO. I feel bad for folks just getting into the game!I'm currently trying to rush through the research here. Knocked out four camouflages for the paltry sum of $900 000! That just means they're discovered though... Only another $45k to apply them to each gun. Seriously this. It's ""random"" but I'm guessing Ill have to pay another million to get past the rest of the camos to the actually cool Then pay out the to actually use it.GTAO has become the game GTAV satirized. It's awful. It used to be one of the best examples of what AAA games should be and made Ubisoft's offerings look pathetic by comparison. This latest step in Rockstar trying to maximize their micro transactions has all but reversed that. We can only hope the next update will have a mode to revert to when GTAO wasn't a bunch of weaponized Saint's Row wannabe cars and planes and rocket bike planes where players need to shell out real cash or grind for *literally* weeks to stay competitive. I miss my favorite game.Original A mile wide and deep. It's amazing just how high Rockstar set the bar for the price compared to other titles out there. Of course they sold the game three different times but let's hope that's a one time thing (lol doubt it).The multiplayer community can be toxic at times and cheaters seem to be largely unopposed by either Rockstar or public lobby vote kicks. It's a sandbox though so you can take your ball and go somewhere else if someone is causing trouble. Beyond that it's a truly awesome game with a stimulating narrative and distractions presented with what remains some of the best artwork in the industry. After GTAV I cringe paying $60 for most other titles with respect to value... Remember the first Titanfall? *barf*Highly highly recommended.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-14,0,0,828,False,Not Recommended,I first played GTA V when I got it on release day for Xbox 360 it was fantastic then and it's fantastic now.GTA V is a great game sure it may not beat GTA IV's story but it's still fun. GTA IV focuses more on Story rather than Free Mode Playability GTA V is great for free mode playability plus there is mods which makes it so much better.GTA Online is great too except for the hackers who mess with players.GTA Online is fun though it is WAY better with friends believe me.You'll have an easier time doing Heists with friends/crew members than randoms.The Rockstar Editor is one of my most favorite things of the GTA V on PC (yeah I know it's on Current Gen now.) because it allows you to make videos way more easier than GTA IV did.NOTE DO NOT USE MODS ON GTA ONLINE YOU CAN BE BANNED.EDIT 6/15/17 Mods are outlawed OpenIV has been killed off because of 2K Interactive. YOU 2K. Do not get this game until the C&amp D from 2K is dropped. This is unacceptable. Without OpenIV many mods will be affected as well as the progression of modding for GTA V.

That's saying a lot too since the game has sold over 70 million copies (70 000 000) making them over 42 BILLION DOLLARS ($4 200 000 000.00) and the fact that they want MORE money from the shark cards is saying something.

You tell me. ive done nothing gamebreaking and im certainly not a cheater hacker or modder. I havent used a different VPN and i wouldnt even know how to go around doing this. I have been spawn trapped by cheaters and have filed reports against them but i dont feel like they have been banned yet i have. Although i dont have a lot of hours as most of the other people who have been wrongly banned i have played for more hours then stated. I have played since release date on xbox 360 Bought it on Xbox one and also pc. Buying shark cards on both consoles. Which seen as im getting reset in about a month will have been a waste of time Money and memories. The main thing that pisses me off is the fact that it hasnt said why i was banned the reason why Im banned for a month and am getting my character reset. It just said a really vague message that says something along the lines of you are banned till 8th of september your character will be reset end of story"" And if you make an appeal or try to get your account back (sending a ticket) you will get a response in your email from an automated bot which gives you a list of reason why you may be banned. All which i cant remember breaking. when you respond to that email they basically tell you to go to players for support. which feels like a personal you we dont care. Which i know they dont really give a about their legit paying customers. i have quite easily spent at least 200 300 on the game alone including shark cards. For people wanting to get this game only do so on sale or or other thirs party sites. but i will never buy another copy or a rockstar game again as their support are bots...",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-09,0,0,643,False,Recommended,Story Mode is fantastic. The chemistry between the 3 characters is so lacking that it is hilarious. Some of Micheal and Trevor's back and forth made me laugh. Great missions and the Big One is a masterpiece. I have yet to finish the game on PC (I beat it on PS3 back in 2013) but the beautiful graphics add to the narrative. Online is interesting. Running friends over in a Rolls Royce is undoubtedly a lot of fun. Me and a few friends have enjoyed hours doing death matches spontaneously shanking each over and stealing each other's cars. However the banter is ruined when a 12 year old tryhard griefer who thinks it's cool to blow people up in his jet when we're racing mopeds around a golf course shows up. They ruin the fun. Additionally modders are everywhere. I was in a plane and then he spawned a massive cage around it and put a bong on my head. Then the f*cking TARDIS landed on the cage. It sounds hilarious but he followed me around sessions until I eventually had to quit. Story 10/10 Online 6/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,166,False,Recommended,There seems to be an issue that a few people are facing regarding the game world not actually.. loading. In high density areas like the city more often than not the world will actually stop loading and the ground beneath your car will simply disappear. Not sure why I exceed the recommended specifications for the game. I can run it on high graphics with 60 FPS but that apparently doesn't stop the game world from being bugged to hell. Oh well we'll see if R* pushes a patch or something to fix this. Until then this game is in a near unplayable state for me. I'll alter my review accordingly when this game breaking bug is fixed.As it turns out the above was a compatibility issue with Windows 8 it seems. Setting the compatibility mode to Windows 7 solved my issue. The game runs amazingly on my mid tier computer. I'm honestly surprised i don't meet the recommended specs yet I run this game with high graphics at 60 FPS no problem. The game is very well optimized for a GTA game (I'm looking at you GTA IV).Now as for gameplay. This is probably one of the best open world games I have ever played. There is so much to do that I'm not even sure what to do next. You can go make a mess of the city go golfing play tennis race around with your friends the possibilities are almost limitless. The story mode is also really well done and after you beat it it pretty much feels like an amazing and polished retirement simulator.Even if you bought it twice already the game is worth it. No seriously you'll probably cringe a little at paying $60 for the same game again but especially on a mouse and keyboard the game feels like an entirely new experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can't run it for 20 minutes without Blue Screening but that doesn't change my opinion of this game. It is still one of the greatest games in the franchise and of all time in my opinion. (Vice City will always beat out the others for me). For the small time I could play it the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive and the controller support is phenomenal. The game is very well optimized especially if you have the newly released AMD/Nvidia drivers. The level of detail is wonderful to have and was nice to see coming from the PS3 version. Even though it's currently a broken piece of I will still reccomend it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The only thing I enjoy in this game is adding new mods/combining them there are so many fun things to do. Why with the mod community when they are what adds longevity and interesting new mechanics to the game? Shutting down the people who are so enthusiastic about your game that they create new parts for YOUR game for ZERO pay is ing stupid. You should be supporting the mod creators with toolkits and maybe even a place to host the mods.

You sit and stare at a loading screen until you begin to wonder whether you should just play something else. Then the half baked game loads and some hacking/glitching guy wins by doing some BS you don't understand. So for 5 minutes of loading time the actual game lasts 15 seconds of confused chaos. Then back to the loading screen. I dare you to try and beat the Community Outreach mission. It's impossible. And each time you try you have to sit through even more minute of loading time. I was like ""sweet I got some video game time!"" Two hours later after NOT actually having played a full minute of a video game it occurred to me that this game just really really sucks.

The online portion of the game really opened up the gta experience for me and is the reason I think this is the best GTA game yet. (also superior graphics and physics) No other game on the market has as much going on any given moment. I bought GTA on xbox 360 for myself and then a copy for my son. I then bought GTA V on pc and enjoyed playing online again. (my character from xbox transfered over) We bought another computer and a second copy of GTA V for pc to play with my son.

This Game's story mode is so fun also drive around alot since there are alot of random of events that could happen and can even affect the storyOnline Mode Its fun... There are squeakers who think they are edgy as so beware also there are some bugs and connection errors also don't buy credits the only good parts of GTA online is the grind and the heists so I reccomend that you do not buy a shark card also if you ever think you have alot of money just buy every car and every weapon with every mod you know just get everything and you do then reset so you can start from the bottom and get to the top againWhat they should add There should be a prestiege in GTA online since people who get to the top seem to be bored because they have everything but with a prestiege player could get to the top then start over with new game plus or something like idk Rockstar would know what to do you know either way a presteige function should be added,Grand Theft Auto V

There's only two or three setting I can't quite max but I'm running it at 2560x1440. Ultra grass (which looks no different to very high as far as I can tell) and HD shadows (which is seperate from the main shadow option has 15 20fps hit) but I'm running Nvidia soft shadows which means the ""HD shadows"" don't do much anyway.Online seems to be stable but I haven't played that much yet.Very very happy. Great game I'd highly recommend. Don't let the last GTA put you off (which is a mess still to this day) Rockstar have spent a lot of time making the PC version.

It's a game that can be as beautiful as you want it to be with a plethora of options to tweak. The controls work well with keyboard AND controller. The awesome thing is that you can have the keyboard/mouse plugged in as well as a controller and the game will detect which you are using and adjust the tooltips. The polish on this game is very apparent. The character migration also works well. What I'm trying to get at is everything about this game is everything from the xbox one/ps4 but better in every way.

People who have spent the past decade making their games enjoyable long after all of the original content has been completed have seen all their hard work go down the drain. These people took pains to ensure that OpenIV cannot be used alongside GTA Online. The real problem with Online hackers are the coders and game file editors who corrupt files while playing Online NOT people installing single player mods. This will do literally nothing to curb Online cheaters they will continue to do what they do which has nothing to do with OpenIV. I wish this decision would hurt Take Two financially but I know that the main market for Shark Cards (10 year olds who buy them with mommy's money so they can go online and insult people's mothers) won't be affected.What a shame.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not to mention the blatant cash grab that is shark cards since they are the only way to get any money in game apart from heists and CEO activities which don't work very well (see above statement regarding trolls).The only reason I picked this up on PC in the first place was to mess around with mods and wreak havoc in single player with mods if I want to fly around in a star destroyer and blare The Imperial March while haveing an army of dogs running through the city while wearing an Iron Man suit who are you to say otherwise?

2016-08-11,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This is a game I've been playing since September 17th 2013 and have obtained three copies. I'm also a seasoned veteran of Grand Theft Auto V's Grand Theft Auto Online. And despite the general shenanigans of GTA Online I still love it. GTA V GTAO are still great games three years and three years later (X360 X1 PC). The story is good and well done to a point and thoroughly enjoyable. The 30+ hours I put into the story and many hours I ve put into GTA Online is and was very much worth it.Pros Well written story for the most part. Good characters for the most part (I'll explain below). Great graphics even on lower end GPUs. Runs well on decent CPUs. Action packed at times and keeps you going. Satisfying ending depending on what one you choose.Cons Despite the three characters out of Trevor and Michael Franklin isn't that well written and fleshed out as a character. I do understand he's the newbie in the group but he could've been fleshed out more. Lamar Davis. I understand he's a satire of the ignorant and stupid thug male but that's why I dislike him and him being in the game. The overly aggressive police AI in GTA Online. From shooting to kill the moment they exit their squad car to excessively ramming the ever loving out of a Rhino MBT or a vehicle MUCH bigger than their car. Seriously the police AI is screwed up. Not so much of a complaint but more of an observation. This game displays itself in a light of realism but you can flip your car back over with ease or turn your vehicle in any direction in mid air as you please.(This review may be updated.)9.5/10Would buy a 347 867 times again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,I think one of the major problems with GTA V is that time has shown how untrustworthy Take Two and Rockstar are when better games have released since 2013. The single player is brilliant. Everyone knows that by now. It's got amazing detail in the world but time seems to have turned Los Santos from this brilliant open world to a bland uninteresting wasteland. It just doesn't hold up very well anymore. Not to mention how long it took for the game to drop for $60 to $30. When the game launched on PC it already wasn't worth $60. The online is complete garbage from what I've heard even though the idea sounds promising. The port is solid enough. My older machine which has since been upgraded ran at 60 no matter how far I pushed the settings. I bought this for a third time over a year ago because I wanted to mod the game. And while that held my attention for around 10 hours. The mods for the game aren't very good most of the time. Everything outside trainers has too much clunk for me to enjoy when it's set in such a beautifully crafted game. But I have a bad itch when I don't like a developer or publisher. It just screams in the back of my mind that the game has micro transactions in it's online. Or that Take Two attempted to take down OpenIV. I can't recommend the game anymore. It just doesn't seem like a game I could tell my friend to go out and buy without telling him all of it's faults. Hell I'd rather just lend him one of the three copies I had to buy.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,594,False,Not Recommended,The games from rockstar have always been fun and they always seemed to love their fans but it definitely feels like this games more motivated by money and the business side of things. I certainly understand that they need to make money but their actions against their loyal fan base seem very disrespectful. While the microtransactions left a bad taste in many players mouths we ended up getting free DLC (the large content updates) so it was more understandable. However the actions that have been taken against the modding community by the corporate side of things has been disgusting claiming they were trying to help the online community but instead used brutal legal force against a bunch of gamers looking to help others have more fun. I agree that the online hackers suck and need to be stopped however rockstar or more accurately 'Take Two Interactive' has gone and attacked many single player only mods and modders. Some modders even reported having investigators come to their homes and threatening them in person with legal action. After these recent events I have lost most of the respect I had for rockstar I think the game devs are still amazing at what they do but if they loved their community they would stand up for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

If we're to be able to stop Take Two from treating us like mere mines for them to strip of cash then it starts here and leads to a boycott if it gets to that. For that reason I'm also not buying any more games published by T2 unless they kill that cease and desist. By now means do you have to boycott yourself as T2 does have some really good games (some of my favorites in fact). But if the mods or even just the principle matters enough to you then I urge you to do the same.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-22,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT If you are considering buying this during the steam summer sale do it if you want to buy GTA V for the single player modding experience otherwise do not buy this the multiplayer has turned into garbage.If you are just getting the game for single player and modding that go for it tons of fun. But DO NOT PURCHASE any sharkcards or the ""Starter Pack"". Rockstar and Take Two have turned GTA Online into a disgusting cash grab that really makes me both sad and angry to see what it has become. GTA Online used to be a very fun experience and if you need proof just go look at the old gen console versions. The PS3 stopped getting updates before lowriders so they don't have to deal with the flying rocket bikes with homing missiles the assortment of jets that only people with sharkcards and modded accounts can afford (unless you want to spend a huge amount of time in game to afford that and make your money back from all the pay walls you have to buy into unless you want to just do races or other jobs which still would take hours to make a decent amount of money) and now with the release of this DLC the Orbital Cannon. A lock on one hit kill costs 750k to use while manual aim costs 500k. Its like they are giving hackers a tool on a golden platter to mess with anyone who would want to play the game as Rockstar ""intended"".I put a total of 60 real life days in game time played on PS3 PS4 and PC combined and near the end I really was regretting that. I have been a long time supporter of Rockstar (since GTA III) but their focus on ""Recurrent consumer spending"" rather than new single player or well polished content has forced me to withdraw my support until they fix their If they drop the focus on micro transactions (which is not likely to happen) I will recommend this game for Online (provided they fix that too) but until then I cannot recommend getting this game for its multiplayer.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,108,False,Recommended,This game is really good. I bought it back on PS3 when it first came out and immediatly couldn't let go. While it's true I have other games that maybe I like more inherently such as Half Life or NaissanceE Grand Theft Auto V probably is going to become my most played game very quickly simply because there's so much to do in it. Even once you've compleated the story campaign and every single player mission (an unrealistically gargantuan task by the way) there is still GTA online. If you somehow manage to finish that (Which because of the user created content I don't think that can even be done) the huge open world still gives plenty of opportunities to screw around and have fun. I have seen better stories in games but I was still thoroughly entertained by that of GTA. The main story is extremely enjoyable and almost all the side missions bode well into the open world and don't feel tacked on.As for optimization the game runs fabulously on my old laptop on the medium settings something that left me totally dumbfounded. I have heard people are having issues with getting the game to run I never had anything like this but judging by the other reviews I would say you should look into these issues before you purchase.All in all this game is absolutly amazing and totally worth buying even if you've already bought and beat the last gen versions. If you already have the current gen maybe hold of till a sale though.,Grand Theft Auto V

Recommend friends only server.Sad thing is the PS4 edition's GTA Online is better by a bit.(New con)2. Rockstar is trying very hard to stop people from modding the game so they update the game twice and require you to have the current version of Social Club to run the game or else the game won't run.3. Did I say the Social Club is still annoying?4. Take Two wants to rid the game of modding once more and is trying to delete any way of installing them. Also they consider it illegal.

2017-06-15,0,0,324,False,Not Recommended,so full disclosure i got banned for using a mod menu online.I bought the mod menu because it took forever to make money in this game. You could do rooftop rumble and make 20k before they lowered that amount to like 10k for 20 minutes of work. They introduced CEO work but all it takes is one 10 year old in a jet singing the trolololo song in his head to make sure that you dont make any money from that. Same situation with the later added MC. You can do heists but half the time it doesnt load and 3/4ths of the times it loads you cant start because someone fell asleep while waiting for it to load then half of those successful times one of the people blows themselves up with a rocket because it why not.So ultimately youre left with a choice pay $10 for lifetime access to a mod menu which is essentially unlimited money or $100 for 8 million gta dollars. You can get 2 of the new cars and halfway upgrade both of them for $8million. What I did with the menu was so much more than money. I didnt even end up giving myself money after my inital 30 day ban. I spawned cars for people asking what they were like to drive I spawned blimps for me and my friends to fly around and have fun with I flew people around in a school bus. I was finally permanantly banned after logging in driving my car on the water to my yacht and then repairing the damage done to said car in the process. Looking at the reviews the modding problem hasnt gotten much better and i got banned easily 6 months ago.On top of all of this they still charge $60 for a game that was released first in 2013 again in 2014 and again in 2015. This game is almost 4 years old and they are still charging full price. ON TOP OF the insultingly high shark card prices. This whole thing with single player modding doesnt even make any sense because its not like single player has received any new cars since 2014 anyway. Which honestly sucks because I really enjoyed the story that was told.Forgot to mention that online is a joke now anyway flying motorcycles tron bikes tanks military grade helicopters and jets a car that can jump 50 feet in the air and then deploy an unlimited amount of parachutes an electric car with a jet turbine on the back and so on. I can no longer support either of these companies and I was strongly considering RDR2 but I can't morally justify giving these people any more of my money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Lost all of my progress which took a lot of grinding since I don't waste money on shark cards no matter how badly they try to make it impossible to progress without them. Whatever I won't play GTA O.

After a few updates cars guns and everything else started to cost more and more. This raised the issue that never bothered other GTA games. Is GTA actually fun when you can't afford to buy the fun stuff? The answer is no not really. If you want to afford the fun cars cool guns and other amazing stuff you will need to grind endless hours of the same missions to do so. If you make a bad purchase and get a car or item that isn't super fun you have to start that grind again.Also they are super strict on anything considered cheating. Modder join your PUBLIC lobby and start spawning cash on you? Banned and fully reset account once you come back. Have fun grinding.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-09,0,0,1458,False,Not Recommended,I liked it to begin with. I loved the multiplayer. It was fun to arrange freemode battles. Hunting tryhards facing off hostile jets from the ground. taking on groups of people at once or just goof around. I loved it.Then R* stopped dealing with the modders.Now you have less tryhards and more cryhards people who sit literally for HOURS ingame in their apartments passive trashtalking nonstop. then start following you around in passive vehicles. trying to kill you with eject kills while still in passive. If they fail at killing you like that they will either Go to the new bunker prepare the orbital cancer and then try to kill you with that. if they fail. or you go passive they will start trashtalking you for going passive despite they have been passive all the time themselves. and sit for an hour talking in the bunker while charging another shot. If they fail again they call in modders that will freeze you in an open area so they get free kill which they will brag about for weeks. they will follow you despite you block them.Or they will use mods to crash your game. sometimes even follow you when you join another server just to crash you again.

2016-01-14,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Invasive 3rd party DRM makes this game inoperable for many who purchased. The game itself at least in single player while funtioning was superb and felt alive with personality and many great satirical commentaries. However that was short lived in my experience as the game suddenly refused to log into the Rockstar servers. My game was new and unmodded no firewall blocks that could hinder connection so I went to the Rockstar forums and discovered how many others are facing the same issue. Cannot play the single player or multiplayer portion of the game because it requires DRM to verify through it's servers even AFTER initial authentication. Absolute garbageware waste of everyone's time.Refunded after an hour or so of being able to play the game have never had an investment become so useless so quickly. I don't recommend buying this or any future Take Two Interactive/Rockstar games until they and all other publishers realize that DRM is the wind in the pirate ship's sails.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,321,False,Not Recommended,"I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS COMPANY FURTHER. I refuse to be nickel and dimedSo I dont normally write reviews... but this is a special case I feel.I got this game when it first came out for ps3 then again for pc for mods like LSPDFR andadding cars etc. had a good bit of fun with friends on both versions. Then why do i not reccommend it? well... the first Issues I had were when they added microtransactions to the online. well doesnt sound too bad at first.... but look at the prices of them! at time of writing $8 000 000 in game is currently $99. so basically if you just want to buy that floating fortress yacht in game that automatically shoots people approaching it basically closing off portions of the map to any players you dont like that particular day. gameplay issues aside its not cheap (keep in mind... you can upgrade this yacht by painting it other colors and choose between 3 hull styles naming it putting a flag on it... all of which costs more money. the 8 mil is just the base cost). ok lets look at some other examples. they added heists (which took forever for them to impliment) in where you would pay a setup fee and then with 2 4 players (cant solo these) attempt to complete a set of setup missions and then attempt to pull off the heist itself. thehost of these missions does NOT get paid durring the setup missions. ONLY after completing the actual heist. meaning theres already less incentive to do heists. why spend the3 or so hours trying to do 1 heist and make a few hundred k for themain event as host when you can join some random guys setup and get 200k for every setup mission. which there are usually 2 or 4 of. so in short it isnt cost/time effective. the next issue. is the ONLY expansions to the game have been to the online. by itself again doesnt sound like a big deal.... but not everyone likes playing with people who are just going to be jerks and try to kill you constantly for no reason. ""well what about passive mode?"" behold my next issue... while a good concept it stops players from attacking you yes. however... italso stops you from drawing a weapon at all. which first thought is why do you want to draw a weapong if you cant attack players? AI. the police in this game are brutal. they will hunt you down across the map for just standing near a cop too long. you cant defend yourself from ANY attacks. its stupidly easy to gain wanted level. and if you start to get away more just magically spawn in front of you often so close you cant even turn away before they spot you again. the only ways to escape are 1 use the alley ways to hide from them. after breaking line of sight duck into an alley to hide. its pretty obvious the devs made this intentionally the focused way to escape. 2 the other way is to high tail it to the airport and take a plane and start flying high out over the water. helicopters will spawn but can usually get away from those.""well the other additions to the game have good ways to make money too!"" and you arn't wrong. however. those other ways require a substantial startup cost. multiple millions often times to get going. andtheres a chance you dont succeed so a lot of the invested cash is just gone. short version.... they make doing anything in game less profitable than just throwing obsurd ammounts of money at them. if I recall NerdCubed and a friend of his had a contest... see who could make more money in a set ammount of time. that video more or less expresses my issues with this.another thing I am not a fan of is the vehicle upgrades. I like the idea of upgrades however the only way to unlock those upgrades is by winning races in that type of vehicle. not everyone likes racing so this is just really annoying to the rest of us. I think the worst of it was you have to WIN 107 races to unlock some part.so this game has more than plenty of flaws and issues.and overall it was a decent game especially since you could escape to single player and mod it to be silly and run around with a tornado chasing you or become a police officer and respond to calls doing some roleplay in the game world like being a truck driver firefighter garbage collector.... it was a good change from the usual run around and shoot this shoot that race here... it gave the game variety and gave it more replay value. now Take Two has in its infinite wisdom ""made mods illegal"" before. it was against TOS to use mods in multiplayer. ok thats fine no problem. a few months later they released in an interview they feel they are UNDER monetising their users.... they feel there are NOT ENOUGH microtransactions in a 60$ game... GTA is in the top 5 best selling games of ALL TIME and they feel they arnt making enough from the users...microtransactions aside.... as I said mods give a fun change of pace. for things as small as graphical tweaks to as big as basicall anything you can imagine. but now thats gone. so if you like grinding for weeks at a time to get enough money to buy 2 OK cars and a motorbike (not even the big fancy yacht) go ahead and buy this. if you want to pay over $130 of your real money for a virtual yacht that takes away freedom of other players to explore the map go have fun.but if you are a player that believes in earning things IN GAME with in game methods I reccomend finding something else. this is a real shame. the game has a good bit of potential to be fun. but when everything is aimed at making you feel so insignificant you have to give them MORE money to afford anything. its no longer a fun experience. and its getting shelved until some practices get changed. modding is the whole reason some games are as successful as they are. gta SA IV III all included. while yes by themselves the games are good. once you play the story once thats usually it. no new surprises or benefit from playing again. mods give reason to keep buying and playing older games. and squeezing every penny from your customers does not make us want to come and play more of your games. recently Take Two put a Cease and Decist for OpenIV. Basically a program that allows you to change game models or install the majority of mods. it has been around since GTA 4 and opened doors to hundereds of hours of fun. now declared illegal. basically the Open IV devs have said it isnt worth the time to fight back even though they could easily win this in court under fair use as similar cases have appeared in the recent past. Take Two have made their position known.... ""you can have fun as long as you give us more money. and no other way"" is the gist of it. if you dont give in to the scheme you are in for a loooooong grind fest to get anywhere decent. If you are a believer in fair use mods or having fun without microtransactions then stay away from this game and Take Two Interactive. I do not entirely blame R* for this but dont call them innocent either",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-16,0,0,987,False,Recommended,"Spoiler alert.I've played many of the GTA games (the only GTA game I haven't played yet is LCS). This game is the best one to date.The storyline is very good although Franklin to my seems like the weakest of the three characters in terms of the quality of his backstory and motivations (mainly because his story doesn't seem all that compelling to me). The ability to end the game 3 different ways makes for a difficult decision for some. I was not really a Johnny fan from GTA 4 (spoiler) so seeing his ending seemed like a rather pathelic way to finish him off. Trevor is a Psychopath who claims to be ""loyal"" and in some ways is but he is also a dangerous Psychopath that has no remorse in hurting evn his closest friends and allies so being given the chance to end his life is tempting. Michael on the other hand ""loves"" his family but doesn't know how to be a dad nor did he show a lot of guilty over turning against Trevor or taking actions that would hurt his own friends and family members. At the end of the storyline although option A was tempting I picked C because the enermies were a far greater ongoing threat then Trevor was.I have to admit the game is a very fun game to play. One of the key differences between this game and GTA 4 is more options in terms of stuff to do. They have also changed how characters get paid which makes certain key missions in game (heists) the type of missions you really want to do your research on before starting them. In some ways the game encourages you to do out there and explore the map to try and acquire new allies for the heists as well as experience some rather unique and in some cases weird side missions with random characters. One of the little changes that GTA 5 did which I love was bring back properties. Getting killed in other GTA games was discouraged as often times you would either lose a lot of money dying or your weapons and to get them or the money back required some level of grinding and or purchasing of guns in game to replace what was lost. In GTA 5 with the properties the players can buy death really isn't a big deal anymore because you can eventually purchase properties that pay a good stream of income every week without having to do any real work to maintain those properties (although for some properties you may have optional property missions to maintain that weeks dividend). It's nice knowing you can focus on for example trying to do the special jumps or on doing the flying achievements and not be all that concerned if you have an accident knowing that your character will be getting a relatively consistant cheque every week that would more then cover the hospital and gun store bills.Flying in GTA 5 is very simular to the flying system in GTA 4 but they added in trubulance which can make certain manuevers more likely to end in instant death. This adds to the challenge but I find that once I adjusted to it it made the gameplay even more enjoyable. Being able to hunt in game adds another entertainment area although I never really was a fan of it. If you are playing this game on a laptop a mouse is 100% necessary given how important it is for the purposes of shooting and driving.The one area of the game where it could have been better was in friend activities. I just felt like in GTA 4 you have a couple more options in terms of friend activities then in GTA 5 as in 5 the options seem to only really be strip club movies tennis golf drinking and darts which isn't great.Overall I would give this game a 9/10.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,317,False,Not Recommended,Review Edited Much further into the futureI cannot recommend this game anymore due to the hackers and script kiddies that rule the roost. Online gameplay is rigged with god mode users and people who flat out cheat while this game is unique in it's offering the PC community is now dead due the previously mentioned hack capabilities and the desire to watch the world burnUpon contacting Rockstar with request for fixing this my post was deleted and I was banned from asking any more questions in the forums. This game is an official joke money grab. As much as I originally loved it on the PS3 the new edition is nothing offering nothing new while also offering the option to be permanently banned because script kiddies can make it look like *you're* the one bombing the entire map incessantly ..,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-05-10,0,0,337,False,Recommended,When asked a lot of people don't like idol anime or anything similar or in other words anime based on music and stuff. I'm one of these people. I don't usually watch idol anime but I wanted to try this out because of the outstanding art that this anime offers.At first I was really hesitant even to the point where I removed it off my PTW list because I would feel embarrassed having watched something like this. Sure this anime might be targeted towards children rather than teens/adults but it doesn't mean that teens/adults wouldn't enjoy this. This anime taught to me that hard work actually does pay off that if you try your hardest you will eventually arrive to your destination point. There are a lot of things I liked about this anime but the thing I liked most was probably the art. Yes I'm a very picky person when it comes to art and this anime reached my expectations when it came to the art. All the characters were nicely designed and all of the 9 girls are cute. In other words the art was what some people call it flawless.The only thing I disliked about this anime was the fact that they were taking too long to prepare for the live shows and stuff like that. The producers should have shown the girls in action more (I don't literally mean in action I meant that they should probably have shown more of their songs).In terms of characters all of them are easily likable none of them are really that bland. There are 3 main characters in this anime Honoka who is seriously hyper and energetic Umi who is very shy and was reluctant to become a school idol at first and Kotori who is a very calm and a little shy. We have these 3 main characters make an school idol group in order to save the school from closing (because they aren't reaching the applicant quota). They name this school idol group 'Muse' (sorry I don't want to look all over the internet just for a greek character). Eventually they reach 9 members by around episode 6 9 forgot. That's basically it for the story since I don't want to spoil a lot.The sound is the second thing I enjoyed a lot in this anime. The opening was just straight up amazing I almost watched it every episode. I don't usually watch endings because they're usually dull and boring but I really loved the ending song this time I ended up watching it every episode. The insert songs were amazing too I ended up downloading that 'Dash' song too (it was that good &gt ).I could probably say that I felt embarrassed inside while watching the first few episodes due to this being my first idol anime but eventually I got used to the feeling and I opened myself up to this anime. All in all I could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot for my first idol anime and I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an idol anime.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-31,0,0,50,False,Recommended,at first i was skeptical about buying the game for pc. I mean with the numerous amount of hackers i heard about on gta online (which is the only mode i play) i thought that spending the 60$ was not gonna be worth it. Then came the fateful day when the game FINALLY came out on sale in the winter for 36$. Figuring it wasn't gonna go lower than that for a while I decided to finally see if gta pc had improved at all and got rid of the hackers. i am happy to say that there are no hackers AT ALL on the online mode or at least in my case. there are some people that aren't exactly the nicest of people (people that spam kill you repeatedly and don't stop) but there were others that were welcoming. some even invited me to rob a store with them and some then specifically invited me to heists which are SO MUCH FUN. i transferred my account from my xbox 360 to my pc with very high hopes and i am glad to say that gta 5 for pc exceeded my expectations. buy it now if you love violence or at least get it when it goes on sale (if ever again),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,160,False,Not Recommended,It is unfortunate that a game such as this with a large and unique multiplayer has such issues. Rockstar really needed someone with experience to manage it but instead they tried to take on the beast known as GTAO alone. It has pushed many away especially with unfair punishments to those that have done nothing after devoting many weeks in the game both on console and PC. Some of those on PC bought the game to mod the single player and have more fun others went to single player after getting tired of the toxic online. Now the single player is pointless after you have beaten it and you can't have fun on your own with mods. Unless you want to deal with a solid single player experience and then deal with a toxic grindy microtransaction riddled hellspawn of an MMO I would not recommend getting this game. Legit players get punished for people giving them money or because they are flagged by an automated system. Rockstar rarely helps out in these situations going so far as to close support tickets without a response.,Grand Theft Auto V

I also then have found out the multiple other issues that this game has such as frequent crashes servers keep lagging out the amount of hackers that completely ruin the experience by spawning in money right in front of you or simply flying around with god mode and killing everyone is really beyond me how this game has not yet been fixed after months of the game coming out. Another issue i have with this game (Which links to the performance issue i suppose) is the constant stutter.. Within singleplayer the stutter is minimal and doesn't affect that much my fps usually goes from 60 to 40 HOWEVER the second i join multiplayer i am unable to drive shoot or anything as the game will stutter every couple of seconds that causes my fps to go from 60 to about 5 10. Apparently also a lot of people have had this issue since the new patch came out with the new content that came out about a week ago.

Rockstar did not do a good enough job with the net code as even now months after the release of heists they still don't work. The odds are stacked against you even if the network holds. If anyone dies it's heist over no money for anyone. Someone leaves or their game crashes? Same thing. And if you're unlucky enough to be the host of the heist you get to fork out up to $160 000 just to start the mission.

The fact that Take Two is trying to kill the modding community in order to force people to play GTA Online which is full of bugs hackers and nearly impossible to play without buying game sharks (microtranactions) shows how little they care about the gaming community and only cares about making money.

I was only online for around 30 minutes before another player spawned various versions of me around me in different postures and several police vans right on top of me??

The characters are good and the setting (as someone who grew up in LA) is surreal. One of the most enjoyable and memorable playthroughs and worth 100% completion.Online is... well it has a lot of potentional but it falls short due to Rockstar's lack of attention when it comes to hackers. You basically have to hack your account to get money but Rockstar won't ban you for that. Just don't do mod menus or around with other players too much and you'll go undetected.

Prepare for nice views funny ads great characters and good story. Online however is broken in so many ways I cannot describe it. Trying to play with friends is frustrating for the whole group. It really seems like a half finished job that has just been put there. Prepare for random disconnects LOADING SCREENS waiting more waiting many confusion jobs that don't pay not being able to join random jobs with your buddies as a group not being able to join jobs with your buddies because you're two or three instead of four hackers finishing jobs and ending up in different sessions than the ones you were in with your friends which leads to LOADING SCREENS racing with a friend in private session and suddenly the game makes lots random people join unskippable dialogues people leaving missions which boots everybody back to random places in the city forcing you to drive back to the mission and start inviting players from scratch as if you didn't already see enough loading screens npcs that pester you with phone calls until you answer only to give you a mission which you cannot refuse. It's just a mess. We've had more fun and less trouble playing early access titles in multi player. Get it for single player.Example in one entire afternoon I was unable to complete the very fist online mission of Lamar because somebody would always quit for various reasons forcing me to spawn at the airport (after a loading screen) drive back to Lamar's place loading screen re invite players wait for players loading screen. Mission. Something goes wrong somebody quits. Rinse repeat. I've spent more time inviting and in loading screens than playing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-25,0,0,76,False,Recommended,I would recommend this game to others who would enjoy this style of gaming. While I know others have complained about being blown up or being bothered by other players this comes with the environment you are in. Of course someone is going to want to rob you or do you harm. I'd say really learn the map and fix up your car to maneuver through alleys and other small areas. I've come to the conclusion that if you are good with being a GTA driver then you will have fun escaping other players when they try chasing you. Be on the lookout and always know that someone is watching you. All I can say is I am always two steps ahead of the curve when traveling in the city. Just be smart online and you will do well in this game. Most importantly have fun even if you are getting your handed to you. Know that you will come out ahead as you level up and gain more guns and cars. I love this game! Stay frosty peeps!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-02,0,0,710,False,Recommended,Been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series for a long time so buying this was something I was to do no matter what the game was like.Between PS3 PS4 and PC I have played this game for way over 1000 hours.This game has everything you would expect from a Grand Theft Auto game and everything you could want from a free roam city sandbox. This game allows you to drive a ridiculous amount of vehicles (air land and sea) and of course blow stuff up with a multitude of weapons of which the list is ever increasing with regular updates adding new weapons clothing and vehicles (which is incredible seeing as the game has been out for over 3 years).I have spent an embarrassing amount of time just aimlessly driving around the map just because I can and after all this time I still always manage to find something new which goes to show just how in depth this game is.There have been some iffy things around this game in terms of features of the game itself as well as decisions that the devs/publishers have made such as Having NO FOV slider the only way to change it properly is downloading an FOV modNot having singleplayer DLC (which was promised in 2014 seems like the publishers/devs realised that online updates were more profitable and being easier to make which is a shame as GTA IV's DLC packs were great).Lots of modders/cheaters online although this is much less of an issue in recent months there have been periods in which you couldn't go online without an annoying cheater trying to ruin everyone's fun.Lack of singleplayer love from online updates In many of the updates that added new vehicles/clothes/weapons to GTA Online Rockstar have chosen to not only prevent them from being purchased or found in singleplayer but in some cases actively preventing the vehicles/weapons etc from being spawned in singleplayer (assumed to be to boost shark card sales in GTA Online).It is sad to say the devs/publishers have been a lot more focused on GTA Online and not much on single player at all but game is still incredibly fun to play both solo and with friends. Updates are still being created/added which is quite rare for a game like this especially being almost 5 years after its initial release now.Take Two and/or Rockstar have made attempts to kill the modding scene of GTA V which is a shame they went back on their word to push shark cards on users which has turned GTA Online into a pay to win grind fest rather than creating promised Single Player DLC. I'm really not expecting anything different for future Rockstar games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and the Inevitable Grand Theft Auto VI which is disappointing to admit after being so hyped for this game originally even though I enjoyed the game watching one of my favourite game studios turn quite sour towards their playerbase wasn't fun.Although this game had quite a few issues it was a massive improvement for GTA on PC from GTA IV which was a wreck in terms of optimisation. I am unsure as to whether I will purchase GTA VI/6 on its release even though this game has given me hundreds of hours of fun between its release on PS3 PS4 and then PC due to Rockstar's drastic change in direction for the series.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-25,0,0,50,False,Recommended,This is a great game!The story is amazing and even though many missions use the same mechanics they are all unique and fun.There is a skip button to skip part of a mission if you get stuck on it.It looks amazing for how old it is and most modern hardware can run it.$60 seems to much to pay but on sale it goes for $20 $30I highly suggest buying it as it is still heavily supported by the developers and there will not be a sequel in the near future!,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-09,0,0,498,False,Not Recommended,Yes we really bought this. We built a cloud chamber for a 6th or 7th grade school science fair and were looking for things to test. I wanted to find some uranium glass but that was harder to find expensive and the delivery times were all too late. We also opened up a smoke detector to find the americium (we didn't break it out of its casing). Sure enough we were able to see the tracks in the cloud chamber which was pretty cool. We did NOT bring the ore to school!!! but we did bring the little tin. If you're looking for an impressive and cool but really easy science fair project go with a cloud chamber. They are easy to build and they work. If this freaks you out find some uranium glass (also called vaseline glass). If you do the project right and make the kid do some serious research it is also a great learning experience. As for safety concerns the ore comes in the tin and in a tiny zipper bag inside that. We never opened the zipper bag since it is the dust you might breathe in that is probably the biggest issue.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-25,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I don't need to say anything about this game the name says it all. GTA ONLINE is a cherry on the topping and Rockstar are the 'Real Rockstars' for still supporting and adding things to GTA V even after so many years because the base is so HUGE.The certainty that this game won't die for another 3 years now is the reason why I re purchased it on Steam Sales given the last I played it on my PC was a gifted DVD version and my new rig doesn't have a DVD/BluRay drive because everyone uses STEAM anyway.All in all don't think about it because if you have to think about purchasing this game NOW after so many years after its release date then you my friend have some serious problems.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can't emphasize enough how poor the quality is of the gta servers and that it is tolerable because of how fun the game is but it really needs to be fixed.2) Hackers. There is a big issue with hackers and it is not uncommon to find one in one of my online game sessions. This makes doing MC Missions near impossible.

2016-04-01,0,0,237,False,Recommended,"When the game was released on PS3 I loved it. Not wanting to by another console I opted to build a PC. First Steam purcahse was GTAV. Best decision I ever made. That is until the last few months. The game is now overrun by ""hackers."" I usually wouldn't care about this but it has turned the gaming experience into one of two options. 1. You play in the open world games for 3 minutes before having something go up because of some garbage ""hacker"" or you try and play one of the numerous gametypes only to find out that no one is online and you just wait in a lobby for 5 minutes before quitting out and playing something else because the people that actually enjoy playing GTA without cheating are no more. I love this game. But without some type of policing of hackers by Rockstar I feel that this game is on its way out. And no amount of double XP/RP Weekends or new Adversary game modes are going to save it.On a brighter note the campaign mode is one of the most entertaining campaigns ever created. The story is captivating and immersive. The gameplay and controls are smooth and intuitive. Also the game still feels like a GTA game while still evolving the genre of openworld gaming. In summation if you have never played GTAV and want a great game to play wait for a sale and snatch this up. The campaign alone is worth the puchase. If Rockstar gets the modder/hacker t under control then the online aspect might return to its original glory. However if you are looking for an game with great online gameplay you have missed your window with this game. Which is actually pretty sad to me.",Grand Theft Auto V

I thought the story was the best part. I still agree it is a good game but I wouldn't say it is the best game. I found it to become boring after a time. I give it a 8 out of 10. It would of been better if it had more character development. More mods for cars and weapons and a broader selection of mission types. I wouldn't have paid 60$ for it if I had known I was gonna put however many hours I have in it and never look back. Last note is I would agree it is the best gta out to date but I guess i am not a gta hardcore fan anyways. If you love gta I would totally recommend this game.

The sun is setting and the lights of the city stand out against the darkening sky.I get on my dirtbike and find a trail and can almost feel the wind in my hair as I traverse the narrow mountain trail. A coyote darts out in the path ahead of me in the twilight and I almost hit him which would send my bike end over end into a ravine. My heart jumps and I feel the adreniline rush as I navigate the narrow trail in the fading light. I am almost at the bottom and my bike hits a stone and I flip over and land head over heels and end up in a ditch. Ouch That's gonna leave a mark..... I get up brush myself off and call a taxi to come pick me up as my bike is a twisted pile of steel and rubber.What a rush. What a beautiful place.....So why am I such an A hole.I have never felt so divided by a game in my entire life. Let me make one thing clear. I am not some self righteous prude that things video games are evil and need to be banned. I remember the first time I clobbered a waste barrel in doom and took great delight in watching the imp disintigrate into a pile of gore at my feet.But GTA V is sometimes so hard to love. This is because your main ""characters"" are people with little if no redeeming features whatsoever. Now I get it GTA has never been about being a ""good guy"". But usually even ""bad guy's"" have some redeeming features. The closest thing to a ""hero"" in this game is retired gangster Michael that is in a dead end marriage with D bag kids (ones a stoner millenial and the other is....well not a virgin by a longshot) and a nice comfy house in Rockford Hills that he seemed to only get because he screwed over his buddys a decade ago.The satire of the game is laugh out loud sometimes and I get where Rockstar is going. Missions like where you end up fighting aliens in a self imposed ""bad acid trip"" or high tailing it around town after you've caught ""America's Sweetheart"" in a rather compromising situation with a fellow teen star are riotous and hilarious. But then you get a mission like ""By The Book"" and .... If I ever have to do that mission again in my lifetime it will be too soon. I warned my friend about that mission and he said... What did you do knock off a pet store? ""I wish I had....I wish I had....""I love the game I love the environment and I love the beauty of the world around me. I'm just not a fan of who I am in it....And perhaps that's the point they're trying to make.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,724,False,Not Recommended,"I must stress that the downrating is purely about the state of GTA Online. GTA V is a fantastic game but this critique is purely about GTA Online.Rockstar has a history of making exceptional games. But GTA Online is the first exceptionally bad game that they have released. The online mode is completely broken. There is a huge disparity amongst the player base between the payers and players. You can grind for days on end to try and achieve something like a new car or plane. But grinding is the opposite of fun. Or you can buy shark cards which are micro transactions although it's hard to see them as ""micro"" when some of them cost more than the game itself. Grinding to get money in GTA Online may as well be a second full time job it's boring and monotonous like a real job. Rockstar has gotten away with destroying one of my favourite franchises by diluting the experience and charging obscene amounts of real world money for in game items.GTA used to be fun escapism where you could indulge in your baser instincts. But now you still can do that but only after wasting hundreds of hours of your life or paying disgusting amounts of real world money. I'm honestly depressed by what GTA has become it's very similar to what EA has done to Star Wars. GTA IV got expansions in the form of ""The Lost &amp Damned"" and ""The Ballad Of Gay Tony"" Two of the best examples of expansion packs I can think of. GTA V got Shark Cards.This current plague of Micro transactions is killing my interest in my favourite hobby that is video gaming .",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-21,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,"Dear Rockstar I'm afraid after being a long time GTA customer (Since GTA 1!) purchasing GTA V THREE times and spending a large amount of money on in game money I'm forced into position where I have to complain.As noted above I have spend a lot of money on not only the GTA franchise but also Rockstar games in general and feel now cheated out of my cash and loyalty. I decided to purchase GTA V a third time to reap the benefits of my powerful PC as I no longer have my Xbox One and to continue my profile that I transferred originally from my Xbox 360. I feel I am disappointingly being penalized for investing a lot of money and time money into your franchise by you putting a ""limit"" on when people can transfer their profiles to PC.I'm afraid that I cannot see any sense or logic at all in such a well established company with an extraordinary loyal client base applying a ""cut off point"" for profile transfers. Given the many poor reviews of your game it is easy to see that loyal customers are feeling poorly treated me for one.I have every confidence that such a good successful company as yourselves would realise what you need to do to make your loyal customers happy and turn around all these negative reviews. Notably myself if/when you make the decision to make this ethically right you would restore my faith in you as developers and this franchise.I look forward to your response and being able to turn my review from negative to positive.Regards Antoine",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,321,False,Not Recommended,The recent move by Take Two with their cease and desist against the creators of OpenIV is unwarranted. The program is never used as a way to cheat in GTA Online it was always intended to be a tool for single player mod developers to add interesting new ways to play the game and is very likely the reason why Rockstar and Take Two still get so many sales of the PC version even after 2 years. They have killed a lot of the replayability with the cease and desist and likely have killed a majority of future PC version sales.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Pre load and all other disappointing staff long long ago aside GTAV and GTAonline are both recommended. It is needed to be mentioned that GTAV story is interesting but it doesn't have a proper ending which deserves its beginning. That's a pity. So many unpleasant things in the installion of PC version. I am not an native english speaker but i still pose this to let more people know something serious about GTA5. That's what happened to me.1. Pre load succefully2. Cannot dispatch because it needs unbelieveable space disk of 120GB to dispatch when it only mentions about 66GB will be needed for this game3. PC crashed have to shut down and reboot this process repeated 5 or more times on me4. Delete the local file of gta5 and try to manage some disk space for it5. Re download6. Install no response7. Google what is happening. 8. Try to install Social Club manually doen't work9. Try to update my Nvidia sofeware doen't work10. Finally fount out there are problems with mobile Nvidia cards I have to turn off the driver when I want to open the launcher correctly (WTF)11. Now it says soemthing about you cant play because your PC is not available (I am quite sure my PC can run GTA5 in low quility) you can try soemthing so called safe mode? not quite sure about the exact name because i didn't use the english version.12. Go to the support page of Rockstar games I can't find the soultion can't pose the question in the forum because my account of Social Club is new can't even submit a question ticket to Rockstar.More than 10 hours past but I still CANNOT play it. Totally time wasting.Seriously speaking why i pay money for this sh*t ?I never write such a long review because the most games i played are awesome i don't think they need my review to prove their are high leveled.ROCKSTAR FIX THE PROBLEMS ASAP FOR F**KING SAKE !,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-04-07,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Whenever I have no idea what I want to play I just start up GTA Online and I'm happy. You can do so much in this game and if you get lucky and load up into a full session with 20 other people it feels so much more social than any MMO I've played lately. I highly recommend this for everyone even if violence isn't your thing. So many mini games great soundtrack fun physics hilarious banter to be overhead while driving and walking past pedestrians. My sister doesn't like video games really but she loves to just drive around the map and sometimes when I get off work I love to do the same. This game is probably the closest thing to a life sim that is out right now. Especially when you switch to 1st person. I don't want to write a whole essay here but maybe the biggest selling point of this game for me is that Rockstar is STILL releasing DLC for this game and it's always 100% free. It's a little ridiculous how much they want us to like them but it has worked and I will certainly be in line for the next pc GTA title.,Grand Theft Auto V

However with 180 hours of online playtime I must admit the online mode has grown stale is incredibly pay to win and reeks of griefing and requires massive amounts of grinding.

You actually had fun. Now? All you ll ever have is working your off for money. People don t have fun no more like they did in the old day. The game is extremely enjoyable but only if you have time to enjoy it like you do in offline mode.#2 THE COMMUNITYTrust me 60% of the people are actually good here. HOWEVER YOU WILL ONLY MEET THE REST 40% OF TOXIC. (Well they may say it s just a game they re having fun but you will be anoying as hell) You will shortly turn into the kind of person you despite. You will be a racist. You will be a sexist. You will develop an anti social personality. THEN you figure it out 50% of good people in the 60% group have load of money yet have nothing to do no more thing to spend on. That leads to the sight of your future.#3 THE FUTUREYou yourself and your friends (if you got any) will turn into selfish jerks who only care about themselves. Like I previously said GRINDING. The fun is the past.#4 THE DEV More and more they put in ridiculous stuffs just to make more ******* of humanity appear and make you regret buying (then buying more) sharkcards. All they care about is your money. This game is older than my ex boyfriend yet it s still plagued with its first day bug. Solving methods ain t working in many cases and they will keep suggesting you do what they tell you to do again and again.Support? Supporters are mostly machines who can t even read English! What s next? SLOWER THAN SNAIL REPLY! I once waited 3 hours for a maximum 2 hour waiting livechat as it's the only way to meet an actual human being. What if I don t need live chat? you may ask You do you surely do when you realize the ONLY thing they help you quickly is SHUTTING DOWN YOUR REFUND REQUEST OF ANY KIND IN 5 MINUTES IN COLD BLOOD WITHOUT EXPLAINING ANYTHING..Actually I should have writen more to help you understand how non sense and ridiculous. GTA Online Veterans say all of them in their videos on Youtube go find out. We should try talking to the dev to change thing? Well like I previously said this game is old and if people re still saying there re still negative things here in the game then your opinions don t mean anything to them. And don t even tell me your money matter It's like how people make lemonade they throw away the lemon after they re done! It doesn t matter if you can stand all that bullcrap Later you will realize you should be better off pirating it. Don t feel bad about this as they made at least 3 times more money from sharkcards bought by people already!.9/10 for GTA VThis game in its offline mode is GOLD! You can do anything you want and experiencing new thing every time! The only 1 point I took away is that you can t have fun with your friends in offline mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-12,0,0,468,False,Not Recommended,"After playing for over 400 hours I was banned without any reason. I've never cheated in this game or accepted/asked for modded money. I have spent many hours doing resupplies heists hangar cargo missions and vehicle warehouse missions. After I was banned an agent told me ""The total earned on your old character was GTA $31 873 938 and total spent was GTA $29 602 227."" This was from a conversation on the 18th of Match 2018. It was one of many conversations I had with customer service from Rockstar that ended in being told a ban is unappealable. Here is my experience.When the ban first arrived it came with a message that it was unappealable and that I would lose all character progress. I instantly tried to remedy the situation as I know I have not modded or broken any of Rockstars terms and conditions. This was a false ban. Rockstar informed me as I thought they would that there was nothing they can do. However over the course of the next few days Rockstar filled me with false hope that the ban could be lifted and that that the matter was being looked into by their supervisor. This is one exchange that I had with a customer service representative named Mandi Agent I understand that this is taking a longer time. The reason why it is taking a longer time is because usually bans on the account cannot be appealed and we need to be double sure if everything is accurate from the account and for this it might take sometime. I appreciate your understanding in this issue. Even though this is the case you can be rest assured that your case is being looked into and we will get back to you once we have more information on this.User 3/18/18 6 38 41 AM That is good to hear. Does that mean there is the potential for this issue to be fixedAgent 3/18/18 6 41 00 AM Usually the bans on the account are not lifted however this has been looked into by our supervisor. I will not be able to give comments about the result of this investigation rest assured we will get back to you at the earliest.Another agent told me that my claim was being expidited and that Rockstar would get back to me soon. None of this occurred. Instead I was let down never told what my infraction was and ultimately informed that I would not be allowed to play until the ban was lifted and that my character was gone. There was nothing I can do. Rockstar took roughly 32 million dollars away from me with this false ban. That's how much I had earned during this process. To put that into a dollar figure that's over 400 Canadian dollars in Shark Cards ($305.87 US). That is a large amount for a company to repeal from an account without reason or appeal. For those who want to play this game for the story I saw do it. For those who venture into the online mode Beware. You too could be banned without reason. You play without mods and without cheating (to your knowledge) and still be banned. You can be friendly to other players and not use exploitsd and still be banned. Rockstar will not help you. They will give you automated ""no appeals"" messages. Don't buy this game for the online as you are rolling the twice each time you play on whether you get banned or not.It was a fun game to play to play (look at my hours) but the damage suffered from the false ban made the time I spent playing a painful memory and a wasted experience.Please pass the word on as everyone should know this before buying a rockstar game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Story is average and can't reach even half of qualities of GTA SA.I uninstalled few days ago and i've heard they already nerfed i/e bunker and all these goods ? It was my main way to make money.. I'm so glad i removed this crap. I've had no friends playing this game so i had to play in cheater fest public lobby which is terrible. I saw russian garbage (crew RUSS) level 5000 8000 players every single lobby i joined in they were spawning fire water and cages under feet of every player in session and yet no one even kicks them off. I made a lot of money legal way and i bought almost everything this game has to offer there's really lot of content and i liked but so needlessly expansive... there's really a lot of grinding required to make money for everything.. but why bother making money true way when cheaters just smash one button and they have thousand times more money than i've ever made for 300 hours of gameplay.. and even when you report them on rockstar support they always send you automatically generated robot message that there is no further action needed from me (i even tried testing by asking support for something else and got same robot answer lol)..and then i come into game and the player i've just reported and got answer from support is still happily cheating around. So no money legit players and yet still let cheaters cheat around ? Good step rockstar..you just ensured that more legit players are going to cheat as no one is going to pay real money for something you can just cheat for no punishment whatsoever.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,221,False,Not Recommended,I have played GTA through 4 different platforms (PSP PS3 XBOX360 and PC) and the games were always good however mods made them great. I would say that is what has always made GTA special that you can do and be whatever you want in a semi realistic setting all from playing tennis and being lawabiding to flying cars and going on a rampage. Now Take 2 has removed the possibility for mods and thus reducing this once brilliant game into a simple sandbox 10h of interest.

2018-01-03,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,Game takes EXTREMELY long to load even on an SSD and an i5. Very flakey game. Needs SEVERE revision to the online play. What makes the game bad? Having to play an introduction in story mode before you are allowed to play this game online. Followed by the amount of resources this game requires to run. It is very flaky and runs like garbage. I can literaly go cook a meal and come back and it may be not even be loaded.The tutorial mission REQUIRED in order to play any other part of the game is STUPID and just flatout dumb. Earning money in the game is boring. Doing co op missions where you fight each other in dumb little mini games is bogus. I'd expect missions where you are robbing banks gas stations and convience stores for money. Not doing dumb things like recreational activies in the game for money. Lastly the CHEATING and exploitation in the game world is TERRIBLE.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-23,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,It's currently full of hackers and non good sport players ruining your game all the time.And apparently Rockstar is more concerned about players cursing than with hackers.It's worse then CS GO when talking bout hackers.In addtion there are some bugs that cant be fixed.

2018-02-22,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer better map and story than GTA IV although with much inferior physics destruction and vehicle handling. Still a fun experience but the gameplay is just not as satisfying as it could've been had they just copied it from the previous game. Keep in mind before you purchase this game that the singleplayer mode has been abandoned (content wise) all the new stuff is exclusive to Online.Online aka loading screen simulator relies on peer to peer connections that make the whole experience worse for everyone with the only advantage of costing less to Rock$tar. There's an absolutely massive grind to it if you want to purchase and have fun with any of the cool stuff which is similar to working in the lowest paying and most boring jobs in real life (players waste several hours/days to make a million and everything costs several millions). So this obviously favors micro transactons (aswell as money hack/glitches) it's a triple A game with a triple A price tag but Rockstar's greedy asses still managed to turn it into pay to win.There's also a huge lack of rather obvious and simple quality of life improvements to the game which would require me a few more thousand characters to address although the most urgent one is that we need to be able to kick players who are joining a lobby. The amount of times people glitch and stay in joining status for eternity effectively killing the lobby (since you can't start until they join) is too damn high.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-12,0,0,429,False,Recommended,"I got gifted this well over a year ago now and I think it's more interesting to write my review well after the fact given the amount of unusual time I've played (and have yet to play) BACKGROUND 1) I started the campaign post forced Prologue and managed about 3 or 4 missions in about 12 months ago but gave up When I wiped my computer I lost whatever little progress I'd made. It didn't wow me then but characters and writing were on point with previous GTA shenanigans. However 2) The hours I've spent in this game reflect an online experience like no other I've yet to those are vanilla hours too spread across late nights and early morning binges with mates and way too many cups of coffee. It's not a standard MMO by any means but a mishmash of peer to peer ""servers"" where sandboxed chaos ensues. It's the only reason I play this game really the interconnectivity with other crazy people the amount we are forced to work together (and how bad heists begin with bad crews) when all we want are each other's wallets. Understandably a solo online experience is has been would be much much less interesting. So what I'll be reviewing is mostly to do with GTA online OVERALL ONLINE EXPERIENCE + Rockstar's been a little lazy and made the whole community peer to peer one computer connected to another connected to another in a shared environment It's like LAN in your native country if people still LAN so connectivity's great depending on how close you and your friends are. Reaction time between shooting and killing an enemy is crisp and while this might sound like a con as a pro heisting with your friends is what online's really all about so if a game can't do it in my backyard well problems are gonna ensue. If you're connecting overseas yes peer to peer also a massive amount of nausea/rage enducing lag is sure to follow unless your internet's fiber optic. I can confortably complain that peer to peer's an issue because in my country we use copper phone lines for landline calls for our internet. If you're fiber optic net dedicated you're fine. If you're a fiber optic user trying to connect to me it's like funnelling an elephant's worth of data into a peanut just isn't going to fit. If a BIG if Rockstar managed to make national servers this would alleviate the peer to peer problems altogether.+/ Give or take the last six to eight months the online community's been replete with a variety of benevolent and Dickensian hackers droppin' money immortality bombs giant propellers airliners UFOs you name it. Some steal your money allegedly others give (and what is given is prone to being taken away by Rockstar). Bans are likely so affiliating with hackers not usually by choice (just being in a ""server"" with one feels like a liability) is a bit of a mixed bag. Pro/Con sometimes the shenanigans are more hilarious when you're trippin' on a bong and a teleport mod ejects you midair from your apartment couch.USER SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE + Showcasing material with a character YOU'VE MADE by picking the parents of your avatar individualises the whole experience on a whole 'nother level. Where the campaign has you follow a preset character in an open world following a preset story online has you make your own character (who cannot unfortunately speak) make their own story buy their own house their own car jet yacht their own clothes their own expression of themselves (limited as in game presets selected by the user).+ Because things are peer to peer you can import a playlist of your own music (simply find some MP3s and bung 'em in the Rockstar &gt GTAV &gt User Music) to listen to on 'Self Radio'. It's great every now and again to hear the Yavin IV Trench run theme come on when I'm heisting in the middle of traffic bullets are flying teammates are screamin' down my dongle ""LOOSEN UP!"". The other radio stations aren't too shabby either. Everyone's avatar's about the same age about the same height about the same build very white if male very masculine if female limited variety of clothes but updates tend to filter in new types of things. Nobody in their right minds however would wear blocky glasses like GTAV's in real life however. /+ At times game can feel a little grindy. The bigger stuff like the yacht the gold plated jet (well sheet) these cost millions. That means heisting multiple times at best maybe doing a complete heist (BIG CACHINGAS) and its five or six setup jobs (POCKET MONEY) over and over again. And if you want that yacht chrome plated there goes another million you forgot to factor into the original save up budget. That doesn't include bullets armor bugger up retries hookahs and blow. As my crew has heard me say repeatedly GTAV is the only game where I feel poor with a million bucks in my pocket VERDICT Like all games I tend to buy them a little while after their release they're cheaper they're patched they've usually got a bit more content. So far Rockstar hasn't introduced any pay to play featurettes added content has been on top of purchased content of course if you can't be bothered grinding for that chrome yacht you can buy in game currency for real life Matrix dollars (and why you want to steer clear of hacked cache Rockstar's makin' bank off of these and you hacking your way to being a billionaire hampers those efforts).The campaign which I hear is pretty lengthy I feel is on top of the Online (four main heist missions 4x6 setup missions voice acted and cheekily written). It's like games used to be feeling either like you've got more or what you've paid for.10/10 Would make it rain for Candy again.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-14,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Note I only have played the single player. I intend to try GTA Online in the future but there are just so many games to play!Absolutely fantastic game. Ran incredibly well on my PC and looked stunning all the time (check my screenshots on my profile!). Scenery was super vibrant and breathtaking especially on top of mountains or in the city (welcome to Los Santos!). The game has urban rural and even forest settings the game world is ridiculously large (you can drive around for hours). I loved all the characters and the settings they were in (though Franklin was my fave). The story is too cool with tons of crazy situations beautiful locations and insane characters. The humour and writing is top notch I was laughing many times while playing GTA5. As always Rockstar parodies California culture perfectly. Even the side missions are fun I spent the time to complete them all just to hear the awesome dialogue.There are so many different vehicles clothing options and guns in this game. I had fun just driving around and interacting with the world. I also spent a good bit of time customizing my cars there is just so much to do. Minigames jobs sports heists... I played the single player alone for over 50 hours. I got it at launch and still feel it was totally worth it. Fantastic work Rockstar.

2017-06-15,0,0,308,False,Recommended,ing excellent story with great writing and charismatic characters who are extremely well acted and all work together in different and interesting ways. The singleplayer is probably the best GTA storyline ever (IMO). Others will say games like San Andreas or Vice City were better and i see where they are coming from (they are also some of my favorites) but the mocap voice acting facial animations and graphics make it so much more immersive and also the fact you can change between three characters means if there is a character you don't like (I don't know how you could though) you aren't forced to play a character you don't like the whole game.This is already a glowing review and i haven't even spoken about the gameplay which is of the same quality as the rest of the game the shooting is fast paced and exciting with a multitude of weapons at your disposal from a homing missile launcher all the way down to a broken bottle and everything in between. There are hundreds of different types of cars with even more ways to customise them. These can also can also be enhanced by the characters special ablity which continue to make them all very different and special.Yes I am still going on about this game because i haven't talked bout modding and I know not everyone uses mods but in this game it came make an already fun action movie sandbox even more fun and ridiculous (In a good way D). From simple trainers which give you the ability change the world to your liking from the weather to the time to you character model to vehicles name it and with a trainer you can probably do it. Or if you want something a little different you can get a mod that lets you be a police officer or a mod that spawns zombies or aliens or both if that's your kind of thing.I already know how long this review is and I'm gonna stop soon but I have to mention the multiplayer which isn't everyone's cup of tea i personally like it and the rush of getting a big score but if that's not your thing then the game is still worth the price tag. It's a wonderfully written and engaging story that is set in a large and fun map to play around in with a vast sea of mods to play with.TLDR Fantastic singleplayer multiplayer is pretty good IMO.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,954,False,Not Recommended,I deleted my review that I left when they banned modding in any way when they were too lazy to figure out the cheating/modding situation. Everyone downvoted then and so did I. But that there was just a fight we all had to fight to prove a point. What point though? The imbeciles fooled us all. None of the negative reviews really made any kind of impact. The sales are still hapenning up to this day even though the most ideal situation for this game would be to be dead. What really happenned is Rockstar stole intellectual property by making a fuss as if THEY were attacked in some way. They banned modding literally hours after the guy who ported GTAIV to the GTAV engine released a teaser trailer. And when we 'fought back' we couldn't save the most important target of this whole ban. That exact guy who did the job of porting the best GTA to the worst. And now Rockstar will wait until Red Dead 2 dies in order to boost their sales with a VERY shoddily ported GTAIV as we can see in all content Rockstar has added to GTA V post lowrider update. They can't tell muscle cars apart they add vehicles to the game months before they actually release them to the public and even then it takes them a week to figure out those vehicles were never able to turn left they add the 'fastest' vehicle out there and rule it out as a glitch and 'fix' it only after EVERYONE already bought it and anything post Lowrider update except the clothing will at NO POINT cost less than a million. It does? Means it has absolutely no use. Release a car that costs 100k? Release a less aesthetically pleasing worse handling car on the same update that costs 900k and stretch the time to the next update for TWO MONTHS pretending that the Supra knockoff is definitely the nightlife update content sure. Not trying to cash in on lack of content at all. Everything after the Biker Update was the Biker Update anyways 'get' more cash and do ten times the work still making the Pac Standard heist theonly viable way to make money ( not spend a full day of grinding for a single car ). If you have not bought GTA V DO NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. Serious. I have flunked uni just to play more of the game that never quit coming up with ways to take ALL of my time. If you have the game and are having fun sorry but you soon won't. Because there will ALWAYS be more updates with 'cars or things you want' that serve no other but cosmetic purpose. It will never end and most likely GTA 6 will never be. There was supposed to be a proper DLC for GTA 5 yet it all got scrapped with the new CEO. And then we got all this useless content that doesn't put the game in any better place just significantly laggier another issue that for me was never prevalent but then ruined the game forever for me. I used to get seamless 40 60 fps in the city and now it just spikes whenever it wants to. Or actually it kinda decides on when to play right it just lags all the time it's just sometimes it's not as severe. So yeah. This is a very bad game. The only upside is that it has more content than any other game. But that's it. It's Assassin's Creed just not involving. Get from A to B start mission get from B to A and kill a dude with various difficulty. Spend money. Earn 10k a mission car costs a milli. Go figure.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-05,0,0,410,False,Not Recommended,"I bought GTA 5 mostly for the sole purpose of playing online with a few of my friends. After GTA4 I wasn't expecting much fun in the storyline. To be honest I played single player a little bit and it has more of the feel of how San Andreas used to play I would expect this to be fairly fun to play.Regarding online play the modders/cheaters are OUT OF CONTROL. They are always there the same ones and it seems that rockstar just turns a blind eye to them and lets them continue. Last night within my first two minutes ingame a modder teleported to me and just kept melee'ing me following me into my personal garage and continuing to beat me/followme/harrass me. I went back outside was put in a steel cage and randomly shot at as he heckled me for getting ""mad"". I bought this game to have some good pvp fun and do some fun missions. Unfortunately some modder ALWAYS shows up to mess with your gameplay.If you think being put in a cage so you can't shoot/participate in anything being blown up remotely being sniped repeatedly with impossible shots being teleported to and harrassed and having your client crashed on you by these guys all while hearing a litany of foul/assholish chat come at you then this is the game for you.

Then the waiting game started features got pushed back more shark cards and the like I quit far before hiests become an option.Fast forward to now and it seems like things are far worse then better after friends begged me to get the game one finally gave me the money to just buy it I wasn't gonna buy is a second time about the only thing I find even remotely fun is mesing with the new cars and most of those are so costly that I got bored of the grind to get them the hiests are okay I guess worth running once atleast maybe twice. but this game wasn't worth the 120 bucks that was paid for it to get it two times.

Here are some pros and cons about Singleplayer and the game itself +Driving Physics and Steering are great and comfortable+Wide variety of guns and combat options+Great voice actor ensemble and radio choices+Many jokes and puns put in the game+Can be played with a controller+Lots of customization+Long Storyline (Minimum about 40 hours)+Very open world+Replayability due to many options in missions Can be a bit glitchy Gets boring offline after the ending Surprisingly low amount of accessable buildings Story can be very predictable Some side missions seem uselessNow for the multiplayer review Rockstar Games is pure garbage. They hate modding they have the worst customer support they funnel in money through BS microtransactions their hacking detection punishes innocent people solely based on the fact that these people make a lot of money and play the game a lot. The hacking detection cannot detect actual hackers making it so that there is a good 50% chance that any given server will have a hacker on it. Honestly Rockstar Games is the least consumer friendly game publisher in the gaming industry.Most people do not buy this game for its singleplayer but if you do it better be on atleast 50% off sale or you are wasting your money.8/10 singleplayer1/10 multiplayer,Grand Theft Auto V

This review needs more polishing and my review DLC is coming for xbox one and ps4 on March 11 2016. Rest assured ""the review DLC"" will be included for PC during final launch and I promise support for 4K textures in my review fonts while reading at a smooth 60 frames per second. I thank you for your patience.""Here are the pros and cons of the game.Pros Single Player Jesus the graphics of this game is fantastic. Great optimisation with PC hardware. I have liked every GTA story so far this is no exception. The map is huge. There are a variety of things you can do here just like anyother GTA.GTA Online Heists are great. I wish they could add more. 5 is not enough. Regular missions are decent. Apart from doing missions you can race deathmatch all those things which are fun. New content continously being added.Cons If you are unlucky you end up in a server with a hacker and all kinds of bad will happen to you. The anti cheat system isnt that strong if it exists in the first place. Every morning I get up run this game click ""multiplayer"" go to work and by the time I am back from work in the evening multiplayer still wouldnt be loaded. The loading screen is too long almost as long as my p*n*s.Edit Good job rockstar my friend who has absolutely done nothing got banned for no reason along with thousand others.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-20,0,0,810,False,Not Recommended,I was recently (along with 100s and possibly 1000s of other GTA users temporarily banned and (the far worse part) had my character reset to zero and ingame hard earned earned money all vanished). Researching online and reading all the other posts about this happening to people the most likely reason seems to be that a recent update by R* made their antimodding system hypersensitive to other Software. So I use discord for the first time ever to play friendly co op GTA with a bunch of great people one evening. The next time I try to log in a few days later I receive a message saying I am banned and my account reset to zero. The fun doesn't stop there though. I write unhappy but civil messages to Rockstar support asking for assistance and every single one is returned with a cut and paste list of things people do that get them banned (NONE of which i've ever done) and am implied message don't do any of these things (which I've never done) again or risk being banned again. 0 out of 10 Rockstar for valuing and respecting your customer base. &lt sarcasm&gt Thanks for the great reward for being a decent player that you just gave me I feel so appreciated. &lt /sarcasm&gt (See my original positive review below.) I really really like GTAV. Yet I'm sure it's also a psychologists nightmare. )WHAT I LOVE # The fun of crazy driving where no real people are actually physically hurt no matter what you do # The action of shoot ups with ever escalating official response options (its like being in an action movie!!) # Escaping miraculously from those massive responses # Doing missions with people where there is at least a basic degree of patience and co operation even when we fail and start again that there's some learning and strategy going on # Making a random new friend on a mission and then going on a rampage gang fight or bunch of missions with them # Motorbike races across country!! )# Train rampages! Hopping on the fladbed car of a train either cos it just rocks up when I'm fighting the cops or just getting on and blowing up some cars and then waiting for the cops to arrive and give chase. Such chaos!! Yeh!WHAT I DON'T LIKE # The waiting screens # The greedy angry impatient scramble for cash some people have (Please! It's a game. It's not real!!!) # Horribly rude impatience with people who make mistakes or get shot on a mission I mean come on if there was no risk of failure what would be the point and because there's a risk of failure people will sometimes fail!!! Whining on about it or being derogatory about their mothers or saying you wish they were dead is just you being an a**hole! Sure on a mission try and keep your together but stop with the a**hole perfectionism!! Maybe Rockstar could make categories of missions (1) Dead Serious (2) Serious But Co operative (3) Newbies and easy going. (Just a thought.)# The fact that you can't block players that are real a**holes so they can't interact with you in freemode. Not a major problem but would be damn useful sometimes. Even to be able to block them for 1hr and then have to renew it would be an awesome addition to the game.WHAT I FIND REALLY BORING # Being repeatedly killed for no reason by someone who is massively more armored and tooled up that I am. Again come on. I'm walking around and someone in an armored car starts repeatedly assassinating me!! It doesn't make me angry or competitive. It's just boring. If it's more evenly matched then at least there's the fun in trying to fight back or get away. I had a great time once where two guys in armored cars were going round assassinating people and I eventually escaped on foot when I got lucky and came across a fast car and they chased me halfway across the map trying to get me and eventually have up. Hah. Hah! Taht was awesome. Usually though I just switch to a new server# Modders who blow everyone up. Again it doesn't make me angry or upset. It's just BORING!!!! Yawn!!WHAT I RECOMMEND# Be in it for the fun# Be patient and co operative.# Give other players a chance if they make mistakes on missions. Sure if someone keeps doing the same dumb thing and getting killed pointlessly that can be a pain but just move on to another mission somewhere else. Sometimes it's just bad luck. The amount of times I've been doing really well and then some bad guy with a shot gun somehow blows my head off... Hell!# If someone pisses you off just move on. Don't waste any time with them.# Anyone is a good player (as in co operative and fun or interesting to be on a mission with) write down their online name then friend them up as soon as moving your attention away from the game isn't going to get you or anyone else killed. Build up a bank of friendsOne last thing about patience. A couple of times the message function has just vanished due to server error and people got really off with me cos I wasn't talking to them. I couldn't it was impossible. Other times lag caused problems. Again it's a GAME. Give people a break. Maybe the server is crapping out!!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-02,0,0,538,False,Not Recommended,What in the F**K happend to this game...So i'm a veteran player from day 1 on ps3 switched to ps4 and recently bought the game the crimminal enterprise starter pack and a few sharkcards on pc (i've given alot of money to Rockstar...) and been grinding my a** off to be able to afford the stupidly overpriced stuff in the game. Had a ton of fun over the years but that went downhill lately. Recently i were notified that i've been banned for 30 days and when the time expires ALL of my progress property ect. will be reset. several months of constant grind straight down the drain. Since i've never wanted to get into trouble for using mods and hacks i've stayed away from them but somehow i still got banned. As this made no sense i tried contacting rockstar to hear what the reasoning for the ban was but was only met with the same automated response that all bans are final and there's nothing to do. I've had a 2 month bad sport period revoked before as rockstar themselves admitted to me that it was a mistake and i did not do anything wrong so obviously this system that they have are NOT flawless and sometimes legit players are caught in this bug or whatever it is and rockstar won't take the time to explain themselves to you. Because you know.. they got their money right? so why would they give a f**k about you. **UPDATE** So i finally got in contact with an actual human being trough the live support chat and he actually said that the anti cheat system in GTA controlls all of the bans and that rockstar themselves actually have no control over this system. So basically they created a machine that just ban people for whatever reason and rockstar can't do aything to stop or revoke it way to go guys. Hackers are roaming every single lobby ruining the experience for everyone trying to make money legit while the legit players are getting punished. The only positive thing about this is that i can finally get over my addiction to this horrible joke of a game. I've never wanted a refund as bad as i want from this game but obviously that's not gonna happen.. All i wanna know is WHY i got banned. Naturally if i got a ticket from a police officer i would like to know why.. You would think that such a big company would at least take the time to take responsibility for their actions and let their fans know what's up but nope. I could go on and on with what's wrong with this game like the items getting more and more expensive and the missions paying less and less. Rockstar has become the shadiest and greediest scumbag company out there and i would reccomend everyone considering buying the game to leave it in the dirt where it belongs.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-24,0,0,623,False,Recommended,There is almost no point in reviewing this game because it's awesome!Gameplay Mostly improved comparing to GTAIV. Cars bikes and other vehicles for land and water handle really well. Flying helicopters feels playing with a balloon on a windy day. At least using a mouse and keyboard. On foot gameplay also feels a little better than the previous games. Also switching between 3 character more if online and leveling them up is very cool. Makes you connect to them even more. I would be cool to see more of the mini games from GTAIV in here but tennis and golf like the previous mini games work well. They are fun to do and a good reason to add more game hours to your playthrough. Visuals Graphics are insane! Some hair models could be improved upon. The look a bit fuzzy and chunky upclose. The world feels alive and huge! So much to explore.Story Overall good story. Crazy moments with Trevor family drama with Michael and how to get a live outside the hood with Franklin. The three characters interact really well. Every scene with the three of them together puts a smile on your face.,Grand Theft Auto V

It might be fun to play with a friend but most people have this game on console and don't have a high end gaming pc to even run it. At worst in order to do anything fun with the cars you need to invest time and actual money. Most of the time I spent online was racing by myself. A far cry from the fun I had on San Andreas mod servers. There was an alternative to rockstars online an actual mod serve for 5.

Honestly the creators of this game really love their community but they also love money but I mean who doesn't however this company ""rockstar"" know how to get money out of pockets.ExampleThey release shark cards on steam so now you can buy in game money with real money and right after that they release an In game multiplayer DLC that requires a huge amount of in game cash to buy any of the new cars and even clothing therefore leading quite a large amount of people bought shark cards to be able to buy this stuff. I myself am banned from GTA ONLINE due to the fact that I gave myself money using ""unethical"" methods and also gave money to other so they could buy all this new cool stuff so they could have more fun in game. I know I'm ""the kind of people that ruin the game"" but I remember GTA 4 as a easy to mod game on PC and not on console PC and console are so far apart that we shouldn't have to follow their limiting rules.

2015-06-14,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Despite a few port problems that myself and some friends were having this version of GTA very much so lives up to the hype. That being said I do have a few gripes with the single player campaign The biggest one is that the money is completely and annoyingly spread out. 1M is quite a bit in GTA but not nearly enough to start snatching up buildings and buying nice cars and past the first heist you'll stick around 1M until the end. This can make the game seem a bit annoying as more often than not you have no incentives (other than story) to continue playing the main storyline. There's very little money to be made until the end and the side quests don't give you much to build on either.Other than that it is a great game and well worth the money especially if you liked previous GTAs but I don't think I'll be replaying it anytime soon.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar/take two says they are cracking down on hackers/modders when really they are punishing the hacked/modded.I'm not even sure I'll play this game anymore when my ban is lifted. If this is how they intend to carry themselves as ""one of the most popular gaming companies"" of the time I don't want to support these F*** faces anymore. The main problem I have with getting banned when i wasn't modding is that I'm not allowed to tell my side of the story. Our legal system revolves (in theory of course) around innocent until proven guilty. However Rockstar/take two has turned this s*** into a witch hunt where there is no trial no questions. You are burned at the stake for what the actual ""witches"" (hackers/modders in this case) say. So F*** you rockstar and take two. You'll never recieve another penny from me. And my few dollars may not be enough to significantly hurt your multi however many zero's behind the number wallet it at leasts makes me feel a little better knowing that I stand my ground on this decision.Edited ***4/21/2018***I will admit when I wrote this review I was extremely salty over a t ban caused by being reported by an actual modder. the Truth is this really is a great game. They are constantly pushing out free DLC even after being on the market across several platforms for five years. I still get kicks out of the new stuff. I just wish they would get better at their cheat detection instead of just taking the word of a douchey 12 year old who is actually running mods that got mad me and my partner got a few headshots in on him (he was using the health multiplier modifier)",Grand Theft Auto V

The racing and car handling is just atrocious I can't rate it any higher than that The cars spin 180 degrees if you so much as touch an ant and then its race over the shooting from cars requires an extra pair or hands and its mostly just disappointing all around but it does look and play well I will give it that.

2015-06-13,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,"Concerning the online cheaters are becoming more and more rampant in this game. The ""good"" ones deposit money into your account (which makes me come to the conclusion that Rockstar's shark cards are one of the worst ideas ever conceived if it's so easy to get money from hackers) and the bad ones can kill you randomly stay invincible be character models they shouldn't be take over your controls etc. The online only becomes completely safe if you either play solo or do a private match with friends but even then the backwards way they coded it means that when you go into a game it forces you into a public session before you can even join friends or whatnot. Is the game part fun? Yes. However getting free money when I want to work for it and thereby taking some of the fun out of it when just handed to me and the risk of coming across meaner hackers who will torment your experience is starting to get me turned off from this game.That and the fact that if you try to get a heist setup going people only wait about 10 seconds before they leave which means it can be hard to get one going unless it's a group of four friends.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-02,0,0,67,False,Recommended,"It's a dominant feeling when owning Grand Theft Auto V simultaneously on two ""next gen"" platforms. The overload of complaints regarding the online system is fairly comprehendable but that is separated between Rockstar's aesthetic craftsmanship of this game's singleplayer story mode. If you're the kind of person to grant yourself ownership of this game just for multiplayer without cost reconsider. If you wish to advance your heist character and treat it with the best criminality as possible you'd be disappointed by the underwhelmingly wacky environment (given that Rockster doesn't give two $hits about players being banished for no apparent reason). However if you are new to the Grand Theft Auto series and want to join in the campaign portal be my or Rockster's guest. Online hackers and shark card 'problems' aside this is the game that hilariously achieves pride in its M Rating. Metacrits have already praised the game upon its 2013 release with an agreeably satisfying score of over 90. And I'm pretty sure they were talking about story mode. The next gen graphics and visual update for PC finalized pretty satisfactory but its still awesome to roam around streets you know by heart and committing unrealistic* crimes along the way. Dialogues between the characters are written extraordinarly well as well as the game's ability to provide an answer to the question ""What if I fire rockets at Micheal's house as Trevor?""

And here's why.SingleplayerThe game's story is great and the characters are unique and interesting in their own ways. Having played parts of the singleplayer campaign beforehand on PS3 I still got some good laughs from playing it because I sure do love its humor. Although at times I actually doubt that you're suppossed to laugh since the game can go from unserious to serious in the blink of an eye.There are plenty of missions to play as the three different main characters (Trevor Franklin and Michael) and they are surprisingly varied with tasks ranging from towing cars to robbing jewlery stores. When it comes to playtime I've heard that it takes about 10 15 hours to finish the campaign.To keep it short If you've always liked them gangsters you're going to have a good time.MultiplayerI haven't played that much multiplayer yet but I have played the first heist bought myself an apartment and played around in freemode with my friends. From my experience the ""hacker problem"" seems kind of blown out of proportion since I've been on a bunch of different servers and the few times I actually stumbled upon a hacker they didn't really cause me any harm. However something that did bother me was the loading times which are pretty long especially if you're on an HDD. The good in the bad is that the game doesn't load very often.All in all I've had a great time in GTA Online and I think that the jobs and activites (tennis golf deathmatch races etc.) are great and I must say that the lobby system and invite system both work really well. So if you have any friends to play this game with you'll probably enjoy yourselves a lot.PerformanceThe game runs at a constant 60+ fps on Medium to High settings on my PC which has a GTX 660 and a quad core i5 clocked at 3 GHz. If you ask me that's pretty impressive considering how great the game looks and the fact that it's open world.Closing thoughtsGTA V for PC is a really good AAA game and is well worth the 36 I paid for it. Also I think I'm right to assume that I will spend many more hours on this gem and I simply can't do anything but give it a thumbs up if not only for the truly top class Singleplayer mode.",Grand Theft Auto V

Well in GTA V you can blow up cars (wow look at that explosion) hijack aeroplanes and helichopters and mow people down (fake computer generated people not real people) the story is really good you play as three character no that ain't no mistype three characters (I'm sure you already know this since the game came out 2 years ago on last gen consoles) you play as Michael a retired ex con robber type guy who may or may not be in witness protection. Franklin who lives in the hood and is hustling anyway he can to get out of said hood. And Trevor whose a drug addict lunatic enough said. The online is pretty cool you can buy cars and apartments and clothes and shoes and tattoos and mods for said cars you can even buy chest hair for your character which is really cool if you wanna do your best Sasquatch impression you can also buy boats and planes. Speaking of boats that's how much money you're going to need to buy all that stuff which can be acquired by doing jobs (or by spending your real hard earned dollars on shark cards) All that being said if you like fun explosions action and adventure prostitutes galore then this is the game for you think of it as a new life since your real one is probably boring and filled with a bunch of pesky rules and bills and work and kids and a wife and or husband that keeps nagging at you all day to do things around the house.

It is fairly well optimized too. I could run it on an intel integrated chip. Plus the modding scene for single player is crazy and awesome.But the one thing that kills this game is the online. The feces was incinerated by the fan. Hackers run rampant and rule the online world while innocent players who legitimately worked for their progress get banned for no reason with no way of getting the ban appealed. Heck I modded in online for over a year and only recieved 2 temp bans. I never messed with other players I always played nice I just hated the grind. But the amount of people who get banned for absolutely no reason is unacceptable.This is not how an anticheat system should work.However I still reccomend this game. They finally lowered the price to $30 and the story is well worth the full $60. I say you should at least try online and play honestly. But at this point that may not matter. I have not recieved any bans or any money adjustments in over a year but the online community has gone to crap. Find some friends to play with and stick to them.,Grand Theft Auto V

I met some hackers and it was not fun ....they were farming us for kills in a deathmatch mission even if he was tripple shot in the head with sniper. I would like a more stable conexion in gta online and the minor bugs like levitating cars and spawning in your face cars fixed in the next month or so (i hope). I give it a 9.5 out of 10 .

2015-04-15,0,0,5,False,Recommended,So far so good spent 92 minutes 'playing' GTA 5 by playing if that includes staring at a loading screen then I'm currently having a grand old time. *** UPADTE 25.04.2015 **Following the recent patches I can now finally play the game and can say that a really nice job has been done by Rockstar I also own this on both 360 and PS4 and without a doubt I love playing this with mouse &amp k/b and at 2560x1440 I had quite a rocky start to getting this game working and it would also seem that not as many people had the same issue as me with getting the game up and running as I couldn't initially even get to the calibration screen yet alone the game.Now that it works I'm really enjoying the game the graphics are nice with a high res monitor they look amazing with everything maxed I've not hit any framerate issues yet and that's on a 4gb GTX 680.On a first impressions basis I'd say that this is where GTA belongs if you don't have a console version then it's worth getting on the PC if you do have a console version there's some improvements over those ports but you'd have to ask yourself is having 60fps higher res and the Movie Editor enough to make you shell out for another copy.Control wise personally for me you can't beat the good old k/b and mouse I've had a few adjustments to make with the driving sections as I do miss the refined movements you get with the analogue sticks on a joypad but that's a small price to pay in order to enjoy the game on the pc. You can play using both JP and K/B &amp Mouse which can in some respects make the driving sections easier.Overall it's a good game worth getting if you don't have it and like the GTA series I don't think you're going to find massive innovations based on the previous game but it's a GTA game and it delivers on the parts that you want it to.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm running i5 4960K 3.9ghz 16 GB 1600mhz RAM and and VouprX R9 290 OC'd to 1100Mhz and I get an average of 52FPS at 1080P on DX10 settings with most stuff either on High (not very high or ultra) or Normal. I am quite surprised actually considering the game on Max settings isn't that impressive to look at not for the specs it demands to be playable at those settings anyhow.One major drawback I find is that the keyboard controls suck not just a little but horendously. I have been switching between KB/M and Xbox One Gamepad gamepad for anything other than intense shooting sections but have now taken to using KB/M as a last resort if getting cained in deathmatch by other players or something.First person mode is the pc 's possible saving grace over console. Usually graphics and controls would be but seen as you need a rig about 3000 to run it at superior settings and the controls are abominable this not the case. First person sucks in a car and flying but on foot it is great reminds me of a shooter mirrors edge style. Where it comes into it's own is on motorbikes riding one in first person mode makes it actually thrilling! But I kinda feel like that is this PC ports only success over console versions.In conclusion good effort R* a definite improvement on previous PC ports but still not quite hitting it on the money yet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,0,0,237,False,Not Recommended,This game is mediocre at best. Yes with friends it can be fun running around killing other players but overall I'm already kinda bored. The cars are cool but not very customizable they are more customizable than previous games but really all you can do is upgrade it and change colors not a whole lot of changing the body hood or spoiler.You have stock or one other that isnt stock. The racing is fun but the driving mechanics can really suck at times. The AI are all sharpshooters with pistols... I hold my own against other players but the stupid police snipe me with pistols from so far away. The graphics are beautiful I have everything set to very high and it runs real smooth even after a couple hours of gameplay my computer is still pushing cool air out the top. So that is nice. The bottom line is this is just another grand theft auto game the major difference is the graphics and I guess video editor if your into that sort of thing. honestly I have found all the missions and heists I have done to be horrifically boring and the loading screens between them drive me F****** insane... Only get this game if you have never played one of the others til you got bored or if your into video editing.

If you simply want to play singel player the game works great buy it! A list of GTA V Online bugs happening to me and my friends all the time You cant simply join your friends. The game freeze return to single player return to empty servers/or servers with other plays and sometiems you simply get ""a unknown error occured"". We spend atleast 50% of the time trying to meet up for a heist or a mission and sometimes just sometimes we can finish it... The times we manage to finish a mission we usually end up on different servers afterwards even though we were on the same one before the mission. This gets really annyoing when you have to spend up to an hour finding or joining each other again. Mission invites dont always show and if they do you usually cant join either way. Its like winning the lottery when it actually happens. The menus are completly unlogical and many functions are missing for exampel that you cant kick players joining a mission or heist. Some people just want to ruin it for everyone and there's nothing you can do. The lagg! The lagg on the servers a real and it seems to be connected to cars you or your friends are driving. What the person driving see is never the same as the person sitting in the passenger seat see. Also other non player cars spawn/act strange and keeps jumping all over the place. Well this is some of the most impactful bugs i've encounterd and theres so many more. So dont buy this game just yet if your goal is to play online.

2018-03-11,0,0,203,False,Not Recommended,"WARNING THIS REVIEW SEMI LONG! GTA V is a great game in many ways but it does have its downside. GTA V had a bad start but at least you did not have to pay actual $$$ to get cash in GTA V Online. When Rockstar chose to let people buy shark cards and added tons of more stuff then that is where things went way off. For one Rockstar may the prices for stuff way too high and that is *one* reason people user modders this to get money God that's why in the start of GTA people do the money glitch so they can get better stuff. Then GTA V has short of becoming a ""Pay to win"" game and I say it like that because you can get better stuff. After all GTA V became crap and the only good use for it is to actual roleplay on FiveM server where you actually don't have to deal modders trollers spawn killers etc. The modder issue also has become way worst which is making GTA V it self look bad. Even rockstar banning innocent people because Rockstar is accusing people of modding after they did a heist (My friend for banned permanent for doing a heist with me and got banned for modding). In the end when GTA VI comes out I can tell you it will not be worth it unless you plan on playing on a private server. Also GTA V story mod was the only thing I liked about GTA V which is this sad for Rockstar. Redjoe678",Grand Theft Auto V

I personally have not been affected by a ban but my brother has and I deal with hackers daily so it only shows me one thing. The Rockstar ban system isn't as good as Rockstar makes it out to be. Maybe instead of having a computer ban players they could maybe have player mods or hosted lobbys so that players can administrate their own little Los Santos. Keep the system to detect ""illegal money"" but please add a way to remove money that was involuntarily added to your person. Let the players have a say in their actions.

2018-05-27,0,0,26,False,Recommended,"3/5. This game frustrated me because it started off so very well. Unlike the crud that is IV we are introduced to two characters Franklin Clinton and Michael ""Dad Nips"" De Santa who are written with authentic dialogue and have subtlety and nuance within their interactions. Franklin is strying to stay straight while being emeshed in gang territory and having gang ties. Michael is having a mid life crises while trying to deal with his selfish self absorbed young adult children and a straying wife. Their paths cross and Michael attempts to be a decent father to Franklin because he's so bad at being a father to his own kids. Things don't go rainbows and puppies but the basis is there for a good interesting relationship and story about these two.And then Trevor appears.Trevor is an obnoxious loud mouthed violent stereotype a psychotic charactature whose only positive aspect is that he is a shrug off who cares bisexual (which is exactly how it's supposed to be so props where props are due). Trevor's main purpose is in life is to kill people sell drugs and kill more people. Trevor shouts all his dialogue and reminds me of Vincent D'Onofrio playing bug alien Edgar in Men in Black. All nuance and subtlety has been thrown out. It's as if a different writer was forcibly introduced into the game e.g. ""This is the CEO's nephew Biff who's always wanted to be a video game writer."" I went from being entertained to looking up how many main missions I have left before the end. Not good.I'm up in the air about recommending this game. Trevor ruined it for me but other gamers might not care about character and story as much as I do. The game play itself is good. In fact this is the best driving I've found in a game the cars don't feel like they're completely out of control constantly. Helicopters on the other hand are the worst controls I've played. I don't feel like it's too difficult despite having no difficultly adjuster. Los Santos is one heck of a city down to the stars on the walk of fame having individual names. Bonus is that you can fail three times and then you're offered a skip section in a mission something I plan to utilize extensively to force myself through Trevor's parts in the game.ETA Finished the game. Michael is the story and the game would've been fantastic if he was the only lead. Trevor remained a dbag that brought the game way down to me. Franklin kept it real. So recommended for Michael not recommended for Trevor.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-05-29,0,0,757,False,Recommended,This game.... Its been out for five ing years. AND IT STILL LOOKS GORGEOUS!!!! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is amazing to look at and the updates with all the new stuff that R* adds is always alot of fun!!!! There is a few problems with it however.... First of all is online mode. You will find modders EVERYWHERE. Now that can be both bad AND good. Bad because there are those modders that just LOVE to command kill the whole server. Then there is the modders who are cool and will spawn money/exp or just spawn cars and let you drive them or whatever. The driving is alot of fun kiinda hard to drift around corners with how the cars work but whatever. Cars look amazing but the detail/textures on the engine when you pop the hood is not very good mostly blurred generic So for all you car enthusiasts out there... this games car engine textures are mostly .. BUT there is a few good cars with very well done textures and very detailed.PLUS and car that you can take to Benny's Original Motorworks can let you customize things like the carb airfilter etc thich is REALLY fun. Now thats online. In story mode I gotta say that I LOVED the story. Very well done!!!! No complaints. Any problems I had was jsut my own dumbass fault... For example in one mission I had to Find and deliver a uhhh whats it called? lemme look this up real quick....................................................................................................................................AHHH FOUND IT!!!! I had to deliver a Z type. Now I had done everything!!!! All the hard parts I had done. All I had to do was drive it to the airport. IT TOOK ME TWO I.N.G HOURS TO DELIVER IT BECAUSE I SOMEHOW KEPT BLOWING IT UP!!!!!!!!!! WTF!??!?!?! Anyways as I said before that was all on moi because I just couldnt drive the car for whatever reason. Any ways this game is AMAZING Love it to bits!!!! (GTA Online is where its at for fun after storymode though) Blackjack,Grand Theft Auto V

Love the first person view it's really wel done and makes a huge difference and the story is still awesome ) .On the hackers note. I joined an online sesion and enjoyed myself alot lots of people playing normally so I thought it was exaggerated on the reviews. Second sesion I joined. A hacker broke down my car teleported me out of my car I get back in my car starts changing to all sorts of colours and it starts raining money bags. Said to myself stay in the car so I don't pick up the bags and get myself banned. Next thing I know I get teleported outside my car and it starts raining money bags again. I tried to exit the online sesion as soon as possible to avoid the picking up the money bags.Bloody s up the game for everyone don't even get why someone would try to get another banned like this. was probably pulling his little willy while raining down moneybags. Sadly I didn't get his gamertag.I hope one day rockstar does something about this but there's probably not a chance.Recommended for offline gameplay not recommended for online gameplayRockstar fix yer br&gt,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,176,False,Recommended,It's GTA V on PC. Enough said......but if I must go on then I'd say it's very good. Now this is coming from Xbox 360 tho so of course it looks and plays amazingly. There are subtle changes that I think if you're a true fan you'll definitely notice how different it is. Despite the obvious launch crashes and chaos it runs really well. I mean it's beautiful. At 90+ FPS it's just awesome really. Invest in Gsync or freesync when it's out or whatever because you haven't seen anything until you've seen this at those Fps stutter/tear free. It really was meant for pc honetly and I'm not all pc master race bs either. I own consoles. This is really better. But the issues are pretty heavy right now tho. Wait til it's patched b4 you buy if you're considering it. I wouldn't want more whiners in the forums,Grand Theft Auto V

My main gripe with this game is that the online mode is a blatant money grab expect to grind endlessly to keep up with new content all cars are overpriced as and you simply can't make enough money by just playing the game with friends the game just wears people into buying dlc I got my last account banned because I started hacking just to make the game fun again and it worked! until I was banned that is.

So far i've only played about an 10 hours and come in with very high expectations. It worked on first launch no crashes or glitches. I set my graphics to my monitors resolution of 1920x1080 and set several a few items to high but left most at normal (including textures). I only have an nVidia 570 card so I can't go extreme. I chose to ignore overlimit warnings and went over the memory allocation slightly. The game still runs perfectly smooth for me so far so I may try increasing a few more settings. With my Intel i7 4770K and 16GB RAM running on Windows 10 preview x64.I've only played the story mode so far but so far seems fun in typical GTA fashion.

2015-04-20,0,0,261,False,Recommended,Having played a combined 75+ hours between the X360 and the PC I feel confident enough in my review. This game takes place in a obvious parody of Los Angeles where there are plenty of things to do and pop culture refrences to find (no spoilers for those). The main story has a total of 40 hours and then another 5 in side missions. The main story is very different from those of the other GTA games but it is still quite interesting. The online mode is par with some other online games but it could be more fleshed out in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

However to get the DX11 1080p 60fps youll need GTX780ti or better. I have that and i still havent maxed out everything. If you have a half decent SLI or Crossfire setup you should be good to go. The singleplayer is fantastic and the online feature is also very luring. The online heists are pretty dang fun too BTW. I give it a 10/10. The story is complex and the voice work is amazing as usual. I was mad all the way back in february when they delayed it then delayed it.... then delayed it... but it was worth it.

2017-06-16,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,GTA V was at one point great game. That much is clear. Now however the Online mode is full of hackers and engineered to make you pay for microtransactions. Now Take Two sees it fit to ruin the fun and replayability of the single player mode that can come from modding. Most people who play this game already have a copy so the entire purpose of having a PC copy is to use the mods. When Take Two tried to shut down OPENIV they made a big mistake. Unless you want to play the vanilla single player experience for the first time this game is probably not for you. TL DR Online is a cash grab full of hackers and mods are now almost unusable in the singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

So great job I would be a lot less salty if you hadn't banned me for being innocent so congrats to you and take two.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,631,False,Recommended,UPDATENow that they have addressed this issue and handled it appropriately I think anyone with a functioning brain can agree this is a great if not the greatest as of yet game.________________________________________________________________I literally cannot believe they are banning now even for single player mods that do not affect online play whatsoever. I have considered the Grand Theft Auto line of games my favorite since GTA 2 and once they went 3D the allure was almost exclusive for car modding for me. I loved being able to have a personalized version for me with genuine cars custom skins even my own face on my character etc. to be able to show off to my friends and enjoy myself. I always thought Rockstar was aware that their games were such an amazing canvas for such creativity but now they're permabanning people from SP just because they want to alter their save files in single player? Or mod cars? Or improve their field of view? This is insane and one of the worst mistakes in video game history since the creation of ET by Atari.It is common sense that modding for *Online* purposes should get you a permaban seeing as online modding is also known as HACKING. But for single player? There is no shame in using a single player trainer after you've bored yourself with all there is to do or having a Corvette instead of a Coquette or maxing out your FOV because you have two 4GB GPU's. This is madness and by the recent reviews of your game Rockstar I think it is quite clear that you have f#%&amp ed up big time. I hope you correct this immediately.Give us what we want you already have our money. Ban the pirates and online hackers but leave us single player engineers alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's important to remember that they will not ban for single player mods as they have outright stated on their news site and almost all of the crashing issues have been fixed in a recent update. I have friends who used to only be able to play online for about an hour but after the update we were able to play for 4+ hours consistently.

2017-10-24,0,0,357,False,Not Recommended,Buy it during sale. High risk of being banned.The support team is horrible The contents can be REALLY entertaining Story is acceptable and the graphics are amazing. Game is alive and constantly updating bringing great new contents. File size is huge but worth it. But the reason I'd give it a thumbs down and say buy it during sale is mainly because as others and also me have stated It is a banning simulator. Also as said before The Rockstar support is very bad/ignorant up to a point that I am not sure if I am actually talking to a human at all.How I got banned? Whilst driving a Zentorno that took me months to get (I had to do VIP work bcs I did not know about the games that reward alot more) Everywhere I go mods just kept dropping the cashes everywhere. Some added me and offered to teach me the hacks. I always was the one who refused and told them no I would never cheat it ruins the fun of the game and it would not be worth my money at all if i had everything. Few days later RS banned me for a month After that I came back and the transformation race was introduced I used akuta while everyone else used tron bikes and since I have played 80% of my time with my bikes I am godlike with driving it. I won my first transformation race starting with an akuta. I believed the game thought I was cheating so they banned me permanently. It's been more than a year and I still can't do anything about it. It is one of my favourite games ever till this very day and I just wish Rockstar believed me. It hurts to love something so much just to be thrown away by it. That's all enjoy your game,Grand Theft Auto V

Well after getting passed that and finishing the game it seems less compelling than previous games in the series. There's not much holding me to the game after finishing the campaign (which is pretty weak honestly). This contrasts with previous games in the franchise that allowed you to build status outside the campaign. The best cars are easy to find (can't believe I'm complaining about that). It's quite cut scene driven. Just let me play in the damn sandbox. The online play is mostly player v player combat and combat is the last thing this game should be showcasing (it sucks as usual).,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is alright but that's not why you really play this game. The gameplay is very fun with many options for guns and such. Online adds tons and tons of replability with it's own set of heists and all around fun chaos with other players. The community for the game I found was quite good. In one lobby we all basically sat about and just chatted without any interuptions and honestly I haven't seen one hacker while playing. There are some other things I could go on about but my scale says it all This is a must play. Get it if you can.That said...For a game that it's predecessor had one of the biggest modding scenes of any game they've treated modders like Revising this to say give it a pass.,Grand Theft Auto V

Other then the constant hackers who will blow you up in 5 seconds after joining teleport you half way into the ground and set you on fire (not to mention the blowing up of my vehicle then having to pay for it's return). There are also a LOT of bugs like the one that pops up from time to time about my friend still being in the tutorial (which he is not) but now I'm finding out that he is getting missions that should have unlocked for me that I've never seen. Like for Simeone Lester Ron Merryweather drops etc. Being level 28 I should be getting them from time to time but through hours of play haven't seen a single one.Admittedly it was funny when I popped out of tutorial with high hopes going ""Oh I can't wait to play with friends and meet people!"" then before I could get in a car I got snipered and watched my vehicle explode. I see why the 500k comes with the game now. . I do not recommend this game till it is fixed or they make it easier to contact Rockstar gaming as I have yet to find it in ANY of the options in game.

2015-04-21,0,0,172,False,Recommended,It's been a very long time since I've played a game this much. Seriously blows away my expectations the only problems I've had are a few texture issues and one time where it hanged after the end of an online mission (out of 60 hours) howeer YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY VARY there are still players having issues.I feel the single player is very well done no real complaints at all. The multiplayer on the other hand I would really like to see more development (as I'm sure is coming) I would LOVE to be able to experience the full Los Santos with my friends meaning I'd love to see the wildlife put into the game the ocean especially is so boring without it.. The leveling up system is a bit of a drag at first limited missions and weapons but a little grinding and I'm starting to see the online game open up for me. If you're purely interested in just doing missions with friends it's great but this game is so beautiful to look at and just drive around in I'd love to see the freemode opened up a bit more and I know I see other people online asking for the wildlife to be added in.And on a final note about online Rockstar please make it easier to create an invite only session. I'm so fed up with getting kicked into a public session after playing with my friends especially after starting in a invite session. Yes I understand I can turn on passive mode and I do see some promise with the commending system but a lot of people just find it fun to have the map to their friends so why make it a lengthy process to get there?,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,109,False,Recommended,First ImpressionsHaving played neither the console version nor any other game in the series I was pleasantly surprise by how much effort has been put into the game by Rockstar which is good considering that they must have delayed the game at least three or four times. It also runs fairly nicely on my dual core CPU providing it is set to high priority in the task manager wih the lowest the framerate ever drops being around 45FPS and maintaining a solid 60FPS indoors and in enclosed locations. I can safely say that the CPU is the bottleneck here and I can crank the game up to maximum setting without a performance change (graphics card being a GTX 970). The game is very well optimised.OverviewYou are placed in the role of the three protagonists who can be switched between at most points in the game all with very well portrayed and unique personalities unlike some (I'm looking at you Aiden Pearce). While the story can be slow moving at some points the heists and parts which involve actual gunfights and car chases really make your heart pump (and you feel cool after a getaway on the side) and the sidequests are fairly in the sense that some can be extremely fun and others can be you towing a car from one place to another for five miles).WeaponsThere are many weapons which can all be customised with attachements and skins all with slight or major variations (i.e. a heavy handgun is a lot more different to a grenade launcher than it is to a pistol). None of them are overpowered or underpowered.VehiclesThe wide range of vehicles is great especially with some being fairly unique (like a supercar with a reflective silver paintjob). The main types of vehicles are cars bikes planes boats and helicopters with a few sub categories like quad bikes and jetskis.OnlineThe online play is by far my most favourite aspect of the game from thrilling heists to car chases to buggering about shooting stuff up it's all there. It's like the singleplayer but with more features it is also so much better with friends.ConclusionThe game is amazingly well optimised with solid gameplay and an infinite amount of detail way to much to list and many aspects likely still to be discovered.Overall I award this game a score of 8.5 out of 10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-16,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,Oh my god first of all let me get this situation out of the way. I was playing the game happy as can be when I decided to plug in a controller. I could practically hear my computer wheezing to try the run the now 2 fps game. It's been lagging ever since. Pros Great for mods Higher texture than the ps4 ( WHEN GTA RUNS ) Also full controller support maybe possibly my game died before I could really test it.Cons Hard to start up. Not kidding it takes my 2 minutes to get the game to even show me the launcher let alone wait for it to load. Never remembers setting. I have played this game like 15 times over the 14 hours and EACH TIME I had to go into the setting and turn on fullscreen mode. Seriously? Moody in terms of performance. Over the course of the 15 times I've played at least a third of the time the game would barely go above 10 fps when it ran. Other times I was reaching well into the 60s maybe even 70s. NO STEAM OVERLAY ( If that's what it's called ). Whenever you try to Google something prepare for a battle because GTA 5 is getting ready for a war with Steam. It never lets you see what you're doing as it wants to take control and forces you out. I've even had it flash between overlay and the game repeatedly for minutes before I restarted the game. EDIT Also wanted to add that GTA online is a grind fest. Not even one mission is remotley original. Over all GTA 5 on Steam seems like a missed opportunity. It's almost as if Rockstar doesn't even care about the pc gamers and just stuffs their pocket full of the consoles' money without glancing at pc. Even when we got a port it was a performance nightmare. Just save yourself the trouble and buy a ps4 for and GTA 5.,Grand Theft Auto V

Played all the rest on console till I was able to get my own PCThis year it was given to me as a gift. Finished the story mode in 5 days have yet to try the online but hoping to.Its action/adventure and you basically get thrown in a sequence of missions commiting crimes covering them up for you or others and switching between several people who all come together in the story. You can play the story mode at your own pace. Stop and save whenever and being able to roam around find easter eggs and goof off is always a treat.I can't really say much about playing online with it but I've watched videos of play throughs the mods you can put on it and a lot of what can be done is pretty hilarious and interesting.Well worth getting and was so happy when it came out.

2017-06-17,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,Moving to ban modding(open iv) and in turn driving offline players online for new content to bolster their own macro transactions I absolutely will not stand for this. Unreasonable prices online for cash ($144.48 CDN for 8 mill the time of this review) absolutely insane given the hackers that are online giving millions away for free in a few seconds. I think Take Two should treat the modding community with a little respect given quite a few features in GTAV were features that were blatent ripoffs of GTAIV mods.Now you too can play in the buggy hacker laden community that is GTAV. I can't count how many times in a play session everyone blows up due to some hacker or people are given 50+ mill by anonymous players but I guess they can't really be hackers since they are all banned right?____Update September 25th 2017 OPENiv negotiations took place which is what should have happend to begin with. Tried the online experience again 2 days ago after a long hiatus. The first instance had a hacker that threw everyone around and killed them as well as removed all of your guns causing loss of profits from missions. I changed instances and the second instance had a more vulgar hacker threw cars and people around endlessly until my game crashed (couldn't even report player).Long story short if you like the single player it might be worth a look.Online experience isn't.

In a recent bone headed move Take Two has sent a cease and desist letter to one of the largest modding communities to stop them from making SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mods for gta any longer. Watch for them to start selling mods now. This kind of anti consummer behaviour is what is slowly killing the gaming community.

2016-05-15,0,0,408,False,Not Recommended,The game has a good story line and there is lots of modding opportunities for Single Player such as LSPDFR. The downside is that the online mode is not worth it and there is no continuation of the story line after you have performed the final heist.

2015-12-11,0,0,212,False,Not Recommended,Buy it for the single player not for the multiplayer.Rockstar squeezed every last penny from GTA Online for 4 years (last gen and now new gen) and now they're telling us that they have no resources to make a single player DLC. Of course this is blatantly them trying to cover up how much $$$ they've been able to make from setting insanely high prices in every Online update either you will waste your time grinding days and hours for a single vehicle or property to actually be able to start the new missions from the update or you will buy Shark Cards to save yourself the time. Obviously Online has made them heaps of money so they chose abandon their status as a good gaming company that once made good fun games into a company that wants to exploit its players.

2015-12-08,0,0,226,False,Recommended,It's GTA 5 by Rockstar Games the best GTA to date and a big improvement on GTA 4 which quite frankly broke my heart not the storyline mind you I loved all the stories for GTA 4 but just didn't have the same amount of side activities once you finished the game where as in GTA 5 they brought all that back and more.GTA 5 is by far probably one of the best games you can get on Steam by a long shot. The download and install through Steam is not fun though.9.5/10 Great game everything rocks except I don't like that there is no crouch button when you get into shoot outs you either gotta get to cover or you are a sitting (standing) duck.

2015-12-08,0,0,211,False,Recommended,Alright.. So I don't pay full price for games very often anymore. Something told me this game would be different and I paid for it about 2 days before release.I have to say I am so happy I did. The story was fun the characters were realistic and loveable the gameplay was classic GTA with some nice new twists but best of all was the ONLINE GAMEPLAY.Online was so much fun. The matchmaking was a little screwy especially using a gamepad on the PC version but other than minor bugs it was incredible to be having a GTA experience doing jobs earning cash going on sprees that all involved the chance of another human being coming crashing through your screen in an armored hatchback or picking up your car with a giant magnetic helicopter. I put hours and hours into getting a nice house a nice suit a nice car and then I had so much fun ruining them all with blood and gasoline in the company of friends.If the community is still alive when you read this pick up the game.If it's on sale for a decent price grab it even just for the single player story.Trevor is worth at least $60 alone.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-08,0,0,779,False,Recommended,Pretty much a perfect game except for poor optimization for Dual Core CPU's and the fact that it's based on grinding In game currency and/or buying Shark Cards with Real Currency Money. Grand Theft Auto V runs pretty smooth on my laptop with a GTX 850M (4GB VRAM) an Intel Core i5 4210U 2.7 GHz and 8 GB DDR3 RAM. I play on somewhere between the highest and ultra graphics at around 45 fps constant except for CPU demanding settings like 'Draw Distance' and 'HD Rendering when flying'. In total I have 560 hours on Online with my transferred account from Playstation 3 my rank is at 107 for my main and 125 for my troll account. The only things that could be much better is connectivity to the Rockstar game servers and the Anti Cheat (Online) system.

It's amazing a masterpiece if you will and the game feels fresh with now 60fps and amazing graphics it really feels like a new game. I can run it on all very high at 60fps on an i5 4690k at 3.5 GHz 8gb RAM and a gtx 970 at 4gb of VRAM.The story is great and I already talked about it a touch but it is great pulled me in once again getting real emotions and attachments to each character. The heists give it a fresh feel with them being a new edition to the GTA franchise and make it feel like you are really one of the characters by letting you choose which way you want to carry out a heist or a robbary or an asssanination. The missions are linear Franklin doing more ""gangster"" missions with Michael doing ""upper class"" missions such as yoga and Trevor doing well hilarious and explosive missions. The three characters each have their own personality and emotions. Franklin being very 3 bit Michael being relaxed and upper class and Trevor being a mainiac.Overall the game is great and the new graphics and 60fps give the game a very fresh feel to them and the story is very interesting and cutting edge. for 24 on Winter Sale it really is a steal.UPDATE I've noticed a bug where the game drops to 30fps and locks for 2 seconds and then goes back to 60fps this happens whenever I boot up my latest save and I have to wait a while for the game to fix itself.",Grand Theft Auto V

You can do plenty of different activities.Online in my opinion isn't bad at all. You may see 90% of the Negative Reviews are either modders or Rockstar shutting down GTA MP. Shouldn't give a thumbs down for a whole game just because of the online mode.The game is also optimized very nicely.

Random strangers always mess up ur heists there should be severe penaltys for this kind of behaviour so people start to take it abit more seriously.3.

I waited a year for a game i love to come out on pc and paid for the game for a second time just to play the game in all it's glory on the pc so imagine my suprise when i went to play online today got in my car drove to the garage in a new car spent most of my money customizing it drove back to my garage and just before going in i got blown up....fair enough respawned got shot respawned tried to shoot the person glitching all over the place got killed respawned got put in a box and blown up so many times my pc locked up and i had to pull the plug. it is obvious that Rockstar no longer cares for it's fans on the pc. Some may find this funny others will not but i for one will never play the game again. You have been warned!,Grand Theft Auto V

I bought it 2 weeks ago when it was in summer sale and was really hyped about the game.Played with a couple of friends till we were like rank 40 and then we first same someone that could be considered a cheater running in around in the streets blowing people up with no rocket animation or something.After we were trying to talk to this guy he kept spawning money bags under our feet now one day later i cant log in into the game anymore and it says i have a 30 days ban. I have no chance to contact rockstar games because they dont addresse to this problem.. im kinda about that because i just bought...So Pros awesome gameplay with alot to doCons worst customer support ive seen in my entire life + the possibilty to get banned for literally doing nothing and standing underneath cheater spawned moneybags,Grand Theft Auto V

Cheats are the biggest problem you cannot enter a game without cheats ruining the game.I recommend that you play with friends only in an ""invite only session"" if you want to avoid the annoying cheats.GTA DOLLARS OK! they made a really good game but... Rockstar have made it so that if you want to have real fun you have to spend alot of money making your vehicles the best they can be. I have been playing since the day it was released on the PS3 and i spend alot of time doing missions and heists to make money which hardly cover your ammo costs.The result is you ""have"" to buy gta dollars as cars cant be stolen as often as you want and do not pay out that much when you do.I have bought gta dollars a few times which i didnt mind doing ! but FFS when i spend hard earned money for virtual money and then i join i random lobby what do i see!!!.*People asking cheats to give them money*....WTF so lets say ive just gone and bought what is it $8.500.000 gtad's? which is hmmmm 54.99 lol i could have just gone in any lobby and found a cheat and got all those dollars by begging in practically any server.Thats if you wasnt spawned to some remote area frozen in place and money bags spawned on you by some cheat you dont even know which does happen!.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-30,0,0,72,False,Recommended,What more can be said about GTA 5 that you haven't heard already? Rockstar usually make amazing games and this one is no exception to that. The open world element of the game has been perfected as you can easily navigate the entire world without even using the minimap! That demonstrates the games ability to create landmarks that are easily recognisable. The world is very diverse with many different areas and different things for most types of gamers. The gameplay is very responsive with very good feedback as the guns feel responsive whenever you pull the trigger. Shooting an npc gives you the correct feeling unlike GTA 4 which made them feel abit bullet spongy. If you use a controller vibrations are as you would expect and the controls make the game easy to playthrough and not difficult to just pick up and play. The story is fantastic with three playable characters a never before for the GTA series or maybe for Rockstar as a whole. There are many different great set pieces in the game which look fantastic and are pulled off very well. The game also has an online counterpart dubbed GTA Online. This part is different but similar to the single player. It is rather buggy but the bugs are slowly being ironed out. The servers can sometimes die which can be a huge pain but whenever the are working the connection is quick and smooth with lag being rare (but it can and does occur). The public lobby's are as expected walk around minding your own business will get you killed pretty quickly. However if you play the online with friends in a private lobby then the online section will be great fun as you's can do anything you want. Wanna rob a store? Go ahead. Wanna skydive? Jump off the nearest mountain! The possibility's are endless and the amount of fun you can get out of it is the same amount.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-22,0,0,543,False,Not Recommended,The game is astounding in all respects however the online is a mess. There is no division among servers so someone in America with a ping of 200 may be lagging around your server and that is only 'IF' you are successful in getting online. In truth the system being used is so ancient and prehistoric that you will have spent more time loading than playing the game. You want to set up a dedicated server? Load single player then load multiplayer then load a mission load the players into your mission load the mission itself and then when done load the end of the mission and load the server back up again. Usually invited players are kicked back to main menu and have to be invited again to the server. When you play online and don't enter any events or missions you die by severe lag or get disconnected.Worst of all is the t where Rockstar service is unavailable and you have no reason at all as to why you cannot connect but your friends might get online even though it says the services are unavailable. Its due to terrible online design and no literally no money spent on buying servers.If you buy this game to get online just be aware you may never actually get online and all the t methods people tell you to do in order to get on will get you no where because this is all based on the terrible service from rockstar. Again another example of a game company that milk your money and tell you to go yourself when their online service breaks down. In truth Steam should be removing this off their store as it only tarnishes their good reputation. Would love to continue playing the game but have been unable to for 2 days. Was playing perfectly fine for 3 days then this Its a disgrace. And a waste of my time and money.,Grand Theft Auto V

This is the quality of game that PC Gamer's expect and richly deserve. Studio's need to take notice because the bar has been raised. If substandard ports like Alien Isolation Splinter Cell and Mortal Kombat X are the reason PC Gamer are often grumpy then games like this surely must be the reason why we carry on buying expensive GPU's and overpriced accessories. To say this game is visually stunning is a gross understatement. The gameplay refinements made in the last two years help deliver on some of the best narrative you will find in modern gaming. When GTA III first came out it completely changed gaming this iteration of GTA does the exact same thing. This is the best game ever made and nothing really comes close.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,253,False,Recommended,"Great game but there is one problem which is that the game has a memory issue which causes it to get lower and lower framerate the longer you play. After playing for awhile you will start to experience frame drops which get progressively worse the more areas of the map you load. This is extremely frustrating because there doesn't appear to be a fix other than to ""just upgrade your computer."" I have an Intel core i5 processor 8GB RAM and an NVIDIA GTX 1080 TI graphics card so while I am not exactly running a NASA computer it's still pretty decent. Rockstar doesn't appear to care about this issue as they seem offended that anyone would dare to play their game without what I feel like most people would consider an exessive amount of RAM. Game itself is pretty fun apart from the technical issues (and the fact that most of the people in the online mode are whiny little 12 year olds). Story is alright walking is a little clunky and cars control pretty decently (plus when the game is running well it looks quite pretty). Honestly the online mode is not horribly interesting unless you are running the FiveM client and getting on RP servers or you have a few friends that own the game. The money system in online is horribly grindy. The only real way to make money is by doing missions that you probably don't have the money to buy gear for which leaves you with the option of either robbing stores (which doesn't pay very well) joining a mission and hoping you get matched with someone who has cool stuff and can carry everyone through paying for the Shark cards (which I do NOT recommend since you will have way too much money and way too little skill plus the fact that you probably already paid somewhere around $60 or so for the game) or doing what I did which is just spend around 10 15 hours running races to get enough money to buy the gear you need to do the missions that pay well enough to be worth doing. Overall though I would say it's probably one of those games most people should at least have in their library somewhere since I can pretty much guarantee at least 100 or so hours on the singleplayer story alone. Plus with a couple of friends you might even have some fun just screwing around in the godforsaken hole that is online mode.TL DR Buy the game for the singleplayer mode and the huge open world. Online is grindy and toxic (although some fun can be had if you have friends).",Grand Theft Auto V

There ARE hackers everywhere using godmode cheats and stupid files like that but as long as you stay away from them or go into passive mode you will be fine. Another thing this game takes bloody FOREVER to get going properly.

2015-12-31,0,0,100,False,Recommended,After playing GTA V for a good 50 hours I can confidently say that this is one hell of a game possibly even a top 10 for me. I don't know what it is but cursing down Interstate 2 (5) in a convertible on a hot summer day with a mini SMG shooting anyone who dares cut you off is a special kind of fun. The missions are diverse fun and challenging. I haven t really played any GTA Online yet but I m sure I ll get around to it. Here are the pros/cons of the game I have found so far Pros Huge diverse open world that GTA is famous for. You can drive off road downtown or even go boating in your yacht. Cars cars cars. I love driving in GTA and with the improved driving physics and increased number of vehicles GTA V is a driver's paradise. It may not be a driving simulator but damn it's fun. I LOVE the characters and their unique abilities. The three way switching system is great and I like how each character has their own unique background.Cons The helicopter and plane controls are absolutely atrocious. I failed a mission 4 times in a row looking for the right key to make the plane ascend. I eventually just reconfigured them but by default they are mapped to the numpad which is OK I guess but on a laptop without one you will need to make some changes. The DRM seems pretty insane and I hope that it never becomes an issue. So far it hasn t been but I m suspicious that it may cause problems in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am happy to report no crashes whatsoever even with mods installed all of the missions so far have worked perfectly and the cell phone always pops up! The vanilla game itself is one of my favorite GTA games to date and it is even more fun once the modding begins. I have played this game on both the console and on the computer and let me say that I am extremely happy that I gave GTA on the pc another chance. Highly recomended 9 out of 10 rating!!! ),Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-31,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Decided to buy this game for a 3rd time since it was on sale for pc. I orginally had it for the ps3 when it came out and then the ps4 when it came out on that console. Going from those consoles to pc is a welcome change overall faster loading and the option to switch between mouse and keyboard and controller on the fly. I am playing mainly online and the only downside to that is the modders but what can you do? I didn't stay on gta on the ps4 because people didnt really talk and the ones who did usually had their mics always on so i could hear their mother in the background telling them to come eat dinner. Overall I am satisfied with this game and super happy I could transfer my characters.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-01,0,0,327,False,Recommended,This is pretty much the perfect game. Even the single player part of it alone deserves a full price purchase. If you ever liked any of the previous iterations you're gonna love it. The multiplayer is a pretty terrific idea but it isn't always fun. Especially if don't have any friends... Right anyway. So heists are fun but competitive modes such as deathmatches and races are almost always empty or at least they were for me.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-01,0,0,109,False,Recommended,First of all I love this game ... been a fan of the entire series since the very first game IV although one of the greats just didn't really click (insert hate comment here!) between Niko and the whole dating mechanics they somewhat lost me.This one however the game style seems more similar to what we used to get early on ... I have to agree with some reviewers that the game leaves you wanting more after the story wraps up in single player mode and that it becomes a true fan thing afterwards to push for gold on mission try to cause chaos or finish every single task in the game and push for achievements and that works for me so I m happy.I have just started playing Online initial thoughts looks good the newly added protection mechanism (disable something something where no one can shoot you I think it s called passive mode) seems to work or maybe it's just because I play in hours no one is online not sure but no complaints from me yet anyways!The 3 character theme heist the voice acting the style of missions the amount of details cramped into the beautiful city and now playing online I have enjoyed almost everything in this game and for me personally I couldn t get any game to get me hocked this much in a very long time (with a busy schedule) this one gets my vote for a full score and a recommendation to anyone to play this one,Grand Theft Auto V

I had never played a gta game before so i was wondering where do I start. So I saw gta san adreas and played that loved it and beat it. I then was wondering what next so I played gta 4 and that was amazing to me how good the graphics where then and how realistic it was I was so amazed by then. When I finished beating that game I waited for so long it felt like for gta 5 like I was so hyped. The night gta 5 came out I got it and I played the out of it on xbox 360. I then sold my xbox and got a ps4 and got gta 5 for that and played the out of it even more. Now I got a pc for christmas and I got this for it and a few other games And its even better than before.

Don't get wrapped up in trying to grind for money in the multiplayer however you'll never have enough and it won't be that fun because R* is pretty clear they'd rather have you buying the money,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-04-23,0,0,320,False,Recommended,Being one of the best selling video games of all time I felt that it is worthy of a review. Being honest (this actually probably goes to many people) GTA V is actually the only GTA game I ve ever purchased. Although it is worthy of this having the best visuals biggest map largest player base and most detail. The story mode can be completed between 25 30 hours and having 7 hours just of cutscenes! The story mode truly is like a complex movie clearly grabbing inspiration from a handful of crime movies such as ones directed by Scorsese. The story includes numerous complex characters who we connect to seeing both their lives at home and their lives as kickass criminals. Throughout the story you get a good amount of time playing whoever you want although most of your time you actually will probably spend exploring around the map. The map as a whole is around 100 square miles being one of the largest detailed game maps ever made. In single player mode another thing many people find themselves doing on PC at one time or another is modding. Modding is not recommended by Rockstar by any means and there is always the risk of being banned but as long as you only mod in single player mode you aren t risking much (they only take online modding seriously and I highly discourage it). Modding single player is pretty awesome though allowing for so many new possibilities. You can use flying cars you can become a superhero change the course of time etc. Although Online mode is where it s at. In online mode you can do hundreds of missions and games with friends and Rockstar is adding new content on a regular basis (making people question if there is a GTA VI in the making). In online mode one of the main status indicators are people s vehicles. Most of the major updates involve cool vehicles like winged motorcycles Deloreans underwater cars etc. You can even own a yacht that is equipped with a helicopter luxury motor boats and jetskis. Multiplayer frequently is dominated by modders though which can be interpreted as a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes modders are only there to feel powerful and repeatedly mass kill everyone on the server but sometimes they make it rain big bills and get you enough to buy that turreted car you were saving up for. GTA V Online never really gets old even if you ve done a lot. Even if you aren t working on missions you can have fun in the world of Los Santos doing pretty much whatever you want.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can get one shot by some 12 year old that stole mommy's credit card and bought an effectively invincible vehicle and there are so many hackers that there truly is no point even trying to play for real anymore.Don't go anywhere near the multiplayer no matter how many friends you have.

A high end car itself costs nearly 3 million dollars . Dont forget the houses or other stuff like bunkers etc. The game is too much of a grind and rockstar keeps encouraging players to buy shark cards while they release dlc that makes gta online a cyberpunk demo .

2018-08-11,0,0,705,False,Recommended,Labor of Love The best way to describe this game. As one who enjoys open world multiplayer games with a variety of content with the addition of a great singleplayer campaign with a great story I do enjoy this game greatly. Never have I been able to run out of things to do in either the campaign or online nor have I exhausted new and creative ways to experience the wide variety of gameplay presented. Unfortunately Grand Theft Auto really makes you fight for it's affection. There are no small shortage of reasons to dislike this game a few major ones I wish to go in detail for later but it is safe to say that no game is without flaw and GTA has quite a lot. As often as you can enjoy this game you can just as quickly despise it. When I bought the game half off years ago I had been anticipating playing it. I had seen several people I follow publish videos of their antics online and was noticeably intrigued. Playing it with my friends who already owned it only further made me anxious to obtain it. When I first started my initial opinion was neither good nor bad. There had not been any particular thing that swayed me one way or the other and I sought to play it more to formulate my own general consensus on it. As I continued playing it I began to look beyond minor flaws in favor of the increasingly positive gameplay. As of wiriting this review I own dozens of cars buildings and businesses and tens of millions of dollars. I find this game extremely fun to play fully aware that there are flaws which are in the grand scheme of things undermined by the overall pleasant experience and satisfaction I get from it. One of the key selling features for me was GTA Online a chance to not only do everything the main characters from the story undertook but now with friends. I could partake in all manner of new events online and for someone quite introversive made several friends who have only made the game more enjoyable. This game has really left a positive impact on me. I can remember with ease all of the fun I have had over the years. I can easily consider this one of my favorite games of all time. For those yet to purchase it the game can feel quite overwhelming at first even throwing too much at you. Once you get accustomed to the controls gameplay mechanics and ultimate objectives for your character the fun begins. For such a large place to explore there are hundreds of small and large things to busy yourself with. Grow a criminal empire untertake ando create the most extravegant of races hold car shows and goof off in rather eccentric vehicles the choice is yours. Whatever you want to do if it is in this game there will easily be hundreds of hours avaible for that activity. Now I understand that I am one person and one who probably has quite a few deviating opinions from that of several others. To give them a fair chance you should know what may be of great importance to you. Overwhelmingly most reasons not to buy this game given by others can be boiled down into the fact that Rockstar does a poor job of regulating its game from modding and that heaven knows how many accounts have been unjustly suspended and several hundred and even several thousand hours of progress have been lost. This is more than enough to justify one turning away from a game and my opinion should be taken in this regard with a grain of salt as I have not had my account suspended. With that said in a very careful attempt to analyze these complaints I am going to attempt to ask a question I kindly request not to take as insincere. I am curious and would like to ask these reviewers if their accounts had not been suspended would they recommend this game? From the hundred of reviews I have seen over the years I can only infer that they would recommend it as there are few other problems major enough to warrant a negative review. As someone who still holds a lot of emotional attachment to a great many games I can be easily angered when I lose gameplay for a title I have invested a lot of time in. However is it not the job of a review to analyze the game as a whole and not based upon one bad experience? From what I know about games losing all gameplay is the worst possible thing that could happen and that it does not occur quite often in terms of one person. I don't think you should not inform those interested in purchasing GTA that this thing can happen but I do not think that the most extreme problem a person can experience with a game should be the foundation on why you discourage others from buying it. I myself am not without a handful of complaints and do not blindly defend any game or developer. Rockstar does need to better manage their game with modding modders can be a right pain the butt at times several features in the game are quite irritating and seems to only serve the conquest of griefing GTA is not immune from microtansactions a problem worthy of its own category the K/D ratio has spawned a depraved group of tryhards that only make the online experience worse the list goes on. But at the end of the day I still find that while all of these things can let the game down they are only small and brief instances of negativity while the game itself with nothing else attached can still deliver a positive outcome. Ultimately I can determine that the majority of my complaints can be levelled at people abusing mechanics or actively trying to irritate me online. If I were to play the game alone or only with friends my list of complaints would vastly diminish which I believe speaks for the actual quality of GTA and not of the players. I can not speak for everyone but if I can hate the tryhards and griefers but love the game I would consider the game still worth purchasing. No doubt there will be rainy days but if you still think the game as a game is good then stick to it and do your best to enjoy it. In conclusion I would recommend checking the game out via let's plays analysis and reviews and the opinions of friends and/or colleagues you trust. For the price this is a game you should research carefully before buying or just wait until a rather generous sale to pick it up. If at all possible find a friend who owns it and ask to try it out. If you think that you will be able to look beyond the actions of a rather irritating minority of players for a generally impressive game I recommend it. If not I would probably say not to buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-28,0,0,686,False,Recommended,I have played this game for quite some time the multiplayer is amazing to say the least even with all the problems it has for example things that you build only last for a session(not to be mistaken with things that you buy). The game lags a lot on multiplayer even when you have an awesome internet connection. You do have to grind a lot for the money that you require to buy new and important things but there are a lot of things so that you never get bored.The online community when you are a noob is less than welcoming. They keep blowing you up until you learn to lay low and even kill them(I had a fun time killing the killers though). Trust me you'll learn quick or leave.My biggest complaint would be that once we build an MC and add players to it they go away as soon as they leave the game which makes it a chore to keep inviting them again and again to join the MC every time you login,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-28,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This game is an oddball for me. The story mode is phenominal I've 100% it twice once on the Xbox 360 and another on the PS4. I have not gotten around to beating it on the PC due to laziness but nonetheless I've had my fair share of the story to say the least. In terms of gameplay it is definitely dependant on how you play with the control setup. But once you have that sorted away you should have no issues at all. The game is so smooth and very easy get get used to. There is no skill based things that you can improve upon at least to my knowledge. The controls on the keyboard and mouse are very complex and sometimes don't make sense so using a controller is highly reccomended. If you're using the keyboard and mouse for combat while using a controller for vehicles it will be a 10/10 experience. The online is another case though as once you 'beat' it as in basically doing everything there is to do there is no replay ability unless you're willing to wait for a lackluster update. I'm currently around level 177 and I still find myself unable to have fun. The missions are repetative and usually fetch quests which get boring after you play for about an hour. The community really takes the cake when it comes to negativity as this is probably one of the top 10 most toxic gaming communities from my personal experience. In every public lobby I always find myself being shot at as soon as I'm in the vicinity of another player even though I mean no harm. I go into passive mode after my car is blown up for the hundredth time and I'm then called a . It's not entirely the experience in trying to go for so ya. TL DROverall I rate the game an 8/10. The story is great the characters are very interesting the gameplay is fun the controls are iffy on the keyboard and mouse and the online is cancer.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now of course it's got bad parts such as MP gameplay limitations or those annoying 12 year old ""gamers"" driving around in a Insurgent or a tank and shooting everything but there is Passive Mode so it should help.

I have over 270 hours in this game and probably 100 of them was spent at a loading screen. And unfortunately you have to deal with it A LOT. What makes it even more annoying is that random players online tend to leave in the middle of a mission FORCING you to go back to freemode (load) and restart the mission (another load). If it wasn't for the unholy load times this game would be damn near perfect.But even with the load times I still would have to recommend this game just for the sheer fun of it.

2015-05-06,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V Reviewwell it's finally here almost 2 long years after it's initial launch GTA 5 is finally on PC. I've played this game on both my Xbox360 and my XboxOne and now i can finally play it on my glorious gaming rig. I will admit that I'm still a little bit salty with rockstar for delaying the PC version of this game for so long but I got to say they did one hell of a job optimizing this game for PC. this game runs great and has more graphic settings then even a lot of PC exclusive games have. the keyboard and mouse controls feel very fine tuned and even driving with them feels decent which is a huge rarity in games. I think it's fair to say that this has to be rockstars best PC launch yet but on the other hand that's to be expected with how many delays this game has had...anyway with that being said let's move on to the game play aspect. GTA V with no question has one of the most diverse open worlds I've ever seen in a videogame this world is HUGE and it feels like a real living city. I've been playing this game for almost two years now and to this day sometimes I still find new places I haven't seen before in the game it's that divers. the gameplay has been refined from GTA 4 and feels a lot more natural and fluent it even has a very well done tacked on FPS mode so you can experience the game in a whole different perspective in a way it makes it feel like an entirely different game. the story is very fun and very compelling and can even be touchy at times and is a reflection of how messed up modern day society can be. there is a ton of side ejectives to do in the single player and playing GTA online with your friends is an absolute blast. this has been said to death but I'll say it again even with all the delays this game has had it is still a masterpiece. I can highly recommend this game to almost anyone. it just goes to show what can happen when developers put actual time and effort into their games and build them to last. all i gotta say Rockstar is way to not f*** it up xDFinal Score (9/10) Incredible 3,Grand Theft Auto V

The game gives the player the freedom to explore an amazingly perfect world but also tells a story full of attraction excitement and black humor. This is a leap in the maturity of the story series and the game mechanism is also more dramatic than the ""Knight Robber 4"" changes. The most immediate change is that the cover system is more reliable and the automatic sighting system is more comfortable. Car controls are also more gripping and no longer feel like driving a car with a butter tyre but exaggerated controls can make players often ugly.

After nearly 100 hours of grinding in the competitive and repetitive online mode I was banned for 30 days and had my account reset despite having never cheated modded nor received money or other incentives from players who were cheating. If you are like me and find yourself in this situation then good luck. As R* does not allow your ban to be appealed and has a terrible customer support network that will provide you with no information as to why exactly your account was banned in the first place. This horrific online experience has convinced me to never touch GTA Online again and I will likely never purchase Red Dead Redemption 2. And you know I'm definitely going to mod the singleplayer now. Overall an amazing singleplayer experience that is ruined by a disgusting and unfair online system that is plagued with cheaters and microtransactions.4/10 Would Not Recommend,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-08,0,0,719,False,Recommended,Fun singleplayer game. Sometimes online is fun too but everything is overpriced and absolutely not worth my real life money. Also I find no interest in any of that nightclub/bunker/clubhouse crap so I wish there was an option to stop all those harassing phonecalls from Ron/Lester/etc. Those calls can be more annoying than the endless supply of 12 year olds using cheats to lock me inside a cage... sometimes.Overall Recommended but only if the price is under 20 bucks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-06,0,0,63,False,Recommended,GTA Theft Auto V is a wonderful game. Although the gameplay is very limiting the true fun comes from the driving. It is recommended to buy this game before taking your driving test as it really helps (Drive in first person for a more accurate driving simulator it is very helpful to get used to the feel of the windshield and the car on the road). You can do all sorts of things in this driving simulator like learn to parallel park or just learn to park in a parking lot. It is always very important to remember right of way and whether or not you have to wait for someone to pass. The game is very realistic but waiting in lines for the red light to turn green has never been more fun!,Grand Theft Auto V

The online mode has its flaws on matchmaking and slow loading but there is an endless amount of content that you will be able to enjoy and have a lot of fun even more with a couple of friends which will help you diminish the bad aspects of the online experience.On top of all that is a great plot with ups and downs thrilling moments full of action and the more powerful your computer the better the graphics more cars and people on the streets.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-07,0,0,178,False,Not Recommended,"The game is both my most favorite and most hated. The game itself is really fun and frustrating to play and the game mechanics such as driving are great.The best ways to make money are heists vehicle warehouse or doomsday. The buy ins (in order) are 200k (plus the varying buy ins for the heists themselves) 1.5 million (at least) or 1.25 million (at least). The heists buy in is 200k since you need a high end appartment to start them and the cheapest being that expensive. The only other way to make actual progress and money you pretty much need to find a hacker or become one. Which there is a plethora of them if you go that route. The anti cheat pretty much doesn't exist unless you have a completely stupid amount of money. But this is a double edged sword. If you find a ""nice hacker "" you will probably drive nice cars that haven't come out yet and get some money. If you are unlucky the hacker will spawn things on you and make the game unplayable. The ""nice hacker"" will more than likely be the one who gets banned. The Shark Cards are options as well... but they are really expensive and will probably be a bad option. It also supports the bad business practice that they have enabled. Although if you can afford them Rockstar has made enough money that even if you speak with your wallets it won't do very much to change. This game has honestly the worst AI I think I have ever encountered in my entire history actually. The NPCs will spawn in the middle of the street within your POV sometimes even on top of you. You will notice a fun game of bumper cars with or without your consent. They will swerve into your lane or into oncoming traffic just to crash into you. There is no reasoning that I've heard of to justify it. The gunplay is the farthest thing from satisfying since enemies will either die in one hit or one million. There is no in between. The controls in order to change your gun or zoom in (not ADS) are the same and if you go even slightly too fast it will just change your weapon instead of zoom.There is a lot of connectivity issues that I have run into. They mostly consist of booting you from servers and putting you by yourself or kicking you from missions. One thing that happened to me and my friends during the Doomsday Scenerio (final Doomsday heist) we would all experience lag spikes in certain areas in the building but not outside even though all of our PCs are above recommended specs. At the very end of the heist my friend messed up and died resetting us to the last checkpoint. Which isn't that big of a deal as the checkpoint was right before the end. But instead of putting us together at the checkpoint my friend got kicked and we were booted from the lobby losing 2 hours of progress and had to restart the entire heist. That's really just one example of the connection issues.The ONLY redeemable factor for me is the vehicles and their customization. This is why I actually play the game. I love driving the cars and customizing them. The planes and helicopters are cool too. The people at Rockstar are pretty creative when it comes to vehicles. The Oppressor Mk1 and Mk2 come to mind. The games most fun part has to be customizing vehicles with your friends and compete to see who has the coolest and fastest car. The missions for the vehicle warehouse are really fun and selling lets you customize cars for free and drive them afterwards. In conclusion I don't know why I still play this. The more I play the more I realize all of the flaws this ""definitive"" edition has and it makes me lose more and more respect for Rockstar and Take Two. I honestly don't think I will support them anymore. I feel like the $262 000 000 dollar budget was put entirely into ""how to make the player pay more money and how can we make sure he/she hates themself for starting this.""

It's online feature is horrible though.I think the story is the best part about this game. It introduces you to 3 characters and you go through their lives. Simple. It has it's good and bad moments but it's what I bought the game for since I like story games.However it pushes you to play it's online mode. In that you need to pay even more money just to have some fun. Even after spending $60 dollars (or $30 if sale) to have a good time on online will cost you another 50 or maybe 100. It takes a while to work your way up and just doesn't appeal to me.I'd give GTA V's Story a 7/10I'd give GTA V's Online a 3/10Overall for the entire game a 5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece and Rockstar's best game to date. If you've played the past entries in the series then it is the same usual mechanics finely tuned and improved. Los Santos is a large sprawling open world with countless things to see and experience. Even under those crashing waves are sights to behold. One new mechanic has been thrown into the mix three playable characters that you can (most of the time) switch between on the fly at any point you want. The story spans all three of these characters and is some of the best writing in the series to date. Simply put play this game you will not be disappointed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-08,0,0,189,False,Recommended,"Sigh... Oh man. So I've played GTA V for a pretty okay amount of time and don't get me wrong I love the game. I love playing the game. Specifically I love GTA Online but I certainly don't mind the plot. There's just a few things wrong with the actual gameplay like the really long loadtimes and broken dialogue every once in awhile. But that's not enough to not play it. It's still worth it's pricex in that regard.But... to put it simply everyone who plays GTA V is in an abusive relationship with Take Two. The reason I don't say Rockstar is because Rockstar's developers had nothing to do with the horrid updates of the game. But Take Two is just... awful. Every update has so many features that NONE OF US WANTED and maybe two or three bugfixes out of the hundreds that need to be done. Every new ""event"" is chalk full of totally overpowered items just to get people to use their in game money so they have to buy more with real money. Imagine GTA V as a dead corpsified horse and it's players as vultures. The developers keep smashing in the corpse (beating a dead horse you could say) trying to expose more gross bloody meat for the ever hungry players. The only problem is that the horse has no meat left. BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP TAKE TWO! You can almost hear the lead developer yelling ""GRIND THE BONES INTO PROTEIN POWDER POP THE EYES LIKE GRAPES MAKE THE SKIN INTO FRUIT LEATHER BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE MEN DO SOMETHING WE'RE OUT OF IDEAS."" Meanwhile of course they're caring 0% about the players at all just greedy for their money. Remember when there was a bug that banned anyone who joined an Online game? Remember how the developers denied it's existence and gave the task to redditors to warn each other of it's deadly effects?The point being GTA V is a good game. It really is.

And after that I don't care about the single player ither because the online version is so bloody brilliant. It's the best balanced combination of driving shooting action and great team play in any game I have ever encountered. You can play it as a typical team shooter with just your friends by doing instanced missions either co op or PvP or you can free roam around the huge map in a variety of vehicles (almost 500 to choose from) and run a full criminal business or jack cargo from other people's businesses for fun and profit )Despite being several years old it's still getting frequent updates and the servers are pretty lively.

2015-06-07,0,0,192,False,Recommended,This is easily the best Grand Theft Auto game yet. It improves over its predecessors in virtually every category but perhaps the greatest new feature of GTAV is its online multiplayer mode You can share the city with a large number of players and either engage in a variety of cooperative or versus missions or you can roam the city causing mayhem to your heart's content. The online mode does suffer from the occasional but obvious hackers with invulnerability no clipping through the sky or even destroying all vehicles (including the one you're driving) within an area at the push of a button. Arguably the best feature in online mode is the cooperative heists which typically consist of 4 5 smaller missions leading up to a big finale and an equally large payout for successful completion. Finally the large variety of missions available keep the online gameplay new and exciting for quite some time which easily makes this game one with a abundance of replayability.The single player mode also improves across virtually all aspects of the game. The storyline is exciting hilarious and often unpredictable while effortlessly allowing the player to cycle through up to three separate main characters each with unique perspectives and storylines all in the same city. The graphics are breathtaking and the game's optimization is enough to ensure even an $800 bargain computer can handle it on maximum or near maximum settings. The music is reminiscent of earlier GTA games but with more options and some hilarious talk show stations to keep you entertained. Vehicle customizations are vast and many online vehicle enhancements are unlocked with successful completion of multiplayer missions. The variety of vehicles you can control are enormous from luxurious super cars to giant dump trucks to military tank and jet fighters you'll have plenty to save your hard earned cash to purchase.As you've no doubt predicted by now I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed any of the previous GTA games or to anyone seeking an open world mayhem video game with a criminal theme. I'd be remiss if I gave it anything less than a 9.5/10. It loses 0.5 merely due to having so many hackers in online mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-06,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,IF in regards to the GTA ONLINE Feature DONT BUY THIS GAME!!! It is a pay to advance mode and the final heist that offers a 1 million dollar reward is total crap. If anyone dies or anyone carrying the money gets shot you lose money and when you respawn you respawn with even less money than what you had. If you want to play the next GTA then go ahead and play GTA V but if you think GTA Online looks good it ISNT. The fact that paying more REAL MONEY into the game in order to advance and get cool stuff is comparable to when you have to pay money into Clash of Clans or Candycrush in order to advance. Yes it is possible to save up enough money to buy something really cool in game like the VTOL jet but you have to play the heists over and over and over again. And there are problems with these heists in terms of waiting in lobbies for other players to join and then having them leave the heist when you're literally ten seconds away from it being completed. This has happened to me in not only the heist finales but also the heist setup missions many times. A lot of things in the online mode feel like they need some more work in order to be almost enjoyable at least make it more of an enjoyable experience by fixing the leaving players in the middle or at the end of a heist. Or just do away with the whole buy fake money with real money concept.

Not everyone wants to be an ignorant gangster or drug dealer or some trash like that it would be nice to play a police officer in the game too. Can play a very nice and advanced Golf game. Can play tennis. This game is best played with friends with a similar taste in games. Very big open world to explore. Killing people is absolutely unnecessary but the game characters taunt you like mad and eventually you get desensitized to the violence. There's too many menus and menus within those menus. Best played with a controller in many situations. You can't play online until you beat their intro which can be difficult. I didn't enjoy this game at first but once I got use to the controls and I had friends explain how to navigate through things I changed my outlook on this game and I really enjoy it. I turned off my microphone so I can't hear strange human players taunt me (they can be ignorant). I use a 3rd party program like mumble or skype to chat with my friends within the game so we can communicate and effectively beat difficult missions. Overall I give this game a 7/10 5 being average. Still there's a lot of possibilities in this game waiting to be explored.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-02,0,0,118,False,Recommended,My opinion of GTA V is a bit mixed. The game is worth it alone for the single player campaign but GTA Online can be a bit iffy. GTAO has some issues large amounts of hackers long loading times and clunky loading screens and GTAO freeroam is P2W in it's entierty. Oh you didn't spend $100.00 to be able to afford a flying motorcycle that shoots missles too bad enjoy getting blown up at every encounter with another player. What GTAO does good however is providing a platform for fun minigames in the form of FPS games racing and community made games. That along with the online heist missions makes GTAO barrable. The devs of GTA V said there was going to be more single player DLC but that was dropped because Online was a massive cash cow for Rockstar. The single player is great. Switch between 3 characters mid mission to perform different tasks great wacky cops as per usualIn the end and wonderful driving and shooting. This game leaves me feeling bittersweet but I would say the game is worth it for the single player experience alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-13,0,0,49,False,Recommended,"It's been out for over a year so a review this late is mostly semantic but An incredible adventure that manages to bring a bit of life and joy back to the GTA series that GTA4 took out without necessarily being as good as it's forebearer San Andreas GTA5 is worth your time and your money though a somewhat anemic third act will leave people confused and unsatisifed at the absolute end.If you've played a GTA game before you know what to expect. The only real additions are the Heist and Three Character swap system. The Heists are a bigger deal in Multiplayer and it gives the sense that content was cut as there is an entire RPG leveling system for your crew members and not nearly enough heists to actually do anything with them. The Three Characters while expanding the narrative possibility in the game also strech the story so thin it loses flavor near the end. Franklin is missing an entire act of character development while Trevor and Michael have their climax during the top of Act 2 and then stop developing until endgame. A last minute decision to kill either Trevor Michael or get the actually good ending of the game reeks that a design decision was thrown out at the last minute. Perhaps Franklin was supposed to learn more about his mentors and come to a decision himself rather than be forced into it by the Assholiest s who ever Arsed a Hole even by GTA standards. But aside from some final act woes GTA V has found a measure of spirit that GTA IV threw out in a desperate misguided bid to become the Sopranos. GTA V isn't afraid to laugh at it's audience it's tropes or itself. There's a running almost desperately forced theme about Cliches avoiding or embracing them. From the moment Gang Banger Lamar briefly gives an overview of how every first five missions in a GTA game go to Michael bemoaning that he'd become a sitcom father even to the ingame anime spoof being predominantly about the dangers and virtues of playing it safe it's hard not to see a shot at meaning that GTA IV couldn't manage with all it's grey rainy cousin murdering muddiness. It doesn't quite get there (the thin and bland last missions have nothing to say on the theme regaurdless of who you decide to gun down) but the attempt is heartfelt.A stronger final act would have gone a long way to making this a nearly artistic work ""Heartfelt"" is the best way to summarize GTA V this is a game that someone wanted to make and be a part of and every performance and line and mission has an undeniable energy and excitement to it.

You will have tons of checkpoints while doing missions so if you ever die or fail the mission it will keep pushing you through so you can finish the mission. There is no challenge or whatsoever in this game.Months have passed but they still didn't implement a single player car insurance system even for the cars that are bought through internet with your earned game money. What I mean is that you can only have your default cars forever but if you blow up a sports car that you like or leave it somewhere else other than your garages it will be gone forever.Online mode could be fun but it's full of cheaters running around in godlike mode killing you instantly but you can't kill them.

If you want to play this game just to make private lobbies with your buddies and single player of course go right ahead. But for public lobbies I cannot say the same. GTA Online as devolved into a goddamn warzone of cheaters. I've owned this game and have been playing ever since release on PC so I can say with confidence that cheating was never this bad. Was it a problem? Of course it was. But never was it so common that I just down right do not have any interest in playing anymore.For example I played for about 2 hours today and had to join 3 different lobbies becuase there were cheaters ruining the game. Kicking me out of my vehicle appearing and disappearing on the minimap and then finally making my game ing crash just becuase I talked to him in the chat. It is this amount of power and control in this game that nothing feels worth it I have such little power compared to the losers who cheat. At this point I'm not sure I ever want to pick up the game again. The community is such a cancer in this game they're actually doing exaclty what the disease does best.So absolutely amazed that Rockstar has done nothing about the issue.

2017-02-06,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,Well here is my second review of this game I say in advance that the review will go to the multiplayer part in order to buy it mainly because of this and the plot is good I like it.So let's start with a brief prehistory it consists in the fact that I twice caught (at least at that time working) the anti chit system and my review was negative will it be different? No now I'll explain why.I want to say that from this game (multiplayer) mixed feelings on the one hand interesting for the first time two missions and robberies with the players on the other toxic players and farm a lot of farm VERY MUCH FARM. Beginners at the moment can only get a rocket in the face and they will not be able to do anything equipment is expensive and cars ah I think that even a thief Putin would have enough money for life as long as normal transport costs. Antichit has stopped working (I'm not saying that you go download cheats no) just in every third lobby you will meet a person who will ask about the reader because no one wants to farm in this game and the cheaters are already really not afraid of the ban like the players .In general what will I say? If you have friends and better friends with private cheats buy but if you want one sitting for 41 minutes in an empty lobby waiting for another person to join your robbery at your own peril the developers always add something but the game dies you need more and more farming and I understand the toxic players they just have nothing to do in this game.In general Rockstar receives from me a kick in the and the game if you do not take into account the plot gets 4/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-24,0,0,19,False,Recommended,This installation of the Grand Theft Auto series hit a new high with this release of GTAV. Originally released in PS3 and Xbox 360 the PC port is a similar release to what came out for the PS4 and Xbox One. Differences with the PC version of GTAV is that it has a first person view a modding community (no Steam workshop) and a vast amount of players in its multiplayer (top 3 via steamcharts.com). What might put people off are mods can be used for single player however cannot be brought to multiplayer. I do not think it is a big deal as multiplayer is still fun nonetheless. I wish community driven modes can be brought to multiplayer for new experiences rather than what's given with the game. Other than that the single player mode is still the same as before. Nothing new has changed since the PS3 and 360 versions. Graphics in this version are beautiful on a i5 4690k and a GTX 970. I can nearly max out settings with 60 FPS and I feel much more immersive in this game as a result. If you are on the fence about picking this game up because of price point and previous played it I would still recommend picking this up. Multiplayer is just a new experience with this game and much better with friends. Even without friends the game is still fun because of so much you can do in the map. Also heists are tons of fun and so much replayability.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-24,0,0,848,False,Recommended,At its core Grand Theft Auto V on PC is the same game that it is on other platforms and while it s never looked as good as it does on a strong PC anyone who s played GTA V elsewhere may not benefit from buying it for a second or third time unless they re desperate for better graphics. If you fall into that camp you can easily transfer your progress over to the PC version via the Rockstar Social Club to continue where you left off diving headlong into the revamped Los Santos with minimal fuss.It looked great on PS4 and Xbox One but GTA V shines on PC thanks to 4K grade textures the availability of additional post processing effects and an unlocked frame rate. Previous versions of the game played just fine at 30 frames per second but you quickly appreciate the added fluidity of playing at 60 FPS (if not more) on PC. If you can give it enough juice (read afford top end gaming hardware) then you can marvel at the added flourishes in 4K even but even three Nvidia GTX 980's in SLI couldn't push the highest settings at 4K without dipping to around 30 frames per second. Whether in 4K or at 1080p the new high res textures pop with detail and new lighting effects lead to plenty of awe inspiring moments. GTA V can paint stunning pictures with the right mix of scenery subject and daylight that highlight the natural beauty of its geography and the grime that pulses through its concrete veins. GTA V has always looked good but a great gaming PC is the only way to witness the full extent of Rockstar s admirable handiwork.Keep in mind that GTA V retains evidence of its last gen roots even on PC with simple geometry abound. You notice low poly models on occasion as they contrast with the great texture work and lighting on hand as simplicity and complexity mix before your eyes. GTA V is impressive at times but you never forget that you re playing a game that s foundation was built with outdated constraints in mind.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's insanely fun with friends and there are hundreds of missions and activities to take part in. The stunt races are mad and the heists are just awesome.Sure there are problems. The loading screens take so long I could read a book quicker and the game is a hackers haven at this point and Rockstar really need to get off their arses and sort it out.

The acting is top notch with loads of laugh out loud moments. I'm over 30 hours into the game but it feels like less than 10.I've had a few crashes soon after launch (resource not found) wich was very annoying but they have become much less frequent of late with none this week (touch wood) which I think was related more to Rockstar's social club and online components rather than code on my computer. It certanly feels more stable now without any patch update I've noticed.Get this game. Its very good (and I didn't like GTA 4 at all but loved GTA 3 and Vice City).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-20,0,0,395,False,Not Recommended,The game is horribly slow moving. Solo mode require a LOT of driving and by that I mean that over half of the gameplay is driving/flying around to the next objective. The actual missions themselves are still rather slow even the shooting as the fun action is short lived and then it goes back to the very tedious driving or boring parts of the game. As far as mutiplayer goes it isn't much better. Unless you have a group of freinds to play with or don't mind playing with people who don't much know what they're doing you'll be doing missions solo. These missions are not very numerous short rather boring and have an unsuprisingly huge amount of driving. the races meanwhile are worse. no one is ever doing races. Friends or solo. And then there's the fact that the most they pay is 11K and MAYBE enough RP that after 2 20 missions you can level up. In other words you will NEVER make enough money to buy and upgrade the good cars and money that is if you can even unlock them. After doing all 5 heists my friend managed to make about 2m dollars including the double money first time bonus the 1m loyalty bonus and having only bought guns and ammo to do the missions. that's enough money to buy a good apartment a couple good cars and that's it. So there you go playing all 5 heists with the same people MIGHT get you enough to get some of the stuff you want. Now to the only truly good part of the game mods. The mods such as superpowers shooting cars shooting money explosive bullets anti/moon gravity were the only parts of the game that I ACTUALLY enjoyed myself. and now you can't do any of those. Rockstar has made it impossible to use mods and if you find a way they are either instant of banning you or take over a month to do so. overall this game is not worth $60. I would not have bought it if I had known any of this previously.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-11,0,0,40,False,Recommended,I will be only reviewing the single player portion of the gameSo i've just beaten the game around the 35 hour mark and i gotta say this is such an amazing game! Everything about it is just ing outstanding the voice acting the script the location the characters Rockstar knows how to not disappoint their fan base. The plot of the game is just great and how they used three characters to unveil the story was REALLY well done. Michael Franklin and Trevor have unique characteristics making them super unique and helpful throughout the game. Each one of them come from distinct places of San Andreas giving the player the feel that they are exploring at least a good portion of San Andreas. Their backgrounds are also pretty distinct Micheal is doing pretty good living at this huge house in Rockford Hills Franklin is trying to make some money and have a better life while Trevor... well Trevor is taking care of ''Trevor Philips Industries'' in the desert area of Los Santos. The way those three end up together is funny as hell and extremely well done and by the end of the game you will love the three of them. By the time I beated the game I got sad that they wouldn't ''meet'' anymore at least not in story missions.The city of Los Santos is just gourgeous the graphics are amazing theres absolutely nothing to complaing about it you can even go to Groove Street (important area of GTA SA). There would be times during a mission that i ended up dying because i would look at the great views the game just throws at you. I've played the previous GTA titles before and after beating those games I would end up playing them again only after a while. In this one I feel like exploring the entire world searching easter eggs doing the extra missions and etc. Maybe the reason is that the city feels so ''alive''. GTA IV felt like you were in a living city well GTA V makes that even better. Also I don't think I've run through many glitches maybe twice and that's considering the fact that it's the largest map in GTA historyThe gameplay is pretty standard and straight foward a third person shooter where you take cover with any object you find. Lets just say it works pretty well there are no moments where you feel like you had a unfair death and obviously it's FUN. Just don't expect anything out of the ordinary. If you have played TPS/previous GTA titles before you will feel right at home.The downside is how heavy this game is on PC. Some people are having the hardest time running this at the highest settings even though they might have high end PC's. Oh and its around 65 GB. Yeah you read that right SIXTY ING FIVE so make sure you have enough space for it and a good internet connection because this is taking a while. Also the loading times when you boot the game are really REALLY long but besides that the game works pretty well.If you plan on picking this up specially for the SP portion of the game GO BUY IT. I will guarantee that you won't regret it!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-29,0,0,275,False,Recommended,GTA V Story Mode The story mode is long exciting and fun and it can give you a lot of funny moments.Been playing this constantly and is never tired of it.There is so much to do here some examples is to play golf darts or tennis.This is great for players that love to do sports in real life or those who are interested in sports.When playing for a while doing random activities that comes up I must say they really put effort in this game for us.GTA Online This is just like the story mode but much better.You can for example play with friends and play heists or missions that can help you rank up and earn money to purchase an apartment or cars.All activities works here as well so you can play together with friends or just random strangers from an online lobby.There is so much to do in GTA Online that I can't describe all of them but if you are interested in a fun multiplayer game to play with friends then GTA V is certainly the choice for you.No matter how long you play for you can still have fun playing.I rate this game an 9/10 for the reason that it is very fun playing with friends and just hang out.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-29,0,0,122,False,Recommended,I'm thoroughly impressed at how well they ported the game to PC. Much better than GTA IV. I like how the heists are handled but online sometimes feels not at its optimal because of connection problems. Luckily I haven't experienced any launching problems or errors. The other downside is that I am basically at the recommended system requirement however I still experience stuttering and loading issues online. Playing singleplayer on the other hand gives me little or no lag whatsoever. Therefore I recommend to be above the requirements to have a good experience. Minimum requirements will not even be close enough and will cause annoyances. Last thing to note is that the only long waits I have is when launching the game (about 5 minutes) but loading any other time in game isn't that long.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Interactive and RockStar Games need to realize that even though they created the game it doesn't mean that people that buy it have to play it the way they want them to. GTA 4 was a good game but only went so far. Modding the game made its life expectancy much longer. LCPDFR is a big reason why people were still buying the game up to the point and even after GTA 5 was released. Then RockStar says if you want to mod the game that's fine. If you can't do it online. I understand that because of the currency aspect to the game. If you nod you get banned simple as that. OK fine.Now we have people working on their own servers to host online gameplay of GTA 5. Take Two and RockStar are. It loosing money from that but they get upset and send out letters and the project ends.....but then it continues months later and is great.Now that they see they can't stop them they go after OpenIV that allows you to easily mod the game as far as textures skins models and so on.All I have to say is that when GTA 6 is released and they see that it doesn't sell as many copies and doesn't continue to sell copies after the hype dies down maybe then they will realize the positive impact modding has on their sells and income produce by their games.They want to be anti modding then that's fine but say goodbye to the money you guys make after your game falls flat and gets boring.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,Notice my playtime? Guess what? That's all the time I spent modding GTA V and all the time I spent playing LSPDFR. LSPDFR has been the heart of GTA mods since San Andreas released. But this isn't just about LSPDFR although I'm unimaginably furious. This is about modding in general. This is about a passionate community bringing people together with brilliant ideas and new innovative ways to play. I've been part of this community for many many years. At this juncture we dedicate our lives to improving the singleplayer aspect of a game that Rockstar's abandoned due to GTA Online. GTA Online has become Rockstars million dollar baby and they have done all they can to preserve their new cash cow. GTA isn't even about singleplayer anymore. It's no longer about ridiculous DLCs. They've abandoned their roots and I wouldn't be surprised if the next GTA isn't even singleplayer anymore.PC gamers have gotten the end of the stick for too long. Everything is destroyed now. Laid to waste. Thousands upon thousands of modders completely silenced. And all that's left now is the new face of Grand Theft Auto GTA Online.Don't let TakeTwo get away with this. There is NO underestimating how devastating this is to the community. https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv/w?comment_id 647872598&amp utm_medium email&amp utm_source notification&amp utm_campaign comment_like&amp sfmc_tk jMsiUrtajNgxVJa7BmzmX6qmRagjv5skIMqvqeFxtTXWVjrCZpfKgcvyW7wVlofy,Grand Theft Auto V

A street gangster franklin who wants out of that life to make something of him self. And finally a socialpathic meth dealer trevor phillps. While they are very different crimmanals they all share the same thing the need of money in a city full of crime LOS SANTOS the same city from gta san andreas which takes place in 1992 but LOS SANTOS this time takes place in 2013 the city has got a lot worse from when we last saw it in gta san andreas. But when los santos a city full of greed and crime anyone will do anything they can to survive not live survive so michael franklin and trevor all take advange of this and do three daring but profiable heists. so i can recommend someone else this game if you like the violent game thing it is survival of the fitest,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-30,0,0,330,False,Not Recommended,"Very boring game both single and on line just empty game. I'm very disapointed after all the hype. Not worth of full price. The characters are not exciting except Trevor. If graphics is the most important factor to you in games and you love excess shooting with poor aim then buy it.The missions are mostly the same shoot shoot shoot shoot fight against over helming mount of enemies. (For example the mission ""Blitz Play #2"" why they stay and wait for the cops and Swat to arrive why just run away to getaway car and have good car chase action). GTA V from the main missions point of view is a plain shooter game. Nothing intelligent in the missions no stealth action. The other thing which bothers me is why in Heist missions in which you need to collect gear for the Heist has some timed sub missions what's the point of rush (complete in few minutes)? Player should have the freedom spent all the time in the world if he wants to the Heist itself is a different thing. There is also something wrong with aiming and that's frustrating with most missions including plenty of shooting. Haven't found satisfactory settings for the mouse tried every possibility aiming still poor although your shooting skill is 100 %. I have wondered why enemies who don't have bullet proof vest need to be shot several times before they die even from close range doesn't feel right. Also the car damaging physics is strange.Flying a heli is frustrating (also with 100 % flying skill) luckily driving and flying planes works fine. Graphics are nice and the game runs nicely and smoothly. Just Cause 2 has much more reasonable touch for flying.I don't understand why there are statistics for every missions they don't tell you beforehand how many headshots or something else should be achieved during the missions no point at all. Most of the mission are so dull that you don't want to play them again. Why isn't it enough to complete all possible mission and find collectibles for 100 %? There is not anymore fast food restautrants you can go and eat. There is golf and yoga and many more activities which actually doesn't bring anything extra to the game for example there are many good golf games out there if you like to play golf. I haven't found a way how to abort ongoing mission (execpt exit hte game) is there any if not that's stupid.As a summary there is nothing new in the game overhyped. Too many missions from which you don't gain nothing just do the dirty work without any payment. The property income is extremely low in some cases for example from a restaurant you gain only 920 $ a week what's the point to spend excess amount money to buy that no logic at all (poor business). The storyline is also poor and lame.I prefer GTA IV much more than the V never had any problems with running the IV. Also San Andreas is my favorite (maybe the best GTA). GTA V is probably the worst one in GTA series (played all of them).If you like real open world games play Witcher 3. Remember manage your rig well since high end parts alone doesn't quarantee smooth gaming there is always unnecessary s**t running on background if you have Windows.",Grand Theft Auto V

Do not support this disgusting money grubby company 2k (and by extension Rockstar) who see customers as ""whales"" (seriously look it up). They are con merchants who don't give a about customers or the way they choose to experience games.I've put up with the shady this game has pulled over the years on Steam such as still charging 60 dollars for an almost 5 year old game (not our fault you took forever to port it lads) or when the game was ""on sale"" on steam but the only thing on sale was the game plus one of the disgusting shark card microtransactions and the base game was removed from the store page meaning you had to buy that to buy the game.. at no real discount AND it was hot off the heels of Steam refunds coming out and by using the microtranscation item you'd be unable to refund the thing afterwards as well. Oh not to mention the rampant hackers on the online service that they refuse to lift a god damn finger to try and fix. (No your t about OpenIV enabling online hackers is a flat out LIE.)I've put up with it all because the singleplayer was excellent and it was only strengthened by modders that much is undeniable. You know for a fact modders make your games BETTER EXPERIENCES and they add more longevity than trying to force people to play your multiplayer version of the game just for new features all while salivating at the idea of getting a new ""whale"" hooked on your product (THAT THEY ALREADY PAID FOR). off 2k and Rockstar A LOT of people bought your game on Steam just to mod it.

2015-07-02,0,0,468,False,Not Recommended,EDIT As Rockstar Games under direction from its publisher Take Two Interactive have proven themselves to be litigious reactionary and paranoid regarding user modification for Grand Theft Auto V IV and EFLC shutting down multiple user made modifications used for legal multiplayer purposes (and illicit purposes from a small minority of online cheaters) abrupt cancellation of multiplayer BAWSAQ stock trading and single player DLC of GTA V after Shark Cards launched retroactively revoking content from soundtracks of GTA San Andreas and Vice City constituting almost 20% of the total music selection without prior notice and other unsavory profit motivated behavior up to and including the glaring omission of the Red Dead franchise from PCs for no apparent reason I'm changing my recommendation to a negative one. The next genre defining installment in the Grand Theft Auto franchise Grand Theft Auto V straddles the line between familiarity towards the 3D and HD generations of the franchise and throws in some brand new mechanics for good measure.Launch/Performance Yes this is a category now I guess. Welcome to modern gaming. The game was delayed for months after the launch of the console next gen version itself over a year after the original game's launch on seventh generation consoles (Xbox 360 and PS3). The PC version as opposed to the state of GTA IV both on launch and throughout its lifespan is waaaaaaay better optimized. On launch day the online servers were running pretty much as well as they are now with the exception of a couple of lost connections to servers for scorekeeping and maybe one CTD (crash to desktop). That said two game breaking launch bugs on specific missions in Story Mode forced me to creatively use checkpoints/mission skipping to get through the campaign. I'm sure this must be fixed by now though.I was somehow able to get the game running at medium high settings at 1080p with an i7 3770K 16GB RAM and Nvidia GTX 660 Ti Power Edition from MSI at 40fps originally. Then tweaking the game towards more medium settings I was able to get it running steadily over 60fps. Nowadays probably since a title update the game runs way lower for me around 30 40ish fps on medium/medium low settings when slightly overclocked. There's an occasional framerate spike every 20 minutes or so where it straight up hits 60 fps for about 5 seconds and then drops down to normal so I know it can run better but it's a mystery as to what's going on.Although this may be due to a number of reasons which include my PC build reaching the two year mark where my Windows 7 installation and secondary hard drive are both kind of cluttered. I'm sure Rockstar probably also is optimizing a patch or two after title updates of which one just came out so the entire experience is somewhat fluid at the moment. It's very smooth overall and the stability of the game for me is on par with late lifespan GTA IV with a higher graphical fidelity and way less stutter.Story Avoiding spoilers I enjoyed it although I'm confused as to whether I thought it was too short compared to that of previous entries or if I'm not used to the game's pacing. It went quickly which may be a good sign of how much I enjoyed it. It's not without flaws the usual Rockstar brand of satire's here which some people love some people hate. With the increased fidelity given to the world though it reaches further extremes than I thought possible and I'm not entirely sure it feels exactly like every previous GTA game. This could be for good or bad reasons. The characters were less likeable than previous ones I believe again due to the approaching Uncanny Valley of the satire R*'s been going for for the past almost twenty years. Overall the game was more light hearted than GTA IV but more cynical and not as madcap as in San Andreas and earlier so it's a bit of an outlier.Graphics Well... many have considered this the swan song of the seventh console generation and they might be right. The graphical fidelity in GTA V set new heights not only for the franchise but for arguably all open world games before it. There are games out there which beat this one in terms of absolute #graffix but Rockstar's attention to detail in re creating Los Santos is readily apparent at any resolution with any graphics settings and it absolutely helps keep the game which is otherwise somewhat repetitive from moment to moment as someone who's played almost every game in the franchise as fresh as possible. Plus there's actually some color in this one at launch.Map design this fits in with the last criterion but overall the map is massive in both detail and sheer size. On top of this Rockstar seemed to pull almost every side mission activity or variant of same they've ever done and cram it into the map as one kind of facility or other. The main jarring omissions are Pay &amp Sprays car washes restaurants with interiors and casinos. Pay &amp Sprays have been replaced with LS Customs repair/customization garages strewn across the map and the latter three are physically in game just not implemented as something you can interact with. I believe overall new LS' map size was officially considered to be roughly equivalent to that of GTA IV RDR and San Andreas combined with some square footage to spare.Multiplayer As enjoyable as GTA IV's multiplayer modes could be they were vestigial at best I suspect tacked onto the story mode at a time when Microsoft was really pushing for everything to be on Xbox Live. (Could be wrong on the motivation there.) As a result only three missions were available for players to get involved with and this never changed throughout the game's lifespan. Hey it could've been worse in San Andreas the only thing resembling multiplayer was a two player recreation of the classic Rampage Mode and free roam.In V well... Rockstar must have been paying attention to the massive upswing of multiplayer's popularity since 2008 since they effectively made a stand alone title out of the online mode this time around. Your custom character basically flies into Los Santos in a stylish prologue reminiscent of both San Andreas and Vice City Stories' introductions and are herded together with a whole slew of other like minded criminal tourists like yourself into a crash course introduction to what is essentially freemode with a campaign and side missions attached to it. It works surprisingly well considering what it is and Rockstar has regularly added dozens of vehicles outfits and firearms to Online's and the base game's lineup of collectible stuff in the end.It's not perfect by any means just like in IV V's multiplayer is riddled with hacking idiots and general online shooter chaos and outside of mission grinding and the occasionally successful heist Rockstar effectively locked the most substantial content i.e. properties expensive vehicles etc. behind microtransactions. You technically can go through Online without spending more than the 60 dollars the entire game cost on launch but expect to spend a ton of time making money to do the majority of what there is to do in the game.Again doing this isn't all that terrible either. Online's missions on launch were somewhat limited but a content editor machinima mode and the quality of the world's design itself give plenty of opportunities for players to either have fun grinding missions for cash or to just goof off either by themselves or with anyone else on a server of which there can be a couple dozen people more or less.Overall I think GTA V's got plenty of room for expansion (with campaign AND online mode DLC) but it's been a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I'd be quite prepared to say it's got greater replay value than GTA IV and perhaps some of the 3D era games as well. It's worth the price if you can spare the sheer amount of time necessary to max it out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-05,0,0,885,False,Not Recommended,While i would love to recommend this game i simply cannot for this review i am ignoring the obvious problems of Hackers/ Modders and such but its more to do with the direction that rockstar have taken the game. While the game in the early days was fantastic it has changed over the years. What was the major change that has changed the game for the worse ? Homing Rockts ...... Nowerdays in online mode sports cars and such have no place any more. Everyone is driving around in heavely armoured trucks planes and hover cars. These all have spammable lock on missiles which means it takes very little to no skill what so ever to kill people who are running Product/ Supplies with little chance of retaliation due to how easy it is to blow up said transports.Ultimatly Rockstar added to much easy to use fire power. For instance one of the most common runs are bunker runs. Most of the sale's missions for the bunkers involve trucks that only take a few rockets to destroy only one of the missions gives you a truck capable of dealing with Air Targets (which around 50% of vehicals on warstock are). This makes it increadably fustrating to do such things unless there are 3 or 4 of you working together. How ever when doing such things the amount of money you gain as an associate is pitifull and makes it not worth your while...Ultimatly rockstar have made the game to easy for trolls and almost impossible for grinders... all things considered its like ther hoping you get fed up of getting rekt trying to make money and just buy the shark cards to get the items instead.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game isn't fun when it's LOADING which is like 70% of your experience while playing this. The game isn't fun when you keep getting disconnected from servers or dropped while loading a mission. The game isn't fun when you have to deal with hackers OR russians who refuse to co operate and decide to ruin your game or the terrible matchmaking system over all. The single player is great lots of content over all. The game itself is pretty good but ROCKSTAR won't do anything to fix the issues everybody is complaining about like ridiculous loading times and hackers plus they pulled a seriously stupid move when they did their 'steam sale' scam thinking the Steam community are a bunch of dumbasses they can rick roll.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-21,0,0,79,False,Recommended,GTA V REVIEW FOR PC FROM A LONG TIME GTA FAN I am a huge GTA fan. I have played all the gta games and almost every game by rockstar. This review isn't so much about gta as it is about the pc port. GTA as a game is already great and there are already enough review out there (for you to know its one of the best games ever) this review is about my experience as a returning player on pc. I pre orderd this for PC inspite of already have played the game on xbox 360. For those of you wondering weather to re buy or not let me tell you...its totally worth it! It is definitly worth buying a second time (from ps3. xbox360) but I'm not sure if it would be worth it had you already had it on ps4/xbone. The PC version is a huge graphical upgrade and a game like GTA online is meant to be played on pc with free aim and better community. Not to mention r* editor first person mode and when you replay the story it's twice as fun because you catch all the small details you missed before. Overall I really found my second playthrough of the story to be more fun and better. Also pc version has MODS!In terms of performance this game is great. To max out at 60fps you need a insane system but my $1 300 system from 2.5 years ago is actually making this run pretty well. I have 24gb ram Amd 8 core at like 4.2 and a 7970. I get about 60 fps walking around. and anywhere from 35 60 fps while driving. In shootouts i get around 40 fps. This is all on meduim to max settings which makes the game look pretty good (definitly far far far better than xobx 360/ps3). At times the game does look a little visually bugged when not on all max settings (jaggies flickering shawdows a little pop in for shadows) but most of the time the game looks great even when on medium max. Plus I experienced almost no lag even in the biggest of explosions not even for a second. Buy this game!ps. the pc version even on really good settings looks pretty similar to the ps4/xbone version. The major difference of course is the unlocked frame rate which is HUGE,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,89,False,Recommended,When I first started this game I was so amazed by the scope and variety that I praised this masterpiece as the ultimate game to be ever created. Now that I finished the single player campaign while I still do see GTA V as an awesome game I also have some complaints which make this game no longer flawless and perfect.To those unfamiliar with GTA these are some of the things you can do in this game * Walk run stealth swim dive parachute* Bikes cars boats yachts planes helicopters* Fight hand to hand or with bats/knives* Pistols shotguns machine guns rifles minigun RPGs grenades bombs* Exercise to raise strength/health/shooting skill/driving skill* Play tennis golf and darts* Cop chase* Direct shoot and share videos* Lengthy single player campaign* Massive online campaign* Collectibles* In short anythingAnd here are some of the improvements over GTA IV * 3 playable characters instead of 1* Improved HUD that takes less space and shows more info* Ability to switch to first person viewpoint anytime* Ability to use the Internet or save your game with your in game phone* Ability to replay previous missions and challenge extra mission objectives* Ability to retry mission from checkpoint after failure or death* Ability to regenerate health when stationary* Ability to see where EACH police car is looking at during cop chase* Supernatural powerMy complaints with this game are mostly about shooting. One the reticle is too small just a small dot in the center of screen. For I cannot count how many times I got in a gunfight and could only shoot randomly because I couldn't find the reticle. This is adding unnecessary difficulty to shooting.Two the game is too easy in general. Because you can regenerate health in most dangerous situations you can just hide and regenerate to avoid death and then very few missions can stop you at all. For me only the very final missions felt a little challenging and I've always been not so good at shooting.Three I heard Rockstar prohibited any modding to this game. I'm not a modder nor do I play any mod so this doesn't really affect me but their attitude does seem wrong to me.In conclusion this is a very good game but sadly not so perfect.+ do anything in this ultimate sandbox+ 2 games at the price of 1+ various improvements over GTA IV unchallenging difficulty story wrapped up too abruptly all the problems just solved themselves all at once modding prohibited9 out of 10 marvelous.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V not only is more fluid in its storyline it is also fluid in its controls and is well optimized performance wise for PC. Still enjoyable on a lower performance computer but breath takingly awesome on a powerful machine. The main story line is very linear but does not fail to be interactive and engaging.

Every online session has some sort of 'mod' where if you him off he'll just kick you out of the session or screw with you. People get mad when you shoot them yet run around and shoot you the entire game. The UI has major issues. Nothing is consistent. Half of the menu's you have to press 'enter/return' to confirm(WADS plus mouse.... why would our fingers be anywhere near the enter button? Hello?) half of the screens you select using your mouse. When you get disconnected from GTA online it loads single player. Then you have to wait for single player to load then you can try to get back into online. Like seriously no retry logic? What is this the 90s?Just absolutely no thought was put into the small details. The small details ruin this game. What a game with such great potential only to be squandered.I could write a novel about why this game isn't worth it. Too many small things were implemented badly. I,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-28,0,0,335,False,Recommended,We ll start off with singleplayer and then go onto online. Singleplayer One of the main things in singleplayer mode is the storyline. The story is good certainly not better than the one in GTA IV but the characters are very well written. Each one of them has their unique personality. Each mission has it s unique feel because there s more action that makes you like the storyline even if it doesn t have a good story. That brings us to the good gameplay mechanics that makes the action possible meaning well timed actions which gives a realistic feel to the game. Physics for some reason are not better than the previous GTA IV. The game has it s own atmosphere but you can t really notice it but that makes up for the random actions that occur while you are not doing a mission. That s why GTA IV had better atmosphere that made the story a lot more realistic and serious. But that doesn t make it bad there s a lot attention to detail and various collectibles around the map that are science fictional or cause weird occurrences. When you get bored of singleplayer you go onto online. Online GTA Online feels like a different game that we know Rockstar Games didn t use to make. In that world you can have your own apartments businesses cars vehicles and let everyone know how rich you are not only in the game but in real life too. You have all types of vehicles ranging from Oppressors to Jets Deluxos APCs and a lot more that are equipped with top of the line machine guns and rocket launchers that make killing other players much easier than ever. But all come at a higher price meaning that if you want these without grinding for hours you ll have to hit for the wallet. Rockstar will be very happy and will keep adding more of these vehicles made even easier to control. That s where you ll find people in the game that won t be able to live anymore if they don t kill you at least once. Usually the type of players that use the most expensive equipment but still manage to get killed by a sniper riffle. But what if you don t want to spend any money in the game? Then you can play for hours and do a lot of missions and jobs till you can afford these and finally show everyone who s the boss in the lobby. Innocent players getting banned for no reason. GTA Online could have been a better game with less toxic community and painfully long loading screens.There's a lot more to be said about this game but at the end GTA V follows some of the original formula for making Grand Theft Auto games while still adding new features that we didn t have before.,Grand Theft Auto V

There also really is no sensible way of going about making money in GTA Online even less so for the kind of money the new content requires (tens of millions of in game dollars)To sum it all up GTA V is a fantastic game in itself but at this point is too saturated and hindered by microtransactions to even be playable.

(but i have not played it on console for quite awhile so may have players who expolit that was well) if only they could make a deal with Xbox Or PS4 to allow players to play online for free on GTA for life.PC GTA ONLINE version sucks balls.. wayyy too many cheaters and modders (exploiters) on that and sometimes it drives me up the wall something shocking. BUT in turn it's honestly Rockstars fault or whoever designed GTA ONLINE for making payments suck balls when doing missions instead of what 30k? or less honestly u should get 100k for doing them. GTA says they want to make it fair for everyone but they make it harder.. costs so much to buy a car in the game. they dont even cost that much in real life. discounts dont help they need to be lowered for life.Here's what GTA needs to do with their billions of dollars they make every year.Make it even more difficult for cheaters and game exploiters to get into the game.atm you're anti cheating system sucks balls. a 10yo can make a better anti cheat system.To The Cheaters &amp Expoliters some of you are great okay i get that i know some people who stand up for you guys and say you are great..

2018-07-29,0,0,1493,False,Recommended,"I do recommend the game but.. The online community is becomming more and more terrible and just a toxic community to be in/ a part of. I do very much enjoy the game but it does suck because people can control when you can and can't play the game. Meaning if you ""ruin"" someone else's gameplay expirence they report you for it and get you suspended from the video game for at least 30 days.. as I have had that happen to me recently Another thing i don't like is rockstar isn't the best at answering tickets. I get that they are a massive corporation but if you know that you are going to be making massive amounts of money on a video game then you need to hire as many people that is needed to answer tickets properly. I get the huge corp aspect but if you can't keep up with everything that's when you need to hire people to do specific and certain jobs. I was recently suspended from online because someone didn't like who i am friends with I sent in two tickets to rockstar and both of the emails I was sent replying to my tickets said the same exact thing. I was not told why I was suspended and i think that as a player you have the right to know why you have been suspended and or banned from online. Other than these little things the game is very enjoyable with friends I have a massive group of friends that I play online with and we have so much fun doing so this game could be loads more fun if the community was better and if things were run differently by the Corporation (Rockstar). Again this game is very enjoyable in playing as long as you have friends and ignore the rudness of the community as you have very rude people in every online video game/community. As someone with over 1 000 hours I believe that it would be a better game if it was run better and if the community wasn't so toxic.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-12,0,0,1568,False,Recommended,For this I am going to break this review into two parts. Story Mode and Online. Story Mode has always been the bread and butter of the GTA franchise so I feel that judging this game solely for the Online section is rather unfair.Story ModePros As always an excellent story by Rockstar with an amazing cast of characters. Huge Open World to explore and filled with easter eggs and fan service. Ludicruous ammount of attention to detail put into the game even to the smallest parts. Multitude of side missions and activities to do even after you finished the main story. The AI make the game feel alive even with animals that fly around and run everywhere.Cons After you complete all missions and activities you feel like there is not much else to do. Some of the places you could access on previous tittles are now closed off. Sometimes the AI feel a little too dumb. No DLC to expand it as of yet.Over all the Story Mode is an excellent experience to have even if you're new to the franchise. It is the meat of this game and it delives and the negatives are mostly minor grievances that don't take away from the experience at any point. For the Story Mode alone this game is a must buy and I'd recommend it any day.OnlinePros Nice character customization that lets your character look how you want. Immersive system of buying property and vehicles. Awesome vehicle customization with tons of vehicles to own and customize. Free updates that always bring more missions and activities to do. Ability to play with others on public sessions or with friends only on private sessions.Cons Everything is very expensive and geared towards buying Shark Cards. Toxic community full of griefers and hackers that run amok in public sessions. Many missions are locked to Public sessions only severely limiting the ability to grind in peace. Rocktar support leaves much to be desired. Not much to do in private sessions.Online started as a sweet note but as time passed Rocktar let SharkCard money go to their heads and now it is nothing but a sweet sour after taste. Locking all big activities and missions to public therefore forcing players to play online with randoms as a way to prevent grinding even though everything is too expensive. Online alone infuriated me so much that I gave up on future Rocktar games. Don't get me wrong I have over 1000 hours put into this game and I did get my money's worth. But the direction that Rocktar is heading towards with Sharkcards is just not healthy and rather a fine recipee for a toxic community. But definetly do try out this game if only for the Story Mode alone or the ability to goof off with friends but don't expect a public online experience without getting extreme frustration from the community. And Rockstar did amp it up with the latest DLC which takes a big load off the shoulders of people who are trying to grind instead of taking the easy road. But everything is still expensive.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,I wanted to love this.. wanted so badly. I even preordered day 1 on steam. My favorite game on Xbox 360 when it came out my favorite franchise and most coveted title as a PC master race member since the original GTA I played on a pentium 60. However Rockstar has royally messed up... for the first time EVER (I was ok with 4's DRM.. it never crashed!)The crashes! AHH! Both my friend and I have similar computers. I use a 4790K he has a 4690K. Both using MSI Z97 Gaming 5 boards. Both using GTX 970 cards. We've tried everything at stock clocked underclocked. Reinstalling OS drivers rollbacks facerolls the works. Oh wait you're in the middle of a heist? Enjoy this black screen and hard reboot to your PC's dome. Single player? GTAV.exe has stopped working.. Maybe the crash msgs will swap between the two. Maybe a GFX Init error? Maybe just a drop to desktop for the heck of it. Why not? I've been killed from crashes in SP more than I've died from natural digital causes.Sure this happens maybe once twice sometimes more a gaming session (night) but.. really? Its annoying and a game breaking experience. I don't even want to play anymore especially when I spend half of my time sitting at loading screens waiting for crappy pugs. Now I see RS is banning modders etc. I get the online mod banning but make a clear gap between SP and MP and let the SP folks go damn wild! Increase the craptastic FOV! Listen to your customers.. I'm going to make a ticket with Rockstar and I sure hope they help.,Grand Theft Auto V

They have no respect for their own product. They have no respect for the hard work anyone's put into GTA V and it's been made abundantly clear.The one thing that kept the GTA series alive on PC after even Rockstar stopped making content for them was Open IV and it was shut down. What's worse than that is that neither Take Two nor Rockstar Games have the decency to be honest about why they're doing it blaming the ability to hack their online mode using it. Now unfortunately both TTI and RG forgot that everyone else also has a brain and can read words since the one big thing about Open IV from the start has been that it does NOT with online.

2015-09-13,0,0,360,False,Recommended,I love the Grand Theft Auto franchise and I have since I played the first one and loved it even more when III came out and you get the 3rd person view rather than the hellicopter view. If you like GTA you'll love V because it's the best of them all. The only thing that I can really say that I don't like about V is that the load times are super long online is spotty and most of the time you're spending time looking for a match for more than 4 other people in it. And if you're looking to do any of the heists you're better off finding 3 other friends to do them with because most of the randoms you'll get matched with will screw you most of the time. Other than that stuff V is great. The story mode is the best so far in the franchise and I highly recommend it the charcter development it awesome whether it's prodictable or not it's exactly what it's supposed to be and all the RockStar elements are the easter eggs the jokes and everything that RockStar has been doing the whole time with the GTA franchise. Also First Person View in this version is most definitly worth it I originally bought this for my 360 at launch and then bought this version because I wanted to see what it was all about and it is definatly worth it but the 360 version does have more online players and better servers but other than that PC &gt 360.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is extremely fun. Unfortunately you'll spend most of your time in front of loading screens. It takes forever to load into GTA online and once you're in you're greeted with more long loading screens when you try to play online matches. The game crashes every 30 to 45 minutes which means you'll start your loading screen life cycle all over again quite frequently.I have 20 hours logged on but I probably only got to actually play for 10 of those hours. It takes so long to load that I would catch up on Netflix shows while waiting to get into GTA online or an online match. 10/10 best loading screen simulation game I've played.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,135,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V finally hits the PC in a mammoth package of content. If you haven't already jumped on the band wagon it's time to do so.Gameplay Story and Presentation are top notch. Modest systems will struggle to make a pretty image but the level of detail scale and fluidity of the game in motion can make it easier to overlook.Online can be a huge time sink as lobbies can take a while to organize so best played with a group of friends. It can also take a number of minutes to transition between characters or lobbies so a quick bout of multiplayer is not possible during your lunch break in between bottles of mountain dew and dorritos.Price of admission is high but if you like the look of this game as a whole there is a generously filled package waiting for you.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-03,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Great game we all know that.However be wary of the recommended hardware settings my computer has an intel quadcore proc 8GB RAM and 2GB graphics (equal to or more than the minimum settings) but even with all the graphics on the rock bottom settings in 800x600 it's so laggy it's unplayable. I've heard other people say that the game is so optimized that turning the graphics settings UP can help with lag/framerate but that doesn't seem to work for me. Just be absolutely sure your computer can handle it before you drop the $60.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-03,0,0,152,False,Recommended,The game is really fun. Story mode has interesting characters and awesome dialogues. You play 3 characters in the game that are very different than one another which sets this apart from the past series. The graphics are gorgeous but if you don't have a beast of system (Titan X i7 ect.) you should really turn off all the graphics options in the advanced graphics section. I have a GTX 970 i7 2600k 4Ghz and 8GB ram and I am just running everything on high with 2x MSAA at 1080p and I get a constant 60fps. There were issues with stuttering especially when going fast in a car in Los Santos. I called Rock Star custom support and the guy I talked to was amazing. I talked to him about a number of issues and we tried to figure out how to stop or minimize the stuttering in the game. After trying a lot of stuff he suggested I minimized the stutter pretty well. There is also an issue with owned cars disappearing the story mode. For example I went to start a mission in a modded car after I got to the checkpoint for some reason my default car you have at the beginning of the game magically appeared and told me to get in it. I was really reluctant but I had to get in that car because Franklin was in it so I had to leave my modded car there. I set a marker so I could find my car so I could go back to it after I finished the mission. After I finished the mission I went back and the car disappeared. I looked to see if it was at the impound by the impound icon on the map wasn't there. I went to my safehouse and slept to maybe see if it needed time to register or something but still didn't see the car impound icon on the map... So I pretty much lost a car that I spent 100k on mods for. The effort to try and not have your modded cars go missing is too tedious for it to be worth it. Online for me is fun when you find good team mates with headsets for heists miserable the rest of the time. I spend most of my time in the clouds loading the game and the loading times are horrendous. Unlike in single player there is a feature to save your car and know where you car is via insurance which I wish would be in single player as well.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,0,0,619,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V. Somewhere around the fifth installment of the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series. Enter a world of criminals and murderers. Climb your way up the criminal ladder by cutting out competition all the while following a compelling well written story. The city and surrounding area are beautifully made and you'll find yourself driving around the countryside just too see what's around. While finding the idea of jumping into a armored car and taking on another criminal organization head on extremely appealing there is one issue that destroys all semblance of that ""real world"" feel. There are only 20 maybe 21 radio stations. What is this? 1922?! In order for too feel fully immersed in a ""realistic"" world set in modern time we should want no demand to have access to hundreds of stations many of which should be full/semi static. All of the work and time put into the game was merely thrown out the digital window along with the modern head unit and was instead replaced by a piece of technology that mostly likely is still using tubes too function.Still waiting on the update with my FM trasmitter and static channles.Great strip club sim. 34.7/41.1",Grand Theft Auto V

I submitted a ticket to Rockstar on the issue and what would be needed to fix it. It took days to get a canned response linking me to a forum post that had nothing to do with the issue. The only way I can play is with a local account on the machine when every other game I have works just fine.Now aside from that FUBAR'd issue that they refuse to fix I have another problem. Framerates in fullscreen 1920x1080 are garbage. My GTX 680 struggles on low the maintain a playable FPS. Skyrim 1920x1080 2K+ res textures mods and shaders up the ying yang 90+ FPS all day. GTA V low settings 15 20 FPS. But if I put the game in Windowed mode at some funky resolution below 1920x1080 I can get 60+ FPS no problem. Long story short poor optimization.So I spent $60 on this game for PC with the sole intention of modding it and dumping hundreds of hours of my life into it with friends. However Rockstar has decided to ban people for using simple mods in single player. Way to go Rockstar. As if your reputation wasn't already dinged from the launcher issue for the PC release you decided you need to ding it some more. Folks until Rockstar gets their head out of their butt don't waste your money on this game. You'll have trouble loading it poor FPS and you'll get banned online for anything you do in SINGLE PLAYER.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-16,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,Dont waste your money for this game guys. unless you wanna play it with friends or play campaign or something.Personally I liked the game a lot at the start you can buy your apartment (almost every player has the same 2 ones though) having a lot of cars customizing them even customize your character!But....Hackers. Hackers everywhere. At the start there havent been that much but since ppl started to realize it s so eazy to hack in gta their numbers are increasing. And GTA doesnt do anything about it (How it seems).Pvp is open world (there are maps for pvp but usually nobody plays them) there are up to 30 players on a server and it s rar that there are fully 30 people servers where there is no hacker online.Because they wanted to let the single player be fully moddable hackers can do quite a lot in online gta.With 1 click they can give themselves (or others) billions of dollars. can blow all players in the whole server up (and even make the system say it s you who blow them up) teleporting all weapons and i dont know what else i dont care anymore anyway.Then they have a bad lobbysystem almost none existent report system and only chance to get other people in your coop or pvpmissions is to invite them per handy but you get spammed on your handy so noone really pays attention for their handy.When you played gta for a while played every mission and heists for eternity there really is nothing to do anymore but killing players open world (but try to kill hackers let me watch plz i m grabbing popcorn)They sure bring in some new features but it s mostly 1 new pistol 2 new cars and that s it. Plus maybe another outfit.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-16,0,0,109,False,Recommended,I have played GTA4 both the original and all the expansions and to briefly describe GTA5 it is the most sophiscated and realistic RPG to date. But it is still far from perfect still have room for improvement. For example it lacks some of the social features such as making GF hanging out with friends call friends to reinforce and help or other things that would better simulate the social interaction of the real world.The multiple character system is another questionable factor at least at its current performing level. The transition between characters are sometimes quite annoying and disruptive especially in the process of a mission. May be R STAR should try to let player decide which character to play from the start and then progress each character separately therefore making the story longer and eliminating unwanted disruption from switching characters.Also I still think there should be more interesting things to do in the freemode. Currently it looks like we are lacking some interesting features in the freemode and wasting the surprisingly huge map.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-28,0,0,66,False,Recommended,TL DR at the bottom of review.I've loved this game for a long time. I started my GTA V playtime on the ol' Xbox 360 and had an amazing time on it. Using glitches to get into weird areas playing heists (after about 2 years hurr durr) and of course having a fokkin blast shooting my friends' faces in and defending myself in public sessions and all around wreaking havoc. Then one day the PC Nation attacked. It was prepurchasable on Steam so I sold my CSGO knife for it (it was worth it I tell you) and some other miscellaneous items and began the download. It was 50 GB. So I out a whole house. It took over 48 hours to download and I'm frankly surprised the PC didn't explode while being on for so long. Anyway I played the PC Online loved it and decided to mess around with singleplayer mods. Turns out that if you forget to uninstall scripthookv as well you can get banned. So I got banned when going online after uninstalling everything except scripthookv. Now I'm banned. Not permanently but just until September 30th 2015 I can wait. I'm not changing this because of laziness.TL DR Began fun times on Xbox 360 got PC waited 48 hours for download played. got singleplayer mods and failed to uninstall one got banned for a week.11/10 would get banned again,Grand Theft Auto V

Game ini diterbitkan pada tanggal 17 september 2013 untuk console Playstation 3 dan Xbox 360. Game ini adalah game kelima belas dari seluruh game GTA Dan juga Berita dari Rokstar Games katanya Games Grang Theft Auto V ini akan ada di PlayStation 4 Xbox One dan juga di PC pada saat musim gugur 2014Grand Theft Auto V berlatar pada bagian negara fiktif yakni San Andreas (Di dunia nyata California Selatan). Sebelumnya San Andreas telah menjadi tempat berlatarnya Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. Berbeda dengan GTA San Andreas kota di GTA V hanya satu yakni Los Santos Berbeda dengan GTA San Andreas yang ada 3 kota. Untuk pertama kalinya dalam GTA Tokoh Protagonis bukan hanya satu melainkan Tiga yakni Franklin Clinton Michael De Santa dan Trevor Phillips. Ketiga tokoh protagonis tersebut memiliki ciri khas dan kekuatan masing masing.Grand Theft Auto V mencetak rekor penjualan dalam sejarah berikut ini adalah rekornya Best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies) Best selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$) Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion Fastest video game to gross $1 billion Highest grossing video game in 24 hours Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies) Most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game Most viewed trailer of an action adventure video game (800+ milion views)&lt b&gt Kelebihan&lt /b&gt + optimasi tekstur graphics benar benar luar biasa+ texture benar benar detail+ day n night anda tidak hanya akan di manjakan dengan pergantian waktu tetapi dimanjakan dengan bayangan benda yang membuatnya sangat nyata+ cuaca hujan juga adalah feature terbarunya yang dimana anda bisa melihat tiap bulir hujan yang jatuh bahkan percikannnya juga sangat detail.+ Dunia malam ini juga termasuk featurenya yang sangat diandalkan mengapa karena biasanya di game lain ketika malam pasti akan terasa sepi tetapi di game ini anda akan merasa kotanya semakin rame sama seperti di kota kota besar dimana orang akan berkeliaran di malam hari+ Modenya sangat banyak seperti Mengemudi membuat misi perampokan terbang berburu diving mengendarai pesawat kapal selam kapal golf tenis kartu nge ganja balapan bermain di pasar bursa saham. Anda tidak akan pernah bosan dalam game ini bahkan di Single Player Mode.+ Pejalan kaki terasa lebih hidup dikarenakan melakukan banyak aktifitas lain baik itu mengobrol masuk keluar toko membunuh pejalan kaki lain memanggil taxi ketawa ketiwi dan aktivitas lain+ Ada Banyak Populasi Hewan + Ketika Makan menggunakan piring dan sendok tidak seperti sebelumnya.+ Jika kita membunuh atau melakukan kejahatan di suatu tempat wartawan akan datang ke lokasi kejadian dan TV yg ada di Safe House akan menyiarkan nya&lt b&gt Kekurangan&lt /b&gt Yah seperti di comment pertama oleh ChickenNinja mengatakan bahwa game ini membutuhkan pc high end dikarenakan system requimentnya sangat tinggi untuk low spec cuman bisa di 64bit baik itu vista seven dan eight sehingga banyak orang yang melakukan instalasi ulang OSnya dikarenakan hanya ingin bermain game ini. belum support di mac ataupun linux Customer Support responnya lama (mungkin karena masih baru dan banyak yang melaporkan error sana sini) sehingga anda harus sabar jika ada error di pc anda Mapnya itu itu adja D maksudnya hampir mirip dengan seri sebelumnya&lt b&gt Apakah Game ini direkomendasikan&lt /b&gt yah game ini sangat direkomandasikan apalagi dengan harganya yang tinggi dijamin pasti anda mau mainin itu gamenya terus wakakakaka..maaf yah terlalu panjang lebar tetapi jujur ini game benar benar keren intinya anda tidak akan rugi membelinya dengan harga segitu.dan mengapa banyak yang mengatakan aq dibanned??? dikarenakan mereka meng install mods. mods diperbolehkan untuk dimainkan di single player dan mods tidak di ijinkan dimainkan di multi player karena itu tidak adil. jika anda ingin memasukkan mods backup dulu data gta v anda dan masukkan modsnya. dan ketika anda ingin mainkan GTA V lagi restore backupnya... mengapa demikian karena di GTA V belum ada tombol untuk mematikan mods yang anda sudah install sehingga bisa menyebabkan anda di banned.

Reason is because the singleplayer is a nice story to play through and all but the multiplayer is terrible either it be hacking or the fact that rockstar focuses on the multiplayer more than its singleplayer. 100 of my hours were invested into a vanilla singleplayer experience so I was getting bored glad the community in a modders sense is alive and well but the fact I need mods to tend to the abandoned gameplay of gta 5 worries me. Another detail is that rockstar is loved by many so is somewhat getting away with this in app purchase t that has been plauging newer titles. They recently were in a tussle with a whole banning and disabling accounts situation during 2017 but idk cause I dont play the damn multiplayer.

2016-11-25,0,0,1687,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Changed my recommendation to negative because almost the best overall game ever created in the history of mankind became victim to the capitalist greed of developers over time. Connection system of the game was already wrong and badly designed (It allows cheaters to easily bypass protection systems if any) it is now totally obsolete. New vehicles are only added for the sake of more profit. Players as a small time gang members or street thugs are now using state of the art vehicles that are even expensive for the most wealthy of nations in the world! Capable of destruction that makes the game unplayable for peaceful or passive players. Also cheaters are totally ignored they are having hell of a good time over here... OLD REVIEW Altough it is older than quite many titles of the same genre. GTA V is the valiant king of 'open world' throne none the less. Rockstar did well with creating a universe that is too similar to ours but yet too different and far away from it. Also it is still trying to keep up the pace with regular vehicle or item additions from time to time (Prices and requirements to buy/use them are ridiculous though).Game is about mayhem destruction and money. Single player is interesting altough some may find it dull and repetitive. But what makes this game different is the GTA Online true representation of human nature and psyche. Everyone starts out as a hero and ends up as the evilest villain of their dreams.You will most likely rage quit a million times. But come back just to feel the same wrath again. Because... it is GTA!Buy it if you want to kill time but be warned both single player and online may become repetitive as the sole purpose of the game is earning/grinding money. Nothing else.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can do all the missions 100% or you can go on a rampage and kill everyone you want. The online mode is something worse. Everything is too freaking expensive making you buy shark cards that cost 50 bucks just for a simple car. The activities in online are fun for the most part. As long as you don't encounter cheaters you'll be fine. The loading takes a while but that isn't a problem for me because i mostly play story mode. You'll need a very powerfull pc to play this game because it's absolutely HUGE. I had to get a new pc just for this game. But ether way it's a fun time killer game.

2017-06-17,0,0,1039,False,Not Recommended,"I have severe buyer's remorse for purchasing this game on the PC. I own it on the PS3 and the only reason for buying the PC version was for the mods. Take2 in a stunningly greedy avaricious and transparent attempt to sell more Shark Cards and turn GTA into a ""Freemium"" game that you have to still purchase at full retail price has officially pulled the rug out from under the modding community and sucked the fun out of the Single Player experience.Someone needs to explain to the Housers that you can't double dip. When you sell a game for full retail price you should provide that game in its entirety with perhaps some nominally priced DLC.However if your intent is to basically tap the Freemium market like most mobile games and make your killing that way then it is encumbent upon you to make your game ""Free to Play"" and add in all the freemium content you please to bilk your customers the way that Take2 is doing with GTAO bucks or Shark Cards.It needs to be explained to the Housers that you can't have it both ways.That said as a person who already owned the game on the PS3 since launch a major selling point for me buying the game a second time was the mods. Honestly if all I wanted was the vanilla game why would I shell out another $59.99USD for the PC version?Inherently console games are smoother run with much less issues tweaking and compatibility problems and do not force you into having a particular GPU in order to run it. But that is getting away from the topic of this review.The reality is that when you try to strongarm your customer base as Take2 is doing by their despicable Caease and Decist order to the creators of OpenIV what you have effectively done is cancelled out the benefit of the PC version over the console. Rockstar/Take2 if you really insist on making GTA a freemium game modeled after all those mobile apps by companies like Gameloft then fine. Stop selling the game. Make it ""Free to Download"" and ""Free to Play"" just as Gameloft Kiloo and a plethora of other Freemium devs do. But stop double dipping and ripping your customers off.Some of us DO NOT play GTA in order to be bilked by Freemium thuggery. We expect to pay a full price for a game and in the case of PC GTA we expect to be able to mod the game. If you want to increase Shark Card sales then make the game Freemium and be done with it.Idiots!",Grand Theft Auto V

It's very fun to get into and I enjoyed it the whole way through. However I assume you're here for the shooting random people on the streets and enjoying a stroll in your new Progen T20. Well you can do that! The story mode is your sandbox. Do whatever you like with it! Including modding. Rockstar currently is open to the modding community for story mode only. Once you have soaked up all the fun you can have in this game without mods (currently impossible) you can begin modding. There are several mods currently out that are fantastic and there are many more to the. In all this game is highly detailed and great for both new comers to the franchise and lovers of the Grand Theft Auto games. 10/10 would reccomend again for story mode.Online Grand Theft Auto Online is fantastic on the PC edition at least in my opinion. Many complain about the rampent hackers making life in Los Santos a pain. In my honest opinion the game can be fun with hackers. Do not make the mistake of thinking ""Oh just because this guy said the game can be fun with hackers means that I will enjoy the game forever with hackers! Yay!"" No. Not too long ago I got fustrated when trying to go to a Los Santos Customs while constantly being blown up by hackers along with the rest of the lobby. But when hackers who are looking just to mess around for a good laugh with a good sense of humor come around it's great. Online has lots of both Rockstar and community made jobs to earn you money and keep you busy. You can spend your cash on weapons vehicles houses garages and more! If I had to put Online on a scale of 1 to 10... I'd give it a 9/10 because of the fustration I get here and there for hackers in the Online portion of the game. Do not let this stop you from having fun with your friends or by yourself though. In all I believe this game is a lot of fun. I spend many upon many hours playing with my friends and strangers battling to the death racing or having weird conversations while driving in a limo around Blaine County. And I've played hours on end trying to complete as much as I could in Story Mode. But Online seems to have this grip on me to where I cannot stay away from it xD. I know this is not really an in depth review that's because I am not a professional reviewer or critque. I just wanted to give my personal opinion about this game. For my final rating this game should get a 9.5/10. And you can see why I came to this from both the Story and Online modes. Thanks for listening to my opinion.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-12,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,This game is so ****ing bad. I thought it would be great and all yea get cool cars do some cool s*** mess around with a bunch of people but no. You get ****ed over by ***ks with homing missiles orbital strike cannons and lots more money than you. When you try to get more money by vehicle import export you get assaulted by a bunch of players trying to get your loot. Solo public sessions should help but no you have enemies that spawn right in front of you with ******** cars and smgs with the accuracy of about 100000. I was around 3/4 mile away it was a long straightaway and the stupid 2 enemies in blue cars still were able to shoot my car. I lost so much profit from that ****. You can play stupid heists with horrible setups and pre setups (yup setups for the setups) where enemies spawn in front of you you have to control horrible vehicles that barely work properly (doomsday) and the heist itself is more boring than the setups. Thats another way to get money. Keep in mind that you have to do ALL of the setups every single time you want to do a heist for like 300 500k per. Could be worth if you did them fast enough but highly unlikely. You could do cargo runs where you get a piece of cargo and you deliver it but its ing cuz police everywhere and you need a semi and and its just ing horrible. Not to mention other players can interfere too. If you plan on playing with friends then you would probably wanna do ****ty heists because thats the only way money is shared besides vip work which is extremely boring and doesn't get that much money for you or your associate/bodyguard anyways. If you wanna do import export your friends dont get paid anything from the 30 80k (per car imported) or 10 50k(from cargo) so its almost useless unless you play heists which is once again very boring. Find a better multiplayer game. This game is a huge grind and R* doesn't seem to wanna fix this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,208,False,Recommended,Pros Massive and detailed open world to explore. I've been playing this game for two years on last gen and current gen and I still keep finding new stuff in San Andreas. Controls are responsive even when using kb+m. Also one of the best keyboard driving controls I've ever experienced. Would suggest to tweak the plane controls though when you are using a keyboard. One of the best console ports I've ever played on PC. Rockstar did a good job optimizing this game for PC.Cons The story is IMO not on par with previous GTA suchs as GTA IV and GTA SA. In comparison to IV the story is a little bit short and simple but feels like it was rushed whereas IV had a fully developed and complex storyline. The story is still good though. Fewer side missions compared to previous GTA. While the S&amp F missions kind of helped with the post game content I was a bit disappointed that the side missions were mostly races and property missions. Heck the property missions doesn't even work properly and glitches out on most of my playthroughs. GTAO is a of grinding and game breaking mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-29,0,0,2450,False,Not Recommended,The most fun thing in online (and 90% of the players buy this game for online) is freemode. It's all fun and games until some kid takes pvp seriously there and starts sh*ttalking you using cheap p2w tactics (pay cash for getting hidden off the radar pay cash to instakill you pay cash to get 3x health and damage pay cash to buy an overpowered vehicles) or just abusing the insane number glitches that infest this nightmare of a multiplayer experience. The worst part is you can't pick what server you play on to avoid that you have to wait a bare minimum of 5 minutes to switch servers. And you will have to switch often unless you like getting killed by cheaters and tryhards. I don't like them because this game isn't and will never be competitive the gun play is horrible the movement is HIV &amp AIDS in forst person and the game p2w as all hell even in all dedicated dm jobs. The only reason I played it is because I loved dogfighting in aircrafts it's fun and actually takes some time to get good at. But then rockstar ruined that as well with their b*sted coding. You can't play this game for fun you can't play this game competitively. Why play it at all. Oh and did I mention the whole thing is absolutely anti consumer?

2016-06-22,0,0,1562,False,Recommended,I decided to give this game a more serious review because there are some things I want to address.I see a lot of reviews for this game saying that GTA Online is cancerous and the worst of the worst. I have played over 1200 hours of this game on the PC and well over 500 on the 360 (i lost track) and I can say with confidence that those claims are a little exagerated. Now I understand fully that hackers are everywhere and the job payouts were nerfed to encourage microtransactions. In fact I think we can all agree these are terrible things. However people seem to think that GTA Online is a place where they shouldn't be bothered by other people. It seems that people have forgotten what this game is. So I'll put out a reminder for anyone whos thinking about buying this game.Grand Theft Auto is a game where it is every man for himself. It is a game that can be unforgiving and sometimes unfair. It is a game where killing people is praised and wars are encouraged. If someone kills you in GTA Online it is not greifing and if they keep coming after you then find another server to play on. If you start a fight with someone bigger than you then don't act surprised when they start to kick your If you do freemode missions like moving cargo everyone in the server has the opportunity to destroy what you have and get a reward for it. That does not mean that whoever destroyed it is greifing especially when the game is encouraging it. Like every other game there are obstacles and a certain level of difficulty that comes with it. GTA Online is no different. So please take that into consideration next time you play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-29,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Favourite game ever.First GTA game I played was GTA 4 which at the time I thought was fantastic (even though I was a few years late). I got GTA 5 on PS3 PS4 and twice on PC (disc version screwed up so I got it on steam). Worth all of that money x10 and then some. The scale and depth in the game is mind blowing.I've since played the 3D era GTA games too. 5 is the balance between the HD gritty realism of 4 and the arcade style laid back mayhem of say San Andreas.Story Doesn't come close to the dark realistic shady story of 4 but that isn't what Rockstar were going for. It's great in it's own right. It knows when to have a serious tone and when to kick back and let the player have fun. Characters are well done too having 3 protags was a great idea. It doesn't sound important but accessing the world from 3 different perspectives is a stroke of genius. Michael and Trevor are well developed interesting characters. My complaint would be what they did with Franklin arguably he embarks on a bigger journey than the other 2 but isn't nearly as well developed for some reason. It's still fun to play as him and he's a good character but I feel they could've done far more with him. The other shortcoming is the comedy. It's funny but at times it feels really lame and juvenile tbh.World Don't really know how to describe this properly. It's insane. It looks beautiful there's variety (cities/hills/desert/towns/sea). It feels alive which is the most important thing. Feels very real. It's also a very good replica of LA. Only been there once but they managed to really capture the feel and look of the city. Big step up from 4 while it had an amazing city there was no diversity and it all felt really grey and washed out.Online The less I say about this the better. It is toxic and awful pay to win has taken over.Full to the ing brim with absolute bellends screaming into a mic and deafening everyone in the lobby hackers and low life incels who have nothing better to do than kill everybody online on GTA all day. Sunk countless hours into online with mates on PS4 back in 2015/16 tried a few times on PC a while ago was From what I can tell it's only got worse. Enter at your own risk.I don't have time to play online anymore and even after beating the story and getting 100% quite a few times over the years I still play it. Install a mod replay a mission cruise around or something to that effect. Can't run out of to do. I will mention that I barely played in 2017 so I guess I kinda got the novelty of playing it back recently.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-29,0,0,77,False,Recommended,For the single player game the open world and the graphics were top notch probably the most impressive looking open world game I've played. Driving felt good npcs around Los Santos were really well done radio music was great as always and I also liked the fact you can play 3 different people and switch at any time. Lots of great humour and just an incredible looking game. What let it down for me was outside of missions there isn't really that much to do. I tried playing it more immersively taking my time checking out Los Santos and all that and staying away from missions. For the first couple of hours it felt great but once you've driven about played a game of golf had a game of tennis done a triathalon parachuted out of a plane punched a few people had a high speed chase with the cops it gets a bit boring and so you just end up following the missions. I would have preferred something to keep me gripped outside of the missions something that gave me a reason to go out and explore every inch of the incredible open world but I just got bored after a while. Missions for the most part were varied and exciting to do especially the heists. I did find some missions to be a bit arcade like on rails press this button press that button etc but overall they were decent. I might play it again it has replayability cos you can choose different options to do missions and heists and it is a great looking open world. Maybe i missed something i dunno.Great game but could have been better for the single player. An incredibly rich and detailed open world... that I didn't give a monkeys about exploring. I'd give a solid 8.5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,419,False,Not Recommended,Greetings fellow Steam user and welcome to this installment of 'Bullcrap of the Week' the only news program dedicated to talking a bunch of trash about popular games and what better way to start than with the game that went from 100 to 0 real quick (pun intended).Our top story Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar have decided to take action against cheaters and modders by removing millions of illegitimate dollars from modded accounts. Now that's what Rockstar would have liked to hear but in actuality their anti cheat system has instead chosen to remove legitimate dollars from innocent players without warning. The amount stolen is estimated to be between 100k to a staggering 20 mil! Everyone is currently outraged from this act but Rockstar as they are known to do have chosen to stick the middle finger up to players that actually tried to get their money back through Rockstar Support by sending their preset copy and paste 'we don't know what you're talking about' responses to those who questioned.Also in the news Smuggler's Run is now the 4th dlc to use the 'spend money to make money' feature by yet again having to buy a property and go on tedious missions to make a fraction of its initial cost. This scheme was used previously when buying office buildings biker clubhouses and military bunkers. Now however you can do the same thing again but in a hanger instead. Three cheers for uninspired 'free' dlc!Our final news segment is more of a reminder than anything ground breaking however I think it still has to be said. Sorry to break any diehard GTA players hearts but the singleplayer is most likely never going to get a proper dlc addition. Why you may ask? In the wise words of Shane McMahon 'Ching ching bling bling cut the cheddar. If you ain't talking money then your talking don't matter'. By that I mean that they are more focused on releasing the previously stated 'new and interesting' online expansions. Going back a few months ago the hype train had left the station with the GTA community onboard when dataminers found a supposed 'Agent Trevor' and 'Zombie' dlc file in the game's steam files. However like a famous internet personality trying to become relevant again through diss tracks this all didn't go according to plan as Rockstar were quick to confirm that they were never going to release dlc for the single player of Grand Theft Auto V. Who knew a game company could hold the world record for the largest party pooper on Earth?This will conclude this edition of 'Bullcrap of the Week'. I do hope this was somewhat helpful and please do your sad homeless starving self a favour and don't buy sharkcards no matter how tempting they may be. No I'm being serious there are still bright ones in the Steam community who actually think buying shark cards is the best way to spend their Maccas paycheck.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-07,0,0,1038,False,Not Recommended,It was a fun run but this game has gone stale.Let's list some cons *Rockstar is very anal about selling Shark Cards (Shark Cards are basically the EA equivalent to loot boxes but Shark Cards award GTA dollars in exchange for real life currency).*Every update shows spikes in prices on new vehicles and other content (presumably to push Shark Card sales).*The Online community is riddled with hackers. It is quite common to join a session with at least one hacker playing with you. They can disrupt your gameplay experience and Rockstar hasn't been very keen on stopping them. (Except when the hackers give other players free GTA money).*If you receive money from a hacker there is a good chance Rockstar will find out and subtract the money from your Online balance.*There's a connectivity issue where your online session will randomly lag out showing all players leaving your session at the same time. *The customer support is garbage.Now let's see some pros *The story mode gives you a decent amount of gameplay. (It doesn't quite compare to the Online gameplay).*It's fun to screw around. (You can't rampage through town in a tank or harrier jet and expect to come out alive irl).*There's plenty of easter eggs to find in Story mode.I'd recommend this game if the newer content wasn't so ridiculously expensive. Because of the inflated in game prices it's harder for new players to get caught up to those who are more advanced. If I were to make a suggestion I'd say just stop making free content and make the content paid and full unrestricted access to those who paid for the dlc. But Rockstar isn't known for listening to fan suggestions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,852,False,Recommended,This game is fun no doubt about it. Love playing it. Don't get me wrong there's alot of stuff to do. But at times it feels like R* made a very good map as a platform for more content and then abandoned that idea to instead release increasingly expensive things without adding any new ways that would make more money than endlessly grinding the pac standard heist. Now if those shark cards actually gave a proportional amount of money compared to their cost that wouldn't be such a problem but you have to pay atleast 15 to get enough money for a decent car.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-30,0,0,159,False,Recommended,"TL DR Amazing game held back by HORRIBLE microtransactions. Definately worth it if it's on a good sale but unless you're willng to pay hundreds to thousands on micro transactions are ok with grinding (which isn't ""TOO"" bad but frustrating nonetheless) have a modding friend or mod yourself then freemode isn't very enjoyable. The (albeit amazing) singplayer game is not worth it for $69.99 (canadian). CONS *MONEY*As stated above it simply is not worth the 70 bucks if you have no way of making money in freemode (getting 20k doing jobs by other people or stealing 2k from a store is pathetic). The freemode genuinely has enless hours of content with free DLC released years after original launch. The problem? The amount of fun you get depends on the money you have. DLCs cost money vehicles cost money weapons and ammo cost money everything costs money. I am lucky enough to have a modding friend and in turn limitless money (though I don't take too much.. that would just make the game pointless). Freemode is the crown jewel of this game IF you have the money for it. Otherwise it is an utter waste of time after a couple hours unless you find a good modder.*MODDERS*You've seen enough about this in the reviews... Some are s very few are nice and help you with money or with someone who keeps spawn killing you and most are annoying and spawn in random crap on you or turn on god mode aimbot etc. which just ruins any purpose of being in a multiplayer session.*NOTHING ELSE*I genuinely have not a single other complaint... it's just these two cons that ruin one of the best games ever made. PROS *SINGLEPLAYER*One of the best singleplayer campaigns ever. I'm nowhere near finishing it but friends of mine have player hours upon hours of it calling it the best singleplayer ever made. (being an RPG fan.. hard to say that but it's still great). With amazing acting interesting ways of teaching you the game genuinely great animation (considering how long it is) fun gameplay genuinely funny moments (if you're ok with dark humour) and a list that just goes on and on.*EVERYTHING (freemode only if you got money*It's a huge map with limitless possibilites of stuff to do. There are the smallest things that they created... tennis (which is pretty well done... like a $1.99 game on steam) golf (haven't done yet) shooting ranges movie theatres online websites (including a show that's like an adult version of what you really see on a morning on Cartoon Network) and so many small details and things to do. There are also thousands of GTA races and games to do... It's unreal.This is easily one of the best games ever made... Or would've been.... If micro transactions weren't so necessary to truly enjoy a huge portion of this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

You know everyone has a game they just played alot over and over again and couldnt stop playing it? That was Gta 5 for me but to be honest gta 5 isnt that fun anymore its sadly run by microtransactions if you dont have money you just gotta grind for hours As many early gta 5 player we all remember Rooftop rumble playing that damn mission over and over again. But Its a great game to play if you have friends to do those mission with and not alone. Gta 5 is great alone and with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

Also you should buy it with a friend because it is far more fun and exciting when you play it with a friend than alone.Pros Looks great alot of gun options character customization free DLCs *looking at you call of duty*.Cons Alot of modders requires alot of grinding you can't sell a gun that you don't like (you can store it away in your office's optonally added gun closet that adds up on your office's price you can add it later after buying your office if you forgot or didn't have enough mony).Game rating a solid 7.8/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-30,0,0,229,False,Recommended,Overall I give this game 7/10. The single player is great. The story is well thought out and full of comedy scheming and bloodshed. That's all good and great but the multiplayer is horrendous. Every update they release is just more pay to win pay to win pay to win mechanics added. The amount of grind it takes to accumulate the ridiculous amount of ingame cash is overwhelming. When the game first released the online experience was something you could get lost in but now it is just full of cheaters and people who invest their whole paychecks into the game and is not profitable for someone who just has 30 minutes a day to play. With all that said one of my favorite parts of this game is the ability to mod. BE WARNED YOU CANNOT MOD THE ONLINE PLAY ONLY SINGLEPLAYER. It is unfortunate that Rockstar is very anti modder but the community has found ways around it. I enjoy daily playthroughs of doing the Lord's Work on a mod called LSPDFR. In this mod you play as a LEO and the community has put every last bit of thought into it trying to make it as REALISTIC to the real job as possible. I can't get enough of it. It makes it a completely different game entirely. From traffic stops to domestic disturbances LSPDFR is a buggy yet enjoyable LEO roleplaying/simulator that I will enjoy for years to come. In conclusion if you re into this game for the online experience get together a loyal friend group and be prepared to spend lots real world money for ingame currency. If you re in it for the single player modding experience I recommend visiting GTA5 mods.com or lspdfr.com for great modding tools. Enjoy,Grand Theft Auto V

But now im still playing GTA V story mode ( also played some hours Online) i am at 66% completion game. Doing everything races missions strangers and freaks but man its not boring the heist missions its so funny and unique. Gives me same nostalgia for San Andreas story mode. Yep I always said San Andreas have best story mode in all GTA franchise. But now .. GTA V is the most complete game in GTA series.

2015-08-13,0,0,151,False,Recommended,If you've ever played a GTA game before you know what you're getting here many hours of sandbox fun with lots of tongue in cheek story missions and side missions inside an impressive simulated city. Everything in GTAV elaborates on the prior games and then some the city is more populated the countryside grander the attention to detail is pushed further. There's even three main protagonists over the traditional single starring character giving you some interesting personalities to inhabit and wreak havok around the city.Whilst GTAV isn't subtle or particularly clever with any of the themes it explores it steers between parody and homage whilst still keeping an element of tension. The three protagonists are each interesting with their own plots that interweave together as the game progresses. Overall the story is slightly sloppy and overlong but studded with a few diamonds and builds to a satisfying ending. Certain missions really stick out as a highlight especially several of the heists new multistage missions that require planning and preparation including selecting a crew and a method of approach to the job stealing uniforms getaway vehicles etc.A 'director mode' provides greater freedom to play in the sandbox offering unlimited access to the weapons and characters that you've unlocked in story mode and a slew of settings such as pedestrian density time of day weather and many other variables. You can record footage and edit it together although I found the editor a little sloppy and slow I'm sure the patient will be able to stitch together something interesting whilst others will simply utilize software outside of the game for best results.Finally there's the online component. I've played very little of the online mode (due to time restraints rather than enjoyment) but in all honesty it's the icing on the cake. There are missions to complete apartments to buy and crazy players to run away from. It's more of the same but a little less controlled. I went in a shop to buy some clothes and came out to find a player flying a plane attempting to land in the street shearing the wings off and ultimately hurtling down the street as a fireball whilst I scuttled nervously back to my car. Fun stuff.GTAV offers the franchises biggest sandbox so far to get lost and go a little crazy in and there's plenty of fun to be had.,Grand Theft Auto V

The GTA Online product has become completely useless and unplayable by those not cheating. R* got good and was able to detect and ban users the used OpenIV however there are more sophisticated mods out there that the s are using to ruin online play.

As for gta online it starts out as fun but as you slowly will learn all the fun vehicles are locked behinde grinding 500 hours of grinding the same heist over and over again or spending 100$ for like 2 or 3 vehicles and all new content for it would cost 400 or 500 dollars to skip the grind and all the new content would probably be(and this is a generous estimation) worth 60 dollars.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-26,0,0,58,False,Recommended,A fun game but I don't recommend it at full price.Story is entertaining however aside from the main cast the characters aren't as memorable as previous GTA games. Missions are mostly drive to x maybe shoot/hijack/beat up y then drive to z. Par for the course for GTA which isn't really a bad thing so perhaps I'm just getting tired of it since I've played every game since III gratuitously. Controls are tight and shooting is improved over GTA IV.Multiplayer was fun when I played it with friends but these days it's filled with hackers which can either increase your enjoyment (someone running around shooting ferris wheels out of their gun) or squash it. Rockstar bans people who try to mod in their own MP experience so you're limited in that regard.Pick it up if it's at $40 that's my recommendation.,Grand Theft Auto V

Driving is a lot more refined than in GTA 4 and doesn't fling you half way across the map for bumping a fire hydrant when barely moving. Motorcycles are also much more lenient (almost rediculously so). It makes for a much more fun gameplay wise.NOS is sadly missing from cars though they go plenty fast without it. The feeling of sudden bursts of uncontrollable speeds will be missed but the driving feels much more refined and more than makes up for the bursts of speed.Shooting feels solid and the addition of NPCs falling over and continuing to shoot from a downed position adds an incentive to perform headshots (or blow everything up with explosives). However the cover mechanic is still finicky and feels 'sticky' in certain fights.There is so much detail in this return to San Andreas and a lot of throwbacks to previous games. The environment tells as much about a character as the story does so high textures are a must to get the full enjoyment out of things rather than staring at blurry pictures that often times contain Easter Eggs.The story is held up by the characters and the drive to learn more about them drives you on rather than the overarcing plot which is a bit cliche. Each of the characters are interesting in their own way and seeing their interaction with other is a hell of a lot of fun.In short it's fantastic but the world already knows that.The online portion is a separate entity. Online community asside GTA V feels very restrictive in terms of online play. Players cannot host their own custom servers with mods enabled or private free roam instances. They can only connect to a list of things choose from a list of things and play a list of things. While there is user created content it's a bit more restricting than normal.What's there is pretty fun to play but much like Payday GTA V's online is most fun when played with people you know and ideally a full team of friends who all have voice chat and have a tolerance for restarting over and over again due to silly deaths.On the note of deaths the load times are horrible between matches so failures can be punishing on patience. The syncing on the other hand is quite fantastic considering the ludicrous speeds you can go at in a sports car. Everything remains relatively sync'd riding shotgun in a car at high speeds (with a few lag spikes) with multiple people in a map.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA Online is probably my favorite multiplayer concept its just failing a little in the execution. I get the feeling that this was created more as a sort of bonus but has no overtaken the single player and created a demand much more than they were prepared to support. Hacking/Modding has been running rampant and while Rockstar is generally swift and generous with the ban hammer...its hard for them to keep up.

2015-06-04,0,0,89,False,Recommended,I don't usually write reviews for games but I felt I had to for this one. I haven't even been able to play near as much as I would like to because of life and work and stuff but what I have played has been incredible. I was one of those people who were extremely upset about having to wait so long after this had been released for the consoles for this to finally come out on PC but comparing this to the Xbox One version that my son plays it was definitely worth the wait. The graphics are gorgeous even on my 5 year old PC. I can run this game at max settings and the game never even gives a slight hiccup. The absolute only thing that has bothered me with this game is when trying to go back to my house to save the game some missions just start when I get to the door. I wasn't a fan of having to go home to save the game and I had hoped for something different with GTA V. Maybe like the Saints Row games. Other than that I have yet to find anything to make me regret buying this game. I can't comment on the online portions of the game as I rarely play any games online and have yet to even try GTA V online. I do like the iFruit app that I have on my real phone that lets me train the dog as well as other things outside of the game. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because nothing's perfect but this game comes pretty close to it!,Grand Theft Auto V

I haven't even tried the online part of the game yet. I just can't get into detail about everything here. If you are a fan of sandbox open world games like other GTA games and Saint's Row etc then you need to give this a try. Although not necessary I chose to upgrade my vid card from a GTX 770 to a 970 so that I could bump up the graphic details even higher than I was running. One thing I can explain with a little detail is the graphics settings screens. There is a video memory meter that shows how much GPU memory you are using with each tweak and setting change so that you can maximize your preferences visually. And then you can run a quick framerate test that is part of the game to see your FPS for your latest setting. Good stuff.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-24,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Honestly I haven't played much multiplayer as I didn't like it all that much.But the story.One of the best i've seen in a video game.If you only play the campaign the hours you spend will outweigh the cost of the game itself.Story takes around 40 hours to complete and there are a TON of side missions that are both intruiging and worth your time.Graphics are really beautiful on max and Los Santos is an extremely varied and detailed open world to explore.The three protagonists are quirky and I found myself relating to Michael quite a bit (maybe too much) but whatever.Franklin is overally pretty chill and a cool character to play as.Trevor is a d*ck but can also be funny.There are a lot of characters and I think the ending of the game tied things together well which seems to be lacking in certain games i've played recently. The campaign may be boring at first but after the characters are introduced things get a lot more interesting.One of the best open world games I implore you to get it for the campaign only as I have no buyer's remorse at all.8.5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Somehow it feels smaller than the San Andreas title's map. there are no locked areas you can drive around immediately (compare to Vice City's locked bridges)Cons joystick support (which worked in Vice City) is lacking and the keyboard+mouse controls make attacking with the Little Bird gunship impossible while yawing uncontrollably. mouse aiming of weapons is not smooth making precision fire more difficult than it should be. graphics don't feel modern there is a lot of obvious stippling or dithering on most textures. the much bragged about first person camera mode lacks an aim down sight feature.Finally I have to say this plays more like a $30 title $60 is a real robbery vice a PC game one.

2015-06-10,0,0,271,False,Recommended,Playing this game since the first day it came out on the PS3 first day it came out on PC gives me enough time to fairly judge this game.I've been playing Grand Theft Auto for years I recall the basic missons from GTA London and the revolution of third person in GTA III. I can say without a doubt I loved Vice City the best but the game that kept me intereted for years after the release is GTA San Andreas with the multiplayer mod. Today thousands of people still play on SA MP roleplaying racing etc.I belive GTA Online brings along this same feel and is yet to be changed by the hands of brilliant modders. The thing that everyone wants is complete control of the game so that they can make the changes they want if it's to the map to the script etc.I have fun logging on everyday and playing a little bit but I only stay for long durations when I'm playing with friends on Teamspeak. The excessive amount of hackers and trolls today make it somewhat boring but this is expected for every game. Decisisons on how to ban hackers and who they gave an advantage to is difficult to make when it is possible half your player base is bannable.Single player is a fun branch of this magnificent release that brings new generation leveled material to the consumer. It brings back references from old games in the series while accomodating the new blood. I never had performance issues and my own rig is a pretty basic set up running it at ultraOnline is summed up as this if you have friends it'll be fun. Doing hesists with randoms tends to get boring when they die repeatedly because one person left the other behind or hit him with the car. Having /friends/ makes online win.I would suggest this game to others and getting any DLC they put out as Rockstar has been generous with content. This is now my go to game until Fallout comes out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-29,0,0,577,False,Not Recommended,Alright how do I even begin?Grand Theft Auto Five is a game that was once loved and treasured by people worldwide. It had beautiful game design interesting characters and a awesome online. But notice how I m using past tense. Grand Theft Auto was once a good game but those days are long gone.It all started back when Rockstar noticed that more and more people were playing their game. Now obviously Rockstar took advantage of this and released some more DLC. The first one that really caught my eye was the Ill Gotten Gains DLC. It introduced the world of GTA to Yachts a giant boat that players could get. Now while this was all great for its time I would like to point out the fact that Rockstar charges people a minimum of 6 Million in game dollars for one! The most expensive being somewhere around the 13 Million mark. This is absolutely insane since Rockstar has a cash bundle that players can buy to boost their money. The most expensive one being 8 Million dollars for 100 real life dollars! I originaly bought this game at full price and im honestly shocked that Rockstar would even dare to make a deal as ludicrous as that since its basically a game of Who is richer in real life? The people who get this game for sale and recently will be bullied relentlessly by the richer and higher ups who have magic space cannons and flying cars taken straight from Back to the Future!Moving to more recent events I cannot ignore the outbreak of modders and their impact on the community of players in GTA. While there are people who have not relied on modding or external sources for money there are people who with just a few clicks can get everything you ve spent the last year on is pretty unfair. Especialy since those people can just blow you up for no reason just for fun. Basically Rockstar will turn a blind eye as players who have worked on their businesses for months will get everything ruined in seconds. Worst of all Rockstar takes advantage of people s anger and pushes the Microtransactions even further.In conclusion Rockstar created a monotlith of a game that has gone bad. Once it was a masterpiece now it will be forgotten buried under the greed that led to this. If you re interested in buying this game now I recommend you go to the pharmacy first and buy Headache pills and Anti Depressants.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you've played GTA IV recently a lot of the major elements from that game are the same in this game. While I haven't played too much of the single player mode the new three character storyline is very cool and the ability to switch between different playable characters while on mission is neat as well. The biggest bonus of this version of the game is a much expanded online mode. Now with GTA Online you have a customized character (up to three) and a bank account which allows you to do jobs to earn money for cars weapons and apartments. GTA Online has a bit of storyline feel to it with the heist mode where your character and three of your friends help plan setup and pull off various heists for big cash.,Grand Theft Auto V

In all seriousness this is the best version of GTA yet less than 10 seconds to load into GTA O or GTA SP from either or and only about 15seconds to load into the game on first launch. 9/10 loading screens.Graphic settings is amazing you can control pretty much everything about this game. Only drawback is no matter how high it is reflects still look like in cars. Textures and grass/water looks amazing 8/10 graphics. Combat is so much smoother than peasent boxes way easier to aim while driving or just aiming in general is a hell of a lot easier 10/10. Keybindings can be a bit weird but nothing too off. Being able to do anything you want without having to move your hand off of WASD is pretty nice. All in all i give this version of GTA V 9/10 . WAY WAY WAY better than peasent box versions.,Grand Theft Auto V

One for PS3 One for PS4 and now for the PC.I got the game knowing that I would not be able to play online with modding singleplayer but that was alright with me. GTA Online is a toxic place with a horrible community hackers and cheaters as far as the eye can see. The main reason why I paid money for this game again was to mod singleplayer. For awhile all seemed well but than the day came when I updated OpenIV and found that it was being taken down.What right do you have to take down people's hard time and work Take 2? If this is because too many people are modding singleplayer and not playing Online than you can count me out on playing this game ever again. Maybe if you fixed your online community and microstransactions I would play it but nah as long as people are buying Shark Cards you don't give a . you all.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,Single player was enjoyable if not typical for a GTA game in terms of story. Multiplayer while it has it's redeeming qualities is full of hackers and cheaters. Combined with the lack of server browsers and long load times more time is spent searching for a suitable game than anything else.All that aside Take Two's stance against modding is unacceptable leading to them banning OpenIV which does not affect multiplayer and has been developed for a decade now.

If you have lot of friends who play this game or a good mod then you will have money and be high rank but if you dont you are screwed it will take you ages to even get good facility and then you realise how bad it is so you decide to buy shark card buy 2 cars and you are out of money again GG10/10 would buy again (jk its horrible 2 for graphics 1 for singleplayer 1 for some funny moments in the game 4/10 for me),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-27,0,0,189,False,Recommended,Gta used to be amazing. I used to play on a different account but I wanted to start iver hence my low play time. Anyway GTA was amazing but because of multiple horrible updates and modders the game isn't as fun. I mean the new Super vehicles just make it so much easier for griefers and try hards. I mean Ive been stuck in the same place for 30 minutes being spawnee killed before I could use my overpowered obliterate Cannon to kill them. Speaking of that everything is now way to expensive. I mean it costs 500k to use that cannon. Whatever. Luckily I'm rich. I'm not going to get started on modders because you could just watch any gameplay video and find one. It's ridiculous. I don't mind modders that kind their own business but the ones that just kill you over and over are just so annoying. Yeah it may seem like I've been trashing the game but it's still super fun. Although it takes a stuiped amount of grinding to get rich once your rich it's so much fun. Im not gonna explain the fun just watch some BEST WINS AND LOSES COMPLICATIONS videos to understand. Also watch some Doomsday heist videos cause that's a really fun thing to do. To conclude if you have time to spend at least 5 6 hours a week for like a month or two then buy it. If you only have like an hour or two a week this game will bore you to death. Gta is super fun and I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY IT but only if you have some time.

Prices are going up on everything. It's obviously meant to encourage players to buy Shark Cards. I would be fine with it but even if you spent the max ($100) you still wouldn't even come close to owning every car from even just one DLC update. I've grinded out money to the point of insanity and after the release of the Import/Export update I just looked at the $2 million dollar minimum price tag on the cheapest vehicle and quit. The income produced by grinding just isn't enough and I'm not spending $100 on Shark Cards let alone $500 to actually afford everything.

2018-01-07,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,Short version Storymode should be about the story not getting stuck in an endless police spawning mechanic loop making for an overly time consuming chase that kills any story progression. Shouldn't need codes to evade cops at 22% completion when it took way less before that point. (Note I am NOT talking about chases in missions I mean wanted levels from bumping cops or hitting someone.)...Having owned and played every GTA for the Pancaked first game till now I will say I do love the series.... BUT.... while playing solo story mode the police get to be a load of horse crap. Very early game (less than 6% completion) you can opt to litterally just outrun the police and a realistic number of spawned cop cars are on the map which is great and lets you use your skills behind the wheel to evade them. Now get to around 22% and every time you get a 2 star wanted level there will ALWAYS be a cop popping up less than a block infront of you regardless of where you are or where you are going or how often you hit side streets backroads or vross country.Frankly I find it completely crap mechanic that I had hoped wouldn't have followed from previous games (Which tended to abound in the console versions especially...).After an hour of said horse crap I finally said screw it and found the built in 'codes' to remove my wanted level after a mix of james bond and fast/furious driving skill couldn't overcome the crap mechanic... Which litterally screwed the entire experience for me.Do to this crap alone I would rate this a 3/10. No game mechanic should force you in to a never ending loop of crap.,Grand Theft Auto V

I kinda prefer it's Los Santos because the LS displayed in V offers way to many higher end neighborhoods. I always thought that LS is supposed to be a dirty criminal and poor city .. yet V's LS only has 1 2 neighborhood(s) that actually look that way ... LA's South Central/Inglewood is so huge ... Either way thats only criticism on a very high level ... GTA V's map is just fine for it's storyline and GTA Online.Thanks R* for not publishing another GTA IV.,Grand Theft Auto V

Kinda hovers between 71 low to as high as 95 fps in indoor enviornments. I have high shawdows high textures. I cant run the game on very high textures cuz I only have 4098mb of total video ram available and the game requires about 4300mb of video ram for that setting.

2018-02-01,0,0,57,False,Recommended,GTA5 is a series that keeps tweaking and refining their formula to improve with each iteration. The latest entry is no exception. This game manages to put more of everything you ve come to expect from GTA and then fill it up with even more stuff.The driving has never been more fun and varied. The city has never been bigger. The shooting has never been more intense. To top it all off the characters and dialogue in the game are really masterfully done. The campaign is a mix of campy and serious action movies mixed with some heist movies with a dash of comedy. To add even more to the great campaign there are many extras that you may never even experience in the game. Aside from the mini games (darts golf tennis yoga) there are many side quests in the game some of which can take hours to complete! Some of the side quests are secrets to find!You don t have to be a fan of the series to enjoy this game.

Now I can wait until later this year to upgrade my graphics card and still enjoy this amazing port in the meantime. Amazing work Rockstar. Well worth the wait and the $91NZD price tag.

2016-01-04,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,"A Game not more not less1. The Singleplayer as such is a solid expierience though there exist some minor.Story You are playing 3 characters Michael Franklin and Trevor .Michael is a good written Character whose Life focuses mostly on his family life and his relation to Trevor.Trevors Character suffers greatly from being almost one sided crazy and hating everything. Franklin is the Character which stands for a bit of sanity starting with a ""Ghetto"" life and trying to escape this life.2. The biggest problem of this game is by far the so called multiplayer why so called you may ask well here is why i don't consider it a multiplayer though you can interact with others the multiplayer .Suffers of Major problems .First the grinding if you start of you soon realise you need to do heists to get some money and reputation .The problem is The levels are ridiciulos long after a certain point i would say 30. Also at the beginning you start with a pistol seems ok right no. It is not ok Gta Vonline is disgraceful to newcomers .If you are fortunate you will be killed after a few minutes into the Game if you are unfortunate after a few seconds.(If you are on a Full server this isn't rare)The houses itself are acceptable at price but the armored cars which alomst everyone uses are overpriced the first armored car you can get is the armored kuruma which only takes around 525k The next Problem is this is a PC game and rockstar seems to forget one thing about Pc gaming you are not bound to just play the game no.This Game suffers extremely due to easy access to hacking tools .A Gullible Ban system which doesn't even work since a unban tool is available for free if you do some research.This Hacking Problem is also strengthend by the ridiculous pricing of the vehicles. If you own an armored vehicle like the Insurgent with a cal 50 mg you have literaly no enemys except a few tanks. everything else does almost no scratch to this vehicle .The only good thing is that you can collaborate with your friends in online Games .This gets boring really Quickly. Or you can kill opther players and ruin their expierience your choice.The Community is as bad as in Battlefield or Call of Duty.3.The Gameplay is below average for AAA or Average if you count less well known companys.The Gunplay right something i want to point out an Ak has almost no recoil does less damage than a G36 a plastic rifle makes sense right? But gun balancing itself is OK realism is not existant first cars unflip themself if you press d or a .At this point i guess they wanted to make it a more fluent expierence and ignored realism fine that's ok.In case you fly during a Thunder Storm your aircraft is influenced by Wind a good thing.The controls for aircrafts are a pain if you play standard controls you will soon notice that one hand has to deal with the right Number Pad while the other uses w a s d to control the flying. Did i already mention the Cod like recoil? No? oh well then the recoil is non existant .Play a few minutes of Arma or S.T.A.L.K.E.R to have a realistic recoil.The weapon selection is basic most weapons have a similar purpose and are either a bit stronger have a little bit more range.Mostly Full automatic weapons and some Handguns no Bolt action rifles. ( I do not consider the Snipers rifles counting to normal guns )Rockstar considerd paying less money for licences of everything to be a good idea. Final resumeé the balancing of Online Multiplayer is awful not bearable for a AAA company like Rockstar. Average Gameplay Good Story Good Graphics This Game has a good Story acceptable Graphic fidelity and an Awfull Multiplayer.Story is easyly a 7/10Graphics 8/10Multiplayer 3/10Gameplay 5/10If you buy this game for Online you will find yourself cheating if it's just begging for money from other hackers.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-02,0,0,372,False,Recommended,GTA V has an amazing single player story worth playing through it was clearly meant to be more than it turned out to be as it feels like most DLC content to be released for it was shelved or released as online content instead which is extremely sad. As fun as the online can be it is always riddled with small problems and instabilities long loading times hackers and modders. I never expected this game to have so much going for it people even skip the story for the online part altogether missing what great story is there that would add to their online experience later knowing the characters and the world better. Without the single player the game world in my opinion is just a shell made of pretty graphics. Rockstar could easily have added a lot of the vehicles and content for online into single player for people that enjoy a more single player experience like myself. But it seems unlikely that Rockstar would do that at this point in time.If you plan to play the whole package I recommend getting into it. If you're playing purely for online just forget it and play something else that won't rob your time and money.I recommend it for the single player alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

I've had quite a lot of fun with it on console and just recently switched to PC. I can definetely say it's a lot better of an experience. Combine this with mods and you have a game that could last you a bit. Vanilla can get boring however especially the online mode. The heists races and events and all get old rather quickly. Unless you have a good amount of friends who you can play with online isn't as fun.Still a great classic. Good single player and not a broken port like GTA IV.,Grand Theft Auto V

There isn't a lot to complain about with this game. But there are still some.The interface (menus controls etc) are very complicated and leave me wondering if the Rockstar devs ever spend any significant amount of time playing PC games before they set out to make this version.The online is pretty fun its admiteddly not exactly what I had hoped for but its still a good part of the game. The jobs and heists are a lot of fun when you have the right group setup. However that is the catch the community sucks. So predictably finding a group that isn't full of trolls or doesnt have at least one bad apple can be challenging. Thankfully though their is a pretty clever reputation system in place so hopefully the environment for ""friendly"" players will become more enjoyable.The online also has very long load times at the moment though its kinda sporadic. Sometimes your in a job in 30 seconds sometimes it can take a few minutes...Aside from all that for being about 3 weeks old the game is really good and will likely only get better.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game is definietly worth 59.99.The story is great loved every bit of it. 3 characters and interchanging them in different missions was very creative and made the missions feel more dynamic.The gameplay is great with the PC version comes first person and at first it sounded like a gimmick but it really is useful aiming is great while in first person and when getting in a firefight I love to use first person to aim. Driving is very fluid and you can do some great tricks.So far the PC release has been finnicky for starting it up but if it works its great!

2017-06-17,0,0,271,False,Not Recommended,I've had major issues with this game for a while and honestly didn't realize that I hadn't left a review but now I realize might be the perfect time since there's such an uproar and take two really needs to know they ed up.My main issue with this game is the banning system. These imbeciles had a 3 strike policy on bans (I believe it's now 2) that even though I had video proof of a hacker shooting money at me still got me banned (and I'm sure that the hacker didn't). By the way they also can't tell you why you got banned there is no logging system for this apparently so no way to figure out what might be happening and if their system is having issues so they assume their system is infallable. So banned once 10 days later started playing again because I thought it must be a mistake unfortunately not as a few hours later I got slapped with a 30 day ban. I was furious so I contacted Rockstar support to try and figure out what the hell happened and why I kept getting banned. Well let me tell you about the ing amazing crew that Rockstar hired to do support. The first thing you get in response to submitting a ticket is a copy paste response of the email they send you to let you know you've been banned basically saying you're a hacker and bans are non appealable. They then proceed to disallow you from making another ticket for 24hrs. So over the course of a few weeks I finally manage to get ahold of someone who actually listens to me and I show them the video and they wipe the hacked money from my account. Success right? Well no actually. I finish out the rest of the 30 day ban and as had been reading on forums that certain programs running in the background may be detected as hacks. So I turn off evga precision I turn off Shadow play I turn off Windows defender I turn off Logitech gaming software anything and everything I can think of. As soon as I load in. Boom perma banned. I was so done with this game.Fast forward to a few days ago when I just finished rebuilding my PC and decided I wanted to crank up the settings and replay the story mode. All was going fine but I noticed they stopped adding the dlc to single player so I looked for mods for the game to add them in and that's when I stumbled across this whole openIV thing and was thoroughly disgusted with Rockstar and Take Two. I can't recommend this game to anybody. I can't believe that one of my favorite games became this monstrosity. I will never buy another Rockstar game until they right their wrongs and something tells me it's gonna be a while. P.S. here's the video of the hacker shooting money https //youtu.be/XcinCFe9sC0P.P.S. I'm sure there's mistakes galore in this since I'm writing it on my phone so I apologize in advance.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,GTA V seemed like a fun game when I got it. It was wonderful when I played it however there were many problems. Lagged out my PC. It was an efficiency build but I set the game to the lowest settings. It lagged the least when I was in buildings but when driving (the point to the game) it lagged HARD. Had what could only be considered junkware in it. After I removed the game Rockstar Social was still on it. It took up over half of my hardrive. Has terrible ethics. I played with mods sometimes and the Tsunami Mod was a blast. Rockstar takes away mods? I tanks away my trust for them. Also the iFruit app takes up so much space as well. Doesn't care about hacking. I haven't been banned by those hackers that teleport you around the map but there are hackers everywhere online. Don't even get me started about the scamming community.In conclusion stay away from GTA unless you like fat cats who expect YOU to charge $60.00 for a negative experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

To buy one thing from a pack you either need to buy $4 000 000 worth of ingame cash or grind for hours upon hours. You could find money lobbies but they're hit and miss and could land you a ban.

2016-11-25,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,"***UPDATE*****************************************************************************************I take it back. While this game is incredible in a general sense they actually have banned many MANY innocent people. The support is nonexistent and they force you into public lobbies that are full of cheaters in order to do any of the new content. These cheaters can do everything from impersonating you to get you banned to taking all your money away. I have no incentive to come back because I could lose everything I've worked and paid for in one session due to the negligence of the people supporting the game.The decision to not have dedicated servers and therefore no decent anticheat has ruined possibly the best game I've ever played. Then compound that with forcing you to play with cheaters to do any new content and it becomes a heartbreaking mess.******************************************************************************************************This is one of the best most detailed games to come out in recent memory. It is definitely worth the money.I only really have two negative things to say about it. One is that money is slow to acquire in online play and vehicles/houses/etc are really expensive. This is of course intended to sell shark cards. Two is that online public servers very often have cheaters in them and R* did very little for a long time to combat them. However recently they have started to crack down somewhat at least on the money cheaters.Because of this crackdown many people have recently claimed to have been banned falsely from GTA online. While false positives may be possible I suspect some of these ""false"" bans are for legitimate reasons that the players may not have known about. Any number of bad behaviors can get you banned outside of using actual cheat programs. If you are on the fence about buying the game you shouldn't need to worry about a ban if you do the following (NOTE this is just my opinion after having 550 hours played I could definitely be wrong) Don't cheat. This one is obvious.Don't have people power level you or get you ""quick"" money. They will use cheats/exploits and get you banned. This one is also obvious.Don't use anything that modifies the game files while you are connected to R*'s servers. One common mod that got people banned early on was a mod that changed their FOV. While this seems innocent it is against the TOS. If you use single player mods you need to do some special things to keep from them being active during multiplayer. You'll need to google that and use them at your own risk.Don't purposely gain money/levels from someone who is obviously cheating. If another player is firing millions of dollars at you out of a chain gun instantly leveling you up etc leave the session and don't spend it. Report it to R*. I have a friend who had a hacker dump a small amount of money on him and he spent it. He got a two week ban months later.Don't exploit. If you find something in game that lets you gain experience or money at a much higher rate than normal methods don't keep using it. This includes player created game modes.Don't be horrifically offensive to other players. Blowing people up is fine but try to contain any bigoted tirades.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-31,0,0,170,False,Recommended,"I apologize if my review is a little long winded but I had alot to talk about particularly my concerns about Grand Theft Auto Online. SummaryGrand Theft Auto V is the third installment (after Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City and Grand Theft Auto IV) in the HD Universe era. The story is about two bank robbers named Michael De Santa and Trevor Phillips. After a failed robbery attempt in North Yankton they seperate from each other and relocate to Los Santos. Events in the game unfold after Michael pulls down a Mexican Drug Lord's house and he is forced to rob a Jewellery Store with his new protege Franklin Clinton. Initially believing Micheal to be dead Trevor realizes that Michael is still alive and leaves Blaine County to confront Michael in Los Santos. The trio then build up their resources in order to do ""The Big One"" which is to raid the Union Depository.When I saw the gameplay trailers for Grand Theft Auto V the gameplay reminded me a bit of Max Payne 3 except you don't shootdodge and you don't have the ability to slow down time except for Michael being able to slow down time as his special ability. The narrative flows very well the vehicles are easy to handle and the three characters are very easy to connect to. My personal favorite is Trevor because of how bat crazy he is. Overall I believe the Campaign was enjoyable and I'd play it again in a heartbeat.The multiplayer aspect (Grand Theft Auto Online) however is completely ing poor. Granted I initially liked the idea of the type of concepts they put into the multiplayer you know being able to pay for your weapons vehicles and property but the idea of Grand Theft Auto Online and the features that came with it wasn't executed very well at all and as a result you have this big gigantic bloated mess. You have servers that you connect to that are very low quality and poor even when you have high speed internet. It should NEVER be a chore to find a fully functional lobby with low amounts of ping. Another issue I have with Grand Theft Auto Online is the ""bad sport"" system. What this does is that if you are being a bad sport you get put into a bad sport lobby and you would be unable to play with friends who don't have the bad sport status and if you blow up other players vehicles you are automatically labelled as a bad sport and you go to a bad sport lobby. I'm sorry if it's an offence to blow up the vehicles of attacking players then what the is the point of having anti vehicle weapons such as Rocket Launchers Sticky Bombs and Miniguns? Not using anti vehicle weapons against another player who is attacking me whilst driving a vehicle would put me and other players at a huge disadvantage. Not only that but blowing up the vehicles of other players was allowed in Grand Theft Auto IV EFLC and previous installments in the 3D Universe. Just the fact that you can't blow up hostile vehicles gives a very big indicator that a big componet is missing from the core game. I know this is something that Rockstar can't fix but the community is so polluted with toxicity. A lot of players would rather be instead of being cooperative. I also keep hearing talks about ""Oh 1 m so going to haxor u"" and people discussing how to hack the game. For those types of people I have a suggestion Play the game the way it's mean't to be played!. Other than those types of people a lot are antisocial and they also make death threats. Nobody wants a community this toxic but unfortunately it still happens. Next up is microtransactions. I strongly condemn any publisher or developer if they use microtransactions. The Microtransactions that GTA Online uses are Shark Cards. This allows you to spend real money to get in game money. If you are like me and you won't purchase any microtransactions you'll notice that you will have a very hard and long time to progress your character buy some cool and purchase expensive properties. I feel that Rockstar is putting a very strong emphasis on Shark Cards and it doesn't allow players who just want to play the game the way it's mean't to be to progress as fast as those who purchase Shark Cards. This is a toxic game development practice that needs to stop as it's not good for the game industry at all. Not only that but if you buy Shark Cards it can be easily manipulated by hackers and cheaters which leads to my next issue and this is the one that has stopped me from playing Grand Theft Auto Online all together. With a multiplayer that has microtransactions and has an MMO type of ranking system you would think that Rockstar would be able to include decent anti cheat software. But duh no! They didn't include anything to combat cheating at all. The only thing that they included was a report system and they encourage players to get a ticket with Rockstar Support and contact them. Most of the time these reports don't do much to fight cheaters who would exploit. They just continue doing what they are doing and go on with their merry day. At least Garry's Mod and other Source games have the VAC Anti Cheat to keep cheaters off of multiplayer why not include something like that Rockstar? The game has been out for three years and Rockstar still doesn't have anything decent to defend their own servers. Lately I've heard that exploiters can now manipulate other player's progress not just their in game money and weapons anymore. They can take away your vehicles your apartments they can also derank you and they can prevent you from leaving a game session. I feel that GTA Online is now unplayable and it is not worth it to play it but I don't think Rockstar seems to give a because they would rather profit from Shark Cards rather than create a multiplayer mode that is safe sustainable and fun to play on. I am so glad I stopped playing online.Pros+Nice Open World.+Story narrative flows well.+Interesting Characters.+Fast and Fluid gameplay.Cons No Anti Cheat system. The Bad Sport system is severely flawed. Microtransactions are included in GTA Online. The community is toxic. Poor quality game servers. Terrible multiplayer. Johnny Klebitz could of had a bigger role.ConclusionI will admit the single player is still fun to play and this is a great game and I am still going to recommend this but the multiplayer makes this very hard for me to recommend. Due to this I cannot in good conscience agree that this would be eligible to be a game of the year. I have heard that Rockstar is already in the process of making Grand Theft Auto VI. They better fix their multiplayer for the next installment if they expect to keep the franchise profitable and to keep the trust of their fans. I'd say buy this when the game becomes cheaper because at it's current price you aren't getting a very good deal.",Grand Theft Auto V

Some transitions are very sudden it feels like the game was meant to be much longer and cuts where made. Still took 35 hrs to finish one play though. The games controls can show you keyboard controls when using a game pad if for example on the Steam controller you set up your trackpads to be a mouse rather than a joystick. It creates a super confusing interface. Would be nice to just set what instruction set you want. Parts of the game are really only enjoyable after completing the last major mission when you have millions of dollars. If you use a car that is not your characters default car on a mission it will often simply disappear after missions. It makes you feel ripped off if you tricked it out. It would be nice to be able to just change the characters main vehicle on demand. Some parts of the game are just fluff like the stock market.

2018-10-20,0,0,320,False,Recommended,This game is pretty fun and all the mods for it are amazing. Getting a new PC just to be able to mod it. I got it for $30 which is well worth it ($60 is a bit much). Very fun online and singleplayer modes. I can always find something new to do.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-08,0,0,190,False,Recommended,It was good at first. but now the only way you could be able to afford most of the cars and whatever else there is would be to grind and once you do after many failed attempts. the next update comes with more expensive items just creating an unnecessary lift in difficulty and incentivizing the purchase of shark cards by also not allowing multiplayer cars houses or things of the sort to be bought or allowed in single player. yes I do understand that they need revenue but wouldn't it have been more effective to make GTA online its own entity and then not force people to pay for a game they won't play while wasting their money.Edit with what i have put before the sale price for 19.97 seema much more reasonalbe but i would prefer for it to stay at the price since even though it is an old game none of the online features such as cars and apartments are usable in singleplayer without the use of mods. In genral this is a good game. poor use of marketing the game with keeping the same price and and adding small content over time but still a good game. So if you plan on buying the game make sure to get it on sale so it has better value to you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-13,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Its a great game but its hard to say if i can reccomend this game and heres why The single player experience is superb. Filled with the right ammounts of serious drama comedy and much more. With beautiful graphics even on low to mid tier hardware the cutscenes make the game look like a movie. You'll enjoy the lengthy activities especially if you're a completionist. Mod support is decent but not needed at all to have a great experience. The attention to detail makes this game rival games of even other genres as well. Sadly however thats where my praise ends. The game's multiplayer is the wild west with pay to win microtransactons and pay to do anything at all honestly. 2k seems to put more effort into the multiplayer DLC rather than put anymore effort into the games single player. There was even once plans for single player DLC however 2k figured theyd profit off of multiplayer DLC. Normally I wouldnt be bothered by this but the multiplayer is a shared open world enviroment where if you spend money on these microtransactions mind you these are very very expensive microtransactions you wont have much fun especially doing the multiplayer co op missons. Theres plenty of other games like this that will give you as much if not more of a fun experience without these malicious microtransactions blocking your paths of having fun. To a dedicated gamer who's adapted to this kind of market yes i can reccomend it but thats a very small reccomendation. To the average consumer/gamer which is what this review is intended towards I would not reccomend it even for its discounted price even if you can find it cheaper elsewhere.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-13,0,0,54,False,Recommended,This is Grand Theft Auto! Just like many Grand Theft Auto's before fun to play in a rich and open world full of things to see and do. The story line albeit short is fun to play. The 3 characters are well built and some of the missions are brilliant especially the heists and car chases. Sometime it feels like you are playing in a bank robbery Hollywood movie. Fun!If you are into the story line it's too short for paying full price so buy this game on discount.I cannot talk for the online part because I do not see value in it.,Grand Theft Auto V
