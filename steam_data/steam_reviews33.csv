I do like how they added a new map but literally I play it every game and it's very annoying. The new weapons are okayish but it's always good to balance the weapons out for certain situations where they excel and have an advantage.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,Upon playing this game for around 40 hours I honestly can't recommend this game. Perhaps it is the servers or glitches/bugs or poor optimization. Or perhaps this just isn't my type of game. I am in dire need of the return of a team based tps like SOCOM. You loot for 10 minutes. You run/walk/drive your way to the circle. You wait a few more minutes being patient. Then you get your head blown off 25 minutes later and 25 minutes wasted. Bring back SOCOM on the Playstation 4 with a Dualshock and I will invest thousands and thousands of hours into it. This game just isn't for me. (,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-15,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,"The problem with PUBG on PC from the point of view of a casual gamer.Let me start by saying that I'm just a ""casual"" gamer not a hardcore competitive gamer (I haven't played any online competitive games prior to the battle royale craze). I'll also say that I enjoy the battle royale game format I play PUBG on mobile and I'm fairly good at it (I win sometimes not all the time and I average around 3 4 kills per game).But unfortunately I just can't recommend the PC game. Here's why The simple problem is the type of gamers that you get on PC they tend to be experienced competitive gamers with all the expensive gaming gear.I find that playing on PC has two main problems one people just seem to know where you are (somehow they just do). Most of the time I get killed by people I haven't even seen. I can be hiding in a building not making a sound for 5 minutes and someone will throw a grenade through the window (this has happened to me many times).The second problem on PC is the accuracy that players have most of the time I can barely get one shot off at someone before they have headshotted me. I have popped out from behind a wall and opened up at someone at point blank range on full auto and they still somehow managed to kill me with a single headshot. Again this has happened many times.(To those who will say that my game strategy must be bad I play the same way on PC as I do on mobile which I'm fairly decent at.)Don't even bother trying to play PUBG on PC with an Xbox Controller (which I used to do) you will just get wiped out very badly. I bougt a proper Corsair gaming mouse (12 000 DPI) which admittedly makes long range shots slightly easier but I still can't seem to fire more than one shot at somone before they have headshotted me. I don't even like playing with KBM I prefer a controller but there's just no way you can play with a controller against KBM players.And there really are a lot of cheaters on PC. I'd heard there were but I can confirm it is indeed true. I report a lot of players for suspected cheating and literally almost every time I log into the game I see a message telling me that someone I reported has been banned for cheating.I've been playing on PC for four months now and I've not even got a single win. It's got to the point where I class myself as doing well if I can just land and find a gun. And sometimes I can't even do that I've been shot and killed on the chute before no kidding.I'm seriously considering uninstalling and deleting the game now and buying a console instead just so that I won't have to play against the cheaters and KBM noscopers.What is needed is matchmaking based on skill level and controller type so that players with similar stats play together and controller/KBM players are kept separate. Apparently this is just too complicated to implement though.If you want to play competitive games on PC firstly you're going to need all the expensive gear mechanical keyboard with macro keys high DPI mouse headset with virtual 7.1 surround sound etc high refresh rate monitor etc. (and of course an expensive PC). And on top of that you're going to need years of experience and practice before you get to be anywhere near good.So my recommendation is that if you're just a casual gamer like me and you want to play PUBG play it on console or mobile not PC.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,334,True,Recommended,"The game is laggy buggy badly optimized and terrible overall but still one of the greatest ones I've ever played.I don't even know when was the last time I enjoyed a game as much as PUBG. It feels bad when you bug into a wall and can't get out or your opponent kills you while you're behind a tree but these ""phenomena"" are very very rare.The reason for the mixed reviews is that multiple million people play this game and the ones who have a problem are loader than the ones who don't. Lately big companies like EA are milking people for DLCs and additional content that should have been included in the game. In PUBG this is not the case. You get what you pay for. A ****ing big map or rather two a dozen guns vehicles and 99 opponents. No trick anywhere. The feeling when you reach top 10 and hear an AWM boom ing to your left your heart beating like Mayweather simply gives an undescribable feeling which alone justifies the 30 cost. When you're playing with your buddies is when gameplay gets really great. What's better than shooting around in a 8km x 8km map? Shooting around as a team of 4 while yelling at each other that HE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WHY CAN'T YOU HIT HIM YOU PLEB.ConclusionThis is an overall good game with optimization issues.

2017-11-14,0,0,409,False,Not Recommended,I have changed my mind about this game. A while ago I saw this game as a fun game that could grow into something amazing. Now I see that I was wrong. In my opinion this game is no longer enjoyable solo and barely fun with squads. One reason this game sucks is because it is just a repeat every single game. You join a game you deploy you get loot you survive a little then you either win nothing or die. When you die towards the end it's a punch in the face. You wasted 15 20 minutes doing nothing to barely something then you lose it all. However repeating action is something that occurs in every fps game but I find in pubg it feels exactly the same every time. Another reason is the greedy devs. When the game started the devs thought their game wouldn't amount to anything but now that it has the devs have become the devil child of EA and Activision. Some of the microtransaction are so stupid. The third reason is the god awful servers. I couldn't tell you the amount of times I have died because of the laggy servers. I've had moments when I get shot I take cover then I just die. Then the deathcam is no help because the deathcam is just as bad as the servers. I have to say pubg was a great game at one point but now its just pure garbage. I am very disappointed with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,427,True,Recommended,This game is nowhere near perfect and its current mixed reviews rating is completely fair. However I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game and it is pretty fun at times. There are some frustrating mechanics and bugs that need to be tweaked though (e.g. losing too much health after getting out of vehicles that are slowing to a stop brakes in cars being a bit buggy). Also the servers (at least in Oceania) still lag every few games and I'm still frequently prompted with the 'too many logins' alert all the time.This game gets a whole lot better when played with friends compared to playing alone. I've had more memorable moments looting with friends than actually engaging in gunfights with enemies. There's a good variety of guns to use now and the scarcity of rarer items on the map seems to be pretty well balanced. The points reward system is also a nice incentive to keep people playing however the amount gained from coming anywhere but top 3 in squad matches is pretty poor. Also the developers overwriting their original decision to not have micro transactions in early access is also pretty sketchy.Overall this is a pretty enjoyable game that needs a fair bit of work done to it if the developers want to keep the game alive. Based on the current state of the game I wouldn't be surprised if a similar more polished game comes along over the next 12 months and steals the spotlight completely.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-19,0,0,385,True,Not Recommended,Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. It's fun and addictive unless you have any but high end computer and even then the technical and server issues often make it completely unplayable. The game releases tomorrow and as of now the test server (the one that will be released in some hours as the real deal) has a build that crashes dozens of times in a row for a significant portion of players and no fix seems to be in sight. Even if you are lucky enough to not experience this a lot (you will and I guarantee YOU WILL experience some crashes) the rubber banding missing textures invisible obstacles impossible damage outcomes and piles upon piles of other bugs will surely ruin the gaming experience for you and soon make the whole ordeal sour.3/10 that is if it actually runs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The cover caught my attention a badass dude walking away from an explosion me vs. 99 other players every man for themselves my WWE fanboy side screech out Royal Rumble vibes and I was instantly bought it. The first 100 hours was a pain I felt life was judging my choice of playing this game sacrificing my time my family and career all for a chicken dinner. I still haven't won a damn chicken in Solo either I'm really unlucky or I'm bad at the game and need to ""get good."" Nope getting good watching ""how to"" and ""Tip &amp Tricks"" youtube videos about PUBG isn't going to make you a pro neither playing over 300 hours will or even streaming the damn game and having your viewers witness you making either top 20 5 place (if you did win 1st good on you). Also never get the hype on a game never.This game can be addicting and I don't mean a good way maybe it's the trends that society keep pushing us to be the best but from what I learn in this game. You really need to be lucky to win. You need to have the luck to land somewhere that has guns you can pick up instantly so you can shoot and kill first and have a better chance of winning cause you're still alive. You need to have the luck not to join a server with a hacker that doesn't one shot kill you out of nowhere. You need to have the luck for PUBG to favor your spot so blue zone doesn't screw up your plan of survival so you don't have to run in the middle of the field and hope you don't get blaze assaults from campers. You need to have the luck to be paired up with decent teammates communication is critical but 70% I still end up with Chinese players and they can sometimes be a and kill me for not speaking their language. If life is a gamble then me I'm now afraid to go outside.Features I beg the blue hole company to do Add a report button after watching deathcam footage Pubg_help is zero helpful. Have a mute button on selective players. Revel all 100 players' names on the server so I can find out who the is mic spamming. If chinse players want to play on the NA servers especially for squad pair them up and leave it as so. Not being racist I know they want to enjoy the game as much as I do Let them have their group and let me have mine. Allow BP to obtain keys I don't want another CS GO lotto scam going on. Add a ""Add friend"" button I personally find the ""follow"" feature a bit creepy someone whom I'm not friends on steam added me to his team and asked me ""Do you remember me?"" Then he started mic spamming and it took me a while to find the leave group button Move the ""Leave Group"" somewhere easy to find. Tweak the vehicle driving mechanics it's getting there some cars still flip and glitch but its finally getting there Adjust the terrains on the maps all of them. Overal It'll take a while to get used to playing PUBG for beginners you'll either hate it or enjoy playing with friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,515,False,Not Recommended,As much as I love this game the hacking in it has gotten worse and worse. Bluehole or whoever runs this sh*t needs to build a software program that runs all types of hacks out there and picks up on them. It's not like they don't have the damn money to do it. Last couple games I've played I've been killed with snippers or M16 with headshots from 1000 yards away or longer. After reviewing the kill cam there is no possible way half of the hits could have hit me. You can clearly see the aimbots when they look threw their scopes and there is no swaying in there movement also. every time I look down a scope I get sway none of this bs steady hand sh*t. I've also noticed that half the players that end up killing me this way or from the Asian community I feel you guys should fix it where everyone plays on their dedicated server region. I'm tired of going into games where it is riddled by people who can't one comunicate with you at all or they just straight up hack. Eithere this game gets fixed soon or your gonna lose a lot of good people out there that actally enjoy this game. And before anyone says anything smart. No I'm not the greatest at the game but I'm also not that sh*tty at it either. So to the PUBG corporation you guys really need to work on a system that will band these hackers or at least get rid of a majority of them. If I wanted this type of hacking I'd go play COD suck a**.

The game is in early access and not optimized well so if you have a lower end computer I would recomend some upgrades or waiting. I personaly run a Amd 6300 overclocked to 4.2 and a xfx 470 and i have 16 gb of ram. I run the game very well considering.I see a lot of negativity about people with 1080's that are struggling. Love to know what cpus they are running. Probably a lot of bottlenecking going on. As far as the gameplay fantastic and a great team to back it up. I look forward to the final product in 6 months.Edit I no longer recomend this game. The game was a blast to play in Alpha Beta was fun as well but thats when it finally started going down hill. The game has been out of early access for a while now as in fully released game. It feels like a early Beta build. Loads of bugs including reloaded shotgun wont fire. Imbalanced weapons with aim punch imbalanced damage poor hitboxes poor car mechanics. FPS drops like crazy. This game seems to get worse and worse yet they add more maps and more skins and bullcrap that does not improve upon the base game that is so flawed what soever.

2018-07-01,0,0,716,False,Not Recommended,"Utterly trash of a game. And thats coming from someone who played it for more than 600 hours. Ever since the beginning the servers were always ily optimised for the game due to its enormous size with 100 players in it but nothing was ever done to help improve the quality of the gameplay and server. Instead the developers chose to push out aesthetics that doesnt even matter in the game and t crates to milk the living daylight out of this game. I will admit that this game is currently the best Battle royale game out there right now but due its sketchy developers and shady way of running the game its player base has been on a downward spiral over the years. Now with the new updates of supposedly ""improvement"" of the FPS i've been hard crashing every 5 minutes in the game. I even thought its my GPU's fault so i went to buy a whole new GPU to test it out and while i got improvement in FPS my game still crashes extremely frequently. The guys over at BlueBalls will not give a about the actual quality of the game until everyone is sick and tired of the completely unforgivable that we as the players are going through and finally boycotting this ass game. Hell maybe once they are finally done with milking the out of this game they would just leave it to rot and create new games and judging by the way this game is ultimately heading to self destruction i wouldn't be too surprised if that was the case.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,1497,False,Not Recommended,The game was once the best battle royal out there but that only lasted a couple of months. Fortnight took that title off them quick and it feels more finished and plays much better. The developers seem like they don't know what they are doing and just keep trying to figure out ways to rip people off instead of learning how to use unreal engine. Can not recomend this game because in reality with the money they have made there is not much to show for it the game is still broken and feels worse than an early access game. Oh and there is a lot of hackers keeping this game alive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,179,False,Not Recommended,I can say for sure that I will never play this game again.In the beginning the game looked very promising but now it's just a disaster.Instead of fixing bugs or performance issues the developers are rather implementing new skins and new lootboxes. First there was just on key to unlock boxes which was okay I guess but now you have to buy specific keys to open specific lootboxes with real money.And if that wasn't enough you can now buy a so called Event Pass which gives you instant access to specific clothes and skins. You can also gain EXP through playing the game. If you reach a specific level you simply unlock stuff. Sounds good right? Yeah if there wasn't a stupid level cap which resets daily. I mean come the f*ck on! If someone pays for this stupid pass and plays a lot why in the hell limit the amount of level ups he can get?!?In summery the future of PUBG looks really dark. A lot of other developers are making similar and better games and it's just a matter of time before everyone stops playing this everlasting Alpha version of a game. The developers showed once more that they simply don't care about their fans and that they are just in it for the money. They try to get every last penny out of this game because they know that at one point everyone will have left for a game of one of their competitors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,667,False,Recommended,Gee what can I say PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a fun game that is plagued by issues that the developers have yet to address in its current state its very unoptimized server issues low variable tickrate 5 40 tick max(ever try to pick up a gun and it lags this is the reason why) no options for localized play(lan) ping limit or regional locking ( you will literaly play with people from all over the planet speaking of which our friends in the east (CHINA!!!) more often than not tend to use cheats to level the playing field use open mics dispite the language gap and introduce massive spikes and griefing on the us server due to playing in another country now im not saying everyone in China cheats but as a matter of facts its not frowed upon over there to use these methods in gaming but thats neither here or there back to PubG. Potenitally one of the best games ever if the framework(server issues) get resolved a ping limit is introduced(no more than 120) along with more centralized servers for every region ( e.g us east us centeral us west ) dont get me wrong these issues aside its an amazing game lots of fun stories with friends its always a good time until your reminded of these things mentioned I have faith the devs will fix these issues over a period of time just not in the time desired but overall i recommend this game to anyone just make sure you have a halfway decent rig otherwise you will have issues,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So what i want to say is in this game you are never save never know if somebody is scoping you. Its a lot about tactics and luck to find good loot. Only thing that is bad about this game is its price because 30 euro for multyplayer battle royale game is too much. I know it is still in early acces but games like rust have much more content for better price. Oh and i almost forgot about Lags and on lower spec. computers texture mish mash mostly on houses. but still this is a great game and i recomend it.That was what i wrote around 3 months ago. Now the game is out and its buggy as hell. Its just unfinished. Do i have to say more ?When in early acecess 8/10Now 5/10 is max i can give it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In all honesty the engine (and servers) are horrible way below the standard of most of todays games. It is pretty terrible technically speaking. Where it really caught me though was the fun squad based gameplay fun tactical shootouts and skirmishes. I've played over 100 hours and will continue to play despite its flaws.

2017-12-22,0,0,103,False,Recommended,"I have one thing to report for fixing Starting the game leaves me stuck on a black screen but the game loads fine after I hit any button on my keyboard. Running Windows 7 with MSI Z97S motherboard Intel i5 4440 and Radeon R7 370 (outdated tech). Even with my outdated tech I still get solid 45fps can be 60 sometimes if I drop all settings.This game runs much better on my computer after the 1.0 patch. I can run higher graphics settings and still get more fps than before. Th gun control feels a lot more polished as well and the audio is perceptively better for me now with surround sound headphones. There was longer loading times at first but that seems to have fixed itself. The new map is awesome! Less hacker sitings than before so far even though I still get paired with groups of Chinese/Koreans/I don't even know what they are saying teams when playing random squad mode and I would suggest the devs region lock the severs... problem is if someone is using a VPN (like most of China and a few other countries) they can still log into any sever they want and appear to be from that country. Not really an obvious way for anyone to fix that problem... but that is the wonder and magic of VPNs. So far I can only understand some of the negative reviews I have read specifically the ones that say they either can't load the game or they have net lag / really long loading time. It would help if you report your specs but instead you all continue to gripe without giving any info It's completely useless without info. Not everyone has your problem so it is most likely related to your PCs. Also if you are complaining about aspecs of the gamemode itself battle royale then don't buy games that say ""Battle Royale"" In there description. If you don't like 20 30 minute rounds of survival deathmatch then go back to CS GO! Is that hard to figure out?? If I don't like MMOs I'm not going to buy an MMO and then say in the review ""This game is stupid why can't I have a single player version?"" *Facepalm* All in all one of my favorite shooters being developed and a great battle royale!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,345,False,Recommended,This is a great game but the major problems that exist are probably not going to be fixed not because the PUBG team doesn't want to fix them but because they revolve around massive amounts of players using the game at the same time. This mainly includes server lag and hosting issues. There are invisible objects in the new map that I've found driving up mountains in cars that don't affect player entities. They do affect bikes trucks and minibuses. This is an example of a problem that just comes with having such a massive map and not enough testing to fix all of the little problems. As for the gameplay itself I would recommend PUBG to GROUPS of friends. Playing by yourself isn't anywhere near as much fun as going for a backflip in a bike in the final circle with a friend stuck on the back who can't get off. The guns handle well but it can be hard to get used to the shooting as there isn't anywhere to really practice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,349,False,Not Recommended,Post Early Access and this game is riddled with just as many bugs as it was three months ago. The game has gotten progressively worse and server lag makes the start of a match unplayable. The game itself is a great concept and is fun when it briefly works but bullet registration parachute deployment server lag awful crate system and hackers make maybe 1/10 matches enjoyable. Battle Eye is probably the worst anti cheat you could have for a game and no region lock allows hackers from China to flood NA servers and ruin the experience for everyone. Hit registration is the worst of any game I have ever played as you can have your sights right on the target and miss simply because either the bullet never registered or the server lag and de synced from client side that to the server you weren't even aiming close. Vehicle controls were ruined during official release and the can just randomly cause damage and stop if you hit a bump in a weird way. Also at the start of matches you can randomly take damage from landing somewhere and the delay for falling out of your parachute makes the experience feel broken and out of place. The parachute deployment has gotten worse with time rather than better making the start of matches even more unplayable. This game is And Blue Ball is likely not going to make it better. They have already milked so muching ing money off of it its ridiculous. Do not give them more money until the game is completely playable because in its current state it isn't.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is very nice that the devs added the death cam to the game thus way I know I was killed unfairly. It just blows that I have to deal with such a thing and I hope I am not the only one saying this cause this is happening way to much.

2018-01-05,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,My apologies if I didn't give this game enough time to play but I don't see the point of going on. The first game I had one of my teammates drove up to me shot me then shot me again (killing me). The second game I couldn't understand anyone (they spoke a different language). The third game was more fair but still not enjoyable.If I am going to be intentionally teamkilled on the first game why should I keep playing? If I can't understand my teammates and therefore am unable to communicate with them effectively what's the point of trying to learn from/with others in squads? Overall I don't reccomend this because I can respect dying from an enemy but from your own team?Edit I tried a 4th game just to see if I overlooked anything (in squads) and it seems like I didn't. Everyont spoke a different language and this one teammate killed me revived me killed me revived me and the cycle went on. He kept saying things that I couldn't understand so I dropped everything on the ground and he still teamkilled me. I really don't see the point of playing this game (in squads at least) when half of your deaths aren't even from the enemy they are from your teammates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,This was my 100% favourite game of 2017 but now with the recent update they made changes to the lootcrate system. So you can earn the points through playing so you can get lootcrates and as someone who doesn't get to play often I get maybe 2 a week. However with the new update you can now get Desperado crates and such which once you've spent your points randomly getting you can't actualy unlock instead you have to pay actual real life money to unlock the crates. This was not part of the system when I downloaded the game and frankly I feel ripped off. Had I known this was going to be part of the rewards mix I never would've bought the game it's greedy and soul less.

Oh and 1 more thing my pc is pure garbage i mean its not the worst i had one even worse before AND I COULD STILL PLAY IT dont come at me saying ""oh the lag fps are so bad"" playing at 60 fps is ing amazing u dont notice any lag or fps i understand if u want to feel more smooth but with 60 u no longer lag i play with like 30 prob and i feel good of course it lags a bit and stuff but its normal since my pc is garbage stop crying about the fps and just lower the graphics to low and u will be able to play it if u cant with that im sorry but your pc is like 15 years old like my old one was so just buy a decent one and you're ready to go. Another reason for bad reviews camping someone that uses this as an excuse is actually stupid im sorry the one who camps is the player not the game the game is not at fault and camping is a tactic even if you don't like it just learn how to deal with it. ""my biggest mistake was buying this game on alpha/beta it has so many bugs!"" ... its just as you said YOU bought the game KNOWING it was early alpha/beta OF COURSE it has bugs ITS ALPHA like what???? ur job is to report those bugs and have them fixed by the pubg team but tbh i myself haven't seen any bugs except for one that would happen when you're sprinting with a he grenade out and looking to the left and your guy would look but it was fixed soon after no major bugs nothing nothing like what i saw people talking about ""invisible walls"" i never saw 1 invisible wall on pubg i have no idea wtf hes talking about. Now the reasons behind the good reviews The game is amazing for some reason you just love the fact that you're playing among another 99 people to survive in a small island and that makes u excited it makes your heart beat faster it has a very tactical gameplay since u have to think the better locations not just for looting but the best locations u should go through to get to the final circle without risking to loose best places for shooting with cover everything. As far as i've seen there are also most no bugs and if there are bugs it normal its early alpha u bought the game knowing it was early alpha. Another reason the devs actually want the game to go somewhere in just 8 months of develpment this game looks more completed than games like DayZ which has been in early alpha for 4 years the devs of pubg have prooved to us that they actually keep up with what they say the fps have improved since it was released they released a promised new map (well it wasn't released into the full game yet its just later today) and i actually believe in their capabilities to make this an amazing game. So now we reach the conclusion FPS could be much better but they the game is playable (as i said my pc is garbage and i can play it decently well) and the fps are going to be improved later when they have everything they want in the game done. Hackers personally i haven't seen any hackers but ok i guess some people are just salty. The game has hackers yes like every other game but from what i've seen its rare to find one. Bugs this should'nt even be in here the game is EARLY ALPHA YOU BOUGHT IT KNOWING it was EARLY ALPHA of COURSE it HAS BUGS THAT'S WHY ITS IN ALPHA! But from my experience there are basicly no bugs or very rare ones to happen and if they do happen just report them to the pubg team. The game is amazing it has amazing graphics good maps and it has a tactical side to it it's fun to play the game with friends. This game makes your heart beat faster with it's unique battleroyale experience (oh and btw h1z1's battleroyoale took the idea from PlayerUnknown the mind behind pubg) The devs actually want to do something with this game i personally trust the devs i dont ask everyone to trust them but i do i believe that they can go far with this game and they know it too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-14,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,Good game with quite the potential to be special. However after some time playing the game feels pretty meh. The upcoming map is good in my opinion. Yes there are some cheater in the game but it's not as rampant as people say though it would be very annoying if you encounter one.Recommend if you have friends to play with.If you play by yourself it will become a bit boring after 100+ hoursEdit July 2018Nvm I can never get good in this gameI prefer the older PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,0,0,389,False,Recommended,Give it a shot I can't say every negative review here is false. People are just done with it. I get it cause this game has been in the development since a long time and still it has the dsync issues hackers poor optimization poor hitreg and bugs with new updates (which does get resolved kinda quickly) We really want this game to be way better than this. It's not built on UE4 and hence it's perfomance is significantly worse. The wrong company made the right game and that is exactly why these issues exist. The fix pubg campaign is working. I know a lot of people would disagree to it but they probably are too arrogant to notice. There is a significant drop in the number of hackers and aimbotters. I did stumbled upon an aimbotter like yesterday and I reported him. Today I started the game and got the message that he was banned. Battleye anticheat is probably the best I have ever seen since I know how brutal it is in Rainbow six siege.Although pubg also has battleye but it doesn't seem to work that well at all. WE DESERVE that kind of anti cheat and it's probably in the works. They are also adding another anti cheat to the game. If you are wondering to buy the game I would say it deserves a chance. Yeah it's been a long time already but better late than never. THE fix pubg campign ends by december I guess and we shall see where it leads us to.

The final phase of it is extremely blood rushing and it gives you a huge feeling of accomplishment after winning it. The worst part of the game is the infinite Chinese players spamming words in all chat. Chinese players are invading every server and they have the largest grp of cheaters as well really giving you headaches when you try to climb up the rank. A region lock will be super good. Even though the game itself is not that good due to the poor graphic and number of bugs. But the gun shooting of the game is really impressive and real.

2018-01-15,0,0,42,False,Recommended,This game is really good. Don't believe any of that Chinese hackers BS because I personally haven't encountered any so far. (I'll update once I encounter some.) What you're getting is a solid 100 player battle royale experience that's like no other game I've ever played. But even with the 1.0 update the load times are pretty slow and there are a lot of rendering issues. Matchmaking is nice and fast and even with the poor optimization I still get a decent 60fps on my rig with an I7 6700 a GTX 970 and 8gb of RAM on mostly Ultra settings. If you don't have a fast PC or are concerned about Chinese hackers I'd strongly recommend going with Fortnite (It's not on Steam it's on Epic Games and it's F2P.)

2017-10-26,0,0,130,True,Recommended,"EDITED and recommended I can t in good faith recommend this game. Even in early access. Why?At the beginning the updates made sense. They implement more content because the game was short of it. They improve some things and fixed some bugs... They implemented 4 different weather/enviroment... And they were good communicators.What's the problem then?The game runs like hell even in very decent machines. It affects the game play so people with the recommended requirements or even above find themselves in situations where the FPS (frames per seconds) drops below 30fps.A good example of this is two players one inside a town facing the fields 45FPS another one outside facing the town 25FPSThere are some problems with the high amount of players that are hard to fix. And then there are small annoying mistakes that stay there forever.For example 2 or 3 months to fix the autoselection of servers to the AS (asian servers). Every damn time you choose to play you MUST CHANGE THE SERVER TO NA or EU or whatever. It took them 2 months... And still you can't have a default play mode so you don't have to choose it over and over again... Meaning I don't play 3rd person view and I have to manually change it every f*(ing time I play. It's not so hard to implement.Another thing is the main menu. As you might have heard is a plain website. Yes like the one you have in your firefox or chrome but fullscreen. So if it fails you have to restart it. There must be a reason for this but i find it DUMB.Lately the communication between players and developers is getting stucked in the waiting process of getting something that really matters. More updates no one cares about... Same lack of optimization same annoying default selection same hackers same laggy servers. Bluehole is not addressing this things because they don't want to answer 10 times to the same questions. But if you don't fix the game how do you expect people not to complaing with the huge amount of new players coming.So people know that before 2018 there should be Vaulting system (be ready for all the rest of the real problems to come back). Which is very cool. New map which should be a must by now. FFS. New weapons Always cool and kind of easy. Optimization. FFS FFS FFS FFS FFS .... MORE PROFIT.Good things about the game. 1. If you have NASA PC you'll rule over the rest.2. The fashion. Everyone is playing battle royale games nowadays.3. The ""realism"". It's not insurgency or squad but it's kind of.4. Playing duo or squad. 5. Each game is different (or it used to be).6. If you don't get your head blown by a sniper or a camper and you get into an actual fight with other player it can be really really funny.The bad things of the gameplay.1. Low FPS2. Delay charging textures that affect the gameplay (it's kind of fixed).3. Being so difficult there should be some improving method for new players like a single player tutorial thing.4. after 2 months playing things are repetitive.5. Everyone is streaming 24 hours / day so you probably will s&amp ck at it for a long long time.If you are a mainstream player get it right now though.TLDR laggy buggy and bad optimized piece of work here. Came to edit my review.Now that the biggest problem (frames per second) is fixed I think the gameplay has improved a lot.The lag is still there but not as annoying as before. Just sometimes makes looting impossible at the beginning of the round.Still can't set FPP (first person perspective) by default . kudos to the developers. But still some things need fix.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The adjustments to the loot crate system have come under fire but you can just ignore it. It is scummy but has this stopped people from enjoying csgo or overwatch? Of course not. The gameplay can be a little glitchy at times so stay away from the 3 seater bike. Besides that and some other things it is a great game that I highly recommend.

2018-01-15,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,This game is so bad. As shooters go the lag is so bad that you can't shoot at a person and hit them if they are moving. I've walked into a building where no one was and then suddenly someone appeared in front of me and shot at me and would bounce around back and forth and I couldn't hit them. Then when I watch the death cam. They didn't hit me either but I still died. The concept is unique. Getting dropped off a plane to a landing point of your choosing. Then fighting everyone to the death with whatever you can scavenge.. But why are we all jumping out of the same plane if we are all enemies? Why do some players always win especially when they are obviously cheating? Why isn't the anti cheat system any good? I don't recommend this game to anyone unless you are a cheater and can show off your total lack of skill by having the computer play the game for you. Even then don't buy it. Not worth it. I wouldn't want to encourage the developers of this game to give up on fixing the problems with it. My copy was given to me by someone I helped on Ark Survival Evolved. I'd give it back if I knew how. P.S. if you want to play me at a game of skill I'll see you on CS GO.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-31,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is made addictive for its simple premise you and roughly 100 people (friends included or excluded) scavenge two large maps fight eachother and chase map limiting circles to ultimately become the last man/team standing. There is enough content as there is to sustain its popularity it s got decent shooting mechanics but is weighed down by a lot of environmental issues and shoddy vehicle physics. Item wise almost everything serves its purpose there s just a lot of guns that don t do a whole lot by means of damage. Aside from that I think this game isn t that great because of the development corners that had to be cut to push this game to 1.0 . It wowed people by putting features that they ve had in test servers for months before an official implementation that was not very different from what many had had for months before. The game is still as poorly optimized as ever though it is no longer laggy. True shills of this game would applaud the devs working over the holidays to fix it but really if they knew they were going to ship out something that underperformed before the holiidays then they re just doing the hasty patchwork that wouldn t ve been done if we hadn t raised a fuss over this. There was no real rush to have it go to full launch and they really should have taken their time with it to smooth out terrain issues and server localization. You re still going to buy this game because your friends have it but something tells me that the rest of anything good that will come from this game will happen at much slower intervals or in DLC now that it s been fully released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's been out for over 6 months and they've sold more copies than most game developers ever dream of and yet they didn't work on their game at all (Maybe a little) but for now I'm uninstalling this game it lacks depth and gameplay nothing to keep the average gamer playing their game consistently. Also earned enough to buy 3 loot boxes got work boots every time that was very dissapointing the one spot that had depth lacks it due to greediness. Not spending more than 36.99 for this game sorry but loot boxes and this game in general isn't worth it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Theyve made 900 million dollars off this game and what have they done thats noticeable? Its been a whole year and the most notable thing theyve changed is the UI a couple guns vaulting and a new map. Dont get me wrong fotnite but at least its constantly updated and is playable. It gets constant updates and new guns every in other week why is that so hard for Pubg to do? ""pubg is more realistic"" no but thats no excuse to make 3 versions of the same gun with a different looks. Ive got 400 hours on this game and I've had fun times but that was earlier last year when it first launched. I myself don't have many bugs to complain about but my friends are riddled with them. Sometimes there map looks like a potato and its not like they have bad computers its just bugs that cause it. It's been a year with the same bugs and same generic feel. This game will die faster than the wave of open world games a couple years back like dayz sa.

Perhaps just locking region for the first 20 or so hours of game or with recent reports would be a good way to keep the nonsense off the (best) NA servers. The game itself however is great. Devs are doing great with optimizing and adding new content. But this unfortunately is very hard to enjoy with the horrible cheating. Devs have tried very hard to remedy this from what I can see but they are in over their heads with the sheer volume of players. More aggressive measures need to be taken to preserve the integrity of the game for those of us who make up the majority of the playerbase and also paid full price for this game. Will change my rating if and when this is fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-03,0,0,1668,True,Not Recommended,"I love this game but i can not reccomend it to anyone looking for a ""good time."" I picked it up back when it first game out and it had that obvious early access feel to it. But as we are getting closer to release the bugs and lag are still here and probobly will be here for a while. When this game makes it to console it will bring down the standard of quality for every game to come. So we will have Pay to Win in AAA games and ""released"" games will be mid stage early access titles. At first its flaws bounce off of you the game is fun and intense and enjoyable. As time goes on each bug will become more glaring and slowly suck what little joy you did have out. cons loot is often stubborn leaving you stuck in one spot trying to swipe things over if you use the inventory or mashing F sound design is wildy innacurate. (added car horns but you can hear them barely before you can actually hear the engine bullets sound like they come from the wrong directions in close quarters many annoying background sounds that are just enough like a car in the distance to break immersion.) bullets in transit do not deliver damage if you die before delivery. Not so much a big deal in solo but in squads or duo that last bullet could drop someone. hit registration seems iffy at best and feels like a battlefield game on release. WILL stick Asain players in your game regardless of PING terrain is flawed enough that vehicles are more dangerous that helpfull because one polly at a slightly bad angle can stop you or flip you like there is no suspension. almost unplayable solo Pros The core mechanics of the game are obscenely fun which is why it is as popular as it is. there are chances for some great events to happen fun with friends but it will anger you if you are close enough and are comfortable being a little aggressive with eachother. Chicken dinner is satisfying but not satisfying enough to justify. 6.5 / 10 Player Unknown himself doubts the games polish declaring that it is not ""Esport Ready."" What i hear when he says that is ""this game is garbage once you get past its surface and expose the little flaws that we just cant fix we eventually will be able to fix them but eh.""I'm glad he made his money as he is obviously talented but this will be one of the last big early access games. because by the time the game is released everyone is done with it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,114,True,Recommended,"This game I'd say is hands down the best game in the ""battle royale"" category.It has great graphics and a realistic feel and tops all the other battle royale games. It's main competator is probably H1Z1 which has slowly started to go down hill and is getting worse and worse I didn't say Fortnite because the idea is the same but both play out extremly different.Now some of you may be wondering ""if it's such a good game why don't you have a lot of hours on it?"" The thing is this is for my preferance it isn't a game where I would sit down and play for 7 hours straight as I do with others. The reason behind this is it can get quite repeatative and I sometimes get mad when I die in top 5 even though this happens I still keep coming back to it and that is a sign of a good game.I'm glad that the game is $29.99 because if it were $59.99 I would think it was a poor choise of money. Not saying it's a bad game but just wanted to put that out. I feel like this game is more of a ""don't know what to play"" type. So more of a side game. In conclusion if your looking for a battle royale game and don't like the wacky and unrealistic feel of Fortnite then this is hands down the most superior game. The graphics and surroundings are great for what it is (a mainly battle based game). Keep in mind that if your computer isn't the best then you might not want to gamble the money on it I would just go to Fortnite until you can get a better computer.Great game overall pleased good work PUBG Corporation.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Like so many other last man standing shoot and loots this ones main selling point is that it is popular.Other than that it is still riddled with performance issues incoherent gunplay and a UI that might as well be the spawn of the lord Belial himself. The main menu feels unresponsive and sometimes it is obvious that it just doesn't work as intended so much so that the developer has included a button to manually restart it with ease.Hopefully standalone titles like this one will die off soon.I would recommend playing any other shooter with a Last Man Standing mode or try PlayerUnknown's Battle Royal mod for ARMA 3 over buying this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A actually love this game UNTIL the blue zone. This just fu**s up everything. I understand that it's ""IN"" to have it intense but what's the real point of having a game that uses many advanced stuff like inventory micro management so many guns and equipment that would offer a great deal of tactical options and then you put a random principle of a spot which you can't distinguish until it's too late and a circle getting smaller and smaller around it putting just too much presure on a player cause you don't make into the circle on time you die you make it and there's already a player who just had more LUCK waiting for you to snipe you from his hiding spot. If you rush there you don't have equipment to stand the ones coming later if you look for equipment you can't pay attention to surroundings and get killed. I like both styles rush fps such as counter strike (spent like thousands of hours with it) as well as tactical fps (like Arma especially the zombie modes D ) but mixing both together and adding the element of enormous time pressure may suit someone but definitely not me. I can't enjoy the possibilites this game offers at all simply because I still have to run somewhere in order not to die and that takes all fun from the game ..... I understand the principle the makers of the game had in mind but please set reasonable time limits to allow the players to enjoy the game. Or make alternative servers with longer time limits i.e. 20 minutes instead of 5 for the player zone to shrink just this simple thing would make the game more enjoyable )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

What can I say I have put a lot of time into this game now and there's tons of thing's that ruin it but the main thing is the Hackers really also the hit detection is annoying.... not sure why but when your kitted and then get one shotted by a guy in a hat and pants with a pistol after empying a clip into him it starts to become less and less appealing. or the classic scenario where you watch the roadrunner steaking accross a feild on foot at 300 miles an hour and he shoots you in the head from 5 miles away over a hill and the death cam shows his name as 55455655556 or sadfhingsedfse3456789 and he kills you with an ump and a Holo site. (Hack Tastic!) Its really at the point for me now that the games ruined. the loot system is still as is the Desert map... so looks like i will be finding something else to play now... it really was great....at the beginning but quickly started to get more pointless. change the Crate item drop value or stop the sale of items on steam and it will stop the hackers... region locking it may also help!! ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,0,0,337,True,Recommended,This game is truely amazing both for the work they have done and the features in place. I love this game 100000000 times more than king of the kill as king of the kill is arcadey you can jump around headshoting people with shotguns jump out of a car at 100mph and the aiming is all off. PUBGs offers a more realistic battleroyale. Better life like features. No stupid looking skins or camos. More guns vehicles and an ability to add attachments to ur weapons. This game is addicting as hell. And i know alot of people are giving out about the optimistaion but the work they have done in the last 2 months is huge. Every beta week the developers worked hard to make the gave better every day . I mean i have a mediocre pc a fx 8320 and 1060 it was very hard to run at the start but now its ok do i mind no because the devlopers are onstantly updating us everyweek they know what people want and they are doing that . People said they could not run the game and they are constantly optimising for example a huge update for minimum spec pcs is coming out after just one month of it being released. As for servers and other mechanics the developers tell us what is wrong and what is going to change. They dont just say oh some techinical difficulty they let us know what is actually happening. Last of all the developers have said there is going to be full mod support in the future meaning dayZ mod possibly or TDM and other gamemodes . The gun mechanics is also truely amazing the level of detail is sick . Hopefully people you will buy this game i mean the developers are working so hard on this game and it is sooo good.

2017-05-08,0,0,687,True,Recommended,I don't write these very often so when I do it means something really got my attention. This is one of the best games ive seen come out in a long while. I looked at it a couple times in the store and really didn't feel interested at all in it but once playing I keep playing like an addict. Keep in mind if looking to purchase though the game is still in early access so there are some bugs which ill put in the cons section of this. So anyway here are the things that really make me like this game and things i cant wait to be fixed. prosTactical feeling game especially in a group strategy is key from the very start and being able to adapt a must.Quick matches for a game that could easily have somthing drawn out for hours usually only lasts 30 mins or so even though the matches feel like youve been in the match all day.Challenging I have yet to win a match but have lasted down to the top 5 a couple times and the start of the game is just as fast and hard to survive early as it is later on.Replayable You are on the same map every game but each match is different in its own way where a lot of shooters need different levels to keep the game interesting this one dont need it especially with a 8x8 km island thats been well createdGame has lots of room to grow in gear and modes. consnetcode the game is new and in early access to i know performance optimizations havn't been completed yet so theres some issues with lag at times(perhaps not the best server company idk)bugs with equipment at times.picking up loot at times picking up fresh items feels clunky and you don't pick up the item u want to there is a solution by hitting tab and right clicking what u want but this also brings up your character menu and blocks your visual.balancing while it is fairly balanced there are a few exceptions where an item seems a little off of what it should be. overallvery worth it imo especially with thinking of the potential this game has at full release and after.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,289,True,Recommended,"Incredible fun game to play!It is a very competitive yet enjoyable game. I am not that great at ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND"" but I still love it. It is great how they let you choose if you want to play first person or third person that means that a player in third person will not have a significant advantage over a player in first person. It is incredible that this game is still in early access. But there are some bugs but thats what to expect with a game still in early access. The amount of feedback that Bluehole ( the owners of the ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND"" ) receive and listen to is great. The test servers are a great feature in my opinion. Personaly I used to play ""Counter strike Global Offensive"". The transition to""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND"" was an easy one. Valve ( the owner of "" Counter strike Global Offensive"" ) did a horrible job of listening to the community and this led to a lot of the player base to move on and it also made the community very toxic.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND is a great Game!

2017-09-24,0,0,217,False,Not Recommended,More fun than CS GO or Rainbow Six Siege. Different type of game and lots of people playing. Game has a lot of strategy but luck also comes into play as well. The more I play the more fun it gets. Really nice that you can leave or rage quit whenever without penalty and it does not hurt the other players maybe just your squad. Which is really nice because no one has to tolerate toxic players.Queue times are really fast. Nobody can type its voice only communication which takes out a lot of salt.Just wish there were more maps or game modes. Still a great game worth buying just as it is though.UPDATE I loved this game so much and wished it would stay good forever. But now its impossible to play without cheaters in every match. Which just ruins the game so badly. Most of them come from china and queue NA servers. Bluehole refuses to do anything about them because it would lower their profits from so many cheaters rebuying. Which is a massive slap in the face to all of us who didn't cheat. Which will eventually kill the game like many before it. I used to play a few hours a day now I have played maybe 1 game in the last two weeks. Also the new map is terrible.Its really truly sad. The game had so much potential but greedy devs ruined it. Just as they failed to add new game modes that are both relevant and fun. Instead wasting servers on first person sad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You have to edit the game's files to turn off mouse smoothing so the game is even slightly playable. Also unless you have a really nice gpu look forward to getting anywhere from 25 60 fps on low settings. I think they should either lower the price for the early access version or people should just stop buying it.(UPDATE They pretty much fixed everything. It s playable now.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,92,False,Recommended,"""Playerunknown's Battlegrounds"" or you could shorten it to ""PUBG"". Nevertheless this game is far from a masterpiece but still holds quite a place in pc gaming as this game is basically a highly budgeted and worked on mod of previous battle royale game modes from popular titles such as ARMA H1Z1 and DayZ.Gameplay wise this game lacks a variety of goals sure the main objective of each and every multiplayer match you partake in is to achieve first place out of 90 to 100 players. This may seem easy to some but it once a game or two of solo is played you start to realize that this will take some practice practice which is only obtainable in an online session. Yes the widely praised phenomenon known as ""PUBG"" does not have an 'offline mode' now this is not what makes the game BAD rather the lack of a training area where you can try each and every weapon and item out in the game before you go out to shed some blood. Now there is a type of training area in one of the preparation phases for one of the two maps (as of writing this) but as soon as you manage to get to one of the weapon benches you may only end up with one firearm to test out before you get shoved into a plane. This shows that a large skill gap between players is present in the game as not everyone has the time to try out every gun themselves before a match starts while the other dedicated player are able to wipe the floor with newcomers who may expect a tutorial which they will never get other than the pop ups telling you which button does what.The lack of an offline mode is a real punch in the gut for me when I play this game although there are areas of it that shine and if worked on may be able to compensate for the supposed inability to add singleplayer testing grounds. Where this game lacks for in features it makes up for in character customization there are an abundance of t shirts pants and hats for your character to wear.I feel I have written for too long so I will say this PUBG is an intense fight to the death shooter that requires patience skill and a lot of frustration management. I will give this game an 8/10 for the reasons I have listed above. Yospy",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There was a guy who ran up on me in a barn skipped all the loot and went right to where I was hiding and killed me. And I had been hiding there for a good 5 minutes so he did not see me run in as this was around third circle squad match (My squad all died at the start).But this review is just to say. Yes there are probably hackers but its not ""litterally every person that kills you is a hacker"" situation.Anyways. I have no issues with the game there's a little lag at the start of the match but I've yet to crash my FPS is 180 Ultra (Get out of 4K resolution idiots then your FPS wont suck). I find squad mode the most fun but I wish there wasnt so many forigner on our servers.

2018-01-21,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,The game performs ok ish and I never found any gamebreaking bugs but the game is still boring. The review is negative because the game is just not that good. Honestly I have no clue why it is so popular. The controls are clunky the camera swings around like a drunken sailor whenever you attempt to do anything and the encouraged behavior is still camping like a for 20 minutes before getting dinked from a hundred meters by somebody you never saw because of random events.I'll theorize. Imagine the finest bottle of scotch. When given to a scotch expert they will be extremely happy about it but give that same bottle of scotch to the everyday person and they will resent it even though the expert deemed it worthy of dying for. Most people would prefer to drink a glass of coke because it is designed for everybody. I think there are no good or bad games yes there are but games aren't inherently good or bad they are good or bad relative to their audience. PUBG is an excelent coke meaning it's generic and fun ish for everybody but nothing exeptional or new per say. Overall I feel like pubg is not a bad game it's just bland. A glass of coke designed to suit everybody without accidentally being too good to make somebody fall in love with it.The game is hugely random for what feels like for the sake of being random. Loot is random meaning you sometimes just randomly lose because you got ed with bad gear. Happens quite often actually. Red zones don't do anything 95% of the time but once every twenty games they instantly again randomly decide to kill you. Why are they a thing if not to randomly make worse players win and feel good about themselves because they don't know the only person on the server with a decent winrate randomly got blown to bits. The zone placement is random meaning if you don't land in the middle of the map you will likely have to get a vehicle and make a lot of noice alerting any potential snipers on the map and probably getting your head relocated around your car ceiling. The game at the same time tries to be skill based and highly random which will make every victory feel like your accomplishment and every defeat just a random occurance even though you clearly made mistakes. One could say the randomness protects the ego and the perceived skill inflates it.Vehicles are essential for when the zone has ed you. They are incredibly loud can be heard miles away and are relatively easy to shoot at once you get the hang of it. Sometimes you don't even have to get shot in one because they decide to kill you just cause they can. Vehicles regularly just because they can flip causing them to be fatal. Collisions with other vehicles are extremely bad.There are many guns in this game but they are all extremely similar. Sure the fire rates recoils and damages are different but the difference is extremely minor. For example except for the akm all assault riffles do the exact same damage with slight differences in accuracy stability and fire rate. The damage difference between the akm and other ARs is so small it doesn't have any signifficant break points. It only makes your opponents' armor drain slightly faster and forces them to use maybe one more medical thingamajig. All snipers can oneshot you to the head even through the lvl 1 helmet most bolt action rifles ccan do it even though the level 2 helmet. All bodyshots need 3+ hits except for sniper and shotguns. All firing speeds for automatics are near equal to firing speeds of other automatics and the same applies for shotguns/snipers.Some will say it's more fun with friends but so is everything else. Sure pubg has hillarious moments when you teamkill somebody by driving over them but those are only funny once and don't really need the specific game to be funny. Accidental teamkills in other games feel just as funny for the first time. The revive mechanic in place in duo and squads is kind of meh because getting somebody up is usually a mistake and will result in your demise except for when you down somebody and their whole squad is behind that corner to get them back up.I can't recommend this game to anyone not because it is bland but because fortnite does what pubg does better with a nice artstyle and more innovative mechanics. Fortnite is also free has better visibility and actively prevents non expert players from sniping you across the map.The dev is also an so there is that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Oh and 1.5+ million people have been banned from this game for hacking a little over like 5% of the total sales in this game. The anti cheat is ridicilous because you will run into a hacker once a day if you play in three or four games and that hacker will more than likely kill you with aimbot. I'm sure there is probably at least one hacker in a game but again you don't see anyone until the circle is less than a KM in diameter.

2018-01-04,0,0,435,False,Not Recommended,Great game but let's be real for a moment.Shooting due to the engine's limitations (I believe it must be the engine at least) isn't as smooth as one would find on BattleField or COD.Graphics could be worse but aren't amazing either.So far they have fixed a lot of the loading problems buildings seem to load much quicker and more smoothly than before. But that's not saying that everything is fine...everything is not fine. Now I would recommend this game albeit all that...but the one thing...*Deep breathe* the one damn thing that pisses me off the most in shooters.Is elements of the game that reduce a competition of skill down to sheer damn luck.Yes I'm talking about the blue circle wall of death.You spawn in a good area? Got decent loot?Wall is on the other damn side of the map...Sure fine I'll drive there.And tell everybody throughout a mile around me continiously where I am at. Everyone who probably has just as decent equipment as me if not better. And I have no clue as to where THEY are.So they kill me why? Because they got a better spawn.Now let's say you got lucky and were one of these 'Wall Campers' (Be real guys we'd all do it if we got lucky enough to...)Now you have to pray to the almighty wall gods that it won't you at the last second and appear on the other side of the map again. Giving any players/teams the opportunity to wall camp YOU.Please fix the wall it is a massive detriment to the gameplay in general. At least reduce the damage per tick and keep it a constant thoughout the game. There is NO need to kill players outside the wall every 2 seconds! Just give them the initiative to GTF inside!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,I know many like this game but in my opinion this game is pure trash. Controls are horrid the physics/engine is one of the worst I have ever played imagine playing a shooter in Hitman. The game is a crap shoot the first 5 minutes are pure luck not skill. Your sucess depends on what house you walk into and what weapons you find not your skill. I have played about 60 rounds and the only guns I find are shotguns and Uzi's the best way to win this game is to literally DO NOTHING. Land on a roof in teh middle of the map go prone and take a walk outside and enjoy fresh air. I have never played a game that ed up a concept so badly. The map is too big so you spend 85% of your time just running it shrinks too fast the lack of decent weapons is pretty much a loot box crap shoot the hit box is one of the worst there is controls are horribly sloppy there is 0 progression system so you can't really do a singel thing to increase your luck no traps vehicles randomly work or not the movement is more annoying that your drunk mother. So if you are a shotgun sniper or you don't mind spending $30 on a game that's pretty much a running simulator this is your game!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Get The Culling (Which PUBG completely ripped off and did a worse job of) instead where you get to use actual skills and tactics. This game is just chickens running with thier heads cut off and it's just not fun unless you get insanely lucky and find something other than a bull shot gun. TL DR This game is about 5% skill 95% luck of what you find wehre you land. Map is way oversized and shriks at a rapid pace so your time is spent running around staying in the zone and looking for guns. Horribly optimized pathetically buggy and just an overall effort on the concept. My best rounds which produce the most in game currency literally come from doing absolutely nothing. I just finished 3rd in a round where I just went prone in a field and left and I was killed by the map shrinking not a player. That's how dumb this game is. Could have been a great game but it's an unfinished pile of steaming dog doo doo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs are going to keep adding more maps and variety into PUBG ( hopefully)Despite these prosThere are a lot of cons.For a finished game it's incredibly buggy and poorly optimized STILL.There is a plauge of cheaters. It's uncommon to find a godlike auto aiming through the mountains insta killer but it happensMost cheaters are more insidious than that.They use wall hacks auto aim sound boosters instant healing the list goes on. these are harder to detect but its in about every single game.The spectator option is still broken along with the death cam so if you wanted to find out if the person who killed you was cheating you have to question if it wasn't just PUBG's buggy inconsistancy.I want to reccomend this game its truly fun when it can be butToo many hackers absolute crap loot boxes.PING LOCK SERVERS OR AT LEAST REGION LOCK!Other developers have figured this out why can Bluehole????,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-21,0,0,232,True,Not Recommended,Honestly i never played a battle royale type of game like PUBG or h1 but now i have and now i understand why its so pumped up about. I never fail to have a good time while playing solo duos or in squads really loving how it goes i just wish that we had more time for firefights and not to be worrying about the circle coming in on us to be able to have a good firefight espically in duos and squads as the players get downed ans can be picked back up. Love the idea of creates for customisation ect also the game has no steam badge which should be implemented of course after the game gets fixed in the areas of concern this includes server stability and they also need to change the server texture stash as sometimes i get to the ground they wernt fully loaded leaving me stranded until they loaded up of course at its stage this game is great and theyre is so much hype around the game which i hope doesnt fade for a long time! Keep up the good work devs love the game and hope to see many updates and fixes in the future 8.5/10EDIT After the game being out you would think they would have fixed there ing servers and its ridiclous constantly getting errors after matches or when im trying to play the game with connection issues this game is really terrible for that and for running into many other issues and the dev's say it can be competitive and for tournuments?

2017-11-13,0,0,31,True,Recommended,This is a fantastic game. The constant movement casued by the circle makes this infinitly better than almost every other game out there and I love not having to craft anything. However this game does have problems. The servers are s*** the devs used to ban people for being near streamers but overall it is still a great experience.If you have a good PC that is. My rig has an i5 22GB RAM and GTX 970 and this game barely runs on medium and doesn't get much better on lower settings. I very rarely get 60 FPS it tends to float around 40 50 and sometimes drops down to 30. However for me the gameplay experience outweighs the bad performance which has been getting progressively better as the devs keep working on the game. Thumbs up from me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would recommend this game to anyone that doesnt mind having technical issues and lags in their game because the only think you want is that one game where everything is going to be perfect and you will feel your heart beating at around 500% of its normal speed.If however you cannot stand bugs and lags then move away from this game until they fix it ( and I really hope they will do it) .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-30,0,0,240,True,Recommended,It was such a fun game at the start but lately not so much. You spend 25 minutes looting only to get killed by someone running faster than your car invisible completely silent shots or someone who can hit 3 consecutive headshots. Instead of new guns and cosmetics we need an anti cheat. Anti cheat or perma ban traced to an IP because right now they just make a new account and back to hacking. Used to be my go to game and the one game I considered an early access success story but now some days I don't even want to play it because it's not worth the frustration. As of now I wouldn't recommend this game. However with an anti cheat and good banning system yes I would.Update bluehole implemented changes to the anti cheat and also will be including a kill cam after you die. The number of hackers I run into has dropped and i can recommend this game to whoever has an interest in it. its not perfect by any means but it may just be the first early access game to be finished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Really great game and recommend. I am in the US and a casual gamer that does not have a temper tantrum when I don't get a kill but it unfortunate about the cheaters. I have only run across one so far and was able to report the death cam video so hopefully the player will have consequences. I find it interesting that people cheat at games. How satisfying can it possibly be to cheat to win vs. actually getting good at the game? Maybe I am an old fart (44 year old US Navy Boatwains Mate) but I would think it would be more satisfying and rewarding to get good at something fairly. Now back to the game review. For me as a casual gamer it gives the satisfaction of a very intense experience thta is a lot of fun and I look forward to the continue developments that come out. Great job and see everyone online.

2017-10-03,0,0,817,True,Recommended,I come from a galaxy far far far away. Landed on this primal planet and the monkeys here have taught me the way of computer gaming. Into my hairy hands a game has fallen named PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND that I of course have given monkey coins to buy it. Thus and after a lot of experience my intergalactic intellect have led me to believe that I'm indeed on a monkey planet and althought the game developers have earned a vast amount of monkey money their undeveloped brain can't focus on making this masterpiece of a game better. On the contrary these speciment seem to focus on spectator bugs and streamer issues like 'stream sniping' instead of game stability and new features. EDIT 15/11/2017 All seriously developers have taken feedback and they seem to try right now. The review above is canceled. Thumbs up from me!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-10,0,0,457,True,Recommended,99 hours in... i think it's fair to write a review.It's a love hate relationship with PUBG at the moment. There are times that I feel that the RNG gods cursed me with desync and lag.And then there's time where my own greed got the better of me.And there's also funny moments of oh sh*t i flew off the cliff where you can't help but laugh at yourself.Despite the lack of optimization the game runs decent enough for you to enjoy the psychotic side of your nature by trying to kill and ultimately be the last person standing in the battle royale.Pros BR style with safe+danger zones created to force players to engage.Enough variety of loot in terms of weapons/attachments.HUGE play area if you land on one end of the map expect to be running/driving into the safe zone as soon as possible.the RNG keeps you from getting bored. Cons Requires more optimizationServer performance may require work. I get better performance on AS servers compared to SEA.Lack consistency in loot spawns last update kinda broke a few things.TL DR If you're on the fence on getting this game get it while it's hot now and enjoy it.Till then am still looking forward to my chicken dinner...REVIEW UPDATE 5th August 2017 after many updates the game is getting better in terms of optimization. Although some may argue about the crates being sold it's all going to the charity event that they are hosting.and with close to 200 hours in game it still provides that adrenaline rush and the shakes especially when you're in the top 5.REVIEW UPDATE 15th Nov 2017 close to 400 hours in the game this is how it stands.recent additions more weaponsFPP only servers (why they need to add that in is beyond me the game is fine without them)Vaulting ( no more button mashing crouch jump coming soon )the main focus at this point is to cut down on the amount of hacks available to the game and optimize the network latency during game play. personally my shift has been from getting the chicken dinners to going all out aggro firefights for the kills. much more rewarding in that sense.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-07,0,0,188,True,Not Recommended,Pros Great concept good community with a large competitive player base ranging in abilities from professional players to to first timers. Lots of community driven material available to learn from through streamers and channels on social media.Game offers a really interesting mix of FPS and a tactical element which is missing in many FPS's today.Different from other FPS's that I have played There is a good level of balancing between close quarter high Damage Per Second pvp and long ranged tactical sniping. Neither being too overpowered. There are many many weapons to choose from each having advantages and disadvantages and some being very specialised weapons for a specific niche. Knowing when and how to use each of these weapons can add a HUGE advantage to your side.Being over run by several rivals? position yourself well and gain the surprise advantage and chop them to pieces with an SMG or any high burst weapon. Have lots of ground to cover before you reach your target? Attach a good scope to a rifle and your good to go. And If you have a suppressor or a flash hider even better! Not only will they not know what hit them but if you do it well enough they wont even know which direction their being hit from!Varying weather conditions add an awesome mix to game play mid day sunset heavy rain thick fog. Each offeres a range of advantages and disadvantages and require a slightly different approach in gameplay players all have their own preferences depending on their play style.Cons At the most frustrating of times it can only be described as bad coding.Can on occasions cause even high end machines to struggle with textures not rendering or freezing part way through a render. Movement bugs in terrain that can not only glitch or get your in game character stuck permanently but can end up freezing/crashing the game and rendering the computer useless to everything but a forced shutdown.There are a a whole manner of glitches when using vehicles of any sort (currently being looked into by dev's)Sound balancing is non existant and there is little to no settings to control sound/volume levels. It can go from pin drop silence and suddenly having your ear drums perforated with a single shot being fired explosives such as gernades or an air rade is out of the question. Need to mention aeroplanes or parachutes where a player cannot even hear team mates even when speaking to them through skype or teamspeak for example.Dont even get me started on exploitive software and hacks. Its rampant Its pretty common at the moment to come across someone using a ESP of some sort better yet Aim Bots.Has been ongoing for months and months and so far there doesnt seem to be a permenant fix or an acknowledgement of its existence even!. They are easily available and can be purchased for as a little as $50 and the players who have been using them are still using them 6months later. IP bans might keep the problem away for the short term (this stance is currently not adopted by the dev's) a longer term fix needs to be implemented.To conclude.Its important to note that the game is still in development its not complete by any means its a long way from where the game first started with some major hurdles being overcome and it still has a long way to go. Players must know and understand what this means before they sign up to buy and consider dedicating too much time any game thats in a beta phase.In saying that PUBG does offer a lot to both hard core gamers and the casual gamer This does not need to be repeated it can be seen by the player base and how they feel about the game it is a hit atm and after some work and some polishing up it will be even better!Although I do enjoy this game from a technical point of view I have decided to give it a down vote.I hope i've been balanced in this approach I would still reccomend it to anyone who might be thinking of giving it a try give this game a chance and im sure you will come to love it.Thanks for reading.Shinra.Suggestions to Dev's Needs a practice mode or a continuous re spawn mode where players can practice without the headache of going back to lobby and restarting a new game over and over again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-20,0,0,446,False,Recommended,I've played for only a week and I only have 40 hours. But since I got the game I never had any problem like other players. The servers always responded to me it would find a match very quickly and something people always comment a lot about is about bugs. I gotta say it is not perfect and no game is perfect. A game without bugs is not a game even if there's some bugs that can be big and maybe unplayable at times. But to be honest the only bugs I saw were with the bike when you wanna pick it up and seems like it goes underneath the ground but then after a few seconds comes back to normal.Those problems that most people comment is very relative because sometimes it is not the fault of the game. At first I had a internet connection that would make me appear half way done of the plane or maybe appear already in the island where the last jump was. But after going to my company and asking for a little fix and get more Megabits of Internet I could play normally and the issue went away.I also saw that there's a test server and many people play there to see the new stuff like new weapons maps enviorement and I saw videos there of people complaining about bugs problems etc. If it is a test server I think it is obvious you will find bugs as it is a test. A way the creators give the player of the game to test their new stuff for the game and see what do they think about it.I honestly do recommend this game and problems with bugs hackers server etc. It's relative. Also it doesn't depend if your pc is so good and expensive I have a computer with I5 3rd Generation AMD Raedon HD7770 series 8GB RAM (kinda old pc for what the game is) and my game works perfectly fine I know at a low graphic settings but I still enjoy it and have a lot of fun. Issues won't happen to every single one who buys this game. I had the same fear to buy this game back then after the 1.0 realese because of what everyone said of how it was but after buying it I regret not buying it before.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The real factor of who wins the games in this is luck. You might loot some clothes while nearby someone is fully geared.

2018-01-19,0,0,1251,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for a little while now. In the beginning it was enjoyable but now has been ruined by hackers. They've added a replay option where you can see spectate who killed you and MOST games end with someone immediately headshotting you without a line of site without aiming or worse still through a solid wall. The game just becomes frustrating and the developers don't seem to be interested in resolving the problem.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-31,0,0,194,False,Recommended,The basics are deceptively simple but there s a level of mastery that can be attained in PUBG and I can t write that off. The more I play the more I appreciate the depth of the game. It s exhilarating to pick off an enemy running across a field and it s terrifying to be that person running across the field. There are a million different scenarios similar to this that unfold in every match of PUBG. For a game that s still in Alpha it s almost a pleasant surprise that server stability is one of the biggest issues facing the game. Desync is a bigger killer than any gun. Servers and netcode can be upgraded and improved thankfully. It s a pity that players have to butt heads with uncooperate internet tubes but Bluehole Studios have made an immersive and energizing game that improves upon nearly every aspect of the budding survival arena genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-29,0,0,123,True,Not Recommended,"Advisory I understand this game is early access I know that it has lots of potential and some things the developers are already aware of that doesn't change my opinion or review of this product and despite the fact that I did enjoy it I'm still not recommending it until the obvious things are resolved.My ReviewThe game has an obscene amount of bugs whether it be ridiculous amounts of illogical lag or dual scopage on a single weapon there are some things that just can't be overlooked especially when their gamebreaking. My first issue with the game is the god awful rendering. I don't know what kind of drugs the developers have been doing but the fact that so many players have issues where the buildings dont render in properly (Some cases like my own involve having high end systems that even on low settings still get this rendering issue) leaving you to run around or stand there until they do so you can grab a weapon and NOT get killed within the first few minutes of landing on the ground. This has happened frequently for awhile and yet still no fixes other than some 3rd party ""mods"" which can still get you banned for using them and lets not forget the occassional crash and disconnect because the game is terribly optomised.Despite this though the game is ridiculously fun (when it actually works) especially with friends. Having played it for awhile I can't recommend this game to anyone for the price their selling it at. They need to fix these game breaking bugs or reduce the price because no way in hell are players who suffer at the hands of these bugs going to put up with them and drop the money for the game. This game has a lot of potential but it's not one I wish I had bought.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have a 144hz monitor that my computer runs ALL other games fine at 144+fps. but not this POS game. Oh i forgot to mention. When you get into a game. Im not kidding I have done the math. atleast 30% of the games will have hackers or poeple playing on the wrong server to get a higher ping. IN this game the entcode is so aweful that the higher the ping the more advantage you have. make since right? This game has great concept but like all other Early access games. the Developers don't care and are just looking for more money. Instead of fixxing the game on PC they are going to launch it on xbox.....why not finish your game on PC and port it over to xbox tweak a fgew things change HUD UI ext. but instead lets just push our game to a console and watch it unveil. I don't get how they say its gunna run on xboix 60 fps when 70% of computers can't even get a constant 60fps. DOn't buy this game. If you do I'm sorry youll put as much hours into as me and realise how it really is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To the twitter which never posts anything expect ( We apologize for the delay in getting our servers back online).

2017-10-26,0,0,709,True,Recommended,"I can understand why people find this game buggy and irritating i have died at least 10 times to either a bug hacker or silent buggy. But in all my years of playing videogames PUBG is one of my favorite games of all time. You might have some difficulties with the controls or rules in the beginning and you are going to die a significante amount of times before you get any good at the game. But when you reach the 50 150 hour mark you begin to understand how the game works. Sure you are going to drop in school and die to someone else because they either were lucky enough to find a weapon or simply just better than you. But with every defeat you automaticly get better and better at the game. My best tip i can give to a new player is ""dont give up"" because you are going to lose maybe 50 times in a row before you are greeted with a chicken dinner. Sounds like s*it i know but dying is a part of the game and because of the 1 life you are given the victory in the end is the sweetest most awesome thing ever. When you die in overwatch CSGO league of legends etc you can for the most part always come back from the fight because death is just as much worth as cupnoodles. But in PUBG its just game f*cking over and i think that is the best thing about the game because it improves your skills continuously. Dying over and over again is a pain in the but you slowly begin to understand where to drod which weapons to pick and much more in no time trust me. Servers can be harsh but for the most time a single ""refresh"" solves everything. And unlike other videogames and companies Bluehole acctualy changes the game and makes it better and better with each update. And for those out there mad about the 1 life gag then try again ok? you are going to win eventualy and that victory feeling will only get more and more awesome with each win you get. The game have some faults here and there but im sure they are going to be fixed in thefuture and cmon the game is not that unplayable i think people get mad cuz they keep dying and have to restart. Te game mechanincs itself are not that aweful belive me.mouses will be thrown keyboard buttons will fly across your room your pulse will reach over 9000 each time you make it to the top 10 but trust me victory has never been so sweet. I would definitely recommend this game to any new player or experienced fps player. Shorter and more specific review its a good game git gut losers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-02,0,0,560,True,Not Recommended,This game is far too loot oriented the circle moves too fast and many mechanics are designed just to ruin the player's day. For example Red Zone is just a slap in the face. The bomber plane in H1Z1 was much more interesting. You hear it coming look up desperately in search of it's position and direction run like hell for 5 seconds. In PUBG Players are forced to waste a ton of time just waiting for it to end sometimes even as the blue zone is coming in and can even cut off access to the bridge to/from military island.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,225,True,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun.It's probably one of the most entertaining and addicting games I've played all year. As with any early access game there are going to be issues. The issues I've encountered frequently in PUBG (Mostly lag sync and server crashing issues) don't occur enough to make the overall experience less enjoyable. As of this review I've played a pretty good amount of PUBG and I've maybe experienced 2 or 3 hackers in all the games I've ever played. It's frustrating to lose to a hacker but that doesn't happen nearly as frequently to me or my friend group as it appears to occur to others. Are there issues with the game? Absolutely. This game needs a LOT of work done to resolve the network issues and sync lag. However the game is a ton of fun to play and all the issues I've experienced really don't take away from the general enjoyable experience (at least in my opinion). I think it's worth playing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-17,0,0,404,True,Recommended,So Players Unknown I personally never write reviews its something I don't touch base on very often even on early access games but this game is the exception setting aside the cons (servers optimization) which should be expected considering the game hasnt been out for a month yet its amazing. I've played king of the kill for hours but always felt like something was missing or wasn't that well thought most of the guns are useless but playing this game feels so rewarding i've spent hours playing duo's and solos and it has yet to get old getting loot seems rewarding rather than a task. Guns in this game are balanced and each feels fair even pistols have a good amount of heft hitboxes as far as my encounters have been spot on and just the overall combat in this game feel amazing i would say though that the jumping needs some work seems sluggish/unresponsive but besides that movement is spot on. Graphically speaking if you have a beefy enough computer (1070 and up) running this game in ultra is beautiful the detail put into buildings is amazing I love the fact that theres some destructability (nice touch for throwing in nades' and what not through doors) and the layout of the map is spaced well and you don't have to go into cities for everything item placement is spot on and spawn rates are fair. Concluding this is one of my favorite purchases on steam and some of the most fun i've had in a while weekly updates are amazing and the quality as it stands is superb considering how young the title is I can only see the game getting even better as time goes and I cant wait to see whats to come overall 9/10 from meEdit This game is still awesome and the devs have worked so hard on this game i cant wait for the new map and for 1.0 to release ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,353,False,Recommended,This game is a great game especially if you have a group of friends to play with. As someone who played in beta I can appreciate the updated looks in 1.0. Although the new map could have been better my friends and I don't enjoy it as much. Also rubberbanding and server issues are still a problem. Overall the game is rewarding and fun due to being able to come back and win your first chicken dinner. But for some reason 1 isn't enoung. I like being able to choose to play in first person or 3rd person. Both are challenging but its more personal prefrence. You may think the game is RNG and luck but really if you are a good player you can get to the top 10 or 5 in any given game because you are able to adapt to any situation thrown at you. This is why I will not say the game is repetitive. The amount of differnet encounters keeps you on your toes. On the negative side the game lacks customization. When you first start the game you are able to customize your characters apperance. Opening crates using in game currency is cool but you only get the same few items because everything decent is so rare. Customizing looks in this game sucks. Although when you get in game you can find the same 3 levels of a helmet vest and backpack. There should be different looks that a player can have in the game or different optimizaions that each vest or backpack can give. There also shouldn't be this idea in my head that I want M416 and Kar98k everytime I start a game. Its my goal. Why? The guns aren't balanced. There are guns way better then others and not many differernt options found within the game. The reason I keep coming back is the burning desire to win and get kills not because the game is balanced. The gameplay could be a lot smoother but it isn't bad and there are still too many bugs for a 1.0 game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,17,True,Recommended,"Okay so let me just start by saying that this game is fantastic and the level of quality is amazing for something that is still in alpha. Now let's move onto the actual meat of this. The Good PUBG does a lot really well. Gameplay is fast and intense and literally gets your heart pumping. It's equal parts DayZ and Counterstrike with a reminiscence of STALKER. This game doesn't seem to require a legendary PC to run. In fact mine's just on the high end of average (i5 CPU GTX 970 GPU) and I've had absolutely no graphical issues. On top of this the connection seems good. I've had no lag issues outside of the staging area which doesn't affect gameplay at all. Once I'm in the overworld I'm good to play. I know a lot of people had issues with this recently but I think it's been patched out. You get put in matches fast. I have never once had to wait for a match. Battlegrounds is insanely easy to pick up. If you've ever played a shooter you can play this. I've only got about 7 hours on record and I've made it to the top 10 25% of the time. And I would only rate myself a mediocre to fair FPS player. There is a lot of character customisation for a FPS if you're into that sort of thing. You can earn credits in game which can be spent on rewards packages which in turn unlock more customisation. You can also buy and sell such things through the Steam Marketplace. There does not seem to be a lot of hacking going on which is nice for a huge game like this. The game sounds perfect. Guns sound like guns footsteps sound like footsteps and this is a game where both of those sounds are absurdly important. The Bad Of course as with almost all games there are some issues to point out. For starters for a game that claims to be a tactical shooter the rounds are a little too fast. This is caused by the next point. To control the gameflow the playable area of the map shrinks forcing players to engage with one another more quickly. This itself is not a problem how quickly it shrinks the area is however. Instead of giving players a chance to scavenge gear weapons and vehicles you are pretty much forced to run towards the center of the target zone. It definitely keeps the game moving but removes some of the tactical ness. The UI is just plain awful. It works don't get me wrong but it takes a lot of clicking to figure things out. And being nitpicky it's fairly ugly too though that is not a dealbreaker at all. Finally and this is a big one for a multiplayer only game there is no reporting system that I could find. Now as I mentioned in the ""Good"" section I don't feel there is much hacking going on. But I had one death that was almost assuredly not kosher and I found no way to report the offending player. Down the road this could bring some trouble. The Ugly PUBG is a game very much in development so there are things that are bound to change. There are a few things that I think are worth noting as needing work but not being disruptive to gameplay. The controls are a bit wonky and take some getting used to. Unlike the UI however once you've worked them out they work fine. Plus remapping's a thing so that helps. I would love to see a functioning replay ability so I can go back and watch the match especially to see how my opponents take me down. This game needs a FPS only mode. Currently the game can be played in both TPS and FPS. Most players go with TPS to give themselves a slight tactical advantage For those of us who enjoy a degree of immersion it would be nice to see a FPS only list of servers. The rewards system is...meh. I'm on the fence about it because on one hand credits and rewards do not impact gameplay whatsoever so there is no pay to win mode here. On the other hand however if you're not into the cosmetic aspect of the game it would be nice to be able to use these credits for something else. In Summation Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is fantastic and fully playable even in its alpha state. There are some wrinkles to iron out but the devs are listening to the players and are actively updating the game. This is the prime time to get into a fun new FPS.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,46,False,Recommended,"I'm sick of influential streamers bloggers and whatevers that are getting this game negative reviews. The point is that this is a fun game. https //youtu.be/am4TPyXefgMI'm not that great but I still enjoy it so much. I like the way it separates FPP and TPP into respective servers heck I like the fact that the player base is so huge I can get a game with any settings. It's a challenge for your computer. With a GTX1060 and i5 7400 + Shadowplay I get 50 60fps on Ultra with Shadows on High 1080p. On my much older rig which still performs okay with many recent titles (R7 270X FX6300) I get 35 45fps on medium lowering the settings bumps up the frame rate but that's a good idea of what to expect.This is one of the first games that actually got me to go on the internet and start looking up tips and methods on how to play better and have a more enjoyable experience. I feel like the time you put into the game is a reflection of the experience you're going to have regardless of gameplay style. 24 hours in and I'm pretty terrible but still better than I was before that falling just short of chicken dinners lately. A lot of negativity towards this game is due to many stupid things ranging from it not performing well to individuals using racial slurs in game. While the former is expected the latter is due to an online experience with 99 completely different people. I imagine if I was in a room with 99 other people that one of them is probably going to be racist it's pretty easy to switch voice channels if you're in a toxic situation. I imagine some negativity is due to things like glitches server problems you know? things you might expect for a game that currently has about 2 million people playing 100 on each server and several toasters probably making things more difficult.If you want to look at this game in a political or technical way then yeah there is a lot of ""mixed"" reception towards it. But if you have a decent computer a sense of humour and sharp tongue it's a ""mostly positive"" experience. If you're good at ARMA or any form of shooter it's going to be a ""very positive"" experience.5/10 if you're a bit sensitive and your computer sucks7/10 if your computer just sucks8/10 if your computer is good but you suck at games9/10 if your computer is good and you're good at games",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,1501,False,Not Recommended,"I love playing this game even with all its bugs its the best rush in any video game I have played. Pure strategy competition and a little bit of random luck. This game wasted away my summer fall and I was looking forward to it passing the time during the winter. However the cheating has become so bad in this game since 1.0 Launch that I cannot recommend this game until it is under control. 3 out of 5 games I am reporting someone for hacking with aimbots recoiless mods and being able to see me through walls. Wasting 20 30 minutes getting to the top 10 and being killed with hacks is so frustrating. Single duo and squad games all suffer from this problem. 3 or 4 on 1 at the end of a match and you're team is dead because of some D bag with a fully auto recoiless M416 from 100 yards out. WOOT!Not to mention I can barely meet any new players to invite to play our discord server because almost every random person you pair up with on the North America servers is from Asia and do not speak english or do not work as a team.The addition of the ""replay function"" is awesome but it just helps me to verify that there are in fact so many cheating players that its not even worth my time to play anymore. This game is a 8/10 with no cheating and unlimited fun with friends.

2018-01-03,0,0,171,False,Not Recommended,PUBG Is a good concept and can be fun. But to go 1.0 when it is clearly still an Early Access title speaks volumes.Sadly the main reason I cannot recommend it at this point is aside from it still feeling and looking like an early access game made from asset flips it is as you can no doubt see from other reviews and discussions filled with Chinese hackers and if they're not hacking they're taking advantage of lag.If I join local servers I'd like to play against locals not people with a 300+ ping. Players that you shoot several times who then turn around and 1 shot you or through walls because where you see them despite the blood flying from their bodies they're not where you think they are and they're not taking hits like you think.Sadly PUBG is not the only game that suffers from this networking phenomonen but many old school shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament you could minimise it with rate capping. It really needs to make a comeback.Devs are looking into it (of course no promises made) and of course no idea when it will be implemented.No issue killing local players and I have no issues with being legitmately killed.But it stops being fun when you constantly feel cheated. Be it from hacks or lag abuse and these players lagging it can be hard to tell.Kill Cam doesn't help as you do not get an exact replay of events as they occured and it can give the impression someone is cheating who may not be and the opposite is also true. Although someone firing an AR on full auto and landing every shot seems to be a give away.Thanks to loot crates and being able to sell the contents (something that should never be in a paid game imho) you find many servers filled with AFKers. Who aren't there to play but to make themselves money. Needs to be anti AFK systems and penalties in place. Again something other games have managed to do in the past.I'd say PUBG could be a good game but it lacks maps (Only 2 currently) game modes custom servers unless you're a twitch celebrity and much much more that we used to get in such games way back in 1997.But it's got a long way to go for a 'RETAIL' product. (Heck it has menu options that are greyed out. Yeah 1.0 right there.If they deal with the flood of Chinese players infesting every server if they properly deal with the hackers. (Something no game currently does sadly free money from resells (MAC bans maybe? IP and Account bans have never worked. Seriously what's the point of Battle Eye EAC and similar? They seem to do jack sh!t)If they can add more content ASAP and quality content at that and get better optimization happening then I could recommend it.If it was a F2P game still in Early Access I'd recommend it.But as it currently stands. I'd have to say hang onto your money and see how it goes. For $30USD and a 1.0 release (just in time for Xmas of course....) and with in game Ads and loot. I do not feel this is what a paid for retail game should be.I already own it so I'll keep playing and see how it progresses. But it's wash rinse and repeat gameplay only fun in short bursts. Play it for any length of time in one go and you either end up bored or frustrated even more so when you win but do not recieve your points. Needs some capture the flag Team Deathmatch more than just the last man standing which is more of a game mode itself than an actual game.tl dr for $30usd you get a hackfest that feels more like a mod for Arma 3 than a new standalone game. (and oddly enough it was an Amra mod I believe. Seeing a pattern with Arma mods becoming standalone games here)This game has made millions and it would be nice to see those million actually being spent on development than buying more pre made assets and glaring problems seemingly being ignored.Game needs more time in the oven.Potential is there but it's not there yet. If you enjoy frustration more than fun. buy it.Friend bought the game for me if it had been my own money I'd feel ripped off and cheated honestly at this stage.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Basically the asian server joins north american and the result leaves a server of 15+ asain hackers in one game.

I know this isn't a fashion game but MAN DOES IT SYCK when you cash in 2 weeks worth of points only to play the ""loot crate lottery"" and get the same shirt and hat 3 times in a row. It shouldn't be like this... I have some great memories with this game and will continue to have more with my friends but at some point you have to start voicing you opnion. The fact that after playing over 200 hours I had to spend REAL MONEY to get a coat is a joke. Yes there are hackers (par for the course these days) yes there are glitches and server issues (technically we are still in the ""early access stage"") but when the devs are concentrating on monetizing the game before you can even get a t shirt you like after playing 200 hours... something just doesn't feel right. It organically feels like I'm being cheated. 1 level no control of how I want my character to look and broken development promises.

2017-11-20,0,0,258,True,Recommended,Ok where do I start. PUBG is an amazing game that has captivated my love for a FPS game. Even if it takes quite a while sometimes to discover other players the payoff is great! The game is still in Early Access so it is plagued with random bugs but I still really love it. I have only put 200 hours into the game so take my opinion with a grain of salt. However as the months passed the walls of the houses became covered in advertisements for random things and twitch streamers which I think is a stupid move for a game that costs 30$. The amount of hackers also seems to have incresed. I have not seen that many but everyone I talk to seems to have some sort of experence with impossible deaths. I would still recommend this game but Just know that things could continue to go down from here if the devs do not get their stuff together and fix some of the more serious issues before releasing more content and advertising all over the map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,Great potential but let down by greedy developers. The netcode for this game runs on average at 17Hz. In 2017 that is pathetic. Servers are over capacity so are constantly laggy with Asian and Russian players flooding the EU and NA servers (as instructed by Bluehole) and ruining the experience for everyone else. There aren't enough Asian servers and there are NO Russian servers. The way the lag compensation has been done you are at a very high disadvantage if you have a good connection and fast ping. Punishing those with decent internet and rewarding those who are rubber banding everywhere Then there's the hackers and whilst it is sort of expected for a game of this magnitude and punk buster are doing their best to get on top of it a bad experience is a bad experience.The game is an absolute mess right now.

2018-01-09,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,So obviously everybody loves this game and it's quite popular to say the least. Yes there are issues but what game doesn't have. Let me see if I can balance the argument here. So in my opinion the reason this is such a popular game is because the stakes are so high. You die you're done. This makes this game very tense nerve wrecking and exciting. Equally so if feels just as exciting and even more thrilling when you kill someone knowing you have ruined their game. Synical but true. ProsHigh stakesDecent variety of weapons and armorModerately complex terrain with forests hills water and roads. Good amount od different areas. Zone systemConsInconsistencyLag issuesBugs Taking damage when landing from a parachute Sudden Vehicle disembarkment when crashing Getting shot through coverNot enough loot It's a bit ridiculous. Not everyone wants to land in high populated areas where all the good loot is you guys need to spread the loot out better. I sometimes find all there is in an entire complex are pistols. Nothing pisses me off more. I have noticed good guns in some low pop areas but the latter happens too often. Also I'm tired of seeing 4 bags but no gunsNot enough vehiclesZone moves too quickly towards the end and gives too much damage. The end of games is a rush and spoils the game for me.

2017-10-27,0,0,211,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun but there are a couple problems the hackers and the lag. THE DEVS NEED TO REGION LOCK ASIA. They say this is unfair and they know that most of the hackers come from China but what I do not understand is how this is unfair. What is unfair is that the majority of the player base cannot enjoy the game because of the morons in China hacking. Until they get their anti cheat fixed or incorporate VAC they need to region lock EACH AND EVERY region. Players should only be allowed on their own regions. Even if a person from another region plays on another region isnt hacking it still ruins the game because their lag will be through the roof. Until Bluehole fixes this issue and listens to their community I will not be playing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-12,0,0,437,False,Not Recommended,You already know what this game is and I do love it but reigon lock China. It has nothing to do besides the fact that Chinese players are across the globe so they have a high ping which will kill you around corners and that 99% of cheaters come from China which was stated by Battleye themselves. I really do love this game but reigon lock China and it will make everyone happy. Also the parachute nerf makes the game much worse because now most people have to go to closer cities and most of them die early so that by the first circle there are only around 40 people left and makes the mid game boring because there is no one to fight.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,685,True,Recommended,"Alright so I have put off this review as long as I can. I have played PUBG since april. It has come a long long long long long long way(seriously cannot emphasize how far it has come how fast for early access game). It is an amazingly addicting game that will have you saying one more game until you look at the clock and realize its 4am. It still has room to improve no doubt but the playerunknowns team is incredibly helpful and keep everyone up to date with what is happening. There was an infestation of hackers for a few weeks but that has since passed and I have not seen one since the updates to the cheat system. They're has been many many many annoying bugs you will see that from the reviews but almost all have been ironed out and the game is finally coming extremely close to launch. Only 1 more week of testing the final PC 1.0 test server with the new map this week and then the official release will soon be after that. The reason I write this review is to recommend to buy it before the price jumps(if its going to).Comments about optimizations I have a new system with a 1600x and 1060 6gb I run at a lot of the settings on ultra and a few on high while playing on 1080p 60hz screen(60hz gross I know). I average 70 fps and now rarely drop below 50fps. I will drop below 50fps when the servers are overpopulated that but at non peak times the game runs very well.I also have a old system with literally the exact bareminimum requirement listed below. fx 6300 and 660 2gb 8gb ram. If your system does not match the performance of that(five year old system) dont try to run the game and then complain that the game doesnt run. I do not care about how ""terrible"" the graphics are. This is a massive game and with 100 people + all the RNG + all vehicles and objects in motion being simulated in real time whether you see them or not is a lot for any processor and GPU. I have seen to many people trying to run this game on older non gaming laptops it just ain't gonna happen and if this is you stop complaining.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,Concept and gameplay is great. This is a really addictive game and there is endless possibilites. The big problem with it now is game loading and assets rendering. It's Beta i know but when games load it feels like its constantly buffering content.. stuff that should be static like the map and even the menu rendering. Glitchy map loads and lag on occasion make this game dissapointing in some ways. Generally enjoyable to play just expect to spend some time restarting the game ofter and wait for the map to render.

2017-04-20,0,0,932,True,Recommended,i would say that this game is better than people have described it to me making me realise that you should never judge a book by its cover and you can only react to what you have seen. If you havent played this game then you are in no position to judge however people who have played it can give their thoughts and opinions of the game. ive only just brought it and played 31 mins of it but just by playing a weee bit i could tell that this game has a lot of potential and that if they arent just money hungry like cough cough.....d a y b r e a k then this game will be a banger. Personally for me the aiming and shooting mechanics are really good and me being a cod fan TEENAGER not a child lol..... that in some way it kind of feels like cod in a way like 20%. yh 20% is low but i would prefer 20 than nothing. All i going to say that this game is good enough even in its early access stages but there is stilll a lot of work to be done but i have no doubt that the creator/helper of H1Z1 could fix the slight issues and bugs and the optimastions Honestly if d a y b r e a k keep ip with this b u l l s h i t then they gonna get hit hard just where the sun dont sun.

2018-01-24,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,this game is 1 of the worst 500+ hours and people still kill u like u have just started playing hackers are EVERYWHERE i keep getting shot behind cover (like behind a shipping crate or even a wall) aiming is highly inconsistant i can shoot a shotgun in a guys face and miss him but he'll headshot me without being on target. this game runs worse than the BETA. i would 100% get my money back if i could i also wouldn't recommend anyone buying the game either. the circle is your enemy untill the last 15+ people. loot is so hard to come by so it depends on how lucky u are no fair competetion in this game u can search a whole building and find nothing but the guy next to u has a scar and kar98 kitted with level 2 armor helmet etc. introducing new maps and guns etc into the game won't keep people playing eventually it'll be hackers vs hackers in the end,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-08,0,0,538,True,Not Recommended,Edit 12/14/17 Well. The hackers are back. Last ten games in a row. The game needs consistent bans not a ban wave every few months. The game is once again unplayable and I guess I'll pick it back up if theres news of a new ban wave.Edit 11/26/17 I've had one hacker in the last ten games I've played. This is still annoying when it happens but at a rate this low I can wholeheartedly reccomend the game. If you don't have it yet get it.EDIT 11/18/17 For the last few days there has been a notable decrease in the number of hackers in my games. Not sure of this is a fluke but if it stays like this through the week I'll be changing my reccomendation to a positive. This is a very good game. Some of the most fun I've had on the PC in a while. That being said when other players consistantly have Xray hacks aimbots it makes the game impossible to have fun with. When you die the second that you crest a hill from a guy sitting in the middle of a valley spinning and shooting you know that there are problems. If this were an occasional occurance it would be fine but the six games that I played prior to this review ALL had people cheating. The game is a ton of fun but in its current state its unplayable.

2017-11-24,0,0,336,True,Not Recommended,This game is a great idea but the developers were definitely not prepared to have such a large playerbase with such high expectations. Despite the crazy amount of copies they've sold I still haven't felt a great response in the way my game runs. I find it abysmal that the game runs at &lt 10hz at the beginning of rounds. Once I tried out fortnite I had trouble coming back to this game. Both games run on the same engine and have the same playercount. But one of these games feels like butter and the other one is a clunky unresponsive mess. I realize that pubg is in early access but from what i've played on the test servers it doesnt seem to have changed for the 1.0 release.

2017-05-15,0,0,325,True,Recommended,The game is buggy as hell runs poorly on any machine that doesn't have a high end card and has clunky controls. It's in early access and has a strong dev team that keeps the community updated. It's one of the most adrenaline pumping feelings in any game I've played when I get into the top 10 but that's all it really has going for it. I feel I have more fun with it when I play with friends. I don't feel like the UI is informitive enough and there isn't enough focus on stats. It's deffinately worth the money though just on the experience alone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-25,0,0,1246,True,Not Recommended,Absolutely infurating and fun at the same time. So far I have ran into a series of small issues and a couple major issues that constantly brings this game down. Any change in my network speeds and this game is hell bent on locking your player up and completely disabling them from movement while other players get to leisurely mark a perfect headshot and you get to see and read that in the final moments. Or even more infuriating is watching the blue zone pass you by and you get to stand still slowly dying. Another possiblility is you get screwed over because the randomized red zones that hail bombs on you although mostly funny to drive through will randomly splat you in its hellish fury all over the inside of buildings due to the fact that the buildings aren't entirely safe. Which is fine except when that hell storm pumbles where you're at for over 3min consequtively and you get to hear the sounds of shattering glass and the sounds of dying souls combined with the complete destruction of your ear drums since it seems this freaks out just about anyone's PC. However besides those issues you will find yourself constantly in the lobby anyways from the thrill of that one incredibly lucky game that got you a win. I'll have to admit I want to tear handfulls of hair out in frustration because of either network lags at the most inconvenient times or simply that aiming in this game is the most difficult I have ever dealt with but its incredibly fun at the end of the day. Other issues from daily playing will happen and you'll find that for how much you pay and the technical difficulties alone you may want to consider something else. Personally had I known this many technical issues existed I would have never used as much space on my PC or paid even half the amount that I did. Sorry at this point I only play it to kill time and be able to have fun with my brother.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-09,0,0,410,False,Not Recommended,It had its time but now... Since Player Unknown's was released into Early Access I have been a big supporter of the idea behind the game. I have enjoyed it thus far and had many laughs with friends. The seemingly unstoppable juggernaught of FPS shooting has met its match Hacking. It has it's positives. Development with new Animations with vaulting that was released before Christmas of 2017 was a great improvement to the overall feel of the game. The variety of tools at the players disposable in which to dispatch your fellow arena chums was always fantastic and the legendary Pan being an iconic symbol. However from what would be many evenings spent playing with friends and the odd solo queue it has become a game I loath. The amount of hackers seemingly instant headshotting through a level 3 helmet recoil absent and snapping onto targets instantly from a distance of over 500 meters away and getting headshotted each time just makes the game purely unjoyable. If better anti cheat software was able to be used to make the game fair for all players then I may consider returning and changing this review to a positive. However in its current state I would not recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If I got shot in real life you can ing bet I could tell you what direction the bullet came from even if I was blind and deaf but they'd rather let their audio be the hinderence of the century.And now whatever they've done to the game about a week ago has made it entirely unplayable before last week I averaged about 3 to 4 kills per game in fire fights where people were aware of where I was but now I'll see on my screen that I hit them 4 5 6 times? and I die watch the replay and i see two bullets land. Or hell how about the game that I came in second on because the guy was literally invisible for me i swept passed him like 3 times after i started hearing gunfire and when i watch the replay hes clearly visible.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-22,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"This game is pretty addictive even with only two maps. It is a lot of fun to play with a group of friends. If you take the game semi serious there is a good amount of tatics involved if you wish to make it to the end alive. Sometimes luck plays a role. The game has come a long way and only gotten better. Cheating at one time was seriously out of hand and almost made me walk away from playing for sometime. Banning cheaters and trying to crack down on these issues has made the game enjoyable again. I personally run the game on a lower end gaming computer. I have a descent processor AMD Ryzen 1500x paired with a RX 560. I am able to run the game just fine with all settings at medium view distance at high. I probably could tweak it a little more but the game is very playable with these settings. As I mentioned earlier I play the game with my personal friends. We use a outside chat program. Turning off the in game communications is a must for me as the over the top immature players are at a uber high. I've found my self a few times using the open channel after a match starts taunting my prey in a professional manner for some giggles. An example would be ""I know you are in that shack might as well come out and get it over with"" I've also found that a lot of people think others cheat in this game when really they don't. They end up having a poor internet connection causing them to lag. This does give them a advantage. However the game isnt broke. It's the developers not region locking the game to prevent this. Over all I find PUBG a enjoyable game that you can quickly jump into when time is short to get a little action. Carefull as you can indulge yourself so much that before you know it your entire day was wasted away playing this game. I would give this game at it's current level of completness a solid 7.5/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,163,True,Recommended,The gameplay itself is solid and I have a blast playing it. If you were dead set on a battle royale game this is the one to buy. The reason I cannot recommend this is soley because of the crate system. Currently you make a character ONE character then as you play you earn points based on your performance. You spend those points on crates which have a chance for clothing or accessories for you character. After release they plan to make you pay real money for those crates. That would be somewhat acceptable if this was FTP but it isn't. So I cannot recommend it.For the gameplay it is fun intense and just a blast to play. I know with other games (H1Z1 specifically) the shooting/gunplay was off (H1Z1 had the worst gunplay of any game I've played.). The gunplay in this is solid. I am confident I will hit my target when I am shooting. The loot doesn't seem to be great on the fringes of the island but that's not that big a problem. The game has working vehicles it needs more variety and more on the map but they exist.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-09,0,0,357,True,Not Recommended,Went from giving this game a negative review in June to a postive review in August back to negative in the last few weeks.I had a nearly 2200 squad rank in season 2 putting me around top 1000 NA and played the game a lot. After some fixes server side and an upgrade to a 4gig video card on my side i liked the game even more moving forward..but this was the past.Now from what i've seen the game is becoming more and more Asian orientened (53% of players in the past 2 weeks logged in from China or Korea as of 11/1/17 and only 21.5%'ish of players logged in using the English language setting i believe on the same date) and more hacker friendly. I've watched livestreams with people using hacks and even telling the streamer how to get the hack they're currently using. Combined this makes the game very unfriendly to anyone really.. especially players like me who queue for squads by myself and higher ranked players who are more concerned about dying unfairly and losing stats.Overall i'd say they need to ping lock the servers and focus on getting rid of hackers. By ping locking I mean locking out any IP if it has ping is over 100 lets say.. so a chinese player wouldnt be able to log into a NA server or vice versa. And the hacks speak for themselves.. any amount of tolerance removes the fairness for the other 99% who don't hack and makes it not fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,"IMPORTANT I DID NOT WRITE THIS BUT I AGREE WITH ALL POINTS AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS GAMES IDEA (ORIGINAL WRITTEN BY SpliffPUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. STEREO sound... what year is this?? Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc. But compared to the above points these are pretty minor.What would make this game better? Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). Actually ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items) it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50 they would make millions. Win win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their I will never buy a key to open one and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedy Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.Why is it so popular then? It's exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them) or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etc.The most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sometimes you get connected to a mtach but it doesn't load for you so you have to Alt+F4 and reconnect just to find out you died from someone else killing the 'afks' who probably all have this same problem.

2017-11-06,0,0,439,True,Recommended,Lets not forget this is still in Alpha but I do agree with most here that PUBG creators need to be a lot more proactive in curbing the hacking.

I suck at this game though it doesn't stop me going back for more but single headshots from impossible distances will keep me away until the December release and hopefully fixed of bugs and hackers. But look at the facts. 2.2million players $30 a pop I think PUBG creators have made their money so time to give the real players what they paid for. I WILL recommend this game BUT be prepared for unexplained deaths from unseen/unheard enemy and quite a few game bugs. 10/10 but 3/10 until the hacking is sorted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,1244,False,Recommended,I am changing my review. Before I would definitely recommend this game. But now not so much. There are too many cheaters in this game now. I experience one every 3rd game. And I am not over exagerating. I have come to ask myself how come there are so many. And I think it is becuae this game only costs around $15 in some countries. Now the crate with the lowest value can be solf for around $0.36. You can get 6 creates a week. so that is $2.16. Which means the game earns itself after 7 weeks. Now the quickest way be able to afford these crates is to win so you can accumulate battlepoints faster. I know $2.16/week is nothing for some of us. But it is just about scaling.This is also why we see so many non cheaters asians on NA and EU servers. Because the Asian ones are probably flooded with cheaters. And the cheaters migrate to EU and NA when the competition on AS become to high.What is the fix? We have to devalue the crates some how. I recommend not capping the amount of crates you get per week. The cheaters will then flood the market with a lot of crates that no one wants. Devalueing it. Making it less profitable to actually earn crates. And eventually the cost of electricity is going to exceed the proffit made from crates.So no. I do not recommend this game. Too many cheaters. EDIT I don't know whetehr the issue with the cheaters ahs been fixed but it seems like now that the prices on items are lower that they have some waht become less active to the point that there almost none in FPP. In TPP though I still find at least 1 every 3 games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,The game idea is good and at times enjoyable but the reality is there are more people cheating than playing fairly. Unlike many game play videos you see gun fights last seconds with other players snapping head shots in automatic with no recoil and at vast distances without you even being able to view where they were postioned or at other times players seemingly shoot you through walls or run up to your exact postion you were hiding to find you and kill you with little effort. The game is 50% looking for Items 40% Running due the zone shrinking 5% checking your map and 5% (if you are lucky ) in combat. The squad play is totally over run in every region by Non english speaking people making team communication hard too impossible i have only been teamed with two english speakers in about 30 squad matches in the oceania region. Still there are a few bugs but as other say the second biggest problem is this game needs a region lock/ping lock and the ability to see your accurate ping speed which the developers are only to obviously hiding due to crazy lag issues and high pingers infiltrating every region. An overall score of 3/10 is suitable for this game as the more i write about this game the more i find wrong with it. The developers are avoiding some of the major flaws in an obvious attempt to grab as much cash as possible. I looked forward to this game but it does not deserve its hype unless you maybe live in asia or sciprt and cheat. Its intial splendor is soon eroded with infuriating problems.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Change of pace playing FPS ( if you are tired with BF 1 and CoD formula ) .You can make the money you spent on it by selling crates or items. (I already did and made a profit on it D ) The Community is growing everday. They Update PUBG regularly. Reasons Not to play PUBG Potato PC ( Sorry the game is unplayable when you play less than 30fps) If you prefer FPS games Deathmatch modes the game is not for you. The game has a lot of Game breaking giltches and bugs. ( you will encounter somekind of glitch and bugs )My first match the game CRASH on me. I would still recommend the buying the game especially when you're in the Philippines the game is cheaper it cost PHP 760 ( around $15). The game is fun I hope they can get out of Early Access Next year Unlike some other Early Access games that still in it. UPDATE 1.0 release Dev. dilevered what they promise GTX 1050 could run pubg easy 1080p unlike the EA performance it gave my Zotac AMP!Edition GTX 1060 a hard time hitting 60fps in a populated area and big city Big kudos to the team Dev. bring out PUBG in EA less than a year but the game has a game breaking bugs exploding bikes when you try to stand it up ( that happen to me once) servers are full of holes (I used PUBG Server ping to check my ping) im from PH and my ping in SG is 200+ Korea 160+ Tokyo 130+ and the rest 250+ listen up Blue hole you have a large player base on PH playing on SEA with 200+ ping is not a good server to play in you can put some network status so we could see a lot more details on our status and the HACKERS i know you guys are exhausting all resources to BAN the players using hacks they ruined the game for us but saying all of that I would still recommend PUBG to anyone likes to play FPS even other genre game (Look at my list for Reasons to Play PUBG ) but address the main issue of the game.

It's a great survival deathmatch game that everyone was looking for in other games(like The Culling to name an example) that I'm sure the vast majority of players can agree that unlike others it excels in aspects that other games of the same genre fall short in. It's in fact not in full release and I look forward to it but like all good games there are aspects of it also don't like. Most of my problems with the games are minor and I can look passed but some make me livid. Let's get into it.EDIT Alright love this game great fun with other people however after playing a ton of hours into the game there's too much that makes this game not worth playing.1. Hackers Since around October 6th 2017 there's been an increase in rampant hackers. Some may argue that I'm just bad in fact I am bad at the game. HOWEVER! If you're watching the player on your team after death score headshots while HIP FIRING from 200m 300m 90% sure you'd call him a hacker too.2. Hitboxes They're crap. You should never be able to shoot someone after they're already in cover a game that's newer than a ton of old school shooters hasn't bothered nor even has the ability to fix delayed hitboxes. I even headshot a guy after he was already behind a rock 10 outta 10.3. The Devs themselves Alright low blow. But seriously the game has around 2 000 000 players which should obviously mean they've made millions of dollars. Okay where am I going with this? They have the money and resources to make the game better. But instead Brendan Greene is funding a crap movie which probably will amount to being a nothing more than a B drama when they can do what NigaHiga did.Pros Large Map Like it says it's a huge map. Guns There's quite the variety many with similar stats and advantages with their own disadvantages that are enjoyable to explore. Realistic Death Not meaning gore or anything just that how quickly one can die is incredibly realistic none of that ""Shot in the chest 30 times and still kicking"" shenanigans. One fatal mistake is punishing enough to get you killed. Gun Play Want your shooting to be realistic? They've got bullet drop they've got breathing and they've got peaking. Player Base There's lots of people no long queues to find a game. Cosmetics Are most things rare? Sure but who cares I can dress up in the most badass survival outfit or wear the most god aweful easy to see outfit. I'm hoping to see more. Crate System I like how the crates go up in price to ensure a stable economy in the game's clothes even if some are ridiculously priced *coughs* $1 300 player unknown set. *coughs*Cons Downed in a car Can anyone explain how being downed in a car flings me from it? I can understand the back of the buggy or motorcycle but in the car? That's just absurd. Healing Alright it's kind of a car thing still. Why can't I heal while my ally drives? It's a small thing but pretty unrealistic I suppose it's to avoid people from healing while being shot at but considering that my hands are free(unless shooting) there's no physical reason I shouldn't be able to besides ""balancing"" issues. Severe Bullet Drop Everyone I know agrees with me on this. I've fired the vast majority of the weapons this game features in real life and I've no idea why at the zeroing of 100m for most AR's have severe bullet drop. It's like I'm shooting an air gun and not a military grade rifle. Don't even get me started on the sniper rifles. Recoil Still a gun pet peeve. Everytime I fire an automatic weapon its recoil is so severe I feel like I'm trying to fire a 50 BMG automatic machine gun again. I know Tap fire is the only way people SHOULD shoot in real life and this game but a UMP shouldn't feel like a heavy machine gun at full auto. The Bushes If you've played the game you already know what I'm about to say. The damn bushes from afar look like a person holding a rifle with another gun on his back either standing or crouching. I swear the developers did this on purpose and I find it funny but extremely annoying at the same time. Slippery Slopes Friction is a lie. I've been walking down stairs and I'll find myself somehow on the railing and falling to my death. Rocks that aren't even steep will slide me off and damage me. Jumping It's terrible I've gotten use to the jumping but not being able to simply jump through certain windows if you're too close is extremely annoying. Most people don't even bother jumping through obstacles because screwing up can be life or death. Match Making Squads Technically not their fault. It's a minor issue but still one nonetheless. I absolutely hate being matched up with someone that doesn't speak english. Especially if they're from a different country. I want people that speak english so I can communicate and get things done not listen to someone ramble on in a foreign langauge. It's worse when everyone speaks a different langauge why are you even in the NA server?! Communication You know when you have a full team of awesome players that have a mic and friendly communicate but have that one guy that has ""mic on all the time"" and has his family arguing in the background or has a fan blowing on his face 24/7? I want to mute that guy if there is an option I've not found it. Shotgun range/scatter I feel like I'm shooting a shotgun with a 6 inch barrel and a 2 inch diameter bore. Is this for balancing or has no one ever fired a standard 12 gauge in their life? Holding your breath You can hold your breath under water for 30 seconds given the pressure you're under and amount of swimming you will be doing not too far fetched. BUT while holding your breath while aiming you get about a 5 second window. Seeing that shooting is much less strenuous I'm smelling something rather... fishy. Crouched Cover Fire Okay last gun one why is it that in FIRST PERSON while behind cover and can clearly see my barrel and sights over the wall but still shoot the damn wall? Surely I can crouch SLIGHTLY higher to shoot over a damn wall but I still manage to shoot the wall. Melee Unless you use the frying pan for covering your butt melee has no real purpose in the game except getting lucky in the first 3 seconds of landing next to some unlucky Joe.That's all I had I still love the game and highly recommend it. I had a lot of cons but again most are minor things that are just personal pet peeves. The game itself makes up for it in its gameplay and the amount of overwhelming Pros that set itself apart from games of the same genre.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only guns with some sort of recoild are the snipers and the akm the have no recoil in third person mode.

There was a time my PC restarted by itself and there was another time where I got the BSOD (blue screen of death) which sums up how much the devs care about their ""great game"". I haven't had a worse experience with a game (performance based I mean) in a long time. But PUBG just tops it for the game with the worst performance. And I am totally sure it is not because of my hardware 'cause I have a pretty good RIG so I doubt it is a problem from my hardware. Is the game good? Yes but not performance based.

2018-01-14,0,0,86,False,Recommended,PUBG Review With the full game being released for around a month now I wanted to give a detailed review of the game and what still needs to change.Gameplay 6/10 Although a significantly polished version to the early access the gameplay still suffers from lag and stuttering issues. The main stutter the bad stutter making the game unplayable has been cleared however when on the starting area and when on the plane it suffers serverly from frame drops to around half what you would normally get. It also seems to have a problem staying at a constant fps from a long period of time I was stood still in a game to test this and still had frame drops of about 4 15 fps although some may not see this difference when you play 60fps it becomes frustrating. Despite this playing is still fun and very competitive whether playing solo or with friends. The progression of the circle isn't too random or unfair to players and the weapons are balanced in both drop rates based on it's effect on a game and against other weapons(eg. a pistol doesn't destroy someone with a scar). One thing that was rather odd was the random ammo in houses I understand why this drop exists but when you find a house non looted full of ammo only it can become rather annoying. Overall good but still needs some improvement.Graphics 9/10 This games graphics can only be described through 1 word Beautiful. It's graphics are a perfect balance of performance and asthetics although the aforementioned frame drops have meant some settings have been lowered. As I find with most games the shadows effect fps quite heavly although as I don't see a huge advantage of them in this game this can be lowered with no severe issues being had in the ways of gameplay. Weirdly the effects made a big difference for me in the case of fps but when changing it no difference could be seen. The textures again weirdly didn't seem to have an effect on my fps like alot of other games do with them on very low and every thing else bar effects and shadows being on ultra I got 80 and with textures on ultra 60 70 was what I layed at. Weird but very nice to people with lower end cards. Great work on the graphics.Mechanics 10/10 This is the main part of the game which I truly felt was polished fully bar graphics and had the most work on. Now don't get me wrong driving is broken in certain vehicles and terrain but I felt as if this made the game more enjoyable and actually made me play more messing around with the vehicles trying some stunts or running people over while trying not to flip the car on a pebble the game became more entertaining with this. The drops are balanced and not overly populated in random areas they also drop better weapons less frequently a huge plus in the way of a competitive game. The circles progression is not aggressive to a point where it becomes impossible to actually stop for a moment to clear out an area while running from the oncoming circle a very well desgined feature. The parachuting is as expected working enough(the only problem I had was a visual glitch or 2) and amazingly the opening of doors is ordinary(a little anticlimatic I know). Add ons 7/10 Now this one will be brief. The cases are not bad but at the same time not great. Any microtransactions no matter what they do are good. You shouldn't have to pay to do anything in a game it should be able to earned however in PUBG's defence you can earn the crates and open them or sell them for an item you want howevr the gamescons when they were avaliable for purchase or the Desparado crate need keys which can not be earned which is a slap in the face if you earn them. However with the price of items being rather high on any item or than the basic tops or pants profit is significantly easier than CSGO although I still advise NO money is spent on crates or keys(I sound like a hypocrite if you look in my inventory so to clear that up all items I have were given to me uncased or bought using money from sold goods in PUBG).Overall 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,2213,False,Not Recommended,The PUBG developers are more interested in milking the money cow than providing a good product to their customers.

2017-11-12,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Updated review Most lag issues are fixed and it's very playable both on a mid range laptop with a GPU and on my PC at home. Haven't seen any hackers... yet.Old I enjoy this game but too many hackers. Also the devs don't seem to be making any effort to fix the lag. The game is unplayable the first minute after a drop as people rubber band all over the place. Even after a few minutes stuff like opening and closing doors will cause your character to teleport usually to the wrong side and this always happens at a crucial moment when a player is aiming at you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,830,True,Recommended,Overall it is a fantastically well put together game that is fun for most people that play it and (Just like me) people who are used to the faster paced multiplayer games like Call Of Duty and Rainbow 6 Seige because it provides a different game mechanic and a very familiar feeling to Hunger Games movie that me and my friends longed for ever since we had been to see the Movie at the cinema. With that said the developers still have a few issues to fix before the game is 100 percent there. Like the glitches and slight bug even though it is 100 times better than what it was... its still the diffrent between picking up a shotgun and shooting the guy next to you at the start of the gane or being the guy who gets shot because the game keeps you suspended above the ground for a few seconds as it hasnt registered you have actually lannded or you get 100 meters in the vicinity of a leaf attached to a branch and you get stuck there for a good 10 seconds while the game decides weather its going to release you from the ALL SO POWERFUL LEAF. But... if you're looking for something diffrent in a run and gun shooter game thats bit faster than battlefeild (most of the time) but has the same level of tactical thinking that rainbow 6 seige has then this is a MUST for you! PLUS its only going to get better!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,From me Almost the worst and the stupist game I ever played.. If you are good at FPS games don't play this trust me it only can destroy you but.. If you are the noob player and you like killing for killing without any rules then go ahead 'play' with the others.Technical Game works like you can do everything and nothing change still so we can't even talk here about optimization because there is no optimization. Example? Batman Arkham Knight works on my computer on maxed out settings smothly GTA V on maxed out settings works smothly Battlefield 1 maxed out works.. SMOTHLY! And this? You know the answer.. I can set graphic whatever I want or not and still works like .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-12,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Its controls are a mix of arma 3 and squad but with action you might find in battlefield matches that last of an hour consisting of up to 96 players. The games uses a shrinking 'area of play' random bombings and care packages to force players to coming into contact with each other creating tense nail biting moments where a nearby shot could make you yourself.There are a few cons. The servers i have played on have mostly been laggy. The graphics are deffinetly lacking (i was running it on high settings with 75 fps). And a couple more all of which i contribute to it being an early access.'*on knees* please god deliver this game from early access.Edit Makes it to 4/93 without killing anyone P,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Pros Entertaining for like one hour without friends.Occasional wacky momentsGameplay can make you tense up at times.Cons Game becomes increadibly boring on your own after about 1 2 hours.Doing squad or duo matches with random players usually gets you someone without a mic some chinese player who constantly asks if you speak chinese or the occasional player with a mic who speaks english.Chinese players come from Chine to American servers due to not having their own and lag out the game usually resulting in you dying unfairly.So yeah pubg bad game bro.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,So I bought this game with high hopes because of its immense success on Steam. I think you know where I'm going with this.My main turnoffs were Repeatedly getting killed by people I couldn't see. Yes you basically keep getting shot by people you can't see if you're caught out in the open.Unloading an entire ing clip into someone without them dying. This may be more of a personal issue. I just don't like the game mechanics I have no idea how you're supposed to get a kill but in my 3h of gameplay I failed to do so (Get good? Maybe but that would further prove how bad this game is to new players).It's very similar to H1Z1 which incidentally I hated. If you enjoyed H1Z1 this would probably be a good upgrade I enjoyed PUBG more than the aforementioned title.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,223,False,Recommended,I've put in about 40 hours of this game and I can definitely say I'd recommend it. It has addicting gameplay chasing the ever elusive winner winner chicken dinner and a really entertaining RNG system * RNG Jesus tho*. PUBG is fine going solo or joining random squads. I get some pretty good memories out of the random people I meet. It's a lot of fun to join your discord or irl buddies to play and stream it's really entertaining to watch how drunk you are later on trying to win. I just wish they would add a couple more guns and a couple more game variants. Maybe a zombie survival mode? The main problem for me is the servers the fact that it isn't regionlocked nor ping locked and just how you get connected. I have a 150mbps down 12mbps up hardwire connection and still catch some pretty crazy amounts of lag. Plus it's annoying to get connected with people you cant even talk to it makes squad cohesion go down the drain while trying to go past language barriers. Plus hackers. It's a great game with a couple annoying side bits but hey it looks gorgeous on a 1080ti and its really addicting to play. I'd give it a 8/10.

2017-11-04,0,0,1149,True,Not Recommended,How can anyone possibly endorse a battle royale based game that is riddled with parisitic cheaters. I've played a fair few hours in the game and never has the problem been worse. I thought I had perfected the art of the spray but there appears to be a large amount of individuals who can full spray you with an AR from over 200m. That's just one of many problems. The game is horrendously optimised and runs like a potato. Network lag issues are still considerable. I've been at the end of game only to have my whole squad lose connection to the server with no possibility of rejoining the game. They have failed to release any serious content since the games initial release into early access and yet they still think the game is ready for full release. I don't know what these devs are smoking but clearly there self inflated egos haven't taken a hit. Do not buy this game not now anyway. Perhaps after full release the game will receive the scrutiny it deserves and the dev's might actually do something about these issues but for now it appears they couldn't care less.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-19,0,0,463,True,Recommended,Product received for free. If ever there were any doubt that PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is one of the biggest hits of the year some new numbers last night confirmed it. The breakout shooter reached number 4 in Steam s ranking of most concurrent players ever its figure of 382 561 beating out Grand Theft Auto V and coming in behind Fallout 4. At one point Battlegrounds was also the most watched game on Twitch too a lot of people are playing and watching this game.Not bad for a game that hasn t even officially been released yet. And Battlegrounds didn t go about this the easy way. It saddled itself with an unwieldy name forcing most players to refer to it as the even less penetrable PUBG (rhymes with sub G). It also came out in Steam s Early Access program for games that are still in development with all the instability that implies. To call the game visually unappealing would be kind despite the fairly hefty system requirements and even players on powerful hardware are likely to run into major bugs.How on earth did it get so popular then? Well all you need to do is hook up your LED ridden mechanical keyboard and multi button gaming mouse to find out. I almost never play online shooters let alone online shooters as ugly and seemingly hardcore as PUBG and I m not really into watching livestreams either. But it only takes one round to understand why this game is so special.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The chinese players are polluting the servers by teaming up in solo que games hacking (most hackers contain Chinese names etc) etc.This game has been ruined by the lack of s given by the devs. Bluehole is just money grabbing from all the cheaters re buying the game so i dont think they will ever really battle this epidemic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-07,0,0,196,False,Not Recommended,This game never should have come out of early access. The only reason it came out of early access was so that they could sell you loot boxes without any negative feedback. Oh by the way you don't get to pick which loot box you want. Three of them require keys at $2.50 per key. The fourth is free but you will never really get that one anymore. The game is written on terrible coding and no matter how much they patch and polish the game it will never respond the way you want it to. Shots do not register you can't pick up items Third party VOIP services to vpice chat which meant to prevent that is meant prevent cheaters causes people to not be able to use in game voice chat if they have a certain router Most games are spent looking for weapons now because of the spawn system. You may find something other than a pistol or shotgun if you are lucky and you live long enough. Certainly not a BATTLEGROUND! Now lets talk about all the cheaters that play the game. Almost the entire community wants them to block a country like most other publishers do.

It's rare that you'll go more than 40 minutes even if you win.It has it's fair share of problems to be sure but the highs outweigh the lows.That being said they do occasionally run into issues for a day or two which is to be expected of a game that isn't released yet. We're a giant beta test group and they're learning from what happens and listening to the community. More than can be said of a lot of games.Easily worth 30 bucks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. I play it every night with my friends and thoroughly enjoy it. However with the current influx of players from china playing anything but solo or premade squad is impoossible. The North American server is riddled with chinese players that cannot speak English which makes communication impossible. On top of that their ping is unplayable at best and disconnecting at worst. This leads to situations where you can get hit by someone that you have already downed which is absolutely frustrating. Not to mention the poor netcode that fluctuates more that an SJW's gender spectrum. However these are easily fixable problems that I'm sure with be fixed relatively quickly. I reccommend picking the game up then. I however need to get back to shooting bushes that I think are people.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,309,False,Recommended,"Best $30 I've spent on Steam in a long time.The graphics are OK nothing cutting edge there. They remind me of something halfway between Just Cause 2 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl with some of the game mechanics from a Rainbow Six game. Basically the plot of the game is a Hunger Games esque large scale combat arena. You start with the clothes on your back are airdropped in at random (you choose when to jump and control where you go kinda) and find whatever you can to kill protect yourself... and ultimately you've got a 99% chance of dying every round. (literally... that is the statistic. 100 players 1 winner 99% chance of dying). SO... make it count D. Oh and those who complain about hackers... I've played 20 30 rounds so far and only ONE of my deaths MIGHT have been a hacker (possible aimbot with a map hack)... AND I reported them. The other 29 were 100% good tactics on their part/making a mistake on mine. I love the ""death cam"" for this very reason. I am able to watch how I was killed and watch for anything fishy about the circumstance. And here's the thing At any given time there is between 1 000 000 to 3 000 00 players in game at any given time... odds are if you run into a hacker you won't be playing with them the next round. I've made the top 10 in a round multiple times now it's all about tactics not running blindly in and shooting at people. Go into the game knowing that you will more likely be killed than kill it is all about survival and tactics and if you are killed unfairly... just report the hacker and start another round.

2017-07-05,0,0,396,True,Recommended,"I recommended this game around 100 hours and wrote a positive review. At the time it was EA done correctly. Updates were happening with frequency and many of the problems were minor.Now the game has been stagnant in updates (about one per month at best). The more that has been ""tweaked"" has resulted in the game crashing &amp performing poorly.I know little to nothing about game/PC performance but I can tell this game has trouble running with each addition to the game.Lastly the cheaters have nearly made the game unbearable. It's about 50/50 anymore getting into a Top 10 and coming face to face with Flash or Bullseye.I love this game the more I play it because I feel like I'm just getting better and better and compete. It's sad that my investment of nearly 250 hours at this point basically means nothing.Here's to hoping this game is still playable by the time they add vaulting &amp a new map they've been promising for awhile.PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHEATERS!!!!! This game would continue to be the most played game on PC.The only reason I have not changed the review to Not Recommended is because I play this weekly (usually with friends) and always have a great time.Having eaten a few chicken dinners affords me the casual attitude in which I now play the game for the moments &amp kills not for the chicky chicky din dins.Fortunately this aggro casual playstyle also makes the game more fun and easier to swallow when you do get botted by XQTYC3745008712.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-21,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,At the beginning I was amazed by this game. The concept of a BR game was new to me and i really liked all the different ways in how you can play this game and how differently it evolves until the end depending on where and how the circle narrows. But after a while i realized that there is something strange with this game. If you start this game you might wonder why you are bad and each kill will make you enjoy this game as much as each death will drag you down. But after a while you might feel that the gameplay lags and it's not you whos bad but instead something is wrong with the game. Conclusion there is an input lag of 18ms between a mouseclick and the firing of your gun. This means that it's not only completely different from every shooter but also very different from shooting a normal gun. With a gun in the moment you aim down sight you pull the trigger as far as possible to be able to shoot immediately without the need of tracing the enemy after you fired (don't forget that the recoil will also not allow you to trace anymore). In PUBG it's different. Instead of making single shots or burst to hit/eliminate a target you almost always spray and pray. But luckily for some spray patterns are quite vertical and can not only be trained but also easily solved by macros. together with the input lag and the need to trace every enemy to kill it's made for hackers. Aimbots and no recoil hacks are not only popular because this game is so popular. They are popular because the gameplay is kind of designed for it. I guess Playerunknown might be someone who couldn't play real shooters why he designed a game that is camper and noob friendly and mainly random to give even him a chance to win. If you want to be really good in this game you need to learn spray patterns learn the evironment and loot as much as possible to run around fully armored most of the time. and don't forget to shake. peaking has no input lag (instead of firing a gun as i already told) why you can shake your characters head quite fast. So what you basically do to win a round is loot for a gun die from someone who got a better gun or kill the first opponent hide a bit listen to the totally unrealistic pseudo binaural and asynchronous step sounds loot more until you find a long range weapon run around with a constantly shaking character in order to avoid people from shooting your head because of their input lag camp a lot and kill all the people that forget to shake their heads all the time find somewhere a surpressor and make every supersonic gun a subsonic gun without any change in bullet drop or ballistics kill the remaining enemies from behind when they don't see you. so after about 100 hours of playing i had enough. Now I play Rainbow Six and the realism of audio and the non existing input lag are such a relief. Finally I use my skills again instead of relying on some useless muscle memories ( mainly shaking and fast looting). Ahh and finally far less cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A Short StoryMy friend had to leave our squad match early and had asked us to kill him and take his stuff.Later he asked me ""How did it go?""And it was with immense pain that I told him ""It didn't. The truth was that together we had decided that once we ve gotten rid of you the dead weight we'd get rid of the rest.Indeed killing you traumatized us.Intentionally actions meant for good our heroes have finally lived long enough to see themselves become the villains of our story.Sully set a waypoint and without a word our other random friend faithfully drove up to the highest point of the hill.We all got out and waited for further instructions when Sully said to me ""I don't think we need him""Astonished I replied ""You think we can do this without him?""And he said ""Yeah I think we can.""And thus Sully began aiming his SMG at the poor fellow's forehead.Sensing only jest our teammate dodged playfully around the parked car.Little did he know that I standing behind him had received instructions in advance to eliminate him from behind.Before our teammate could grasp what was unfolding before his eyes I unloaded my shotgun into the base of his skull once and then once more.As he crumpled to the ground lifeless we could hear a disembodied voice that we could only believe to be his spirit exclaim from a distant realm ""what the fu ....""Then all was still.Realizing we have reached a point of no return we decided to drive down the hill with considerable speed in our Jeep and like a Christmas miracle we descended unscathed.But lo in my murderous act I accidentally blew out the front left tire of our Jeep and it hobbled slowly to the top of another hill the final location where all who remained would be forced to gather.Once there Sully and I planned to snipe and catch these fools these fools who would be so foolish as to be unaware of our presence. However all this time I noticed sully was....deteriorating.Hotel Wi Fi was not treating him well you see.His movements would stutter every now and then and he told me in exasperation of the things he saw but the things that were not so.Soon reality as he knew it began to distort further.For instance he believed himself to be inside the car when indeed he was out of it. He thought our vehicle was still in motion when in reality it had all but come to a halt.He believed himself to be hidden behind a rock away from view when the truth was that he was in the grass below.It saddened me that the one person who I could call my friend was losing himself in this way.Then as we waited for the circle to enclose on us Sully turned to me and said ""I have an idea. I think you should shoot me and take my things and take on entire squads"" and I said ""that sounds like a good idea but then he said ""OR we could fight. You will stand behind the rock and I behind this tree and we shall fight to the death through a DUEL!""He said this through the crackling and cutting off of his words as his hotel Wi Fi plummeted him deeper into insanity.Forced to agree to the latter option we began our firefight.Handicapped by his Wi Fi or lack thereof I was easily able to bring Sully to his knees the circle was enclosing rapidly upon us.""Pick me up!"" he cried scrambling frantically all over the ground.In full command of his life I looked down on the crippled sod and said vehemently ""Why should I? How do I know you won't kill me after I do?""And he looked up at me tears in his eyes. He replied ""You don't but people are coming.""With great reluctance I patched him up and cried out to him ""It didn't have to be this way man. It didn't have to be this way!"" while proceeding to crouch in a bush.And as Sully got on his feet dusting the dirt from his trousers he laughed ""You keep saying that. You keep saying it didn t have to be this way. You're right.""Sully pointed the barrel of his gun at me in a manner that was all too casual. It was at this point that i realized the chilling extent of his mental deterioration.The boy was mad.Before I was even able to say a word he unloaded his weapon upon my person and I fell to the ground limp and bereft of life.In the heavens now my ghost filled with woe looked down upon Sully.Without even saying a word Sully materialized a grenade from his backpack and pulled the pin. For a moment time stood still.An explosion of debris filled the sky.Sully's body slumped to the floor and once the dust had cleared all was silent save for the distant pitter patter of bullets flying through the clean Russian air.After Sully took the lives of his comrades he decided to take his own.What drove him to do this?What could have been done to prevent this?What could anyone have said?Was he not shown love as a child?Some say Sully embodies the scum of the earth a relentless killer murdering everyone in his wake without reason.Others say Sully wanted something better for himself and his teammates. He wanted to bring them into a world that was different where 100 or so people didn't have to fight each other to the death day in and day out.Scholars of this event what is now known as the ""Epileptic Mouse Massacre"" or the ""Sully Slayings"" say that it was due to Sully's lackluster internet connection and newfound evidence suggests that Sully had to attend a meeting of some sort causing him to take rash actions to for lack of a better term ""end it all.""With many questions and theories with no resolute answer to this day we are still left to speculate.This is one man's unfortunate account of the Epileptic Mouse Massacre.This is my story.**roll credits**",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Getting pump for the official release mainly grappling but in the long run if they can work out the every shrinking list of bugs the game will be one of those you can easily jump into from time to time or regularly for some good old survival/fps/rng/tactical competative gameplay. Worth checking out even in early release. Yeah it will tick you off from time to time with the occasional cheater but outside of that most of the bugs just add to the entertainment factor unless your in a top 10 situation even so that rarely happens by that point in the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-19,0,0,212,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds does what many games like it struggle to do make large scale competitive multiplayer survival gaming exciting and accessible. The premise is straightforward. Up to 100 players parachute out of an airplane onto a huge island where they must immediately arm themselves with any weapons they can scavenge from its abandoned towns factories and military bases. Over the course of each match the size of the battlefield rapidly shrinks as does its pool of survivors as players begin taking each other out. This imposes an increasingly player dense playground for shoot outs. By the end of each game the last player standing or the last team standing wins. Few of the ideas in Battlegrounds are new. A handful of survival games and mods have explored similar concepts The Culling Hungercraft H1Z1 King of the Kill and of course the Arma 2 mod DayZ Battle Royale developed by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene aka PlayerUnknown. PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds could certainly be more polished but as it stands there s no wonder this intense online survival shooter has taken off so quickly. In a genre dominated by buggy rigid sims or explosive shoot em ups the thrill of simply outliving 99 other players on one life alone is hard to pass up. I would rate the game 9 out of 10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,706,True,Recommended,Intro / TL DRPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a Battle royale shooter. It features third or first person mode. The player can play the game in solo duo or squad mode (squad means up to four players). At the start of each match a plane (flying in a random direction) forces the players to parachute onto an island. The island has a few smaller towns and a lot of wildlands. At the start of each match the players have no equipment at all and must scavenge for weapons items of healing and armor. All the while competing with the rivalling players. There is another element as well. The accessible part of the gameworld is a randomly placedlarge circle. Within this large cicle is another circle. The outer circle will shrink towards the inner smaller circle leaving anyone outside of the circle taking damage. Once the shrinking circle reaches the static inner circle a new inner circle will be drawn and another timer will start. Displaying how much time each player has to reach the inner circleBeing outside of the outer circle results in players taking damage over time. A little at first and then more and more. This game is for you if you like third or first person shooters that require patience strategy positioning good eyes and ears and a bit of luck. These are the things you will need to be able to overlook The game is in early access right now. It is a bit buggy. Specifically in teams and getting a match started. This is sometimes due to the amount of players simply bogging the servers down The game can be frustrating if you land in a faraway place find no car and end up having several kilometers of walking to do. Since the loot is random you might end up having very poor gear. You get fed up with getting headshot by a Kar98 after a while. (trust me on this) There are some cheaters. Now I don't think this has been a major problem but I've been informed that it has become a bit more common of late. You cannot heal or use items that takes time whilst moving. This includes a moving car. Even if you're not driving. The bike with a sidecar is a total death trap. Be very careful. A few tips for enjoying the game. Try to be smart about where you land. Stay away from obvious drops. Keep track of how far you've got to go to the next circle. Try to not move by way of the plane drop path or good loot spots if you want to avoid combat If the equipment you have is good then don't take chances to loot further. Think about your position relative where people dropped where people will have looted and where there is a good place to hide. This is not Quake. A good shotgun shot to the face will down anybody. In the very beginning ANY weapon is a good weapon. Avoid running on ridges. This is especially true during the foggy maps where a person on a ridge stands out like Hulk Hogan at an all girl's school Use a good pair of headphones. this is really important. If you cannot tell from where you are taking fire you quite simply will die. A lot. What did I like about it? + PUBG has no micro transactions. + The voice chat can be deactivated + The sound system is good. You learn to tell distance and direction a shot originates from with some practice. + There is no public chat. So each game will not have a chat full of 13year olds or russians saying things about your mother. There's just you (maybe some friends) and enemies. The only way to commmunicate is bullets (with voice chat off). + Each round is different. Even the different game modes play differently. It takes a larger area to loot and equip four players. It is also a lot more difficult to move four players without anyone noticing you. + The weapons have a different feel to them. I very much like this game and wholeheartedly recommends it. Despite it being in Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"I really enjoyed this game in beta playing a fair few hours on it. Buggy sure but it was beta. And there weren't even that many. And it would be completely fine if they continued improving on the game squashing the bugs and making the game run smooth like it needs to.Instead they've gone down the route of just throwing as much content into the game as possible with no regards to increasing the stability of the game. For a game that is meant to be at it's full release it is god awfully full of bugs and network issues. Honestly feels like playing a Ubisoft game at release.Rubber bandingEU servers unable to handle loadEntire lobbies being dropped out of planes all in one areaHackers4 issues that needed to be fixed before they even considered being ""Fully Released""Due to these issues I have to give it a negative.

2017-08-25,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,Do not buy this game yet. recent months influx of players have wrecked their servers and the company seems less than interested in fixing them as they try to push console.EDIT as of 1.0 It was a lot of fun. but if this is their 1.0 release I'm done. This game is trash filled with cheaters spilling over from the AS servers and the devs can't seem to figure out how put a ping lock on their servers...since that is so hard to do. I doubt they'll make it functional anytime soon if ever. At this point the game's only option is to go on sale as a cash grab before the servers crash one last time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-19,0,0,261,False,Not Recommended,TLDR unoptimized runs like crap freezes randomly stay away As of writing this review the game is running like crap hit detection is funky full of bugs and lag not to mention random freezes either in game or on loading screen which can be amazing when you play with friends and the game decides that you are not going to play in this round as by the time you load back in some one will be there with a weapon waiting for you.... These random freezes would be okay if it would happen rarely but every other match someone from the squad freezes out and it is not the hardware we range from amd 270x up to 1070 and we all have this problem.Fixis are coming as stem pull in from time to time a big update but not much change a few visual updates but the game runs the same... no major bug fixes whatsoever.Cool idea might be a cool game (probably in a year or two if it survives that long running like this) but at the moment poor execution. If you have a powerful machine might be fun when it's not freezing/crashing otherwise wait until they push out more fixes that actually fix,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG (PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS) is a bit of a odd game. The game itself is very tactical I would recommend it if there wasn't such a community backlash currently. Since around the 1.0 update the community has been throwing rocks at Bluehole due to the enourmous amount of hackers and the amount coming from one region China. Recently there has been an uproar of people tweeting on PUBG's Twitter posts saying things like ""Region Lock China"" and the infamous ""#REGIONLOCKCHINA"" spammed all over the Twitter page. The reason I can't recommend this game to you as Bluehole and PLAYERUNKNOWN might as well be flipping us off. The game is fun and all but when I am on the plane I don't like hearing some weird ""CHINA CHICKA WAW!!"" it's annoying. I wouldn't be bothered if I wasn't in the North American servers. If Bluehole could at least face the fact that a huge amount of hackers are from China than that would make lots of people happy. But they can't because that is where most the players are. All I have to say is that ""Region Lock China"" has effected the game a ton. Reviews have went down dramatically since and if not recognized sales will go with the good reviews away. Bluehole needs to get their together and face the music until then all I can say is that you should not purchase PUBG Garfield",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Some aspects of the game I absolutely LOVE e.g the thrill you get after wiping out a squador duo on your own the thrill of when you get a chicken dinner the fun you can have by playing with your friends but every game has to have its cons... PUBG can really get frustrating sometimes because yes I know its now in ""official release""but it still feels like its in BETA for the amount of glitches that are still happening like when I was playing with my friend a duo we both got four kills each and when there were two other people left (we had the upper hand by better positioning and better weapons) my keyboard and mouse stopped working in game. Now that on its own was the worst timing ever then I had to re launch the game and when I did that I couldnt continue on the match that my friend still was in so Id recommend this game if you like gambling in a way with the bugs and glitches but also of winning and feeling like you can conquer the world.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-30,0,0,53,False,Recommended,As someone who played before and after the 1.0 launch PUBG has definitely improved. Graphics are great and it's still a fun game despite its flaws. Speaking of flaws I've noticed that even still the parachute physics are quite bad and movement is really clunky. Sometimes when parachuting in the models aren't fully loaded for my surroundings and neither are the textures resulting in the surroundings being blotchy sharp bloblike objects for around 30 seconds. This game still needs optimization. However I think it's on the right track and I'd recommend buying it now simply because the goods outweigh the bads and it can only get better from here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-30,0,0,398,False,Not Recommended,This game itself is fun but Bluehole needs some iron fist to deal with hackers. I have played 10 games this afternoon each game I encounter hackers thus there is no fun playing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-23,0,0,102,True,Recommended,This is the only game on my steam library I actually paid full price for. Was it worth? I think my money was spent correctly. The gameplay of the game is intense and can get your heart racing if you actually get into the game. Some problems that I have on the game is the driving aspect of the game should be fixed. Ex. if you hit a rock with your car your car goes flying straight up in the sky and you will take fall damage and this can lead to your sad death. Overall this game was worth the purchase and the game is being improve slowly. People may see theat the game is in early access and the game will go nowhere but I see great potential in the game and hopefully we will see a full release by the end of the year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-10,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,10 hour playtime and the game crashed like 6+ times already. Or just closes itself without any error. Or just BUGs in the game and lags that i can not do anthing like moving then it lags and the house is gone then its there again etc. Really really buggy game so far its fun yeah. Its early access yeah for a reason I guess because this game is so buggy and unstable if this would be a final version it would be a joke. The game is fun in duo+ but valium in solo. Most of the time you run around and do not see any enemy at all then out of a sudden you get killed from far away and you don't even know from where exactly... same happens to everyone you do the same of course. But is it fun? No.. The close combat encounters tho are fun and very cool. In house fights and all that is great. But too often you just run around and get shot out of nowhere without even seeing your opponent. That is just dumb and not fun at all.Overall its an good game but doesn't deserve the massive hype around it not in the slightest. But it is an ok game worth it for 20 or 30 bucks depending on where you buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-22,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,Released far too early. Laggy rubber banding and RNG have made this game a complete mess. Lagging around whilst struggling to find even the most basic of items only to get gunned down by a hacker. Or someone that just had better luck than you. Or you get lucky and get a few decent items and weapons early then spend the rest of the game running to stay in the safe zone. The time for the circles needs to be increased. Good gunfights are ruined by the 2 3 minute nonsense we currently have. And either the netcode or servers are still way underpar for this game to be competetive. Most likely the netcode. You've got no excuses now Bluehole Your game is no longer in early access remember. So start spending some of the millions this game has made you. On better hardware and better developers that can fix this laggy mess. When you first land in a squad game you will rubber band back for a good 30secs 1min. Only to then find a item then spend another 10 20 secs smashing F to pick the item up. It really is a joke.So bluehole please fix this mess you've just released or do the right thing and admit that this game is still early access. Also get some cheat detection.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-25,0,0,525,False,Not Recommended,"First of all I want to say that this game is great gameplay theme weapon behavior and lot of more stuff.BUTDevelopers are focusing into most important things like emotes and achievements instead of small bugs like lags (everytime everywhere) and parachute issues when landing or make game more playable. (HUGE SARCASM)You will recieve tons of ""Servers are to busy"" messages before you start a game.Game crashes a lot! Every update more crashes.But hey we have emotes now! (I never seen someone using them somewhere else than lobby)So for now i really dont recommended this game because you die about 400% more because of lags (e.g. you are behind wall but game things you are exposed and get kill).And the inventory system? It's huge joke. I (sometimes) pickup weapon and it takes almost 20 seconds when I can use it. Or I drop item and now it's on the floor AND in my inventory for some time.btw I will probably still play PUBG D",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I am waiting like 20 minutes to ing connect to the servers because they are ""too busy"" even so I have been playing a second ago. Why the do I have to reconnect?Yes PUBG is nice and so on but there have been so many tweaks because the servers were too weak and like that for example the FOG. Why the does FOG has an impact on server performance? PUBG is fun with a team to play with of course it's frustrating like any other game sometimes but that's just normal I guess. But in my opinion you can't play it for more than 2 3 hours straight. It's the same every round so it might get boring.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,218,True,Recommended,Do you recommend this game? I am inbetween to be honest.This review may not matter since this game is hitting it's stride in popularity etc etc etc but I say you should save your money or get it on SALE?!? Don't pay full price for this game!While immensely flawed from the begining PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before. This game was a step up from H1Z1 for me to be honest. It was a fun game thrilling and adrenaline pumping and WINNING CHICKEN DINNERS BAYBAY.However This game needs a lot of work done. CONS 1.) HACKER Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers heavily!2.) Glitches people glitching around car getting stuck and exploding for no reason or the car hitting random invisiable objects and dying AFTER getting into cover somehow?!3.) Servers still lagging terribly!4.) Spawn items They're getting a tad terrible. There are a lot of places where theres ammo and no gun or vice versa. Yes no one else has landed where I landed. Please for the love of GOD get rid of the CROSS BOW!5.) DEVS They're great on some things. However they are missing the point on fixing the game first then move onto expanding the game next. They're all over the place with this game instead of fixing the current issues at hand!Last one I promise....6.) The WALL OF DOOM Please make it where you can't see out of the circle or in the circle! (Lets say like H1Z1 the GREEN GAS WALL OF DEATH) When people get screwed by the circle and honestly don't have a good chance to hunt for good loot and a vechicle. With any luck you find a vehicle you can continue to loot and proceed from there. However my point of the circle henderance would be great to add for BOTH PLAYERS DISADVANTAGES (THE BLUE WALL OF DEATH) afterall it is BLUE so why not roll with it!PROS I enjoy this game more when I play with my squads. So many things you can do to fail horribly. Laughing your butt off while driving and messing up driving over your friend or killing a WHOLE SQUAD with the UAZ. Also when you're so in depth in looting thinking you're shooting enemies while you're actually shooting teammate. There's time when seeing a downed friend run res him/her just to shoot him down again for shitz and giggles. Streaming this game and just having an overall fun time making fun of your teammates or laughing at your own FAILS on the streams are the most EPIC moments you can CLIP!I hope this helps someone out there on my PRO &amp CONS about this game!It's honestly to your discretion on what you want to do with your money!Cheers Lovely Vanyai,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can only speculate its alot of lag switching and hacks that are making this game unenjoyable. Im honestly kinda sorry i wasted 30 bucks on it tbh... For the amount of lag that you have to endure to play through a match and the attention that you have to put into selecting and equiping gear... it needs to be dumbed down. I can only hope that you dont make it as complex for the XBox one. TBH for a ""quick match"" game to just get on and split skulls... there's alot involved with the level of attention to detail that one needs to succeed... the lag only makes it depressing. I run a PC that is better than the system req's and cant figure it out. If youre looking for a new game to roll... save your money until the garbage is taken out of this one.

Youre not!!! its just your connection isnt allowing the chinese people to actually get registered hits on you and Vice Versa when Asian people play on US servers.

2017-11-21,0,0,276,True,Not Recommended,"Today i was picking an airdrop with a friend when suddenly some random guy comes in crash his car into the other side of the box and magically ""run me over"" through the drop.So i want to make a big review to make myself look profesional and a dev can read this and fix this crap of a game.Here it goes a copy of Congo's independence speech ""Men and women of the Congo Victorious independence fighters I salute you in the name of the Congolese Government.I ask all of you my friends who tirelessly fought in our ranks to mark this June 30 1960 as an illustrious date that will be ever engraved in your hearts a date whose meaning you will proudly explain to your children so that they in turn might relate to their grandchildren and great grandchildren the glorious history of our struggle for freedom.Although this independence of the Congo is being proclaimed today by agreement with Belgium an amicable country with which we are on equal terms no Congolese will ever forget that independence was won in struggle a persevering and inspired struggle carried on from day to day a struggle in which we were undaunted by privation or suffering and stinted neither strength nor blood.It was filled with tears fire and blood. We are deeply proud of our struggle because it was just and noble and indispensable in putting an end to the humiliating bondage forced upon us.That was our lot for the eighty years of colonial rule and our wounds are too fresh and much too painful to be forgotten.We have experienced forced labour in exchange for pay that did not allow us to satisfy our hunger to clothe ourselves to have decent lodgings or to bring up our children as dearly loved ones.Morning noon and night we were subjected to jeers insults and blows because we were ""Negroes"". Who will ever forget that the black was addressed as ""tu"" not because he was a friend but because the polite ""vous"" was reserved for the white man?We have seen our lands seized in the name of ostensibly just laws which gave recognition only to the right of might.We have not forgotten that the law was never the same for the white and the black that it was lenient to the ones and cruel and inhuman to the others.We have experienced the atrocious sufferings being persecuted for political convictions and religious beliefs and exiled from our native land our lot was worse than death itself.We have not forgotten that in the cities the mansions were for the whites and the tumbledown huts for the blacks that a black was not admitted to the cinemas restaurants and shops set aside for ""Europeans"" that a black travelled in the holds under the feet of the whites in their luxury cabins.Who will ever forget the shootings which killed so many of our brothers or the cells into which were mercilessly thrown those who no longer wished to submit to the regime of injustice oppression and exploitation used by the colonialists as a tool of their domination?All that my brothers brought us untold suffering.But we who were elected by the votes of your representatives representatives of the people to guide our native land we who have suffered in body and soul from the colonial oppression we tell you that henceforth all that is finished with.The Republic of the Congo has been proclaimed and our beloved country's future is now in the hands of its own people.Brothers let us commence together a new struggle a sublime struggle that will lead our country to peace prosperity and greatness.Together we shall establish social justice and ensure for every man a fair remuneration for his labour.We shall show the world what the black man can do when working in liberty and we shall make the Congo the pride of Africa.We shall see to it that the lands of our native country truly benefit its children.We shall revise all the old laws and make them into new ones that will be just and noble.We shall stop the persecution of free thought. We shall see to it that all citizens enjoy to the fullest extent the basic freedoms provided for by the Declaration of Human Rights.We shall eradicate all discrimination whatever its origin and we shall ensure for everyone a station in life befitting his human dignity and worthy of his labour and his loyalty to the country.We shall institute in the country a peace resting not on guns and bayonets but on concord and goodwill.And in all this my dear compatriots we can rely not only on our own enormous forces and immense wealth but also on the assistance of the numerous foreign states whose co operation we shall accept when it is not aimed at imposing upon us an alien policy but is given in a spirit of friendship.Even Belgium which has finally learned the lesson of history and need no longer try to oppose our independence is prepared to give us its aid and friendship for that end an agreement has just been signed between our two equal and independent countries. I am sure that this co operation will benefit both countries. For our part we shall while remaining vigilant try to observe the engagements we have freely made.Thus both in the internal and the external spheres the new Congo being created by my government will be rich free and prosperous. But to attain our goal without delay I ask all of you legislators and citizens of the Congo to give us all the help you can.I ask you all to sink your tribal quarrels they weaken us and may cause us to be despised abroad.I ask you all not to shrink from any sacrifice for the sake of ensuring the success of our grand undertaking.Finally I ask you unconditionally to respect the life and property of fellow citizens and foreigners who have settled in our country if the conduct of these foreigners leaves much to be desired our Justice will promptly expel them from the territory of the republic if on the contrary their conduct is good they must be left in peace for they too are working for our country's prosperity.The Congo's independence is a decisive step towards the liberation of the whole African continent.Our government a government of national and popular unity will serve its country.I call on all Congolese citizens men women and children to set themselves resolutely to the task of creating a national economy and ensuring our economic independence.Eternal glory to the fighters for national liberation!Long live independence and African unity!Long live the independent and sovereign Congo!""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-22,0,0,424,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Now that the game is 1.0 there is no reason for half thses issues that this game has. When it runs right it is a blast. For the other 80% of the time this game is a cespool of chinese hackers and lag exploiters. I play only on NA servers and the only thing I hear over the gobal chat is Chinese. Blue Hole needs to find some way to ping lock and actually get rid of hackers. Until then this game is mostly unbareable. I have given it more than one chance and it keeps letting me down.I would say overall this game is a blast. Bluehole is constantly updating the game and relaying information reguarding updates and server issues through their social media accounts. However there is an issue at the moment reguarding people using exploits in the code to cheat their way to victory. These accounts are becoming a rairty however it is still really frustrating when it happens. I would say overall the game is just dumb fun and at first most of the games will be quick as you get the hang of where to land to find loot and get a feel for the combat. I have had very few games give me the rush at the end of a match like when I see I am part of the final 10.

Another thing the developers claim they have fixed the cheating issue they have not. There are just as many as there where months ago the only way to fix the cheating issue is to IP ban them not just ban the account and they do not. PUBG if you want to fix your game actually fix it don't dawdle around the issue actually work on it. If you want my opinion the game was released before it should have been the necessary revisions were not made before the game hit live.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,270,False,Not Recommended,I guess I love to hate this game. This is probably the best battle royale game on the market. It can be fun and challenging. However lately I feel cheated almost every round. I am sure there are plenty of legit players out there who are crack shots but I keep getting head shot in fast moving vehicles or while running across rough terrain. When I do manage to skirt past the aimbot enthusiasts I seem to die outside the zone running from the e field in the top 10. Not sure what the point of the gas being so strong and fast in the end game but it seems to ruin the tactical environment. What was the point of finding the perfect loot when there is nothing to fight the gas? If you do get into a fight trying to move to the zone there is no point since the winner will be killed by the blue wall of shame. Seems to go from 1%HP/s to 5%HP/s in one round and tonight half of the remaining top 7 8 players were killed outside the zone. I think a great system would be to group players by class. If they have 10 kills per game they should be grouped with other players who regularly have 10 kills per game and leave us amateurs to play with like people. Probably just pit cheaters against cheaters but at least it get them out of the legit players hair. I love this game but at the current state I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-29,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,This game can be really fun however the glitches and bugs don't make me feel like it is a finished game and it still feels like this should be in early access. On top of all that the recent flood of hackers I've noticed just makes this unplayable. For example the past 4 games I've played me and my teammate got killed by blatant hackers.

2018-01-09,0,0,922,False,Recommended,So here is an honest answer from me about this game. I started playing this game from the launch of early access and have watched this game and it's community grow. During early access I do have to admit that the game did have a lot of issues. It was buggy lagged a lot had problems with server stability and fps dropping unexpectidly. The thing about all of this is that the game is still in development and it's to be expected to have this level of issues. With that being said I still believe this game is great. I also really like that the developers and PUBG team talk openly with everyone about what they are working on and changes they are doing. I do run an above average rig so this game runs smoothly for me more or less. I believe that all of the problems people complain about in this game is a result of an expectation they have on how the game should run/be. I think that if they take in consideration that this is a new team working on a huge project that they would be able to be more accepting to the fact this game has hurdles to get over. I have been very pleased with how they handle the issues and problems that arise and listen to the community and ask for feed back. We all just need to remember that this game isn't being developed by companies like EA or whatever. Give them time to grow and perfect their ability to create a game we all love and enjoy.I am a big fan of this game that is in it for the long run!PUBG keep up the good work and don't worry about all the negativity that you get from people. All great things had a starting point at one point in time. This is your starting point.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Although still in its alpha build in my opinion PUBG is one of the best and most immersive battle royale games of all time. The ability to choose which region to play in such as Asia Oceania and North America and what gamemode to play which consists of single duo and team gamemode are what makes PUBG flexible and diverse and thus players are not only able to play with their friends but also other players from different regions. However most importantly it is the gameplay that defines the game. In my opinion duo and team game modes are absolutely fun and thrilling and it is advisable for players to play with their own friends rather than strangers to receive the best experience. This is because effective communication (through mumble or discord which are my preferable communication platforms ) and good teamwork are needed to win. In addition the need to keep track of other players' locations and have high situational awareness to avoid getting ambushed and gather better loot makes the gameplay extremely thrilling and will surely keep players at the edge of their seats. Single gamemode may lack the teamwork and communication but this makes the gameplay even more challenging and thrilling. In conclusion there is great potential in PUBG and I truly look forward to its beta build's release which may consists of more gamemodes new in game equipments and features and even tournaments after the creators manage to fix the minor existing problems and bugs and polish the game up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,479,True,Recommended,In my opinion the best BR out there BUT The optimasation is ABSOLUTE SH*T I mean like ABSOLUTE SH*T (I'm running on an i7 6700k with a gtx970 and i'm still dropping down to 24fps at certain periods of the game). The worst bug I'm getting is a simple network bug where my tickrate drops down to 0.1 or something similar and it is not even possible to sprint as the game just pushes you back as if you were slow walking almost impossible to even pick up a weapon in that state. You can bug in staircases walls cars pretty much everything (rare but still happens and essentially leaves u for dead cause there is no way to escape it) The genuine tickrate on all servers is very very poor. You tend to get shot after you are behind a wall just because that extra half second the server didn't ping back your player got hit although on your screen you were behind already. Lower spec PCs will have a hard time even loading textures at the start which completely ruins all early game for a lot of people.+The adrenaline out of this game is pure gold (when this piece of junk works)+First BR that is extremely competitive+The reward for winning is quite comparable to the Dark Souls franchise for those of you who played it you know how good that feels DAll in all if the case was that I wouldn't anticipate another update from the current beta I'd say screw this piece of garbage its not worth your money but since a legit version is actually coming out soon go for it might aswell get some training in before the real game is released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If the devs actually nurtured and cared for this game it would be GOTY worthy. I don't regret picking the title up I've had some seriously amazing moments with my friends playing this game but as of late the experience has grown stale. Hacking has been a SERIOUS issue for this game you'll see players speed hacking shooting through walls being bulletproof being invisible or just simply firing into the air and getting headshots on players across the map. So as you loot for 20 minutes to get your prefered loadout 7/10 times you'll get killed by a cheater or someone with an awful ping.

This used to be ( and still is ) probably one of my favorite games and has been a total blast to play with friends. Unfortunately it seems impossible to have fun knowing youve probably got a hacker in your game and all of your trying is absolutely useless. And just knowing the fact that hackers are gonna win every game takes the whole fun out of ""having a good time even if you dont come out on top"" it seems rare to make it past the top 5 now. If i could take a look at my W/L over time im sure itd show a massive drop right around when the game dropped in 1.0. The sad thing is just that hackers arent a once in maybe 10 games occurence id say every game you get into has a 7/10 chance of having autoaiming hackers in the server. Its not even hiddne at all. most of the time its some person with a Kar98 or Automatic AR sniping from an impossible distance with no recoil in third person recticle mode. Nothing is more frustrating than having an M249 in the final 10 with 8 kills just to get shot in the head and have a frag land right next to you and instanly explode then watching the kill cam to see ""LiuXiabo123"" sitting outside of the blue zone with no damage and autoaim. I would love to be able to actually play the game more but it seems pointless as even if im in the final few theres probably an asian hacker ready to screw me with an instant headshot.

You can shoot someone in the face 30 times with a SCAR only to find out that you did no damage and then they turn around and kill you with a headshot by punching you.Even with all of these things I still can't stop playing this game.11/10Please help me now my sanity wanes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-16,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,I will admit the main fundementals of this game are REALLY fun. It has some flaws but it could have been the greatest game of 2017 EASILY. Keywords could have since the developement of this game for the past four months has been probably been the worst Developemnt and PR disaster I have ever seen in a game even beating games like Battlefront 2 and any post Black Flag Assains Creed game ever. I highly recomend you never buy this game. BlueHole decided to appeal to websites like Polygon and have labeled the calls of their Western audience to region lock China due to lag advantage and hacking as Xenophobic. Even with Battle Eye Pubg still guarenties you a hacker in every single ing game. They have had all the time in the world to fix these problems but they can't do it for some reason. I don't personally find Fortnite as fun as a good Pubg game but the devs are at least consistant. Some devs are willing to fix their games on the holidays away from their familys but BluHole cant even realise that 99 pervcent of their hackers are from the country they are victimizing. I would give the gameplay a D and the Developement an F. 0 stars and 0/10. Just play h1z1 or fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-06,0,0,36,False,Recommended,This game is good... really fun exciting and gives a stress filled yet funexperience however... this game is lost. It will never resurge as the game it once was simply for the fact that instead of improving and adding to the gameplay the developers are deciding that its smart to add microtransactions and skins. And not skins that are worth 3 dollars skins that are worth 300 dollars. Its a foolish way to die and personally I like this over fortnite however the appeal is near gone with the game and the developers can only blame themselves not the competition. For this game's sake drop the keys and do what you did before because at this rate i give this game less than a year. 4/9/2018I just realized a GIGANTIC issue with this game by playing a few games. Its SO SLOW. Every single movement is slow and it seems like on whatever planet PUBG is on it has crazy gravity because even getting out of the car takes ten years.

2017-12-09,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,No.This game is seriously terrible and i havent had any fun with it for the amount of hours i have owned it.Firstly this game barely works with absolute awful mechanices that barely work for example i was laying on the floor scoped and i couldnt unscope which led to my death.Secondly theres no hit detection meaning you die instantly as you cant see where your attacker is. This mechanic is awful. If the prey doesnt see the predator then they are dead.Thirdly the RNG is horrible i wont expand.Lastly which is the biggest point theres no way to learn via the game. if you play you will be punished everytime with no way to learn when i started i just wanted to know the basic mechanics and i couldnt as there is nothing to teach even a terrible tutorial would help but instead im thrown straight into a battleground ).In conclusion i hate this game it plays poorly doesnt make sence no retaliation can happen no way to learn the game.I honestly regret wasting my money on this broken piece of garbageI guess twitch streamers are the trash man then...Also who tf puts there online alias in their game yes a narcissistic prick that only cares abour money OH WAIT!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is the first game in a long time that has bought me this much joy to video games again. Its tense playing solo but with another friend or group its very enjoyable. This game has so much potential with at least two new maps before the game is out of Early Access and the zombies game mode. Once custom games (private matches) become available to the open public it will be great to play with a few friends in that open world battling out between your group.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-30,0,0,184,True,Not Recommended,"Been playing this game since EA came out. Was very accepting that this is an early access game and it sure does come with the bugs to prove it. All this aside the game is plagued with issues that are getting ignored the servers and netcode are absolute garbage EU servers are laggy af and the desync is at times unplayable. The way the game is at the minute and at the rate its getting ""fixed"" it is not going to be in a state for release by quarter 4 of 2017 which is what target they are expecting to meet.Also creator Brendan Green has stated that he would not add micro transactions during early access. Guess what happened? Yep micro transactions during early access. Keys will be $2.50 to open one crate with an RNG chance of getting ONE piece of the new outfits. Now yes this is vanity and doesn't impact gameplay but this is extremely shoddy business practice which I will not support. What else will they lie about in the future? How long until paid DLC? What else can we expect from the people who made TERA though? The creator and Bluehole have gotten too big for their boots and are greedy. Promises are being made promises are completely broken. Brendan Green has also stated that there will be no crates that can be opened with in game currency once the game hits full release. Also the devs are on a power trip with the ban hammer. Some is justifyable of course but people are getting banned for team killing who are goaded into team killing because they were getting shot by their own team who is trolling to purposely get them banned. So much abuse and Bluehole just ban without any sufficient evidence. However all those streamers using no recoil scripts/macros are not getting banned. Speaking of catering to streamers here's a tip Don't kill a streamer because you will be banned for stream sniping regardless of them having zero evidence. Well done Brendan Green well done Bluehole you created a fantastic game with a heap of potential and took a massive diarrhoea crap all over it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This doesn't mean that it's a bad game not at all.It's still in pre alpha so there will be annoying bugs that occur from time to time I'm happy that the developers are trying to fix them al quickly.

My only problem with the game is the loot boxes which you pay in game currency to get. This wouldn't be so bad if you could just use in game currency to buy them no. On top of using the earned in game currency you must also pay 2.50 which is really crappy. There is no other way to make your character look cool other than paying real money? That is just bad game design. But the game itself is really entertaining I stayed up til 2 in the morning playing the game. It is also very satisfying to get the upper hand in battle by sneaking up on someone with a shotgun. Although the armor in the game really doesn't help that much.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,When this game was released on steam It was something intense and fun. The future content told to us by the Dev's was a shiney set of keys dangled infront of us gamers and we clapped our hands and cheered. How ever as they become more popular.... you could see them going down the ier path of game devs.My 100% biggest issue with this game and its why I no longer play it. Is that they added the gambling boxes on additional clothing content. Hidden behind an obviously rigged system to keep the market high on their Better quality items meanwile you bust your grinding out Points to unlock a box to gain your 50th red Tshirt. I know my opinion doesn't matter this late in the game but I'll tell ya right now. Bluehole can stick it up their hole cause I won't be buying their next release. They went from Hero to Zero in my eyes cause they went down the road of Loot Boxes over providing access to content for all. The Steam Market Place is a disaster and they are only adding to the issue. Now before ya think I'm just complaining on just the loot boxes their dev practices are going down the with each patch as well. Adding features/design changes that are NOT what the community wants.They made a fun game but the path they are taking is something I personally don't want to support.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,296,True,Recommended,"(I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME AND THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME AS IT DEVELOPS BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED FOR A LONG WHILE) There are few things that I really want to cover in this review first off the developer's decisions for the game. The developers have added a lot of cools things in the game that are fun and interactive but some of those things have not been full tweaked yet so they can actually work properly for the players such as motorbikes these vehicles have been pretty broken and although they are said to be ""fixed"" are not completely fixed transitioning onto certain terrain will cause the motorbike to just completely flip over without a hill or a bump which can be devastating and rather frustrating while trying to play the game. Second off there is always a problem with the game after an update once they update their game there is always an unecessary amount of screen tearing and frame drop making the game unplayable and what's the point of buying/playing a game that you can't even run despite having the ""System Requirements"" for it. Finally they implemented the crate and key interaction in the game which they claimed for it to be necessary before the launch of the game which this may be true that they must test it first they should be more focused on making the game more playable before they worry about adding cosmetics into the game and they should implement it of the test servers first allowing people to have interaction with the crates and keys without having to spend their money on them first before actually trying them out on the real game it just seems rather unecessary for the developers to think that they ""need"" to do something like this on the actual game rather on their test servers first which is the whole point of the test servers to TEST their additions to the game.May I add I really do like this game and want it to be successful but it's hard not to try to say anything when there are just so many unecessary things being added to the game before it is actually out and released.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-19,0,0,480,False,Not Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is my first dive into the battle royal competative game style. I was always a fan of the simple shooters as in CoD because there was no rush aspect. After countless hours of being ditched by my friends I decided to get the game for myself and see what the fuss was all about. Shocked does not even begin to describe my reaction after jumping out of the plane for the first time. The panic racing around trying to loot for a weapon really got my blood pumping and my hands shaking. While I should probably get that checked out by a doctor it just makes the truth more prominent this was my type of game. I knew from then on I was addicted and I hope you have that same experience if you give this game a shot. Whether you want to go lone wolf or play with some buddies this game is worth it. Unfortunately with other battle royal games coming into the light I can't dissmiss the problems this game currently has. The lack of quality updates really puts a stop to this games progression. I won't sit here and pretend I understand coding or what it takes to fully develop a game but I will sit here and judge it like a player should. Games are made for gamers and when the games are no longer keeping the player in mind failure becomes present. I have tried other battle royals like Fornite and the differences are astounding. Keep this in mind when deciding on purchasing this game. TLDR Pros Fun with friends(also alone)Great gunplay experienceNot a difficult learning curveEasily addictiveCan last for hours of funCONS Lack of proper updatesFPS issuesTakes a beast to run properlyRNG circusPersonally I would not recommend this game to new players because it still doesnt feel like a complete game. I have many hours into this game and I enjoyed it immensely but when change doesn't come we change games. Once the game feels good again I would recommend it 100%.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,594,True,Recommended,"Can't wait to see where this game goes and what they add. You're going to die a lot every round actually. Sometimes at #67 and other times at #7 but that's kind of the point to keep dying and trying. And not matter how frustrating it is to have died this way or that you'll keep playing because there's nothing like quietly looting a small compound and then your team hears a vehicle coming in from the West. You all post up ready for the ambush suspense turned up to 11 as you try to get a visual someone in your squad will see them drive behind and enter a house to the NW 50 meters. The next thirty seconds fly by and a squad mate makes contact from the second floor and just like that the fights on and now you've turned the knob to 14 on the action and you can hardly keep your rifle straight with the adrenaline. The other team pushes and your squad mates are yelling out positions and movements as you wait for the breach. You switch your SCAR to full auto and hope they don't have grenades you see the first hole blown in the door and can barely make out the sound of the flashbang that follows bouncing on the floor over the shotgun blast. Falling back to the kitchen to avoid the flash you hear the door open and the fight is now inside less then 15ft away and this is it this is where you die or you survive. You peak the corner to fire and the most intense fifteen seconds of the game insue as you have an all out firefight in the living room of some two story bungalow between you and the two enemy players trying to push up the stairs. Somehow you make it and you only took a few rounds. You yell out for cover as you cross to the opposing building pumped and out for blood after your stroke of success. A well placed frag through the second story window pushes the last enemy squadmate downstairs where you drop him with a quick burst of fire as he's coming down the stairwell. You've made it you've won and the exhilaration is intoxicating and now it's time to loot. Grabbing a few much needed things off the dead player you go to move back to your squads postion only to hear screams of ""CONTACT REAR SE 140 DEGREES TOP OF THE HILL!"" and your dropped out in the open by a headshot from a Kar98 from a player you never had a chance to see. And you do it again and again because there's nothing like that moment in the bottom of that bungolow testing yourself against other players and surviving the fight.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I bought this game in September and since then it has developed very strongly it had some problems but it was still in ""early access"" and I did not pay much attention to the flaws but now it have been three months since the premiere and the number of bugs does not dissapear but even increases. With every update they fix 1 2 things and break another 5 developers give us a lot of statistics abount the banned cheaters but yet me and my friends are dying every second game because of someone with no recoil or autoaim. Sudden framerate losses T vehicle physics constant problems with servers lags and HUGE AMOUNT OF CHEATERS is too much for a ""complete"" game that we have to pay full price for. I also feel like 9 out of 10 games I can't find a weapon and yet the enemy in building next door comes out fully equipped and kills me with an m14 or scar but I'm trying not to look for a conspiracy theory here but it really feels like sometimes this game just tries to with you. I think that developers prefer to focus on stupid crates or useless emote system instead of fixing the issues I have mentioned and these are not all the problems this game has.

2017-07-22,0,0,152,True,Recommended,If you don't know what this game is well it is a multiplayer survival game where you have to loot buildings to get weapons supplies clothes etc. The goal of the game is to be the last person and/or team standing. Now onto the review the game itself is extremely fun to play with friends and I recommend it to anyone that has a small group of people to play with however the game is still very good when playing solo. If you enjoy H1Z1 King of the Kill then I believe you will definitely enjoy PUBG. The games themselves are based on the same idea and the goals for the games are the same. I personally believe that PUBG is better and is more fun to play though. The game struggles with performance for me and many others. PUBG causes low frames and it has crashed for me a few times since I started playing it. I have also seen a situation where my friend jumped out of the starter plane and no buildings loaded for him and he was just constantly walking into a tree because nothing was rendered in. However problems are expected because this game is still in Early Access. Overall I definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys high intensity survival games. I believe that this game was a good buy overall and I've had a lot of fun playing with friends. I can give this game a solid 8.5/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I cant wait to see how this game turns out. 3 more maps out by the end of the year word. The only negative with this game would be the graphics.

2017-08-03,0,0,510,True,Recommended,All these reviews about micro transactions are . I understand where they're coming from but what they don't seem to get is that this case is in the game so that it can fund a PUBG tournament. It is literaly here to promote a professional level for a game that is in EA for 's sake. This game is so incredibly fun to play. With friends you can have so much fun screwing around or even treating it like ARMA. However unlike H1Z1 I actually love to play solo in PUBG. The thrill of winning your first dinner is amazing and its just as fun the more you play. Obviously it has bugs because its in EA (hopefully for like another few months) and yeah it has cosmetics you can buy but you can also get them all for free buy wining and getting kills and getting points to buy crates. I'm glad it has the market it allows the game to have a fun trading economy and supports the devs. This game is soooo worth the $30 and when it's out of EA it'll be as valuable as any AAA (even though it'll stay $30). I hope everyone gets to try it and while it may be hard to run now all that is in the process and everyone of the monthly updates helps that along with pushing new guns fighting systems maps and more. If you don't buy it whatever if you do though enjoy your first Chicken Dinner because it's an awesome feeling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,0,0,79,False,Recommended,The game is as extremely fun as it is agrivating. The initial zone decrease in size is too extreme. by the time you find some decent gear and start heading towards the target your usually caught in the death zone because it moves 30 to 40 percent faster then you can possibly run. If you ARE LUCKY and land your self in a good area near the target you are set find gear and wait. I notice some players seem invulnerable can hit them point blank in he face and they still kill you first and walk away..total bull..I would love this game if it were the same design without the shrinking zones and have the ability to create a combat guild/company of mercenaries etc. Take control of an area defend it and have a respawn system where you start in the plane and drop as usual except there is no time limit a persistent world maybe even add some pve rouge ai.The pay to open a cosmetic crate is absolutely nutz.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then came the bad parts and they are real bad Guns themselves are good but the gunplay is a complete lottery Hitreg is horrendous desync frequently happens superbullets are more frequent than non superbullets. No ping lock means that 50% of the server is currently running around with 250+ ping which leads to one getting shot through walls behind cover etc. It's impossible to lead a shot correctly as you have no clue if the guy you're aiming at has 50 ping or 400. Language barrier You can't queue for duos or squads alone due to queuing with massive amounts of non english speakers. Bugs lag rubberbanding bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs EVERYWHERE. Cheaters everywhere. Not trying to hide it. Bluehole patches it cheaters still there.Untill they decide to match players with similar ping and start beefing up their serverpark this game is a complete lottery.

2018-02-13,0,0,583,False,Not Recommended,"So when I first got this game a few months ago it was grate I didn't see any cheater that I knew of and was happy to play it. Yeah that lasted about a week... Now there are so many asians playing on the NA servers that I refuse to play with any randoms. Every time we would go into a lobby with a random player they are asian don't speak any english and scream constantly in their language with either a TV or 10 other asians in the background screaming. That and every cheater that I have come across and I mean every cheater that I have seen in game been killed by or hell just watching the kill feed for the first five minuets and watching them kill 20 people in the beginning of the match are all asians. Now they apperantly added a ""new"" Anticheat. Yeah it's changed nothing. They banned 1.5 Million people in December according to what Battleeye has said but the game is so full of cheaters that after a certain point in the day it's unplayable. When they can sit inside of a house and just one shot everyone around them while facing the floor or wall it's just stupid. PubgCorp/Bluehole will not do a damn thing about this they may tote some ""New Anticheat"" every once and a while but that won't do crap. I didn't believe in the whole ""Region Lock China"" thing until about two weeks ago when every third or fourth game there was an asain (probably chinese) just knowing where everyone was no matter what auto aim locking onto targets having no recoil shooting through buildings/floors/hills and killing people in one shot reguardless of what equipment that person had. Reporting people does nothing you might report them and in about four weeks they might take a look at it with the ammount of reports going out. They won't do a single thing about the whole Asians playing on North Amercian or Oceana or even EU servers because if they did then they would lose money from their Chinese friends. This is just becoming a money grubbing game for the devs and PlayerUnkown himself. As long as the millions of chinses players are giving them money they could care less about what happens. It's just rediculous. They ban them then the banned person buys another copy and goes right back to cheating thus giving money to bluehole/pubgcorp.

2017-12-20,0,0,291,False,Recommended,Really fun game especially when you team up with your buddies. The game has a lot of good and bad points to it. For the good 1. 100 person multiplayer2. great graphics (as long as you got the GPU for it)3. very competitive4. lots of guns5. weapon customization6. vehiclesetc...for BAD 1. CHINA CHINA CHINA2. still has bugs3. only two maps4. hackers (though not as many since last update)5. can be repetitive6.

So your stuck in 1st person the whole game and then when the 3rd person peek behind cover is needed you cant use it and you get destroyed by people using the 3rd person peek. Its a preety good game and is pretty optimised unlike what other people say it is i have a i5 6500 with a gtx 1060 3gb and 16 gigs of ram and it runs smoothly 60 fps with some very low settings a few high and ultra settings and motion blur witch makes it not look like a potato but still have the same advantage with people with all settings on very low.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Maybe if they didn't worry about loot crates and more about the damn hackers maybe this would not have been a problem.

2017-07-20,0,0,503,False,Not Recommended,"**UPDATE AFTER 7 MONTHS**As good as this game is I cannot play it any longer nor would I recommend it to anyone else soley because of the insane amount of cheating going on. The last couple of weeks I played it ( early mid Jan) it seems every other match had people cheating. The worst part is becasue it happens so often it makes me question every death. Did they have ESP or Wallhacks? They seemed to know exactly where I was even though I hadn't moved or had a chance to be spotted by anyone. It has literally created such a bad taste in my mouth that it wasn't worth playing anymore. I moved to Fortnite where in a whole month of playing I haven't run into a single player that I suspected was cheating. Hopefully one day the cheating will be fixed I understand you can never stop it all but harsher punishments and ping lock seems to be the only answer at the moment. PUBG corp take what Fortnite has done with their anti cheat and apply it I know you both use Battleye but something you guys are doing isn't working. This is a review coming from a guy who hasnn't won a chicken dinner in over 30 hours of playtime. This game is great the circle that keeps closing in on you and forcing everyone to the ""middle"" makes this action packed at some point during the game and It supports all different styles of play.

It's absolutely top notch development and I must say I am quite impressed with the developer's. Great job! I very much enjoyed playing a couple day's but it became very apparent you have a persistent hacking/cheating problem. I wish you all the best in your efforts to control this.

2017-07-05,0,0,1747,True,Recommended,This is a great game that is on track to becoming polished for the FPS community.It is pretty simple either you are going to hide and chase tail the whole time trying to survvive or you are going to load up with a couple enemies a few hourses away and prepare for hunting season.The updates/patches really do improve gameplay every time. I am really hoping they improve the Pioneer Crates and what is available out of them without turning this into some p2w game. People that complain about the game either should be playing something much more simple like Solitaire or have as much a stable connection/ rig as Trump's mouth.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-06,0,0,97,True,Recommended,To start off yes I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS's. But there are some things you need to going into it.1st. This game is extremely choppy I have a GTX 1060 with an i7 6900k and on medium it stays at 70 but every 5 seconds it dips down into high teens low 20s. 2nd. It is an early access game but the developers update it about every month.3rd. It is a very skill heavy game it isnt like any other FPS in the fact that you can work your off for 15 minutes collecting the best and most perfect loot and get killed by some dude on a hill with a sniper. You will want to take your monitor and smash it over your knee it's terribly rage inducing. 4th. I would reccomend getting a squad. It really does help. Playing solo lowers your odds of winning by a substantial margin and who doesn't want to win?5th. It is early access no game is perfect and this one certainly isn't.Have fun getting chicken dinners.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,392,True,Recommended,Huge overview of the game is below.The best early access game I have ever bought. I enjoy the constant patches and additions of new content even though it is quite a solid game in concept and realization. There is no P2W. Some comestic items are traded among players these do not affect gameplay in any way.Game is 65% luck and 35% skill. Very fun to play in a group of friends whether casually or more seriously always a few laughs to go around with more serious players delighting in the precise murders and the casual ones laughing at funny situations given by the game or by choices made.Players (Typically around 100) are parachuted onto a 8KMx8KM island. A pickup of guns and supplies ensues with more thrill seeking players going to large (and more loot filled) areas and players who enjoy getting their feet under them drop for secluded areas to begin gearing up. In the populous areas the vast majority of the game's killing is begun with those surviving having superior loot and supplies while the secluded have a guaranteed pass into mid/late game. The risk taking players will often have the advantage through use of scopes (4x 8x) being typical while secluded players may not find scopes to the same degree. Then said players will have to stay in a reducing circle. This circles doesn't reduce in the center of itself instead chosing a point inside of itself to become the new center point if the boundary of the new circle does not exceed the boundary of the old circle (there is no currently known formula for this.) With a reducing circle players are ever increasing brought into combat with eachother. While early in the game players may choose to watch others walk by without elminating them it becomes increasingly redundant to waste opportunities to kill other players when those said players will be those whom you come into contact with later. The last few circles in the game plays a large factor in the winner of the game with those who are in the next circle will have a large advantage in maintaining their cover and are able to pickoff those who have to advance from their place of safety. The last surviving in the game is the winner of a chicken dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,218,True,Recommended,Really fun game to play with friends. Using a good Anti Cheating system which leads to a lack of cheaters. This game is meant for the players who have good sense of survival and good on spot decision making. I totally reccomend this game whether you know how to player or not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-16,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,Sorry but i don't understand all the hype about this game(and yes! i know the game is in an early stage and it will get better optimize ''later on'') if you're into camping and not doing nothing or running for a long time after you got your loot just to get randomly killed from who knows where then this is your game!!! The island is too big and it feels like there's only 10 cars in the game(it's dumb to die outside the blue ring because the next zone is all the way accross the island! with that size of a map and the game mechanics of keeping you on the move it doesn't make sense the low amount of transportation) This game doesn't even feel close to being competitive at all yes you land unarmed like the rest of the players but it's all about luck whom ever gets a good gun first wins btw if the sole purpose of the game is to kill eachother why isn't there a larger amount of weaponry all over the place!!!!! Personally i don't recomend this game but neither i dislike it maybe i'll just wait a year or two to see this game runing as intended.

2018-01-30,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,"You know when in early access I liked this game. It was a fun game to play with friends and mess around with them. But now after the official launch this game has gone to utter trash. Not only is there now microtransactions which make me feel taunted by the crates telling me ""yo you're so poor and we here at PUBG Corp want all of your money even though you supported us in Early Access"". Not only that but it is bugged to hell. Sometimes I hear myself getting into the plane dropping in the AFK Zone and dying to an AFK griefer all while my game is still loading. Not only that but it is subject to crashing. In tense moments or even just looting sessions my game will crash and I'll have to reopen it where I'm either already dead or the game tells me it is unable to let me back in despite giving me the option to do so. I don't blame it all of PlayerUnknown himself. I blame it on his ego and the yes men over at PUBG Corp agreeing with all of the man's statements knowing full well it puts off the community.Some of my blights transcend bugs and go into the game itself. Shotguns spawn more than blades of grass the fun weapons like the AUG or Groza are locked behind the crate drops which are infested with people and mid game is either running around or getting shot by a sniper that only saw a pixel of your head.Overall if you want to get this game take caution. If you have friends who own the game as well play with them. This game is at its peak when you are with your friends. If not stay far back.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,288,True,Recommended,PUBG is a fantastic game and it's a ton of fun whether you have people or not to play with. I'd recommend playing squads with a friend if you get the chance because the laughs will definitely ensue. The wide variety of vehicles guns and playstyles really appeal to a majority of players. And nothing is more satisfying than getting a Sniper Rifle with an 8x scope and shooting someone in the head 300 meters away.PROS Lots of variety in vehicles and weaponsActive playerbaseCombat feels relatively smoothHuge updates every month and minor updates bi weekly.Character customization with lootcrates that you can purchase which award you different clothes.CONS Doesn't handle well on lower end computersMemory leak makes it so you have to restart the game every 3 4 rounds you play.Overall the game is in a great stage right now for a early access game with the full release being released scheduled at latest by October. The developers have been super helpful and interactive with the community and they've already teased the release of a new map which is going to be desert theme. PUBG is definitely around to stay and if your computer can handle it I highly advise it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,16,True,Recommended,"After hesitating really hard on getting this game I finally caved. Not at all disappointed!PROS Great gunsDecent firing mechanicsGreat places to hide semi realistic camo systemHuge array of guns you can findHuge array of places to goLots of people to kill....or be killed by.It's really really haunting to be out in the middle of a field hearing gunshots everywhere but seeing nobody. Eerie as !CONS A tad laggy here and there. I defintitely dont see the lag a lot of people complain about but it's there. My rig is pretty beefy and it does jitter on occasion but it's playable on Ultra for sure.Cars feel really really fake. But that's OK. The driving mechanics are floatier than GTA IIIJumping mechanics are essentially useless. You jump like Luigi and then randomly cant get over walls if you're not running at them dead on.Lag spikes Not network (in my experience so far) but graphically. I have a 1070 FTW edition card kinda weird that such a game would cause graphical stuttering...Graphically related to the above the game is pretty ugly. Lots of fuzzy edges lots of low quality textures weird character movements etc. Which isn't bad just cos the game doesn't look like the most amazing thing since real life doesn't take away from the game at all. What DOES take away from the game is that the graphics are as bad as they are and the game lags. At the quality of the game with a 1070 or even 1060 for that matter you should be able to rock out at 120FPS all day on Ultra. But that's totally alright with me since it's still VERY playable.Personal notes I havent actually seen any ""hackers"" that people keep refering to. I understand there was a huge issue with that recently but after playing a dozen or so rounds I have yet to see any hackers at all. Im not sure if it's simply that people are salty and as a result SAY it's hackers or if it's that I've just been lucky. Either way I havent had a bad experience yet even if I suck at this game.Network lag spikes have only occured on one match so far and I only barely noticed it. One input command was a tad laggy then I was fine from there. Obviously the creator of this game likely did not expect it to be as popular as it has been so natually it's going to take time to scale out the servers to the degree the demand requires. So I wont mark them there at all.All and all considering this is Early Access (although as I understand it they're already making an Xbox port? Wat!?) and considering it's quality so far Im pretty blown away. I didn't honestly think such a simple formula could be so damn fun. But it is and I think I'll be playing this for a long time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-18,0,0,559,False,Recommended,This game is a real fun time and addicting! Definitely recommend.Edit I now have nearly 400 hours in this game so I thought I would update my review. I still recommend it (any game I can play for this many hours is obviously a game that I enjoy) but it definitely has it's fair share of issues. The game is still very poorly optimized runs inconsistently it's buggy and rampant with cheaters (playing FPP helps greatly in that area at least). I'm not sure these are things that will ever be fixed with a newbie company like Bluehole. That said I still get great enjoyment and satisfaction out of this game on a regular basis. I think it really says something that so many people are willing to put up with the extensive con list it's extremely satisfying when you win a tough battle or win that chicken dinner. So if you somehow haven't purchased this game yet proceed with caution. But it's my personal opinion that it's worth it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In today's world you will never fully satisfy each person. So instead of my moaning and groaning about microtransactions optimization etc. I'm going to give my opinion on what I think on this game. #1. The damage aspect with shooting a person needs repaired. I don't see much difference between lvl 1 and lvl 3 gear. #2. Driving vehicles. Also dislike how hitting the smallest bump makes you instantly roll. #3. More RAIN )#4. A bug where items that spawn in are unreachable (items spawning under items and you can't pick up.I have more problems with this game but it's mostly what everyone has already said. (well other than the fact that you broke a promise......) ( lol. I know that over time this game (as well as others) will be fixed once the issues are tracked and researched. I would buy this game 10 times over if I had to without a single hesitation. It's adrenline pumping fun in my books. One of the only games that I play where I get shot from a unknown location and it makes me jump.

2017-07-26,0,0,428,True,Not Recommended,"Very good game netcode is a little rough though. I don't like the concept of micro transactions. Whatever happened to releasing full games for retail? Companies now days are all about the ""cash grab"" I mean who isn't about the money we all our but once all these companies seen how good releasing alpha games are and keeping them in that current state for years they come up with another scheme by doing micro transactions. Look blue hole you have made millions of dollars by releasing your game in early access we funded you the money for gamescom. How about you do us a favor and hold up to your promise and release micro transactions when the game is in its final state. You can fund the esport event with OUR money that you have profited from. On another subject joined squad match today everyone placed markers where to drop at. I was the only one to drop there. Killed 3 guys got downed teammate revived me said ""hey hey look look here"" I said look at what. He shot me and killed me.

2017-07-26,0,0,582,True,Recommended,Pros Skydiving so you can chose where you want to go RNG weapons and gear spawns you can find any spawn anywhere Restritching player area to force the game to move forward Tons of guns most feeling unique and different from each other Great map with a wide aray of bioms and scenery Fast quene time almost never have to wait for a game even streamers with high MMR usually do not have to wait long Game looks and feels good graphicallyCons Game is quite render intensive making lower geared computers or slower internet speed have issues(I personally have 0 issues but some of my friends do) Server are still new this is early access so sometimes they can lag up some days better than others overall they are stable now as I am writing this RNG is a great thing as well as a bad thing sometimes just learn to deal sometimes you and an enemy drop next to one another and you find a pistol and he has a Assault riffle. On the flip side this has happened and I killed the guy with my pistol. This game is awesome it combines a ton of different elements making a fun interesting game. There is a huge RNG element which makes games feel different each time u play(good and bad). It is a shooter(3rd person atm but they are working on releasing 1st person only very soon) so experienced fps players will feel that same rush and have some game sense that will help succeed. anything you buy in game is cosmestic only some are getting upset by this but its cosmetic it literally does not matter if you do not want the items then do not buy them. I give this game 5/5 stars love the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,153,True,Not Recommended,EDIT see below for original review Well the devs have just confirmed they are going back on their promise and adding in loot crates before even leaving early acccess. Considering the other things that need attention and the millions they have already madem this is completely unnacceptable. And they also confirmed that it will use the horribly exploitable CSGO system. Extremely disappointed would return the game if I could.ORIGINAL REVIEW I'll be honest I expected to refund this game. I'm not going critique gameplay details as I'm sure you already know what a battle royale style game is like. It has surprised me with it's level of polish and accessibility that this genre (that I'm not a fan of) always lacks. I generally don't trust the developers of these kinds of games but the PUBG team has shown a surprising amount of dedication so far. The optimization patches have clearly done their job as the game runs flawlessly on my PC. If they can maintain support this is shaping to to be an amazing game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-08,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Sadly I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Whilst the game itself is good it suffers from some issues including bad performance on high end systems (I'm only getting 45 FPS on low settings with an AMD Ryzen 7 1700 and Nvidia GTX 980) and buggy netcode. Until these issues have been fixed I don't recommend buying it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-08,0,0,145,True,Not Recommended,So....to start with PUBG at its core is a good game. The concept is great and fun and I've had a good amount of fun on it. The combat is tense and breaks away from the normal fps formula you'd find in CoD and other fps games on the market. However the problems I have with the games come from the fact that its still buggy as hell. Yes its early access but in the months I've played this I still run into bugs that haven't been touched (swimming under the map and such) the devs rather focus on making money on microtransactions and getting into the esports scene rather than finish a unfinished product first. The optimization is poor. I run this on a pretty budget build but its not a toaster rig. 8gb ddr3 RAM FX 8300 8 core processor and a 1060 6g nvidia card well exceeds its minimum requirements....yet I still get problems with loading into the map and the infamous texture bug that's only gotten worse as the game has updated. Character customization is a joke when you get your clothing in lootboxes....and whats worse is its one piece of clothing per box at a time. Trust me I have no doubt you'll see the typical microtransaction practice for Bluehole to partake in the glorified digital gambling BS that's dominated the industry. Another problem I have is the fact that the game doesn't really promote team play. You'll get less points for playing in a squad than playing solo. Even if you do worst in solo you'll get more points that way. So yeah in its current state I cannot recommend this game. Pros Fun gameplay and good conceptnailbiting tense gunfightsCons Crap business practicesPoorly optimizedDoesn't reward playing with friendsBugs that haven't been addressed in months,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-08,0,0,169,True,Not Recommended,While the game was very enjoyable at the start the hackers have taken over. Played 6 games back to back only to be killed by hackers. I would reccommend avoiding this game until the issue is fixed. Before this issue I would have rated PUBG very highly. Borderline unplayable,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-26,0,0,138,True,Recommended,If you have an interest in the battle royale genre or games along the line of DayZ PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is definitely the best iteration of it. It's a relatively simple gameplay loop that's very enjoyable and replayable. You queue in to Solo Duo or Squad matches where your team size is capped at 1 2 and 4 people respectively. 100 people max per match but if there are unfilled teams or people dropping out the number will be slightly less. You can queue by yourself into Duo or Squad if you want to be alone vs teams or if you want to join another team that is short players.The dev team has frequent detailed communication and I've been pretty happy with how they've handled things. Patches and updates are regular and come with appropriately informative patch notes. Large additions to the game have been announced (vaulting/climbing new maps first person only servers) and will add a lot more variety to the game.The only thing I don't like is the zero tolerance team killing rule that punishes players in situations where it isn't justified but in all honesty it's not a huge issue.The current controversy in PUBG is the cosmetic microtransaction model showing up temporarily in EA. Normally I'd have a problem with it but this is a test run that is supposed to only last for the tournament period. Yes they said they weren't going to have paid microtransactions in EA but there also weren't going to be any tournaments during EA so I can wholly understand bringing in paid microtransactions as a test run and to fund the tournament.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,181,True,Recommended,I have always hated this type of games (Battle Royal) but this game has completely changed my mind.This game is an amazing intense and hilarious experience when playing with friends.Even when playing solo I have had a lot of funny and awesome experiences. I love the generous amount of items you can find all throughout the map. It takes little time to get into the game's physics and workings.Ofcourse there are and will be bugs (especially when spectating teammates). But then again at the time of posting this poorly written and constructed review the game is still in it's Early Access stage. I just hope it doesn't end up like DayZ and H1Z1 (which I doubt).Do not jump out of moving vehicles! Makes sense.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-19,0,0,94,True,Recommended,Altough it had some flaws and technical issues at the beginning this game is pure fun (especially with a mate or in a squad). Solo is interesting as well but PUBG offers its full potential in Duo/Squad Mode with friends connected via voice chat. Can be frustrating sometimes if lag or desync is messing with you but overall very good value for an Early Access title. Hope the devs will continue the great support and I'm already looking forward to the vault system and new maps!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-19,0,0,16,True,Recommended,If you enjoy losing this is the game for you. Seriously. Go play it. And lose. And then lose some more. Take a break. When you're ready to lose once again this game will still be here for you waiting patiently like an abusive alcoholic uncle with a leather belt and a bad temper. I recommend this game for sick demented people who enjoy frustration.Ok. If you want more of a description than that here goes. PUBG is a tedious game of long bits of searching looting and running to an ever decreasingly sized play area. Luck is a huge factor as it will determine where the play area moves to and what kind of loot you find while searching. Once in a while you'll encounter other players. This is where the game becomes fun and frustrating. Fun in the since that it's exciting. Unpredictable. A rush. Frustrating because you'll probably not survive all of the encounters and get yourself a chicken dinner. Later rinse repeat.That's the entire game. I know it's early access but I still think that even with more maps this is all the game will basicly ever be. I rate this game a solid 715 bowls of puke out of 1156 bowls of puke. I personally don't like it all that much but the game runs fine and does what it sets out to do. It doesn't deserve a thumbs down. It doesn't realy deserve a thumbs up either. What it really deserves is a big fat raised middle finger. But since that option isn't available I'll give it a thumbs up. Due to the fact that the game isn't broken it's easy to find a match and it can be exciting at times.But mostly you're just gonna get mad. Don't say I didn't warn you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you haven't played a Battle Royal game yet imagine skydiving into a giant island and then playing the Hunger Games with 99 other people as the map slowly gets smaller due to an electric wall that closes in every few minutes. The guns and recoil are a little more realistic than other games in the genre. But the Minimap and Nav tools are way better. You always know exactly where you are and can usually guess if you can get to the safe zone before its too late. There are attachments for guns the med items take time to use but are all instant heals. There are definitely some development issues that need addressing. The FPS is really bad and the graphics are very glitchy. Hopefully this will all be addressed before the game leaves EA. Despite all its faults I LOVE this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-14,0,0,49,True,Recommended,I Abosolutly love this game. Its very fun even if you are getting sniped from across the map its fun to figure out where they are. Getting kills in this game is very satifying. Its fun building up to that win and to know you played better then 100 people. The only problem (which is a very big one unfortunetly) is the optimasation. It is really bad Which being honest is expected in an early acess game. my pc is pretty bad but even then i should not have to play at 720p in order to get 30fps. to play well you have to be able to see your enemy in the giant grass and 720p is not great for that. However a good thing in this game is IMO FPS doesent really hinder you that much. It would obviusly be better to play 60Fps But its not impossible to play at 30FPS Or even 15 (although at that point just upgrade though). But again like I said this is an EARLY ACCESS game. Later on the optimasation will definently get better and the game will be better aswell.TL DR Its a good game but the optimasation is bad since its an early access game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've gotten better at it but as I've gotten better the game appears to be deteriorating in quality development and coding. At the same time the floodgates of cheaters and hacks have descended upon the NA servers which appears to be a direct result of 1) Paid crates with superrare items people are selling for hundreds of dollars on the Steam marketplace 2) The Tencent debacle of a parternership bringing the game to a wider Chinese auidience who amazingly seem to be the source of about 90% of the cheats.

2017-10-09,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,I really like the idea of PUBG but I really regret playing more than 2 hours of it. I've never really liked the idea of early access due to the possibility of devs becoming lazy and charging full price for an unfinished game that will never be finished. Exactly like this game. One of the top games on steam still hardly runs properly.Also the haste of the game puts me off a little too. Feels more like a running simulator trying to get inside the safe zone constantly. A LOT more work needs to be put into the game especially as one of the top steam games. Once they sort the main issues out an actually make it playable and enjoyable then I will edit the review. In the meantime PUBG won't be getting much playtime from me and at it's current 27 pricetag (ripoff much) I really don't recommend it.UPDATE Game updated tried again and optimisation seems even worse than before. Used to be playable on medium now hardly playable on Low. I really really want to like this game but I really can't. Mass reports of loads of cheaters ripoff for early access terribly optimised and the lazy devs are still making millions off it.

2017-11-22,0,0,330,True,Not Recommended,"With a few hours in the bank with this game I can say that this game deserves 5/10. Nothing really special. Be it FFA Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch. You will typically spend 30 40mins per match if you live long enough. During that time you spend 50 65% of the time looting for stuff 20 25% running around to find a house that isnt inhabited and 10 15% hiding just to lose it in seconds. I give this a thumbs down just because of the money involved. $30.00 is overpriced for this kind of game. You have 3 gamemodes 2 versions each. (Solo SoloFPP Duo DuoFPP Team TeamFPP) Also given that it's only 1 ""large"" map you dont really have much variety besides the weather and dropzones. On a technical side Desyncs in this game is like cancer no matter how many ""optimizations"" they do it stays. ""Oh a closed door. Should be safe"". NOT! Someone just phased through that door you thought would cover your behind and shot you dead while screaming profanity in their foreign language. Network disconnects and server disconnects happen often and more so during times when kids come back from their daycare centers.Back to the money issue i dont know how much it really for a crate to be honest but they started off pretty well when it just cost you NOTHING for a crate. But as human as they come greed sets in and with it comes that itchyness called GREED. Gotta pay to look good i guess?You ask why I have lots of hours with this game? Simple out of necessity not willingness.Here I end my rant/ review. Don't get me wrong I enjoy it only because of the shenanigans my friends and family come up with to make up for the sheer dullness of the game.Enjoy your ""$30"" game.*EHEM* $10! *EHEM* $10!*EHEM* $10!PS.

2017-05-17,0,0,132,True,Recommended,Playerunknowns Battlegrounds is a very great game but it has many flaws that are going to be talked about.First lets talk about the game itself.If you know anything about the lore then you'd know its set on the Island of Erangel. The island was abandoned after chemicals were released onto the island forcing everyone to evacuate. You are put on the island along with 99 other people to fight to the death with weapons from pans to LMG's.Pros* Fun and competitive gameplay* A mass of weapons vehicles and clothing to acquire.* Keeps you on edge makes you feel you are never safe.Cons* Poor optimization for any graphics cards (especially AMD)* Many bugs/ glitches* No good custom games and if there are they are password protected.Overall this game is great.

2017-07-28,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,This was my first battle royale game. After playing extensively I can conclude that the genre is not my cup of tea. The gameplay works well and performance is improving all the time but when played to win the game is nauseatingly boring. High risk high reward strategies are often more exciting but after the battle is done you'll end up camping where you are for at least 5 minutes if not more while you wait for the zone to close. The low risk more consistent strategy is boring the whole way through as you loot houses and collect a car to follow the zone inward. The game gets its replayability through RNG mechanics. Plane drops change loot spawns in different places and the zone movement is random each time. The aspect in which the game really shines is the tension that builds as the zone narrows and the players alive counter gets closer to 1. This doesn't set in for me personally until the 4th or 5th zone as anything before that is relatively low risk and encounters are seldom in my experience. The RNG while giving the game replayability is also what ruins the game I can accept random spawns and random plane drops but the random zone movement is honestly ridiculous. You can have the best laid and most strategic positioning possible and get boned by a random zone closing to favor your opponents. The RNG factors create a circumstance whereby it increases repeatability but also reduces the skill necessary to win which in my opinion is a big black mark against a game that is looking to become an esport. Outside of that the gunplay is decent and the driving and physics are quite wonky. My recommendation for those who enjoy that tension based game play is to play rainbow six siege because even though I don't particularly enjoy it (and it has its own fair share of issues) it offers a vastly superior experience that doesn't rely on RNG for replayability and generally doesn't diminish player skill. Now let's talk about all the PR backlash that has been going on recently. Bluehole has reneged on a previous statement regarding paid items before the final release. These keys to unlock crates creates even more RNG in this game and artificially inflates the price of items. This also renders the currency in game worthless at the time of this writing. When asked about this Playerunknown simply stated that he liked the CS GO method of selling skins and he wasn't going to listen to the complaints from his community and would choose the money grubbing route of paying for keys. Bluehole also implemented a ban system to deal with those who were squadding in solo queue. This has unfortunately backfired whereby a player was banned for killing a teamkiller that he and his friends were unfortunate enough to queue up with. Similarly another player was banned for stream sniping because a streamer (who has recorded himself stream sniping others by the way) complained and his chat reported the player. Again Bluehole went the greedy route and landed on the streamer's side when stream sniping can easily be avoided by adding stream delay. This is Bluehole attempting to go the route they think will maximize earnings rather than caring about the overall player experience. I wished I had followed my own advice I had given to friends never buy early access even if it looks promising. Looks like it was my turn to get screwed by early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,"If you are playing solo it's not bad a bit boring at it's core tho imho. The most of the time you are looting random items in buildings and try to remain undetected by other players and to stay in the safe zone that is decreasing in size the longer the match is running. Or you are camping somewhere and wait for someone to come around that you can shoot down or you are running into another player by coincidence while you are looting. The action is rare as soon you spot someone directly in front of you either you or your opponent is going to be dead in no time. And when you exit the match in any way you have to start all over no matter how you were doing. The only progression you get is your increasing personal experience (no not XP points) and to unlock more skins the more you are playing. So the most time you are either running/driving around are looting items to equip you with good stuff or you are waiting and watching your surroundings for moving targets. If you are only into action and want to do something like being on the move like feeling your heart pumping you will be easy prey sooner or later to someone who is doing the opposite. There is thrill in being precautious and stealthy to avoid a very quick death of course but if that would be everything about this game I'd cleary say it is overrated. But that is only if you are playing alone. You are way more versatile in a group. You can surround buildings try different tactics to outplay people etc. This can be really much fun. So at least thumbs up for the duo or squad playstyle.Technically it could be more optimised the FPS are kinda bad regarding how it looks but after all that's really not bad for an Early Access title. I didn't encounter any heavy or supercrazy bugs yet. Looking forward to more patches and improvements if they can avoid to put always new bugs into the game by accident (as seen in some other games) the game can only become better and better. I really like the vision of the developers here.So to sum it up imho it can be fun if you are playing in a group or are very much into being sneaky in an (almost) instagib shooter however the most of the time you are doing things in this game that I wouldn't call really much fun. And then all of a sudden you could get oneshotted out of nowhere or you are dying because you were just unlucky by being too far away from the safe zone for example. This is gonna happen a lot to you as a beginner you can't really avoid it it's how the game is designed.You become better by being sneaky camping playing carefully playing multiple hours to get experience and of course by being lucky. But you will die the most of the time if you just wanna play this game a bit to enjoy your time and in any case you will die a lot and start all over more or less. If that still sounds like just being your thing you should try it you will probably not regret it many people favor this game. But if you are rather like ""uh maybe I gotta think about it"" then it's probably a good idea to just stay away really. (You could buy it and try playing it for less than 2 hours though until you cant refund it anymore if this game follows the standard rules of Steam regarding refunds google it maybe to be sure.)I was tempted to buy the game because of the hype and because the people seemed to have much fun playing it at Twitch and Youtube but I can't really understand by all stretch of imagination after almost 10 hours what the longterm fun of it is for me personally. Yes I see that the game can be fun eventually but I am not really into the base gamedesign of it and all the stuff between the fun parts. It kinda bores me there and when it starts to bore you you gonna get oneshotted again because of how careless you play and then you kind of wasted all the time of the last match again and again. Sorry not my thing. If I could I would refund or sell it but Steam got different ToS unfortunately. For the time I was playing it and was motivated to play it 30 bucks are way too much money to spend. So be careful if you are not sure if you really wanna keep the game but are about to leave the refund zone for it. Because there is a huge and empty hole in this game you could fall into like me. And I didn't know or experienced that after only 2 hours not even after 5 hours.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The lag issues at the beginning of games hackers poor optimization (even on higher end PC's like mine). The devs at times feel like they are simply trying to make the most money possible. After playing the test servers yesterday my hope is somewhat reinvented for this title. I still don't agree with them releasing an Xbox version before the game is even close to being finished but they are still making progress. The little detaisl that will be added in the next update feel really nice. Like the game is more complete. Both visually and mechanic wise. I haven't given up on it yet all we can hope is that PUBG doesn't us.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-24,0,0,234,False,Recommended,"An honest review without the hate.Fortnite is free so I will NOT compare the two.PuBG on PC is a fun game but to enjoy it you have to accept that it's not perfect (but given how craptastic some triple A titles are these days it's FAR better maintained then 90% of them)It's updates aren't as frequent as they use to be however the tweaks in gameplay don't need to be as major and the additional content they are going to add needs to be tested etc. as well so it's delay in arrival is understandable. I'm a gamer of 20+ years so my paitence will probably out do most people reading this review that's not bragging that's me simply stating that when I enjoy a game I'll comment on things that bother me (I came from Xbox One to PC recently so this game runs 100 times better then I'm use to) and so far I've not found much. Mind you I'm only 10+ hours into playing this game I came in expecting less given the reviews I read and found that (as I said before) it's better then they make it out to seem.I do however reccomend tweaking your GFX settings and the ingame settings to make it run smoother you can google the best or ""Optimal"" settings and find a bunch of reccomendations.Some things to take into account BEFORE buying Much like most competitive PC games Cheaters will eventually find thier way into a match you're playingIf you can't handle this don't get this game and if you think you can don't complain later. (Even CS GO is plagued with cheaters)Also some players are CHEAP snakes in the grass camping in rooms baiting etc. You'll find all types in this game either learn to adapt or stop playing.Finally unless you can tolerate it mute the ingame voice chat. The little kids LOVE to scream into thier mics there are amateur DJs everywhere and you'll get called everything from racial slurs to other unmentionables so either cowboy up or just mute 'em.However having said all of this if you manage to be one of the few who just love Battle Royal style games (or just PuBG) you'll enjoy (or like me love) this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Keep trying to talk to them and convince them that their anti cheat system is actually flawed(because you did nothing wrong but finally you were treated as a cheater) so they should do further investigation and improvement more importantly remove your ban of course. Please don't try to add me to your friend list. To be honest it's about every week I will receive a friend request asking me how I got unbanned.

That being said you can also play the game more tactically than I do. I've only logged 41 hours but I plan on getting more in there. The only problem that I currently have is that it isn't optimized as of this review but Bluehole claims that is coming soon anyway. I would also recommend playing with friends if you are looking for something to game together with. Oh and another big plus for me is that you can play the game first and third person.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,903,True,Recommended,The recent flood of negative reviews has caught my attention and I would like to have my say in this matter of Cheaters Mechanics/Graphics and The Game as a whole.STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT CHEATERS. If you are going to play an online game especially a FPS there are going to be cheaters. The developers are doing their best to reduce the number of cheaters. It's virtually impossible to weed out all the cheaters unless everyone would like to install a program that constantly scans your computer for files potentially breaching your 'privacy'.Hopefully the upcoming Kill Cam will help identify cheaters and the numbers will reduce drastically. But until then just stop complaining. You cannot define the quality of a game when you're a mad 12 year old kid who thinks everyone is a hacker because you're simply GET A BETTER COMPUTER. The game runs perfectly fine. You have a potato. There are some things the deveopers are yet to touch up on but the game runs perfectly well. If you're Frames/Sec are low try lowering your settings. If they're at the lowest setting and you can't run the game. Then it's your crappy computer not the lack of optimisation. Internet connection also can play a significant role in the performance of your game. Check yourself before you blame the game.THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD.Don't listen to half of the negative reviews here. They're all salty people who cannot play the game or try to run it on a computer that takes AAA batteries. The game is LOADS of fun and the developers are very commited to improving the game. Adding new guns fixing mechanics such as damage environmental factors and even the sounds in game. The game is far from going 'downhill' and if it does I'll be genuinely surprised. It's getting so much love from Twitch Streamers and YouTubers. My point to this review is to say it's a great game and you shouldn't let the negative reviews stray you away from enjoying a game that gives you a rush like no other.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,323,True,Not Recommended,"This game is only worth buying if you have a very high end pc it isn't optimized well for mid to low end systems at this point (09/23/17) i have a gtx 1070 16gb of ram and an i7 4770k sometimes ill get 130+fps but normally when ina city or near people the frames drop 50ish. what's odd is the game only ever uses 60% cpu and 50% GPU on average even with all setings in Nvidia control panel set to ""prefer maximum performace"" and my ""power options"" in windows 10 x64 set to high perfomance. also have game installed on samsung EVO 850 ssd.this is what leads me to believe that this game isn't optimized well....at all. my hope is that Bluehole focuses on game optimization before content for the next month or so. so in conclusion..unless you have a titan XP and a ryzen threadripper...expect dodgy frame rates.EDIT Iv'e uninstalled the game and changed my recomendation. 300 million in game sales and they still can't upgrade the servers or fix broken movement mechanics...and now they wan't to add vaulting.................................................________ .................................... .

2017-04-07,0,0,226,True,Not Recommended,"Updating my review in light of recent developments 1. The game surpassed some of the fastest growing as well as largest player base game in history of steam games.2. It got funded 100 times over anyones expectations both from in game purchases and micro transactions (which got added during early access)3. Everyone expected the game devs to be responsible and hoped they wont 'scam' the community to make some money.Well 1. They did absolutely nothing even marginally good with the amount of funding they got. 2. The game is still in early access with almost every game breaking bug still there (server lag fps drop even on decent rigs due to exceptionally poor game optimization texture bugs sound bugs hacking)3. Where did the dev time truely go? Devs put most of their effort towards adding the micro transaction system in a early access game (first signs of a scam) and to top it off kept adding more and more content into the micro transations instead of actually working on optimizing the game.4. Canceled the ETA on the upcoming patch which was supposed to actually push the game out of early access. Instead the game is going to remain in early access (probably for ever). Cheap shot from devs as they want to make money out of the player base while dodging responsiblility of actually delivering a working product. Lastly fan base still going ""Oh its early access they have done so much already"". No they haven't. With the current sales they have been able to attain with 13 Million copies sold and microtranctional cash flow the current valuation of Bluehole is standing at 4.5 Billion USD.. Do you guys know what that means? This is not a indie game we are talking about. Its a legit company that has swallowed up 390million USD in last 6 months and has delivered garbage in return. P.S.

The controls and mechanics of the game are simplistic and can be learned in a matter of 10 minutes of playing. The only flaw I have with this game at the current moment is the optimization. The optimization is horrendous and even if you have decent computer parts (e.g. 8gb RAM with i7 intel core) you will lag a lot in this game.

2017-10-30,0,0,1292,True,Recommended,So after nearly 500 hours here's my take. Yes there is bugs. Yes sometimes the vehicles are weird. And yes there are hackers on it. Mostly asians servers though. Most people rage and write reviews about hackers and such bc they got killed from someone actually being better than them. (suprising i know. better than you?!) I've seen maybe 10 total hackers. mostly aimbots. 2 speedhacks. but thats out of hundreds of games. The game is fun. really fun. It's even better with friends. You can be all serious or see where a crossbow can take your squad. Oh and the game is early access and kinda blew up over night so yeah they kinda have a lot of stuff to fix but hey they have and are working on it. Most people than tons of game sales means instant fixes. but it doesnt. anyone familiar with IT project works knows that. late dev work can have hiccups and set things back or other mechs may need immediate attn so then they get pulled there. or not enough help bc of the instant success. 100% the game is worth the price tag. 100% isnt perfect yet. Microtrans are just for looks. stop ing. If you die 9/10 times its bc you got screwed on rng/circle boned/caught with your pants down. So learn to enjoy the game for what it is. Fun and imperfect. kinda like life.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-13,0,0,171,True,Not Recommended,"after a long time i finally buyed an early access game again after being disappointed by some others. well i should have stayed away from it. I don't trust a single word from the devs anymore. Games like Astroneer show clearly that Early Access _can_! work. But not this one.issues # servers# feels clunky not responsive at all# problems to jump over pebbles/fences/mini boxes# crashing vehicles on alpha pebbles/walls randomly# a spray of blood from the enemy indicates a hit for you but server said ""no""# broken promise (microtransaction)# it feels like it's getting worse after patches instead of better# ah and i forgot the afk Battlepointfarming and cheating cause of client side processingaccording to twitter devs need months to make improvements for the game but want to release the game at the end of the year well i cannot take them serious at allupdate according to the official website servers are fixed. Developers seem to suffer from loss of realityMy opinion sheer greed for money i would refund it if i could.

2017-10-30,0,0,181,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG is incredibly fun that much needs to be said. It's a lot more fun playing with friends but soloq or PUGing is also great. The matchmaking is amazing from the time you die and restart it's less than a minute before you're teamed up and already in the next match.BUTThe game runs like absolute garbage. The game looks WORSE than garbage. You could show this game to someone in 2006 and they would be surprised at how bad the game looks. Granted graphics aren't everything. This is even more unforgivable because I don't know if there is a PC in existance that can run this game at 60 fps at max settings. Not that you would want to run it at max graphics anyway. The optimization is TERRIBLE. Sure it's ""early access"" but Bluehole have made millions off this game and there have not been preformace improvements. I give PUBG a big up for pioneering in a sense the 100 person battle royale style game but sincerely hope a better game manages to be as purely fun as PUBG is but looks modern and is properly optimized.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But the publicity PUBG got brought it to my attention because the focus of the game is your personal experience. Every game is unique. No matter your playstyle you will find enjoyment playing. You can be stealthy or go berserker and fight everyone you see. What matters is that you can do what you want. What I hope is that when the game leaves early access it will be optimized cause you need a moster pc rig to enjoy it to the fullest now. Other than that this is probably the game of the year considering the value for money it offers since you will be playing it for years!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,358,True,Not Recommended,EDIT They added Microtransactions.TLDR Great game with highly competitive and enjoyable gameplay. Does suffer from some server lag every now and again and some optimzation isssues but all in all it's a fantastic game. 8.5/10This game is an insane amount of fun. It's the first Battle Royale game I've purchased as the others always seem sketchy with their poor reviews lack of content and pay to win mechanics but after around 20 hours I can't recommend this game enough. The loot system is awesome the gunplay is intense and the force field keeps even the longest matches to around 30 minutes. It does have some lag and optimzation issues but with my rig I get 60 fps in most areas. It does drop to around 35 40 in super dense areas but I can live with that for now.From what I've heard from the Alpha and Beta players the devs have been amazingly supportive and will continue to add content as the game's lifespan progresses. I'd love to see more weapons and attachments more customization options and more weather effects. I think we have a winner here boys and girls.PROS Large Player Base insures fast matchmaking times Highly competitive and high skill gap gameplay/combat Decent variety of weapons attachments and vehicles (need more weapons in the future!) Cosmetic items are earned for just playing the game no in game cash shop Allows for a squad of up to 4 players and incentivizes you to play with friends Streamlined healing no bleeding out Fluid game and gunplay Acceptable match lengthsCONS Mildly poor optimization Occasional server lag (US) Pointless melee weapons Poor character customization,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,99,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a great game and it will get better further on in the years (im assuming). Although it is still in Early Access it really gets your heart beating whenever a enemy is near. I recommend it to anyone that has the specs to play this game and you should get it while its cheap ($29.99 USD).If you dont play with friends you might find it boring after a while but pretty much everyone is playing it right now so it might not be a problem.This game still needs alot of improving and updates to make it better and more compatible for lower spec computers But I think it will be really fun for anyone that plays it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are mass amounts of players using cheats to farm pubg's crates so that they can turn a profit by selling the contents for cash. It is rare to end up in a top 10 position without another player using hacks there with you.The only way the game will be fixed is by turning off the crate system or possibly by making the crate items untradeable through steam. Currently bluehole turns a profit by banning farmers who will just buy a new account dropping another 30$ in their pocket for most bans so I wouldn't expect a fixed game in the near future.Fix this problem and my review turns positive bluehole.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,284,True,Recommended,Review(05/08/17) Guide for English KoreanI am really enjoying this game since it feels like fast paced Arma 3 Game.Although I havent played Arma 3 alot i found this game easy since the mechanic is similar to Arma3.Totally fun worth the money.Though I hate to say that the free costume will be disappeared after the Early Access.Other than that I'm really enjoying it. How to configure your game settings(게임 설정하는 법) RAM(메모리) You need atleast 16GB of RAM in order for you to enjoy the game without stuttering.최소 16GB가 있어야 원활하게 진행가능ScreenMode(창모드) set to FULLSCREEN for more FPSScreen Scale(화면스케일) (GPU Dependent/그래픽카드 의존)90 100 (본인 사양에 맞게 조절하시면 됩니다. 100은 본인 화면이 1920x1080이면 게임도 1920x1080입니다. 90이면 1920x1080 의 화면을 90%로 낮춘 화면으로 보여 조금이라도 프레임 나오는데 도움이 됩니다.쉽게 말하면 해상도 줄이는 효과랑 비슷합니다.Set this to 90 100 but this depends much on your computer spec. If you have enough power to maintain frames with your current monitor resolution then set to 100 if not reduce this setting to gain FPS. If you reduce this settings it has same effect as lowering your resolution so this purely depends on your system.Anti Aliasing(안티 앨리어싱) // (GPU Dependent/그래픽카드 의존)Very Low(매우 낮음) Disables Anti Aliasing // 안티 앨리어싱 비활성화LOW(낮음) FXAA // FXAA 설정 활성화Medium(미디움) Ultra(울트라) TAA //TAA 활성화This doesnt really affect your FPS when comparing very low to Ultra. There is only about 2 3 Frame rate differences.이 설정은 프레임에 많은 영향을 주지는 않습니다. 매우 낮음과 울트라의 프레임 차이는 대략 2 3 차이가 납니다.Post Processing(포스트 프로세싱) (High GPU Dependent/ 높은 그래픽카드 의존)Very Low(매우 낮음) All options are disabled // 모든 옵션 비활성화Low(낮음) Medium(미디움) Enables Ambient Occlusion. //엠비언트 오쿨루젼 활성High(높음) Ultra(울트라) Enables Chromatic Aberration. // 크로마틱 아브레이션 활성화This setting affects your FPS when there are many items on the ground and it affects your FPS from 10 20 when comparing Very low to Ultra. So if you have low med GPUs I suggest you to set this setting to Very Low or Low(depending on your GPUs).이 설정은 아이템이 많은 구간에서 프레임이 매우낮음과 울트라와 프레임 차이가 10 20 정도 차이가 날수 있습니다.그래픽카드가 안좋으신분들은 그래픽카드에 따라매우 낮음에서 낮음으로 설정해주시면 됩니다.Shadows(그림자) (High CPU/GPU Dependent / 높은 CPU/그래픽카드 의존)This setting affects your FPS alot. When comparing Very low to Ultra you will have 18 20FPS differences.Especially when comparing High to Ultra you will have 10FPS differences.IF YOU DONT HAVE HIGH END CPU/GPU i recommend lowering this option to Low or Very Low.이 설정은 프레임에 많은 영향을 줍니다. 매우 낮음과 울트라를 비교해보면 18 20프레임 정도 차이가 납니다.특히 높음과 울트라를 비교했을떄 차이점은 10프레임 정도 차이가 납니다.높은 사양의 컴퓨터를 가지고 있지 않는 분들은 낮음이나 매우 낮음으로 설정하는걸 권장드립니다.Very Low(매우 낮음) Low(낮음) Most of the shadows are disabledMedium(미디움) Shadows on grass tree etc becomes darkerHigh(높음) Ultra(울트라) Enhances shadows quality.Texture(텍스쳐) (GPU Dependent/그래픽카드 의존)For this option you will have to check your VRAM(GPU Video RAM) to set this option.Very Low(매우 낮음) 1GB of VRAM or Lower.Low(낮음) 1GB 2GB of VRAM(Does not include 1GB/ 1GB 포함 x)Medium(미디움) 2GB 3GB of VRAM(Does not include 2GB/ 2GB 포함 x)High(높음) 4GB of VRAMUltra(울트라) 6GB or more of VRAMEffect(효과) (GPU Dependent/그래픽카드 의존)This option details the effect from AirStrike in RedZone Flash from Gun firing etc. IF you have lag when this effect happens i recommend lowering this option. * This option needs you to restart the game in order to apply the setting.이 옵션은 레드존에 포격이나 총을 발사했을때 보이는 빛 등과 같은 효과를 보여주는 설정입니다. 만약 랙이 있으실 경우 이 설정을 낮추는걸 권장드립니다.* 이 설정을 적용시키려면 재시작 해야하니 주의 바랍니다.Foliage(식생) (CPU/GPU Dependent)After the balance patch this does not reduce the grasses or trees but it reduces the vision to see the grass and trees by distance. This setting also does not affect your FPS much. The diffrence between Very low to Ultra is about 2 3FPS.밸런스 패치 이후 이 설정은 잔디나 나무를 없애지 않습니다. 다만 거리에 따라 보이는 나무와 잔디를 제한합니다.이 설정은 프레임에 많은 영향을 미치지 않으며 매우 낮음과 울트라의 차이는 2 3프레임 정도 차이가 납니다.View Distance(거리 보기) (CPU/GPU Dependent)Same as Foliage but this setting reduces the building you can see from your point of view by distance. FPS may vary due to different number of buildings in different cities. This setting also does not affect your FPS much. The diffrence between Very low to Ultra is about 2 3FPS.식생과 같지만 이 설정은 현재 보는 시점에서 거리에 따라 보이는 건물수의 차이점입니다.이 설정은 프레임에 많은 영향을 미치지 않으며 매우 낮음과 울트라의 차이는 2 3프레임 정도 차이가 납니다.MotionBlur(모션 블러) This setting blurs your vision like real person when rotating quickly but this setting really depends on your preferences. So Ill leave this setting up to you guys.이 설정은 현실 사람처럼 확 움직일떄 흐리하게 보이는건데 이 설정은 본인 취향에 따라 다르므로 사용해보시고 설정하시면 됩니다.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,184,True,Not Recommended,"The game is really good gameplay is glorious and you'll love it.Then why am I giving it a negative review?Because the game itself is a freaking mess. Tons of gamebreaking bugs on a constant basis awful optimization poor fps models won't load you might get stuck on loading screens memory leaks are common and this game is supposed to be released next month.At some point the game glitched and all buildings became transparent for some reason I could see through freaking walls.Vehicles flip at the slightest bump riding a motocycle can be suicidal and not just becaue of that because it's also glitched and you can die even on fully flat terrain.Getting stuck in terrain? more times than I can count. Getting stuck with the parachute also several times. Getting stuck on doors? check. Memory leaks are common models won't load after the last patch optimization is awful most people have to play on very low specs even with high end computers just because of the massive fps drops. Oh and getting stuck on a loading screen while your character is in game? also check yeah you can get killed before you even load the game.The water is bulletproof. Aiming is clucky as for some reason they use the same button for the scopes and for aiming instead of different ones which screwed me at close quaters more times than I can count. Jumping over obstacles is a nightmare luckily they're working on that particular point.Trying to aim from behind cover is almost impossible because the game struggles to identify stuff as cover and your screen will shake like crazy.Looting without using the inventory menu is plain awful sometimes you have to press ""use"" the button several times to pick a single item.Cheating is commonplace basically because the report feature was non existant until a few days ago and cheaters are not even subtle getting killed by 3 headshots from a submachine fired at full auto from 600m away not subtle.Oh and of course microtransactions are now in game which they promised there won't be until release.

2017-11-25,0,0,96,True,Recommended,The idea is simple be the king of the hill the last survivor. I enjoy the tension of the chase in this game. I find it is a game of hurry up and wait to be killed. Collect equipment load weapons move toward non constricting area wait. Loot more and repeat. 50 60% of the time I never see the person that has killed my character until they loot my remains. When I seem have to have the advantage on another player and start the shooting I loose the gunfight about 75% of the time. I enjoy working on a teams that do not kill/grief their team members. I have now been made aware that the company has aggressively started banning known game cheats (6000 per day). The mechanics of the game limit each play through to about 20 minutes. by that time a handful of survivors are sardined together to shoot it out.

2017-07-17,0,0,164,True,Recommended,With a reasonable amount of play time I can safely say that PUBG it not completely worth the buy as of now. Overall the game suffers from quite clunky mechanics if not just constant lag. And despite being optimized the game still has troubles consistently pushing steady frame rates but if you can live through most of the above you ll still get mad at the game as it feels more like slot machine than a game at times. With 100 players in a lobby all on 1 map it's easy to die because every house you loot could have only pistols and attachments meanwhile someone can instantly loot 1 house at the start of the match and be set for the game (Loot distribution is very poor). looted or not the game heavily encourages camping houses and shooting at those who are moving in the open to avoid the zone or gunfire for easy kills this can easily wipe your friend or squad out instantly because if you have a teammate you only go down and don't die instantly meaning campers get a large advantage because they just res their friend in the house if you down them and if you push they ll be waiting with a insta kill shotgun meanwhile they gun down your downed teammates. When you do get into a firefight when both sides have the same amount of cover the game is much more fun as who handles their gun better wins (Till they decide to throw grenades at you). It's not a terrible game it just seems like an everyday early access game with a unique concept. Buy it on a sale if you need to play it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-17,0,0,319,True,Recommended,For sure a great game! There are tho something that can be approved. As for the server issues have been a lot better since the last update. One thing that might make the game a lot worse is the constant campers. At times you will find a lot of campers due to the games aiming mechanic and due to the now drops.The drops used to be a lot better now it feels like you can run through 5 10 house without finding a single useable weapon which will cause campers.The game has quiet a lot of hackers tho it's not that annoying I have only ran into 1 hacker that I know was hacking 100%. Other than that it's just speculations.This game is for suuure recommended it's a great and fun game especially when you team up with your friends in squads or duos!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But in it's current state I can't recommend buying this game. There's a lot of optimization (in terms of server and loot drops) and missing content that it doesn't feel worth its full price.

From where I sit the only changes from then until now have been a new map some new guns and the much needed vaulting system (which should have been included much earlier and is still a buggy mess). This game is *not* a full release. It is at best a Beta. It runs like absolute crap everyone that know that plays it does so on the lowest possible settings just to maintain their 60fps even on very good hardware. No matter what the devs have said there have been zero improvements to optimization at least in any noteworthy capacity.It's a fun game and despite the Call of Duty community shouting constant racial slurs into the public chat it's still a lot of fun to play but I just cannot recommend a game that's going to keep feeding money to a company that seems to be doing little to nothing to actually improve the parts of the game that need it instead of trickling out new guns to keep people happy with a little injection of ""progress"". Let me first lead with the obvious this game is in Early Access. It's a bit buggy it runs like crap and it has limited features. But you knew that walking in right? ...Right?Either way this game is a blast. Despite FPS drops and the occasional bug or crash or wonkiness you're going to get with any alpha/beta the game is just fun. Sadly that's osmething I've been lacking in games lately. I picked this up because I needed a break from the garbage MMO scene that's currently happening and I'm so glad I did.I think the most important thing I want to mention is how tight the shooting mechanics are. Unlike similar titles ilke DayZ or H1Z1 (or even Rust) the shooting feels... competitive? I don't know how else to describe it. If you're a fan of shooters in any respect you'll feel at home with the shooting in this game I'm quite sure.The biggest complaint I have so far is with the default control scheme and some of the lack of control options. I'm sure this will change with updates so I'm not upset and I'm working past it. For example though you can focus your aim (tightening the reticle) by holding right click. If you want to use your iron sights / scope / red dot however it's a right click to toggle and there is no option to change that as of yet. I'm sure they'll update it and it's hardly enough to dissuade me from playing and I'm gettnig used to it. And honestly if that's my biggest complaint I'm happy.Anyway for the level of polish this game launched with compared to some of the others it's well worth the $30 price tag.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-09,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,I would like to recommend this game. It's one of the few games that get my blood pumping. The main problem is despite the game being out on early access for over a year and them recieving insane amounts of money the game still runs like garbage. When I can run most games on high or max but have to play this in low there's a problem. The other issue is the same as what Dayz was you spend 10 15 minutes scrounging for gear not seeing anyone only to either get sniped from a ridiculous distance or have a guy pop out of a bush and kill you. The ammount of action is fastly inverse to the amount of time spent playing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-25,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,"The crash dumps and logs provide no info on what issue occured that caused the error. Also if you die too soon in a match you're stuck reconnecting until a certain amount of times passes. That's fine and all... I understand it is to battle bots... maybe give us a captcha?? The long wait after a fresh death is extremely irritating. Or this is a bug?Get disconnected? If you take more than a minute fixing issues you will be told that you can attempt to reconnect... that is not the case. After you attempt you will ultimately fail over and over again. It's an odd bug... if PUBG isnt in focus it will load you in and you can see everything as if you were under the map a bit... upon clicking back into the game it will say ""CONNECTION FAILED"". If you stay in the game while reconnecting it will just automatically say it failed without EVEN PINGING THE GAME HOST. Also why when someone gets downed in a car are they suddenly crawling outside of the car? I understand you can drive away and heal them... that's their perk for being in a car! Make them bleed out faster if you need to balance it.Why when I need to hop in my vehicle and I hit F on the driver side do I jump to passenger? I've been shot to hell.. I've been killed by blue zone with seconds sparing I've confused teammates all because I cant run to the side of the vehicle and enter it without magically jumping to the other side. Im solo... my teammates are all dead. Do you really think I want to sit in the bucket of a motorcycle while Im in the blue zone and being shot at? I cant mash CTRL 1 fast enough and take off!Another note... why are all the guns set to single fire when you pick them up? I know for a fact that by defualt most fully autos are set to fully auto when the manufacturer releases them. Furthermore you're telling me everyone who died or dropped their fully autos in whatever way across the map ONLY ever used single? Mix it up or set it to fully auto. I hate hitting B EVERY TIME I pick up a gun. I will turn it to single if Im at a distance sniping someone or they dont see me at medium range and I try and draw their team towards mine. There is no reason to every pick up a gun on the fly and have it in single shot off the bat.Could I add anything more negative??? You guys are seriously releasing on xbox this month? Why the do I blue screen over unhandled exceptions constantly after the new patch? You're trying to somehow update my whereabouts before I have even moved and it is causing my goddamn memory to blitz and blue screen me. Stop that! Throw some fricken exceptions in there PLEAZE.!! I cant even play the game anymore because every two seconds I drop out. And why did you have an AI control my player? Or was that just full retard lag?? How did my partner watch me drive through two towns hop out of my vehicle and run towards the idiots shooting at me while I was rebooting my stupid computer that blue screened on an unhandled memory exception because you guys have no clue how to maintain frame by frame data!?!?!!?&amp &amp &amp $&amp $*(%$(*$*(Absolute nonsense!

The game is unplayable like this I have tried on different connection and I know its not my computer as I run way more demanding games with ultra settings online and offline and never have any issues.Until this fixed there is no point in playing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-19,0,0,500,True,Not Recommended,"The game itself and the concept is nice but the game is extremely poorly optimized. The first person gamemode/cameramode is virtually unplayable due to clunky sluggish and non responsive controls. The game suffers from laughable network lag at times which in turn makes gunfights feel very rng (and doors stupidly hard to open and close). The whole game just feels ""off"". Hard to pinpoint exactly what it is but the camera and player controls just feel weird and unnatural and the network lag can also screw up the entire experience. Problems aside the game can be a ton of fun when playing with friends but from a technical/gameplay standpoint it's just way too bad for me to actually recommend this game. I have an i7 6700 with a GTX 1080 (+11% performance overclock) and even on the lowest settings possible the game is at times an absolute lagfest. All in all i have clocked in a ton of hours with this game and i've had alot of fun but at it's current pricetag (and with the technical issues) i just can't summon the adequate strength to recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-13,0,0,65,True,Not Recommended,I know I'm just joining the crowd on this one bu this game is a JOKE. What a sorry excuse for a game. The amount of cheating that is going on is ridculous. I understand that the developers say they're cracking down in it but when I can hit someone 8 TIMES (2 with a Kar98 to the head!!!) and they don't die yet they can kill me with a few shots from an AK while I have a level 3 vest and helmet it's enough to make me give up on this game. If I could refund this I would. I'm sure once the game is finished then it'll be awesome but good luck waiting for that to happen.

2017-07-03,0,0,266,True,Recommended,Here is what we know about PUBG PlayerUnknown is a the producer and has had his hands in the developing stages of a couple other games like it (H1Z1). I think the reality of it is that BlueHole gave him an opportunity to really make PUBG his baby and he came out in spades. Think about this 4 million+ sold and its an early access game. PROS Vast open world. Survival at its rawest form. Plenty of weapons Plenty of various armor / weapon mods. Graphics are clean NOT PAY TO WIN Simple game play mechanics (Simple to play / Hard to master) CONS (Its tough to do this because its EARLY ACCESS / ALL THESE COULD BE ADDRESSED. Server stability The fluidity of the game is smooth although still some frame issues / network issues Game needs to have more stats across the board Weapon stats for each gun and kills Obviously Kill Cam Top 10 Top 5 Top 25 finishes. Allow more map options / be able to pin up more things or for you to save map edits on your account for the future. Bring in more vanity items (I know this will come anyways) Destructible terrain/buildings. Distance Draw / You can hide in the bushes on the opposite hill of someone else but he can see you because the way the distance in this game works you'll see him standing out like a sore thumb even though he is in a bush prone on his screen. Overall as I've said already a lot of the cons can be resolved just through more time in early access with lots of them probably already addressed or being slated for a future update or release update etc if you guys are hungry for a TPS/FPS true survival of the fittest game PUBG is without question the best of the best you have AAA developers that could only dream of making something this successful and BlueHole did it with a fraction of these big guys budgets. Developers watch and learn from PUBG. MUST HAVE!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-04,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,"I have fun playing this which usually is my indicator for a good game. Playing it with friends online is hilarious. There are however a few caveats You need a good computer in order to play this game at a decent frame rate. Graphics card CPU memory all need to be WAY above the minimum system specs. Loot distribution is very randomized which can be frustrating as hell. You will usually lose your game and unless you have good squad mates or are a fairly decent FPS player yourself your chances of winning are slim. The possibility of giving your character an individual design is directly linked to your ingame success as cosmetic items are earned via a random loot system tied to how ""good'"" you play the game. The game has a learning curve and is fairly unwelcoming to new players. That being said the game sits at a sweet spot of tactical thinking action skill and fun but still is in desperate need of some serious optimization efforts and ironing out glitches and kinks before getting out of early access. **1.0 release update** I'm sorry but the glaring technical issues especially regarding desync are unworthy of a full release.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-24,0,0,618,True,Recommended,Amazing game. After 3 days of having this game I had played PUBG for over 29 hours and did not slow down for several weeks. That being said this game does have its problems and I've had my fair share of complete t moments where I get angry at it forgetting that this game is still Early Access. Most often times they are extremely minor bugs such as hitting a tiny bump with your car and either going completely ballistic and flipping over your car or you might lose a little bit of health. But even though there are many bugs many of them are completely harmless and can even make you laugh at points. This game is extremely extremely fun and rewarding if you are able to get that Chicken Dinner. The first few times that I was able to win I was completely pumped with adrenaline and eager to try and win another. The pre game lobbies are some of the craziest places in the entire world at times going from 50 60 people crawling in a line to 30 people screaming into their mics at the same time. This is something that can either be extremely funny or extremely annoying. Near perfect score 9.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I don't have hardly any time in this game.....YET. I heard all the hype and watched a few youtube videos and said what the heck let's give it a shot. I haven't played ANY battle royal games up to this point so I must be honest and say I don't really have anything to compare it to but OH the hype. First match I didn't do too bad (#55) the second (#40) the third with a few kills (#23) and MAN was I excited. I literally am going to have to pace myself with this as I can see how PUBG will get addicting as ALL HELL. I'm still tweaking my graphics settings and I haven't had ANY issues in that regard up to this point. I'm just gradually upping the intensity to be sure I'm not hurting the experience by pushing it too much. Overall controls are great. I even experimented with my controller and it works well except for making changes to weapons/attachments/etc. A little getting used to and I think I'll prefer the controller/keyboard combo. This game is the top seller for a reason. Intense fun and addictive gameplay. I could do without idiots playing music and other noise on the mic but that's easily muted. Definitely looking forward to getting a duo/squad together to play this. And with the possibility of cross platform...whoa nelly. My only complaint is the lack of a kill cam. Dying from a sniper hit isn't what sucks (although it DOES suck) I think it'd be more gratifying if you could congratulate your killer and learn more from little mistakes you might make.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,660,True,Recommended,"Basically I have a colony of bacteria living in my small intestine that rob my body of precious nutrients and in return give me a nonstop case of the poots.I'm not going to go into the details but my wife left me some time ago mostly because of the late night thunderpoots. I would startle us both awake so we never got a good night's sleep. She never wanted to make love unless she was drunk and high and only then it was after I thoroughly washed my choder while she supervised. All very understandable in hindsight.Anyway I've been having a serious bout of poots lately. Probably due to the fact that I completely gave up on life when my wife left and have resorted to eating at Taco Bell every day since. At first I think the preservatives in the ""meat"" killed some of my SIBO bacteria but I think they adapted came back ""full shart"" as it were.And this is the nut of the problem I'll probably be preoccupied by all of this gastrodrama when your new video drops. I'm frankly worried about the unusually high mucous poot ratio lately and at this rate I'll be doing an all day undie wash when your haircut is supposed to be happening.So if I miss it please think of me and my mucous poots while you're getting your hair trimmed up.Peace love and wet wipes PootLord",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,0,0,818,False,Recommended,In a nutshellPros *actually good enough multi gameplay*NOT PAY TO WIN more of pay to look good (unless you have so much luck or cash)*solo or not this game is playable*could be biased but because of the new update it became much more cooler (from texture foliage to the main menu most improved)Cons *so much lag on servers at times which causes you to lag*playing on sea servers there are so many chinese peeps. It isn't that much of a problem until they make so much noise. even heard they got cheats and all. even became a victim on those teaming up on solo servers wearing red shirts.Recommendations for better gameplay *for me it'd be so much better if it'd be possible to be in servers of peeps of the same country? don't know if that could be possible but definitely a good thing especially when teaming up in squad or duo.*server ping control? it had gotten better but definitely still needs some improvement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I am a player who is not the best at shooters and I am generally outmatched by most other players. With this game I can hold my own and make it pretty far either by myself or with a teammate. It has everything you need to survive if you are lucky enough to find it. It also has vehichles you can use if you stay in one spot to long looting. the player area shrinks at a good pace and lets you know when it is about to shrink. I have not found anything that I do not like about this game so far. I really enjoy this game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys pvp shooters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-30,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,So far NOT worth the price tag. Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrry poorly optimised. Most of the time doesnt load until its too late to jump out to land in a good spot. fun when it works 2 out every of five tries but awful when it doesnt. Also had to deal with random heavy lag spikes and unloaded textures. combat is all around clunky and loot distribution can be utter at times. To be completley fair I have yet to really pour time into the game but the short experience I've had so far has been... unpromising to say the least. All in all I would recommend if you have a beefy computer but if you dont wait until they patch it and make it better optimized. Also prepare to be frusturated. Alot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,874,True,Recommended,So I saw this game when it first came out and had absolutely no interest in picking it up. I've watched people playing H1Z1 and other similar games and they seemed alright just not my cup of tea but I could certainly appreciate them for what they are.After a bit a good friend was expressing interest in it and we decided to go in on it together since it's a pretty fair price. I had super low expectations given that it's early access and I had watched some streams by this point so I had some idea of what I was getting into but figured it'd be a fleeting thing.But I couldn't have been more wrong.After the first game I was entirely hooked the first game where I tried to swim across the river to get to my friend as the wall closed in around us and he found a lucky boat that we sped off in and ultimately got gunned down mad max style by some other boats.Since that fateful game our little group of friends has so many stories even after just 34 hours of playing together. An insane amount of memories and shenanigans are being built up in an incredibly short amount of time and we're constantly having a blast.The game absolutely has its problems of course and there are a plethora of things I hope they'll address in the future (WTB memory leak fixes) but it's a genuine joy to play. Matchmaking is lightning fast and we don't really care if we're popped out super early because we can very quickly get right back into the action without a hitch.I didn't think I'd like this game and it turns out I absolutely love it. Several friends went into it thinking similarly that they'd find it to be a poor purchase but we've all been proven very wrong. This game is a great buy. Do a little research find the launcher optimizations and give it a spin. 10x more fun with friends IMO. Keep in mind if you really hate the game you can ask for a refund if you have under 3 (might be 2?) hours played so you can always go that route.10/10 purchase would buy again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-04,0,0,157,True,Not Recommended,This game is 'fun' overall but the bugs make this game unplayable straight out. A game like this in this stage I don't expect to be fully functional and polished but I expect it to be functional at the very least. This game has loading problems so bad I can't even play 25% of the time. The loading screen freezes and sometimes never unfreezes and when it does unfreeze it has you mid game already and you're at a disadvantage. And even then it's not fully loaded most of the time. I drop down and the houses haven't loaded properly and I can't go inside to get started or even hide. I simply have to wait a while for it to load. And when the game is started and i've started and everything seems ok there's glitches that outright stop me in my tracks from playing. I've straight up ran in buildings and been stuck in the wall because the colliding it bugged. Cars too. It's just not something i'd say go buy for quite some time. On top of that i'm stuck with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-01,0,0,207,True,Recommended,"After reading several reviews I purchased this game on a whim and wanted to see what it was for myself. It's really addicting fun and fast paced. You'll never get bored with the pace of the game or the firefights you get in to. I've seen a lot of negatives for various things like the lag issue with this I've only experienced it a couple of times and it didn't last more than a second or two. I've also seen the reviews that comment on the cheating element but so far I haven't encountered any of that might be due to the 20k+ bans handed down or people need to play better or get better rigs pick whichever makes you feel better. Also seen comments like damage indicators not sure if they meant better health bar or directional marking of who is shooting at you if it's the latter get a better gaming headset turn up the volume and you should be able to figure out the direction of where the shots are coming from. If you really need the indicator to register hits for you why don't you ask for one that gives the direction for footsteps as well sheesh. So far it's a great and fun game and as long as the Devs keep pushing forward this game can go far.Also if you play for the first time and come across a frying pan PICK IT UP!! You don't have to use it but it does provide extra protection for your butt. It's saved me many times as I run through the map and snipers take shots at me and all you hear is the ""ping"" sound as the bullet hits the pan and the ""spark"" visual from the hit. Frying pan Lifesaver!Cons An in game timer so I know when too take a break sometimes I forget dinner or I'm late too work because I keep hitting the ""play"" button Pros Frying pan butt armor (gotta protect the O ring!)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-01,0,0,592,True,Recommended,I have to say i am really enjoying this game and the constant updates and fixes the devs are releasing is insane!Now i have to say if your expecting to be buying a perfect working game. Your not. But its in Early access as of right now and as i said earlier the devs are constantly releasing patches making the game more and more playable. The game is fun solo and with a few friends its even more fun. However.THIS GAME IS INSANELY DEMANDING SO DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOUR PC IS NOT AMAZING.But if your PC is good then get ready for the best last man standing game available today!I hope to see you on the battleground!

The way the game stands at the minute the only thing holding it back is the technical side framerate is dodgy very dodgy and it really hampers performance at times. But let's be reasonable it's early access it's expected. Maybe not worth the full price quite yet but I have no regrets!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After only a few months they have their game in the top 5 played games on Steam which is more than deserved. It feeds you enough adrenaline to keep you going and even when you die makes you want to jump right back into that plane and do whole thing over and over and over again!

2017-07-05,0,0,465,True,Recommended,This is the best early access game i think i have ever played. The game is still very young but it already shines over competitors like H1Z1. It plays mostly as a stealth/tactical shooter but you can also drop in a populated area and fight from the very start. It has the perfect mix between arcade and survival. Despite a lot of faults still present(vehicle physics inconsistent loot sub optimal performance at parts like pregame lobby) this game has done great progress in the short time it has been out on early access with weekly and monthly patches and is in my opinion nearly good enough for a full release. It is the kind of shooter i would definitely recommend even to people who usually don't enjoy the genre. The game is full of funny tense and high adrenaline moments. It is fun enough as a solo but the game really shines when you play with friends.Overall if the game were to go away tomorrow i think i've already gotten my money's worth and it seems this is just the beggining for this very promising game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Haven't had this much fun in a while.Graphics 8/10 Very pretty but unless you have a mammoth computer the great textures come at the cost of lag which can get you killed. Even the low res textures are pretty goodAudio 9/10 Foley is very good. Guns sound as you would expect them to. Able to hear distant gunshots cars driving up people opening doors in the house you're in. Very good very atmospheric.Gameplay 9/10 Very realistic shooter. Easy to learn difficult to master. One big map with many varied locations to choose from collect gear to kill other players and be the last one standing. You have very little health (2 or 3 Assault Rifle bullets will do it) and have to travel to the center of a circle that gets continually smaller without getting picked off by the other players trying to do the same thing.

2017-07-11,0,0,146,True,Recommended,"9.5/10. Great game really addicting. The only major thing wrong with it right now for me is that it keeps freezing! No it's not that I have a ""toaster for a pc"" as my computer can play more advanced games better. I look forward to it's release but I find it hard to be motivated to play more when you repeatedly get to top 10 only to have the game freeze on 3 different scenarios. I'd also go on about how the vehicle controls need improvement but it seems that people already made their point with that. Though it would be nice to see more vehicles (both vehicle variations and slightly more vehicle numbers on the map) in the future. Another thing that needs work are the doors. It would be nice if the range for shutting them was a little farther and the doors seem to have a lag error for some people (so do the vehicles) including me. The jumping is also a little wonky but not too bad. Gameplay is fun and entertaining but can get kind of slow at points (not neccessarily boring but not the best part either).

Every streamer I watch is forced to play with settings on low despite their specs. It ends up looking like arma 2 on low settings and its still not enough to escape framedrops and stuttering and structure loading in that looks like a child drew a slanted house with crayons.It can take 5 additional minutes just to load in the proper textures for the nearby structure The minimum requirements shown on the store page are a massive underestimate theres also quite a few afk bots and it sucks when they are put on your team,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-17,0,0,530,True,Recommended,I would wager that approximately half my deaths are the result of suddenly getting shot and being startled so much that my fingers slide across various keys changing my weapon unequipiing it changing the view and getting down into an unsprintable prone position all simultaneously and not being able to recover my bearings quick enough to undo the damage before being killed.The biggest negative for me is that too many Asian only speaking players flood the NA servers making teamwork impossible as well as counting for approximately 99% of hackers I've encountered. People also really dislike marketable items in game but you get them just by playing the game regularly. I've made back the money I spent on this 1.5x over to date which has essentially granted me this game for free as well as giving me ample spending money for Black Friday sales. In its current state I would recommend it because it's really fun most of the time especially with a good group. However the devs are really bad at fixing issues and updating things and are strongly pushing for an official PC 1.0 release. This game is nowhere near something you should see marketable on Xbox level sales. But you can get your money back by putting the time in so that's nice,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can't frankly figure out to criticise this game in a good way or a bad ill start off with the bad. The jump System hit box area and the sucky skill i have as a solo. I must say that this game will be great now for someone like me you will feel rage some rage like no other. I can guarantee that you have never felt any kind of rage when you make a small mistake and you have a SCAR fully decked out with an 8x scope and you miss a shot on a fellow player and someone beside you comes out of no where and murders you. I must say though when you do have that 8x scope and you kill someone from a great distance you will feel like a badass but when you fail man you will have it haunt you for a very long time. Overall i will say that this game has a lot of potiental and i do know the devs are working on fixing a lot in the near future so i must say this game is one for the books.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-30,0,0,408,True,Recommended,As of right now this game can go 2 ways. It can run perfectly fine or it can completly suck. For example the two major cities in the game lag a lot when you get into them but ill give them some slack since its in EA still. Sometimes when I land from the plane the buildings dont render in and I have to wait a minute or 2 hoping I wont get shot. This glitch only happens sometimes and im sure it will be fixed later on. So as of right now I honetly would recommend this game but be aware of the bugs it still has. It can be loads of fun and it feels so good when you win your first match. Overall as of right now I give it a 6/10 but once most of the glitches are gone I would give it a 10/10.Edit.After some bug fixes the game feels really good now but there are a few bugs like getting stuck in a rock or stupid little things. The game is great now and if your thinking of picking it up then do it for sure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its honestly a pathetic game made by a terrible group of people who have no idea how to code a game. Do not waste yoor money on this game and do not put anymore money into this brain dead devolper who has no intentions to imrove the game in any meanigful way.

The aimbots seem to be most common hell even the 2x world champion DrDisRespect misses on occasion. The other issue is NA servers full of chinese players with lag issues that might as well be a cheat. Shoot where they are get killed from the teleporter. Can't go into voice at all just one person screaming over the other in Chinese. Developers are atleast making comments about the cheaters but with China becoming the number one market for PUBG I think I will have to keep playing with the odd rubberbanding I see. I hope they are truly going to be more proactive and make it harder for cheaters. I really want to come back and make this a positive review in the future.

2017-09-13,0,0,866,True,Recommended,The game is pretty badass. Chinese Overflow into North American Servers makes it difficult to enjoy day time Gaming. Could use a bit more fluidity in Meeting up with random players you enjoy playing with. This Failure often leaves Players not able to reach out to other players post game. Overall it is fun and the large map provides many variations and scenarios that will almost never repeat. Circles do get repetitive but the Late game is still intense if you are crafty to make it that far. Many styles of Gameplay work. RNG can be a bit saddening and Early game is entirely dependant on Location and Population. Sometimes games can last 20 mins or you can Die right off the plane. Overall its a game that pulls you in and then traps you there like a kid in a crate.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Current bugs that I have faced are textures on buildings loading slowly though it only takes about 30 seconds most times (Prevents looting at the start of the game due to not being able to open doors or see loot) and a few times I have faced the bug in which no buildings have spawned for another player and they have been able to run over anyone they please as long as they are on the ground floor or simply shoot through the buildings. Positives for this game far outweigh the negatives playstyles are adaptable and fun duos and squads are also a really nice aspect that makes the game entirely more enjoyable.

Even if not playing really competitively as I do you will quickly find frustration when you are eliminated time after time by cheaters. In many games there are always cheaters but in this one it seems they are the majority of the player base.

Sure the backlash would make sense if it were similar to other paid systems in other games that would give players advantages over others but as i've said this is all purely cosmetic and I for one support the decision to add this system into an already amazing game of battle royale goodness.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-08,0,0,25,True,Recommended,"This game is a WHOLE LOT OF FUN. Either playing alone or with your friends. However I have to mention Those spec requirements? ADHERE TO THEM. This isn't a game where it's possible to play with slight frame skips. It's an honest to god battle royale as such the more FPS you can get the better. Buildings have a tendency to stay out of existence until about 3 minutes after you land. And even that when they DO spawn a lot have an issue to be low graphics to the point of not being able to enter their doors. And recently (for me at least) the game has a ""Network Lag"" game pausing glitch. The last match I most likely will ever play had me stuck in it. Let me elaborate on the glitch when the game detects network lag it SHOULD pause everyone in place so the game can keep up. I got paused but no one else did so when someone entered the building I was in I couldn't move so the other player got a free kill.In conclusion the game is in constant development.The game is SO MUCH FUN but there ARE glitches in it and if you don't adhere to the requirements god bless your character's frozen soul.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-31,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,I haven't played this game for a very long time however I feel as though my small amount of experience gives me exactly what I need to give an opinion on this game.I was very critical of PUBG before I even got it. When I was finally suckered into it by a friend I decided I'd only play 2 hours of it and then refund it. Obviously this wasn't the case. I have plenty to say about this game so I will break it down into topics.Topic 1 The Good StuffI expected this game to be absolute garbage and make me never want to play it again. However the genuine experience and unique playability I found myself facing kept this game in my library but only for a few reasons 1. The intensity and excitement I felt playing this game is one I do not feel often. I feel as though the developers did and excellent job of grabbing ahold of the player and building up tense adrenaline pumping moments.2. Gear is not rare and weak and finding a gun with bullets is not the most difficult thing in the world to do. The option to jump out of the plane whenever you feel and not just be randomly placed. The constant shrinking of the map area keeping everyone in one spot. These gameplay aspects give everyone their fair chance at actually enjoying their experience and being on level ground with everyone else.3. Playing with a friend improves the experience alot.Topic 2 The Bad StuffThese are the reasons why I do not recommend this game 1. It should NOT cost $29.99. That price is far too high for such a limited and underdeveloped game. I have also tracked this price for months on end and never saw it go on sale once. This proves to me that the developers are far too focused on making as much money as possible with as little work as possible.2. It should still be in Early Access. There are far too many bugs graphical issues and kinks to work out that I have a feeling will never be worked out.3. Playing this game alone or with competitive friends will make this way more stressful than it needs to be. You can very quickly become frustrated and waste hours and hours playing angry.4. There are way too few maps and character customization options. This is pretty nitpicky but still something that bugs me.Please only purchase this game if you plan on playing it casually with friends every once in a while. That is the only way I can enjoy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-31,0,0,21,False,Recommended,If you're lucky enough of not having encountered a single enemy for 20 minutes you can can run your off across the map with an intensive case of general paranoia. Then if you haven't found a vehicle yet because everyone else has taken them the blue line will catch up and reduce your hp bar from 100 to 30. You use your bandages but that's not enough. Then you finally make it to the white zone and still haven't seen a single enemy. You finally find a vehicle hop in and drive towards the white zone cause your hp can't take another stroll outside the white zone. And so you drive on and boom you meet your first enemy. You have a full backpack of useful resources but you can't use them cause by the time you start getting shot at you're already dead.

I do think PUBG should consider getting rid of keys then should switch to points earning system to unlock items and rare drops of items for top players in the round. PUGB is a lot of fun espeacially with friends in a squad or duo. If you like a battle royal type of game then this is for you. It reminds of rust and other survival type games.Definitely recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,348,True,Recommended,"I really enjoy the game a LOT of un &amp I've met great people! I can play for hours and hours! For this I believe the game deserves a positive review! HOWEVER The downside The devs let me know they think im a chump by adding micro transaction BEFORE the game was out of EA which they promised they wouldn't. Their answer to this was that ""They had to test these things before the game was finished"" So...you can't let us test these for free and take them away when the game goes live? This CAN be ""tested"" for free the logic of ""We need to sell these to people so that they are ready for people to buy"" answer lets me know they think im a chump.The NEXT answer we were given was that ""Oh i mean its going to charity and the tournament"" Well guess what I think we have already paid enough for you to afford your own tournament and your own charity donations... SO...the bug hit me and I (regrettably) bought keys and opened crates I now have 4 pairs of white school pants for boys (im not a boy tired of boy clothes being the norm) and 3 pairs of white sneakers. THAT ARE NOT SELLABLE OR TRADEABLE!! You cant even sell it for BP's like normal items!!! You're just stuck with 4 pairs of white school pants for boys. Because the Dev's want ot be SURE you feel sick when you give them money. Im starting to feel rage when i think of this game. Im a chump. Why did i buy these keys why did I feed into this!??! I wish I could have kept my positive review rating I have to change it. I just have to. I feel sick when I think about this game now. Will I play it again? Probably the damage is already done they have my money. I just wont recommend buying keys",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,0,0,238,True,Not Recommended,I have to say i'm very dissapointed in the direction this game is heading. The greed is real and they're milking every dollar they can out of this game. As if they wern't already making a pretty penny. This whole microtransaction in EA is absurd. I've spent around 10 dollars to get the same item 3 times. If you're going to add microtransactions at least sell the whole item set together. You want to add microtransactions? Why don't you add actual game content to build a strong community first then when you release the game add microtransactions. SATISFY YOUR COMMUNITY LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY. DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED YOU THUS FAR.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-26,0,0,277,False,Not Recommended,I had previously posted a positive review of this game while it was still early access. It is still a fun game to play but 50% of all games I play are ruined by cheaters/hackers.Now that they've implemented deathcam and replays I can go watch how I did each match and what other people were doing. I can put up with hackers if it's a rare occurance like it was before but now it's too frequent and I'm sick of it. The way the game is going it'll die within this year if they can't fix the hacking issues. Bluehole have said they're trying but nothing seems to be working with more and more people not getting detected and been less obvious with their hacks.My 50% statistic above is how often I report people for cheating after viewing the deathcam and I don't normally do it unless I believe it to be true else I will check the replay later from their point of view if I just find them suspicious.There are also network issues with the game. They're taking steps to fix it and slowly it has been happening but it's very slow. We still suffer from some lag at start of matches spikes of lag during games at random time incorrect character positioning leading to players been not where they are and getting killed arounds corners etc.It's good they're adding new maps and balancing gameplay but they need to fix network issues as well as hacking.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The games a bit rough around the edges but it's in early access so I'll give it a pass. One thing that is a bit disappointing is we were promised there wouldn't be any micro transactions which isn't much of a problem honestly because it isn't effecting my gameplay in any way but it does show that the developer doesn't show very much respect to the community. If you make a promise you keep it simple as that so if a promise is broken why should I or anyone for that matter trust any other promises? So hopefully the micro transactions will be removed and we can ONLY use the bp system. Other than that amazing game keep it up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,504,True,Recommended,Before you read this review keep in mind I didn't even want to buy this game.Once I finally gave in I can't stop playing... The intensity of every round and every kill situation just throws you into another world. It's so intimate and exciting. Me and my cousin can just sit and watch each other play it's so entertaining to play and watch. Most of these negative reviews are because of microtransactions... which goes to charity and the winner of the tournament. Not sure why people are being so anal about it.Overall it's an early access game. It needs heavy optimization but I have so much fun playing this game that I can honestly look past most of the downsides to the game (which are few to none).Buy the game.

2017-09-24,0,0,245,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I received this game as a gift. As you could probably guess based on my playtime I enjoy this game overall.Before each match you'll be placed on an island with the other players. There are several weapons nearby on some tables. After a set amount of time all players spawn in a plane passing over the land where the match takes place. Many people choose to drop off in areas with large quantities of equipment. Consequently such places (military base and large cities) are usually a high risk high reward landing location. Landing in these places or somewhere (hopefully) safer is up to you.Each match can be different.A plasma looking wall progressively closes in at set intervals. Make sure to avoid being outside that wall (marked on the map by a blue circle) as much as possible. If you find yourself outside of the wall your character will receive damage over time.Your landing location will determine not only your starting equipment and number of early game confrontations but also how much effort will be needed to stay within the shrinking wall. In your journey to win the match you'll probably loot multiple buildings or fallen players engage in firefights or car chases and plan your next move (you can play solo or with one or three teammates).This game can be played in 1st or 3rd person. Additionally there are servers that restrict players to only playing in 1st person. Many players turn down their graphics settings to make it easier to differentiate players from the environment (affects grassy fields for example). This allows for a competitive edge over players that use high graphics settings.In addition to medical supplies protective equipment gasoline for vehicles and upgrades for guns you have inventory space for 2 large weapons a handgun grenades/molotovs and a melee weapon. Large weapons found typically consist of assault rifles sub machine guns shotguns and sniper rifles. Inventory space can be increased by wearing additional clothing/armor or backpacks. Equipment such as armor and backpacks range in levels of endurance/capacity.Living in North America I've noticed that the North American servers recently have many Asian language speaking only players. This can sometimes make it challenging to coordinate tactics with your teammates but does not always make it impossible.Regardless of server locations I tend to enjoy matches in which I have only one teammate. Typically we come to compromises much more easily. Additionally during a confrontation there is less ""noise"" in tactics coordination due to the smaller number of teammates.If you're still uncertain about purchasing this game check out some videos on YouTube. I highly recommend this game if you're competitive and/or like fighting alongside a team.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-24,0,0,92,True,Recommended,I've played for half a month and I love it. I love the idea behind Battle Royale and it works well in the game. The weapon and gear variety and balancing are great. I do wish that updates would come a bit faster since this game is obviously making a ton of money but I think we'll get that soon enough. There are still a ton of bugs (mostly being unable to epuip weapons sometimes and clipping with objects). Aiming a gun in this game is a bit clunky. The First Person aspect needs some fixes. There is also a huge problem with people using aimbots and other ways to cheat in this game! I've already encountered several individuals like this. This deperately needs to be addressed in order to keep the community straight so that people can have fun and enjoy the game. Despite the glaring issues this is not a AAA developer and you cannot expect everything so fast. This game definitely holds up despite all of the issues with it and is a blast to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,0,0,269,True,Not Recommended,This game has a great foundation but so far is poorly executed. So when it comes to the weapon attachments they provide a proper balance and stability. This can really change change the tide of the game depending on who your are facing. The exception is anyone who is laging or cheating there is nothing you can do about that fact. You can just die then restart the game over for another round. The cheating is not every game so most of the time you will be alright but when you encounter the cheating it is quite frustrating. So overall it is a good game but there is cheating/lagging which can really ruin the experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have 500+ hours in this game and skeptics went from ""video of it didn't happen"" &amp ""maybe you're just bad at the game"" to not having a choice but to agree because almost every game is infested with China hackers running around shooting everyone.

I read on their site that we should expect to see major game optimizations by the end of april. This gaming being early access has so much to offer.

The mechics in the game at first feel clumbsy but after a while they become normal and simple.While I received this late into the Early Access I feel this game still feels very unfinished in some areas. A more recent post about how the developers will slow down the release of patches to ensure high quality changes is both a good and a bad thing IMO. I feel there are a lot of little things that need some quality of life upgrades and updates to make the introduction to this game more enjoyable but that also leads into a solid seasoned playerbase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-17,0,0,67,True,Recommended,"I've had very little time with this game but so far I'm in love. I'll list what I love about it and since it is still in early access I'll spout off a few of the obvious things devs could work on.What to like1. Matchmaking is fast and premades are in seperate servers from solo players.2. Vehicles are in short supply making this less of a GTA road rage game and much more about tactical engagements.3. Tactical engagements Every encounter comes with a decision fight or flee wait or rush bait or scare.4. Every room you enter could be a gold mine for gear or a trap.5. The island is huge and as players die off the map squeezes a little tighter on the playable zone but it does it in intervals instead of a constant shrinking. Tis allows baiters campers and snipers time to setup shop so that they can still have a little fun...but not so much that they ruin the game...in the end they will HAVE to move.6. Just a personal fav here you can sprint while crouched while not as fast as running upright it is still faster and I love that they implemented this because it is very grounded in what a real person can do.What needs work.1. Character movemet/collision mechanics honestly there's a collapsed stone wall barely taller than my ankles in front of me and i cant even jump over it much less walk over it.2. Crawling in prone makes more noise than crowch walking...if im trying to be as invisible as possible you would think that this would be the way to go...but it's not.3. Buildings all over the map have a bit more repetition than I like. There are some unique buildings out and about but if anything can be learned from games such as the battlefield franchise repetition gets boring and if anything can be learned from planetside 2 those buildings can be replaced and upgraded in patches so that no fight ever feels the same.4. Zeroing mechanics need some sort of explaination I served in the army irl and I know what it does irl. In this game though I have no idea as there is no reason to ""zero"" a weapon in this game. If however its allowing you to adjust for wind and elevation then kudos I love them all the more for it.All things considered the things I love outweigh the petty gripes that I'm sure will get hammered out in due time I'm giving this game a big thumbs up and I hope it helps sway people towards it...this is a game that relies on player base and id hate to see it go.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-28,0,0,318,True,Recommended,This review was originally negative because of the problem of optimisation. However after the number of unofficial fixes provided by the community and the lack of chrome (8GB ram isnt enough for once good luck Xbone players) the game became playable on high settings. There is still a problem with buildings not loading after landing for a few seconds so I have learnt to avoid dropping with enemies.As far as everything else goes it is a really fun and engaging game. Gunplay is very good when compared to other games in the battle royale genre and the variety of guns means people with different play styles can still thrive. The map is also very good and many tactics can come into play to make the most of it.The developers update the game fairly regularly with new features and fixes and seem passionate about wanting to take the game into the future. Im excited to see what else is in the pipeline.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-17,0,0,1182,True,Recommended,"This is probably in my top 10 games ever. If you need an idea of what the game is about it's sort of a mix of DayZ and Hunger Games. I used to own and play DayZ but it was typically boring as hell. Running around hoping to find loot and then just existing because there was no real purpose. PUBG fixes that. Your purpose is to be the last man (or squad) standing out of the 100 people that start in each game. This is the Hunger Games aspect. After the game begins a series of circles begin appearing on the map that show safe and danger zones. If you get caught in the danger zone your health will quickly deplete. By doing this players cant just camp random corners of the map and are eventually forced into confrontation. The average full game (if you win) is around 30 minutes and is basically broken down like this Early game this is full of panicky ""ohshitohshit"" moments. You're scrambing to find a gun and hoping people near you did not. You will die alot here when someone gets a shotgun and other gear while you find weapon attachments and no weapon and are forced to confront them with bare fists. You'll be booting up a new match in no time. Mid game this is the majority of the game. You survived the craziness are now focusing on getting completely geared up. You will hopefully find weapons you prefer and attachments to go with them as well as get a nice supply of healing items and high level armor. The conflicts here are more spread out but more rewarding then the early game ones because your enemies have been hunting for gear like you and you'll be looting their corpses like treasure chests. Endgame You've made it. You're geared out of your mind and the safe zone is shrinking into nothing. All the panic from the early game returns. Every bush is a possible enemy. Houses are few and typically occupied and the center of attention. You will usually be crawling peeking over hills or running behind trees trying to spot your quarry before they spot you. Picking whether or not to take a shot has never been so important. Just a few kills and you could be enjoying a nice chicken dinner.I'm a little excited just thinking about it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-12,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,"Blueballs are too busy implementing new skins and crates instead of fixing some of the core issues around the game.1) Hacking is rampant and all attempts to nullify this has been made redundant.2) Loot spawns. They're absolutely terrible. Clothing needs to be removed completely which in turn will increase weapon spawn rates as a side effect. You should not be able to loot 5 buildings in Po i and only come out with a P92 alongside enough clothing to fill Michael Jackson's wardrobe. 3) Server tick rates. There's been several instances where myself other players and even streamers have been tagged by another player and no hit has been registered. The visual ""blood"" hit marker is showing hoowever no damage has been inflicted upon the recepient of the shot. You SHOULD be able to trade kills considering this game does not employ HIT SCAN gun mechanics.4) Optimisation. This is a big one. Upon 1.0 release optimisation of the new map increased drastically however with every update/hotfix the game is slowly running worse and worse with increased memory leak issues. I've played this game on 2 systems 1 system with an i7 8700k 64gb 1080ti and the game ran smoothly on ultra at 144hz. The other system is an i7 6700k 16gb with a 1070 and the game runs at 70 fps on medium with memory leak issues switching between 70 40 fps (and yes I've reinstalled windows/drivers.) Not everyone has vast amounts of cash to build a system just to play this game Blueballs.Until the core issues are fixed mainly hacking then this game will eventually die a slow death like H1Z1 if Blueballs continues to prioritise profit from Tencent in the Chinese market and loot crates over player enjoyment.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-12,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,This game is rediculous. Don't get me wrong it is a fun game but don't expect much from the devs. Even though I have just recieved the game I have followed it for a long time contemplating a buy. My buddy decided to buy it for me. Even though the community is constantly blatantly telling them to Region lock Asian Countries as it is unfair to NA and EU players they will not. It has gone far enough as the community to go to Change.org to put up a petition. Don't get me wrong the game is fun but it is just drown out by constant Dsync issues and chinese hackers. It would be ok if they would region lock asian countries and leave NA and EU unlocked or have a ping limiter and then eventual boot from the game. I understand the Devs not wanting to Lock China as it is a mojority of their player base and they don't want to lose sales but ing over your Western Community is discustingly selfish. Devs now adays just think about themselves and not their communities.TL DR Too many Chinese with Dsync and hacking.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I really hope the devs can fix the proplem at the main lobby before you load into the home screen you get stuck with nothing but the backaround and the 3 options buttons you have on the top right. It'll say loading in the top left but after that nothing still just the backaround running perfectly fine and the sound is there just nothing else but the options on the top right.

2018-02-13,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Enjoyable? Definately. Frustrating? It can be very much so. Especially when you spend ten minutes running from one building to the next looking for weapons and ammo only to be gunned down by a more experienced or luckier player who have managed to pick the perfect landing spot and getting their hands on the right bits of kit(equipment). On the other side of the coin you do get moments where YOU get the drop on the opposition and that can be strangely satisfiying. Especially when you clobber them with the OP pan while they are trying to feed some bullets into the breach of their most coveted weapon.I would recomened this game to anyone but I have noticed a lot of controversy in other reviews about gunning down a player who is also streaming at the same time. I personally haven't had any issues with this myself so I can't give any feedback on that area. As a whole PUBG is fun to play but be warned if you plan on going in solo you had better be in favour with the gods because your enemies will not show you any mercy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-13,0,0,409,False,Not Recommended,"1.0 Review Honestly it's a pretty crappy game that was rushed to 1.0. Numerous early access bugs/aspects remain such as late spawning loot poor hitbox detection early game dsync non loading terrain at distance (even while looking through scopes I might add) HORRIBLE melee system and many more. While the core gameplay can be fun at times and keep someone engaged on occasion for hundreds of hours (look at my playtime) I get the sense that a lot of players are just waiting for a better implemented game to come along. Many have already found that in Fortnite. It has improved significantly from early access in areas of average FPS and overall dsync but it is still FAR from a ""1.0 packaged product"". The developers are slow to roll out updates and bug fixes or even to COMMUNICATE future updates. PUBG is a phenomenon of a rushed game that filled a vacuum of battle royale demand with the large help of Twitch streamers and other content creators popularizing the game. I myself will most likely continue to play it until a better game comes along which I imagine will be soon. If you haven't picked up this game already you surely can wait along with me.

2017-12-19,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,"Too be honest I'm not quite done with this review. I still need more hours into the game to solidify the statements I'm about to make but for now I can not recommend PUBG without a friend. With a friend however this game is a blast. ( As with pretty much any other game.) Having a bunch of funny moments to look back on is always great but without a friend you start to see the critical flaws with how this game plays. You start out with around 100 people all sitting in a plane that is flying towards a large island. You are then ejected out of the plane at your given choice and sent into a map filled with houses with a then filled with guns. You then must either make your way towards a white circle that gets smaller periodically over time. With a blue area denial type circle forcing players towards the white one. This system would work great if it wasn't for the fact the whoever gets in it first or more likely whoever was the lucky one to be dead in the middle of it didn't have a complete advantage over everyone else who have to make their way to HIS turf.Another issue is the optimization but this could soon be fixed for some with the 1.0 patch. As it stands however the game 3.6 gb of RAM while not in a game so for anyone with 8gb of RAM might have some issues with loading in things like buildings quick enough to be effective. I personally have a powerful enough system to run this game smoothly at 60 fps with little to no issues.Then there is the crashes so far I have had around 6 crashes since I started playing with all of them being in the middle of a match. If the playtime/crash ratio is correct it is close to 1 crash every 2 hours. That is insane even for a indie title especially an indie title with millions of dollars. Solo play is frustrating and very much based on RNG. You checked the left corner instead of the right corner while sweaping a building dead. Busy looting a house when a decked out man drives up and one shots you? Get better at the game and I'm sure that won't happen again. Grow some balls and go straight for School? Sorry someone got a gun a second before you and has already started screaming into the mic to mock your noobness. You get the idea. I've heard a lot of people saying there is a lot of hackers. Well I personally have not seen any hackers ( At least from what I can tell.) and mostly only see people who do nothing but play this game and shoot me with their AKM from half a mile away. Though maybe their the hackers.Now on to the positive side of things. This game can be fun when RNG is on your side and get the S12 and walk into the building with all the naked people bunching eachother. Quite satisfying indeed. Plus playing with friends is always a blast hearing your dead friend scream ""HOETO"" at a hawainn guy who also screams the same thing at me is a wonderful experience. Of course when your friend leaves and leaves you with Solo it is pretty crappy. Excuse the grammar. kappa",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-19,0,0,1900,True,Recommended,PUBG is a great game overall and design is solid. Some issues i have with the game is when lag hits parachuting 234kmh on to a rooftop the loot don't show up and can miss a crucial weapon.

I could care less about the hackers from those areas because NA has its fair share too. The issue I have is that these people from across the globe are connecting to our servers with high pink and it's making servers lag. Sometimes it can take full seconds for a bullet hit to register. It messes us the balance of the game. The creator of this game Mr. Green is an a****le. He does not listen to what the community has been saying. Instead he calls up xenophobic and just assumes we are racist. I couldn't care any less about what the color of the skin is of the virtual dude I'm shooting. I just want him to go down when I shoot.

The gameplay has evolved from a mod to what now appears to be a decent well thought out and stable game for the PC. The recent addition of a new desert map and constant DEV tweaking of the weapons and character abilities make the game a challenge and fun to play.There are down sides as in every PC game the hackers cheats and exploiters will we ever see them go and play PS4? Not likely makes the game more challenging than it already is. Once you get to know the maps the game plays easier which while more fun on one side makes the game a bit droll at other times.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I wasn't really a fan of Survial Games since H1Z1 but I still tried out the game and it turned out I still dont enjoy them. Just to make sure I will put also some of my own opinion in this review so its maybe a bit more relatable. First of all I have to say the Performance is really bad for my spec (Nvidia GTX 960 4GB AMD FX 8350). I mostly just got 40 50 FPS on the lowest available settings. I also think its really frustrating that when you are new to the game you baerly have anything to learn how the weapons work or how their recoil is. When playing 1 round for around 30mins and then dying instantly cause ur weapon is maybe a sniper and you didnt realised it its pretty upsetting or when you get killed from 2 people behind you. Really feels like wasted time. Im aware that there are a lot of people liking Battle Royale games. But personaly its not my type of game. The performance for Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is as said not very good. And not every normal PC Player can afford a huge setup to get a decent performance in games like these. Hopefully they will do some more changes in the near future but for now it really is just laggy and the whole World just doesnt really look good on lowest Graphics.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,112,True,Recommended,Fun when you're engaged but the game gets boring very quickly as you run across the whole map and only see 1 2 teams unless you're lucky. If you dont have a problem with passive play this is a game for you but if you're aggressive you'll find it hard to find teams outside of the initial drop into a crowded town. The hit detection is also horrible as you'll be aimed right on someone but hit the obstacle you're taking cover behind even if you're looking over it. But other than them issues the game is pretty fun if you're playing with a friend or friends as you can keep eachother entertained while running 2 km to not find anyone. So i have mixed feelings here but yeah why not go for it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've played it more than I should (considering how much free time I had) and I actually won a match after 12 14 hours of playing. It's slow paced unlike H1Z1's KOTK which is just fine by me.

2017-04-02,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Love this game but there a few problemsPros Great game in general Quick matchmaking especially for 100 people. Cons Loot is still terrible. Some houses will have 3 backpacks (all levels or will vary) just have energy drinks &amp clothes or just heaps of micro UZi's/UMP's shotguns &amp handguns. When you die you aren't shown where the person killed you was standing (I get this can't be allowed for teams but this would be increasing the amount of reports). Still limited range of fire arms. Only a couple of good guns which are hard to comeby. Vehicles are somewhat common but necessary if you need to travel a fair distance. circle closes way too quickly you can never outrun the circle you have to start running way before the circle starts to close. Would be great to see additional maps added.Apart from all of this you should definetly buy this game. $29.99USD is an absolute steal for what it is!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-31,0,0,59,True,Recommended,Short but sweet review This game is fun seriously it's in early access because it's not finished but that just adds to the amount of potential the game has.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-31,0,0,543,True,Recommended,"This is a really fun game especially with friends. Pros Game can be played in different ways by jumping either into crowded or uncrowded areas so unless you jump school every time your experience can be different every game. Then if you like jumping school or military base every time you can do that too.Guns are pretty balanced according to how easy/difficult they are to acquire.Very active and responsive development team (mostly).Cons Desperately need to implement leaderboards for First Person Perspective. FPP is the future of the game I think. Optimisation server tickrate server consistency all need improvement. Clothing items need to be removed as in game lootable items. They serve absolutely zero point other than obscuring other loot. I feel like this would help improve the game's loading a bit as computers and servers wouldn't have to render hundreds of extra useless items. Note A lot of people have problems with getting banned but I don't really see why it's such a huge problem. For the most part if you're not a jerk you won't get banned. Going around yelling ""F YOU"" to people is pretty stupid. I personally don't think someone deserves a ban for something like that unless they're yelling racial slurs and stuff. But in most games targeted language of any kind can get you banned. Saying ""OH WHAT THE F JUST HAPPENED"" is different from ""HEY BIOTCH GO F YOURSELF F ER."" Maybe you think you're just having fun but in reality you're being an I turned off all chat in game though so I can't hear if someone's cussing me out or not.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,629,True,Not Recommended,"Extremely un optimized game. You get almost the same FPS in Low settings as with Extreme graphics settings and its barely breaking 60 fps Average with a GTX 1080 and a 4.2 Ghz 4 core cpu. Been this way for the past 6 months dont have my hopes up concidering the new map is prettier but you get only a slight increase in performance. The game is buggy so you'll have to adapt to the games flaws instead of just getting good. About 50% of Vehicles are pretty much unusable unless you want to kill yourself cause your team is dead and they're waiting for you to die so you can play another round. Servers are unstable to often and no this is not a problem with my network since everyone im playing with experience these issues at the same time. Server stability issues result in a sluggish rubberbanding shots not registering getting shot behind cover t experience. Way to often. In about 1/10 games you're lucky enough to get on a stable server that stops lagging after about 5 minutes. These are game breaking issues that are present in almost every game you're playing.I can see past some things like the map being too big which results in you either sitting in loading screen most of the time since you felt like jumping in a high risk area or you're just running around looting untill there's about 30 players left. Or the fact that theres no game mode to practice with different. Or that the sound is probably the worst i've experienced in a game that sold over 100 copies it's basically impossible to sneak up on people or accurately locate other players without flinging your mouse back and forth over the mousepad hoping they shoot/step enough times so you can point in the somewhat right direction.This game is only fun for a couple of hours to be honest i've put 200 hours into it and i can only recall a few good memories most when i was new and unaware of all the I'm alot better now not because i've mastered the game but i've adapted to the flaws of the game. Based on my own experience I'd say you'll enjoy aproximately 2% of the time spend on this game. But it's the old ""My friends play it so i guess i'll join untill something better is released.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I want to like this game. And I've won plenty of times. It isn't worth it. It makes my day less enjoyable and ruins the only time I have away from work. PUBG is like chips. It just makes you reach for more when in reality you don't actually want more you just want all the frustration and pain to be worth something. You think that in the end surely it must be worth it.

2017-12-03,0,0,569,False,Recommended,Addicting a lot of replayability. You might think of it as a copy of H1Z1 don't! This is so much more realistic and balanced you don't just need to have good aim you have to use your brain as well in order to eat chicken at dinner time.I'm not just fanboying PUBG it really deserves it and is probably the experience of the decade nothing really can compare to it right now it's such an innovating idea/experience that makes this game replayable for infinite times because it's just so enjoyable to play it! That's also why it has beaten every record in the Steam Record book you thought it was for no reason at all?! Hell nah they deserve it.Oh and if you want an even better experience play with friends it's even more enjoyable that way.People might say the devs don't care for the players' opinion but they're completely wrong I've been following the latest issues in the game for the past two months and most of what people were complaining is already fixed/balanced. There was an issue were you didn't earn BP at the end of the match for 2 weeks (not every match just a few) guess what two updates after they get you all that you deserved during those weeks your all mighty BP you were all crying about (I was able to earn 22k BP compensation for that time).We were complaining about the game optimization they optimized it and still continue to optimize it even more every single update.There was a hacker rampage on all servers for a few days and after everyones complaints there aren't nearly as many JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER and yet they say they don't care for the players' opinion.Not looking for just fun you're a competitive player that wants to be the best? Don't worry this game got plenty of competition ahead of you.Go for it! It will be a great experience and it's definitely worth the money. (Also I've recoreved the game money just from skins so definitely worth it),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-06,0,0,521,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. (Original for July 2017)I've logged quite a bit of hours into this game.The first 40 50 hours were very enjoyable but as time went on I started to notice the flaws of this game.Now the game is a drastic improvement on H1Z1 in most if not every way imaginable but is that to say the game is great or even amazing?Far from it.First of all regardless of who you are regardless of your pc specs you will have crashed not just once twice oreven three times.You will have and will continue to crash a lot.I have logged over 1000 hours into DayZ call me bat crazy but in those 1000+ hours I can tell you I've crashed at least 10x more in slightly less than a 10th of the playtime in this game then I have in DayZ which is absolutely absurd.Secondly The desync.The desync is very very weird in this game.It spands from you getting shot despite being behind cover to getting hit by a vehicle despite having a good 5 meters between you and it.Whilst this may not fall under desync the fact that players obviously don't see the same things as other can bring many complications.An example would be smoke grenades.I am not sure whether or not they fixed this in Rainbow Six Siege but not too long ago you could throw a smoke grenade and to you you feel as if there's enough smoke to the point where you should not be seen but au contraire what you see is different from what your enemy sees.To you you're clouded to your enemy you're just running out in the open hence what's going on in PUBG you may throw a smoke thinking you'll be safe but if yourenemy sees differently what you see no longer applies and you will most likely get shot and potentially killed.Optimization is an odd topic as I myself have rarely been affected by it but I've read many reviews of people barely even being able to play the game because of it so I don't know.I've read many reviews PRAISING the ""bullet physics"".I'm sorry but the game's ballistics are how can I say this VERY limited?There's bullet drop. That's it.You want legitimate ballistics?Go play Arma 3 with the ACE mod.Although despite it all I do understand that the game isn't trying to be overly realistic but come on no bullet penetration? Really?Wooden guard towers are bullet proof.Water whilst yes realisticly it is good at stopping bullets it is not an impenetrable shield.Basic drywall...walls. Bulletproof.The game is not Rainbow Six Siege but bullet penetration to additional objects would make it remarkably better.Another aspect of the game that many people praise far too much are the visuals.They're fine. Get over it.We are not looking at a AAA title and hell they didn't even dsign their own weapon models.https //www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/animated ironbelly fps starter kitThereare more but I simply posted this one link as aform of reference. Dig around yourself.This game has the absolute worst way ofdealing with lag.Should you be unfortunate enough to encounter lag you won't be rubberbanding around you'll be standing still unable to do anything whilst the game goes on all around you.All you can do is sit there and wait.This is the only game I've played that has done this and it is frustrating.I may lag in another game but it does not stop medead in my tracks I'll still be able to move although be it at a very wonky pace.A friend gifted me this game and with friends is the only time I can enjoy this game and whilst I do get a bit of satisfaction out of winning a game I much prefer just messing around rather than actually playing it theway it was intended.Also who the hell decided to make care packages drop snipers without scopes?The practicality of the ""sniper"" just nose dives into a 4x might make a bit more useful but any less than that and the whole thing becomes borderline useless.Any who If I were to give the game a rating in it's current state It'd be a 6.5/10.It's enjoyable with friends.Pretty damn flawed but it's an early access game.Can't wait for 1st person only servers.Edit Jan 26 2018 Stopped playing the game in September of 2017 and recently came back because a friend asked me to play.Figured why the hell not.Joined my first game in months and the game crashed. Wonderful I said.After finally getting into a game that worked I found myself in shock and awe at how smoothly the game ran since the last time I played.It felt like a completely different game because of this and I actually found myself enjoying the game a bit more since I last played purely because of this although the deeper I dug the more and more I despised the game like I used to.PROS Game runs like butter They added a new map.CONS bad_module_info Entire game freezing for everyone Desync that still has yet to get fixed Scripters/Cheaters/Hackers Awful map rotation (The map played being Miramar like 80% of the time) Inaccurate patch notes ( PC 1.0 Update #1 ""Fixed the issue where bullets couldn t penetrate particular fences from both sides."" This legitimately was not fixed until a week or two later after the official release of the patch) There's probably stuff I'm missing on both negative and positive spectrums but these were the most appealing/unappealing of the bunch for me thus far.As I've stated game runs like butter and can be very enjoyable but the sheer amount of sketchy I've witnessed in the past two weeks of playing has just made me hate the game even more due to the fact that even with the game's ""official release"" it still feels like a beta.Official release and still a plethora of bugs some game breaking either legitimate cheaters or the death cam is ed DESYNC and lastly I know there's a new map but I'd rather not play it 8/10 matches it gets horribly dull.5.5/10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-25,0,0,331,False,Recommended,Quickly became addict to this game. I've always like ffs however games like csgo and Cod have never been my style with their too quick to follow gameplay. While you can choose to have some of those moments in this game it's especially fun being in a squad looting the land and searching for fights while sometimes running into one unexpectedly. The blue circle is great at forcing the players together and is sometimes a deadly obstacle itself when you haven't properly planned when to move and where.Many people have issues with hackers but they usually die quickly anyways and are rare to run into. If I could change anything it would be to have the choice to which map you can play. So far we have the original island and the desert but I've been forced to play the desert 95% of my games and it gets tiring. Overall an amazing game that I highly recommend to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are able to exit the game and reload it in time with your squad still active then it leaves you with a huge unfair advantage due to time being shortened each round and you loosing out on a good few minutes.I am currently writing this review looking at my second screen at the game that has crashed and has done many times this last few weeks forcing me to shut my pc down.It cant be my pc as It does not do this with any other game and being lucky enough to own a good gaming pc its highly unlikley its my end.I really want to support the game as it is brilliant and have spent countless hungry and frustrating hours trying to get a chicken dinner and really enjoyed it but something needs to be sorted regarding these bugs.Im slowly turning my back to PUBG which is a shame as its one of the top games out there ( (sorry for the terrible language).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,43,True,Recommended,I honestly see why no one can dislike this game. Sure it's not for some people but the reasons people say its a bad game are just stupid. 1) Of course there will be hackers. Any highly successful game will have them. The devs are always working on this issue. Out of the time I have played I haven't run into any hackers.2) Sure there is some lag but again games like couter strike have on some occasions laggy servers. We have to remember the game has not fully launched yet. If you want a completely perfect game buy it after launch3) Gameplay. The gameplay is all but boring.

This is in the midst of combat sure you get dsync and what not but I have yet to experience any issues with the game outside of the normal nonsense.On a note to those hesitant I too hesitated. I bought it and sure as hell there was or are insert expletive here issues to deal with but the game itself and the optimisation im my case is fun and not an issue.I have a Nvidia 1050 tiI have a i5 7600 3.5 GHz CPU (usually its running at full closer to 4.1 or something)I have Windows 10I have 16 GB RAMThe problem im afraid while this may not always be the case lies with the end user. In most cases. Not all.EDIT I do not recommend solo. Play with friends that way the game is fun. Get killed by a hacker?

When you consider how many people in these reviews have hundreds of hours in this game you think ""what's so special about this game""? I think its the perfect balance of hardcore and casual battle royale games. More UI and indicators than something like ARMA but still holding more realism than Fortnight BR. The issues with this game I believe will eventually be worked out. Most other early access games are dead by this point but PUBG has shown continual patching with an overall trend towards a better game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,567,True,Recommended,"When I first played this game I didn't like it. Was it buggy? A little but it is early access. Was it too complex? Nope the idea is simple. What was it that I didn't like about it then? I sucked at it. Plain and simple. I couldn't be a run and gun spray and pray gun wielding maniac. It took all of my experience in FPS and all over it and screamed at me ""You are a noob!"" I was affronted and left it in my library like an old book that didn't captivate me in the first few chapters.Some time later I came back to it and boys and girls was I glad I did. I came at it from a more mature approach. This game was about strategy and survival. About thinking and out thinking 99 other players. Now admittedly I don't play solo. It doesn't do it for me but I love duos and squad play is a good bit of fun too. It challenges me stresses me frustrates me and urges me to do better. And when you taste the sweet sweet victory and experience your first chicken dinner it makes all the hours worth it. Highly recommend this game for people who like a challenge and can accept that they won't win every single game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-05,0,0,590,False,Not Recommended,This game has hands down the most unbearably worthless user interface that I've ever had the displeasure of using. The anticheat is obviously absent from the game. You're unable to add anyone in your squad to you friendslist or communicate with them other than primatively. Razer and several other hardware companys all make products that come with software that you can use to make macros to abuse this game. They have no plans on stopping this. The ping limit is &gt 2000ms allowing players to abuse lagswitches and long distance server pings to not get hit. (ie why there are so many asian players in the NA/EU servers.) Erangel is so wide and flat that if you don't have an 8x scope within the first few moments you'll be trapped in buildings until the end of the game.

2017-12-27,0,0,287,False,Recommended,"Well now that the 1.0 version is out and the game is officially out of Early Access I guess I can drop a review.First things first even though the game is out of Early Access it doesn't mean there are no bugs. There are. A lot. But I believe it will decrease over time since it's a constant work in progress. Improvements made on the 1.0 version The 1.0 version is a huge improvement over the beta version. The main improvement here is the game optimization. It runs so much more smoothly and at a stable frame rate than before. Congratulations to the Bluehole and PUBG Corp team for that. Also the new map Miramar is so much fun to play and gives the game a breath of fresh air to know that there are two maps to play from (not to choose from yet). Of course the new map runs better than the old one since it's a desert map and there's way less trees grass and other stuff so it's less GPU intensive. But Erangel saw a huge improvement in performance in the 1.0 version. Servers and connection Now regarding the servers and the connection. It still has a lot to improve on. Game starts are literally unplayable at least 7 out of 10 times. You try to reach for a gun at the very start and your character keeps rolling back it's like one step forward and three steps back. The infamous ''rubber banding'' still needs to be taken care of. Only after the first twenty or thirty players have died it starts to wear off. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all sometimes it happens it's a lottery. Gameplay As for the gameplay experience you will have playing this game. No complaints regarding that. It's so much fun! Every match is a different match and it feels fresh again. One thing I especially like about PUBG is that you can play a new match very quickly after you finished the other. You die in your previous match and in a matter of seconds you are already in other match. This is very good! The game is such a huge success because it's a breth of fresh air in the gaming industry it's unique unlike any other survival game that came before PUBG. People say it's an H1Z1 rip off but what people don't seem to know or remember is that Brendan ""PLAYERUNKNOWN"" Greene was part of the team that created H1Z1! He also created the ArmA III Battle Royale mod so it's original. And this game feels amazing! So much better than H1Z1 DayZ (NewZ? hahaha) and every other survival game out there and in my opinion it sets a new landmark in the gaming industry. Definitely the best game of 2017. Too bad they gave the GOTY award to a freaking console game than to PUBG the most played game of 2017. But that's okay it's just a title. The numbers don't lie. Graphics and weapon handling And what about the graphics? Well the graphics are amazing. It's made on the Unreal Engine 4 what can I say more about the graphics? They are very good and realistic if you have a good rig don't refrain from putting it all to ultra settings it feels amazing.Weapon handling is good too. Weapon sounds are realistics realistic bullet drop and weapons too. To sum up Pros Great graphics Fun to play either solo or with a few friends Fast paced action packed gameplay The next round will always feel different from the previous one Huge playerbase meaning that you'll never have to wait longer than 5 seconds to get into a match Cons Sometimes it can feel a bit laggy on game start Cheaters It's not region locked so more often than not you'll find players from other regions playing in your region which can be a disadvantage because their latency will be off the charts making it harder to kill them It's still poorly optimized meaning that even the best of the best PC's will encounter some trouble running it on ultra settings on a stable 60 (or 144) fps Not being able to chose what map you want to play. Final score 8/10 recommended!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-27,0,0,82,False,Recommended,"Great game i would recomend it to anyone. That being said im not sure if the game shouldve really left early access yet it still feels unfinished. Mainly there are latency issues (when i watch the ""death cam"" the person killing me is aiming way behind me). And something about the overall game feels pretty unpolished.AND...! What i truly want to see is more game modes. Battle Royal Duals and Squad are great but i really want to see how this game would handle more conventional game modes (ie team deathmatch capture the flag conquest etc.) I think turning this game into the end all be all of first person shooters would be amazing. I dont want to buy COD i dont want to support EA I want a game that replaces everything else on the market. The ""feel"" of the game is better than most. The engine is almost perfect. Now i want to expand on that and have custom classes respawns a progress/unlock tree with. Basically i want this game to replace every other shooter i own and give me and my friends the perfect FPS.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Tuck the wing tips behind the neck and loosely tie the legs together with a piece of kitchen twine. Season the breast all over with 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper. Turn the chicken over. Season the back all over with 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper. Drizzle the oil evenly over the back of the chicken.Roast the chicken breast side down for 30 minutes. Turn it over by inserting sturdy tongs into the cavity and flipping it. Continue roasting until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 165 to 170 F an additional 30 to 35 minutes.Transfer the chicken to a cutting board loosely tent it with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes.If you re making the pan sauce While the chicken rests remove the roasting rack from the pan and let the pan sit for 10 minutes to slightly cool the pan juices. Tilt the pan so the juices run to one corner. Use a large soup spoon to skim off and discard as much of the clear fat as possible.Position the pan over a large burner on high heat. Pour the wine into the pan. Using a wooden spoon scrape up the browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. Add 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer. If the liquid does not cover the entire bottom of your pan tilt the pan to move the liquid around. Continue scraping up all of the bits using the back of the spoon to dissolve as much of the browned bits as you can until the sauce reduces to about 1/3 cup and is a deep mahogany color 8 to 10 minutes.Take the pan off the heat add the parsley and swirl in the cold butter until it melts. Season to taste with pepper and transfer the sauce to a pitcher or bowl for serving.To serve Snip the twine from the chicken s legs carve the chicken and serve.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,137,False,Recommended,PUBG is a great game. Currently there are issues with hackers and textures loading and a million other things but the game is still to fun to put down. Hopefully the release of 1.0 in 20hrs will show improvements in some areas. Ping lock is coming and will help with server lag. As far as gameplay prepare to die. Competition is tough. I am by no means a good online shooter player but I am not the worst and I have yet to win a chicken dinner in 100 hrs. Third is my best finish. Kills are so satisfying because they don't come easy. Stealth is the name of the game. The player that spots another first has a huge advantage. This is not a run and gun game. Many different strategies to try some players camp and play to survive some players like to drop at the school and big cities and fight it out early. It's up to you.

Now that I have your attention the frustaration that I encounter is not on the game itself. It has to do with me as a player. I love this game but the only thing that I have against it is my inability to break the top 5. You think that you are going to play it smart that everything will be fine if you take it slow and just try to make sure that you sweep the area. Boy are you mistaken when you play this game it will be intense! I love this game. If you have any time what so ever you need to play this game at least once. This game will take some time to learn but when the learning curve is over then you will have the time of your life! Don't play this game if you have somewhere to be within the next hour.

How can I possibly upvote a game that has so many hackers and no way to possibly help anyone that is a little bad at playing it? And also did blue hole nerf the spawn rate of guns in general? I'll go into pecado for example and not find a single gun in an entire two story building and someone pops up with all lvl. 3 armor with a SCAR L and just obliterate me in seconds when the game starts. This is ridiculous! The main focus should be a way to deal with all the hackers and not rushing the game to full launch.

2017-12-27,0,0,192,False,Recommended,PUBG is a game that I certainely think is a must try for every fan of multiplayer games. This game is not with out a ton of flaws but in my personal opinion the flaws don't out weigh the good. The game is fun to play. No two games are really the same. You never really know what is going to happen which is great for a game that is only multiplayer. I enjoy playing solo games while my friends watch over my shoulder and playing in duos and teams. I love the crazy and cool things that can happen. I like how in almost 30 hours played I still don't know the whole map. I like how matches don't soak up a lot of your time and you don't have to be heavily invested to do well or have fun. I just think it's a fun game that everyone should try out.Now here is why I can also agree that this game is t. Since being in early access the constant frame rate drops game crashes lag texture rendering gpu/cpu murdering that happens can be beyond frustrating. I'm running an I5 66k with a GTX 970 and sometiems my game STILL has issues running it. Considering the game has never waivered from a $30 price tag and selling over a million copies you'd think they could fund fixing the game faster and making it stable. I think the developers are doing what they can but I think greed plays a factor and they aren't focusing on ther right things. Another flaw in my opinion going back to the money they've made you'd think there would be a little more variation in maps guns and customization. Overall for $30 you get a better multiplayer experience than some AAA titles. It's a trend setter and honestly the best battle royale game in my opinion. You can expect fun and exciting games and you can expect lag and performance issues. However ignoring a questionable port to console and future plans to port to mobile devices. If the developer focuses more on customization stability and content you have a game with a bright future so long as the hype doesn't die out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-09,0,0,329,False,Recommended,I have a love hate relationship for this game. Sometimes I get like really random great kills other times I'm just a nervous wreck and I die. why? Because you spend half the game running away from blue and hoping you don't get sniped in an open field.Pros If you aren't an idiot you can consistently make top 5. But you'll average like 1 4 kills a game. Yeah. Not a big killer game. More stragetic and common sense orientated. If you want to head toward 3 different squads fighting then you'll probably lose. Or end up in a fight that takes you into the blue death circle and then it was pointless. So people who want to get kills like cray should stick to BF or something. You have 1 life and it's important. I've won games where my entire squad died way early and I just finished off the last two people fighting hiding in a bush because they had no idea I was there. Yeah scaredy cat tactic but it worked and I played through an entire 89 players without getting caught. Near the end it's kinda a game of someone running around being distracting so you can lure the last of the squads out (maybe the last 4 players) so your team can get a good view. Will you die? Maybe. Team work is a big deal. I end up being the medic the spotter call out while my other friend is better at finishing off people near the end because I'll suicide mission so they know where they are. Someone else in our team is probably a great sniper. Another person is a flanker. It's almost a survival horror (LOL) because you're running and you're very aware there's people behind you who WILL die to blue but want to take you out anyway. Oh well. That's why you have other teammates. Playing smart gurantees wins. Playing super crazy and aggressive usually makes you lose unless you're actually very good at it.

2018-02-05,0,0,783,False,Not Recommended,This review is subject to change. I've played since Alpha and had to deal with hackers constantly. That's annoying but what has now become more annoying is the NA servers having players from china come on. It wouldn't be bad if they spoke English. My whole game is dealing with a language barrier and it pisses me off. I get english speaking players 1 out of 15 games. So unless you have friends on or you can understand asian languages this might be great for you. If you have no friends and can't speak anything other than english. Buy something else. You took my money now fix the servers. Even a soft lock on servers would be great. Like the only way a chinese person can be on NA is if he's grouped with NA players.

2018-01-12,0,0,306,False,Recommended,So I'll recommend the game sort of.It's kind of way over hyped.Really it's not a great design. Most of your games will only you off sometimes you'll get a few good games but that's mostly with friends. In fact unless you have friends to play with regularly I highly recommend not getting this game. Solo sucks.Also the game will forever continue to have huge cheater problem.Camping is also 90% of the game the other 10% is getting ed by the circle.It's a fun game with friends in the right mood but it really doesn't deserve the praise it gets. The whole BR design is kind of when you sit and think about it. It'll always favor the lucky camper with a sniper rifle if your the one being forced to move often times it's better to quit than give another player a kill.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Although we only met once but I always remember their friendly voice we have some wonderful memories I am very happy to meet these people. I'm sure you've all met with foreign brothers and we shouldn't let them ruin our feelings. t game company strengthens the anti hanging mechanism!!!我只是一个普通的中国玩家 我经常碰到外挂 这导致我的游戏体验很差 但是我觉得你们不应该呼吁游戏公司锁区 而是让他们加强一下这狗屎的反外挂机制 我在很多大区都碰到过一些非常友善的朋友 例如 三个友善的美国兄弟 一个勇猛的俄罗斯兄弟 一个有趣的东南亚兄弟 一个可爱的英国兄弟 一个有点傻的韩国兄弟 以及一个绅士的日本兄弟 虽然我们只见过一次 但我永远记得他们友善的声音 我们有一些美好的回忆 能碰到这些人我很开心 我相信你们都碰到过外国兄弟 我们不应该让外挂破坏我们的感情 狗屎游戏公司加强反外挂机制,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now with the replay fuction you think it would lower the ammount but nope. Not surprised tho as even after reporting players with video link of clear ESP and Low FOV aimbot the responce was ""we will watch him"" well its been 2 weeks now and he is in the top 5 and still playing with a 60% headshot rating.Part of me wonders if the cheaters and hackers are allowed to play for a set time before the bans so that they will buy the game again. (Business Plan maybe?)The best matches you have are after patches when most of the cheats are worried if the patch will catch them.The Zone The zone moves too quick towards the end of the matches you should always be able to run the same speed of it. It ends up being counter productive to gun play as if you end up on the edge and get into a fire fight 90% of the time your gonna die. So you end up choosing not to shoot people in a shooting game. Also if you get unlucky with your location and the circle ends up on the other side of the map it ends up becoming a running simulator. Maybe the first circle should be up before you jump so you can choose if you really want to be that far away from it?Overal Love the game despise the Cheaters.

2017-12-20,0,0,494,True,Recommended,To start with the game is very challenging for your gpu it's gonna give it hell but if u fit the minimum requirements u will be able to play but players with better graphics will always have an advantage vs you because they can spot you more easily. The game have some bug issues but since it's not released (yet) you cant do many things about it . On the otherside the game is fun adventurous challenging and breathtaking even more if you play with your buddies as a squad. I tell you guys you are in a hell where you can die at any moment from a sniper at the mountain across but if you make it to top 10 your heart starts feeling funny you calculate shots with your heartbeats pumping at your finger at the mouse triger. I have been a gamer for 13 years and i have never had so much emotions playing this game . You can play it hardcore with your headphones to hear every snikky little at the next building or you can just have fun with your friends driving shooting hiding. Also the game responds very well at combat tactics and you really gotta use your brain to win the chicken dinner ! I just won my first solo chicken dinner today and i was thrilled its like you survive through armagedon just imagine being the one who survived between 99 more guys . The game is getting better everyday. If you have a bit of patience i totally recommend it especially if you have some friends to play with (or you can make new at discord etc) !

However in saying this for someone who takes this game seriously will dislike this game due to the many flaws that some of the modes such as the third person mode provides such as being seen from around the corner. Other game breaking glitches such as spawning from the airplane being able to not see any buildings and rocks allowing the person to drive vehicles through a apartment building killing a person who is looting for weapons.

Instead of voicing my opinion I should voice qualities in the game and where it can go leading forward.With that said this game will make or break itself with the 1.0 release speculated to come at the end of this year (2017.) The choices that the dev team has made with Microsoft has hindered the consistent PC update schedule they promised us back in the release month of March.Now all gamers PC and Xbox must wait to anticipate the reborn greatest game of 2018.

2018-02-16,0,0,412,False,Not Recommended,The game it self is stella and great fun in 4 man groups or duo q. Not a fan of solo personaly i play the game to play with friends. Game play is pretty fluid the lag in game is really good playing any where in the world. Im aussie but play NA AS OC all pretty good. Server tic rate is not the best Gun accuracy is also not the best even for the profesional streamers at times you see them on target but miss often.As for the cheaters..... There is not enough being done its very bad at this time with running into cheaters every second game in squads and 3rd person. I like 3rd person alot dont alot do its personal preference at the end of the day.... 50% of the cheaters are from china and the weekends is where the cheating is rife my small 3 man group would run into hackers 50% of the time in games. Thing is they esp hack aim bot so they are always geared level 3 and silences. With rifles they can auto first at range and instantly knock you down or kill you. There is no way to report people in your own squard who are cheating. My advise is to knock them down if they are cheating and leave them there. Thats what we do.Unless player unknown does something about the cheaters and takes a hard stand on them i would stay away from this game in its current state. Most of my friends who played no longer play because of the hackers. Its a pitty the game has come a long way but the cheaters are ruining it for every one and not enough has been done to stop it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,126,True,Not Recommended,This game is a mess I feel bad for both buying this for myself and for a friend of mine as a birthday gift. Ever since the start it has been getting worse with patches and updates that so far haven't helped the game much or have made it worse over time. During the beginning of its release it seemed to be a fun game because there was always a lot of action and it involved some fun teamplay. I see how the concept of the game is fun and great even but the mechanics of this game don't work well along with it as do the servers because it can't handle the vast majority of players that play the game (Which they still haven't fixed to my knowledge).Also worth mentioning is that these devs are not trustworthy as they have broken promises such as when they said microtransactions were not going to be part of the game and they included it anyways with loot boxes for cosmetics. Sure it may not be a big deal for those who don't care about cosmetics but some people care about cosmetics as they like to look cool while playing the game.All in all this game has bugs and glitches as well as bad server performance and consumes your CPU GPU and RAM if you don't meet its required hardware specifications. Stay away from this game if you can and tell your friends the same buy a different game that is worth the money you are willing to spend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,706,True,Recommended,Great game seriously addicting being a Veteran this game really simulates real world combat. A great audio system or headphones are a must. Remember this isnt CS GO the bullets actually have physics. You have to lead people account for range by shooting higher etc. A few errors here and there nothing game breaking after all it's not even officially out yet. I seem to crash maybe once every few days but I'm starting to think that might be my GeForce Experience Replay feature causing it.If I have a major complaint the only one would be restricitng servers by ping and/or region. Chinese hackers are pretty rampant I run across one every few games. Sad part they are mainly hacking on NA Servers if you play the Asian servers you dont see near as many cheaters.If you want a really fun but hard game grab this. I've been having a blast since I started can't wait to see this new map coming out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,375,True,Recommended,"It is the best multiplayer FPS since CS. Quite a lot of fun but must be played in a squad with your friends to realise it's full potential. Playing with Randoms is exactly that random. It's not without it's glitches and lag rears it's ugly head quite a fair bit but when it's all going well it's excellent.Skill cieling is extremelt high so expect at least 80 100 hours of play before really getting into it.As for the negative feedback this game gets yes there are some crashes and bugs this was after all early access. It crashes you restart the game and continue where you left off. To be honest I did not have many issues with crashing. Make sure you have a beefy PC to handle it and it's quite fine. Even with the issues it was quite playable and once you get past the millenial ""must have it now or else"" attitude it truly is an awesome game for $29.

2017-12-20,0,0,402,True,Recommended,I resisted the hype for so long only to end up thoroughly enjoying the game. 1up Refreshing take on a survivalistic game. Single Duo and Squad options. Never a problem getting 100 players to matchmake There are many addictive factors that bring you back for more. (Including anxiety) Hackers and bans for killings streamers occur far less than many lead you to believe. The sound phyics are fantastic. You'll rely on the sounds far more than any game you've recently played.1dwn Optimization is meh. However likely will continue to improve. New map releasing soon is just as awesome as the first. Lame system for unlocking items to customize your character. If there isn't a few more solid patches/ expansions for more maps etc....the player count could begin declining. TL DR There is easily $30 worth of fun in this game. I'd give it a shot. I was pleasently surprised after I did.

2017-12-22,0,0,318,False,Not Recommended,PlayerUnknown's game has seen it's 1.0 update this major update has delivered few improvements and many flaws. Servers continue to go down in fact server problems are a daily occurence. Client side hit detection has seen no improvements peekers advantage determines the result of a large proportion of firefights and running from a fight will often see you die behind cover. Though the main menu has seen a major redesign it remains unreliable and buggy it's a main menu it shouldn't be broken. Performance has been improved in terms of pure framerate but server performance is still lackluster at best and shoddy at worst. Poor tickrate means firefights are often unsatisfying and hit registration even though it is client side is abysmal. Weapons handle like Arma in the worst way possible with games like Battlefield or Siege or even Rising Storm for inspiration how did this development team create such a sludgy clunky mess?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,474,True,Recommended,Before I start this review let's keep in mind that the game is still in Early Access and most of the negative reviews in here are Chinese players that for some reason had ads in their server and they didn't like that.Now moving from that aspect.The game it self have its bad and good parts.Pros Fun to play alone and with friends. Good optimization (if you are running a potato computer its normal that it will crash/lag) Few bugs (for an Early Access game) A lot of weapons attachments and vehicles to use. Huge map to explore and try different tactics to win that precious Chicken Dinner.Cons Only one map (so far the devs are going to release a desert map very soon) Hackers (even though I've only encountered 2 in 200 hours of gameplay there have been reports of some hackers in game even though they get banned quickly).The game became popular for a reason it was not the marketing that was done it was not because it was made by a huge company but simply because it's fun and easy to play and even though you can get frustrated at some point you still have fun in the end.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-25,0,0,210,True,Recommended,I know there are plenty of things that needs to be improved but you have to also REALIZE this game is NOT DONE. It is in my opinion better than H1Z1. You can purchase this game play it for less than 2 hours (recomend playing Duo and Squad (first person or not) Solo gets a bit boring but it makes it challenging.) Tbh I believe that your experience should tell you wheather or not you want to keep the game or not because it all comes down to you. I for one ENJOY's the game. I enjoyed it more than I did H1Z1.

2018-02-17,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,I have 99 hours logged and I cannot understand why I have not stopped playing after the first 3 5. In the 2.5 months of me playing I do not think there was a single night where I or one fo my friends have not had some sort of a connection issue. Take tonight for isntance. I managed to play 1 game because the servers were too busy on a Saturday night. I am sorry I cannot play at 11am on a Tuesday. The 2 3 other games I did manage to connect to were frozen in the start screen. If the poor server quality for a game is not bad enough then there is the gross amount of hackers in hte game. The one game I did manage to get into and play I got kille dby someone with a kar98 from a rediculus distance with one shot. In fairness he fired 3 more shots at me but I do not count htose due to the 2 buildings that were between us because I was not in sight. I wish I could check off that I recieved this product for free but sadly I did pay for it and for a game tht has made millions these servers and hacker issues should be better ironed out. If they want to improve gameplay I would also suggest that there is a reward for winning like a crae or a key for these stupid locked crates that I do not have a choice if I want to get. To make the map experience better having the first zone appear from the start would be a HUUGE improvement. Let the player decide if they want to spend 90% of a match running or land where the action is likely to take palce. Land just to find out that I am on the complete opposite end from where the zone is located is annoying and frustrating. This is epecially true in the new map where you can die running before you make it to the zone. I didnt purchase this game to run for 15 minutes just to die. If all I wanted to do was run aimlessly for long periods of time I would play Zelda or WoW. If this game seems interesting play fortnite for free with less headaches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,1012,False,Not Recommended,At first this game was amazing. Recently it's become a cesspool of cheaters and hackers. It's fun basically until late at night when all the Chinese players get on. They are literally the worst. Nothing but open mics and hacks and of course the team that produces the game is so convoluted due to the nature of the collaboration that they won't or can't do anything about it. At it's base it's a great game but it's been abandoned by the developers more or less. At the time I'm writing this it's been five days since any social media updates for the game have taken place. No update on the anti cheat (which appears nonexistent) or region locking the cheating Chinese players out. If this game doesn't receive some support soon Fortnite is going to take it over which is too bad because I'd rather play a realistic shooter than some rainbow sprinkles dumpster fire for kids.I'm clicking no for I would not recommend this game currently.

There are so many glaring issues like rubberbanding at the start of a game and periodically throughout that are glossed over by developers and the people that play this game. Nobody seems to acknowledge them or really push for a fix. Instead of fixing these core game issues we get things like vaulting unnecessary ballistic effects and a new map. After playing test server prior to v1.0 it is clear not much has changed. Regardless of the enormous hype for the game out there do not buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-15,0,0,5,True,Recommended,This game is pretty solid however it is another king of the hill style game in Early Access. First how is it as an early access title?Well it's badly optimized but not unplayed. I'm playing on an Acer laptop with a GeForce 840m and I'm getting about 30fps on low settings so it's not great... but it's not unplayable like some of the community may want you to think. There is one map there's a good variety of weapons. The essential sound assets are here like accurate location based footsteps and gunshots. The graphics sometimes bug out when you land on the island and everything is blobby and looks as if it's made from clay.How is it on the gameplay front though?So you join a lobby with 99 other people after a minute of making sure everyone is there you get put into one big plane and you fly over the island. Once over land you can enject whenever and parachute down. Once you land you scavenge for ammo weapons armor weapon mods and safety. There is one problem with this spawning system. Sometimes you may go the entire match without seeing a single person until the end... or you may spawn right beside 3 people and die right away. See everyone is in the same plane so it's dropping 100 people accross the map in a line. People are going to jump out over or close to cities which means 7 times out of 10 you're going to be right beside another person and die. This sucks. It's part of the experience yes but it's brutal and is very frustrating.However those moments when that doesn't happen when you get a good arsenal going and are making it house to house that's awesome. And it's better in duo (50 teams of 2) or squad (25 teams of 4) when you have people to back you up.This game is great it's got some optimization issues and frustrating spawn mechanic but it's solid. If you want to wait till it's out of EA okay. If you want to know how the EA is going it's going good no issues yet. TL DR Is it worth 36 bucks? If you can get over 7/10 times dying right at the beginning due to frustrating spawn mechanics poor optimization 1 map and some graphic bugs... yes! a million times yes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,705,False,Recommended,The gameplay is awesome. Maps (both) are maybe too big and circles moves a bit too slow. If you're a w4nker the game can be extremely long which is boring and there are obviously many w4nkers in this game i myself i have way too much ADHD so i cannot wait like that.Pro awesome game so much tactical stuff it requires aiming skills af which i really like especially the bulletdrop which makes everything even more realistic.Cons A lot of w4nkers WAY too many russkis give them a region so they can speak their demonic language freely. And here comes the nuclear bomb. The worst thing in this game is the optimization. It is so bad. My computer should have atleast 70/80 fps but it doesn't. I've heard that players with 1080 i76000s and 16gb memory are struggling as well. That simply makes no sense even though it a big map and everything. So if you have a sucky PC don't buy it because you'll have a bad experience even though the game is good. FRUSTRATION is the key to avoid in this game D.Overall i like it but i will not continue to play it if they won't optimize the game it simply runs so bad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,368,False,Not Recommended,I really liked this game during early access. It's best played in a squad with friends. After playing too many hours it's become apparent that the gameplay is not consistent enough. Too many RNGs coupled with loads of ineffective loot have killed any sense of joy in the early game. It's impossible to become acclimated with each weapon along with each variety of attachments without pouring hundreds of hours into a game that changes as soon as you feel comfortable. Land in the right spot get your favorite weapon from the start? That's not going to be enough... you'll need attachments armor backpacks meds... and you'll likely find yourself in a situation where a different weapon has the advantage. Ok you'll try grabbing the first weapon you see and skip looting every building... oh you're sure to run right into somebody with a decent weapon/attachments and you will be outgunned.I'm looking forward to better games that will draw inspiration from PUBG's lengthy experiments. Watching twitch highlights on youtube will be far more rewarding than repeatedly losing 25+ min rounds for the sake of practice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,278,False,Recommended,To be fair I've played and enjoyed this game from the start. I have had no problems throughout the development with my rig (I7 6700k GTX 1070 16GB RAM in a nutshell) but there have been small snags such as crashes from time to time but very infrequent. Anyways here's a review after playing a couple of games on version 1.0.FRONT END MENU Front end menu is much more clean crisp and tidy. Much better to look at than in a supposed room with a crate next to your feet. New replay feature which is nice to have in case you forgot to record your last match so you can go in and do your own videos. Game modes and lobbies are very clear and give a description of what you're going into before hitting the play button. Leader boards also possess a much nicer layout than before as well as your own in game stats.ANIMATIONS Animations have been cleaned considerably and with the addition of vaulting it makes the game a lot more fluid. Remember before when you had to run all around them 5 foot white picket fences? Nah. Can now vault straight over them. See that Level 3 Helmet stacked on a load of crates you can't get? Well come here you little blighter I'll climb and get ya. Animation looks very fluid as a whole and am glad they kept in the jumping mechanic as back when this was mentioned there were rumours of this being scrapped altogether for vaulting. Picking up animation is now working correctly also which is a nice change and every action is as swift as the last.WATER They state in the patch notes that they have reduced the waves to increase optimisation. I previously had no issues when around water or swimming but I must admit that although they reduced them you would never know. I've read in a past article that Microsoft Studios were going to help them with the water and it looks like they have an have succeeded. Absolutely beautiful. Water splash has also been added as well as gunfire splash which is a nice addition. One small note is that visibility has been reduced when swimming as I struggled to keep my bearings when underwater and was close to drowning. Luckily you will always know which way is up because of the light from the sun but just bear this in mind.POLISHED PRODUCT The best thing for me is the amount of polishing they have done. The colour is now absolutely amazing spot on and completely immersive. Everything blends beautifully. This goes from the crates to the sandy ground the grass to the trees and the buildings as a whole. Everything looks like it has been upped and without requiring additional hardware power. In fact I would say that it HAS optimised better than before as again I would like to say that everything is completely fluid. I don't have a FPS counter and I don't plan on using it as it's something that would play on my mind and I would 'feel' as though I would notice it more but I have a 144Hz monitor and I would go as far as saying that it feels as though it's taking full advantage as it plays seamlessly. Other things which have been polished are the car sounds air strike sound which sounds much more realistic and the overview map has been spruced up and looks very nice with the additional shadowing under the mountains and the colour as a whole.All in all would highly recommend and glad I purchased this game from the beginning to help fund and see how well it has progressed and how far the developers have gone. People saying they have done nothing have absolutely no idea how hard they have worked over the last half a year and how closely they have worked with the community on their forums and they should be proud.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,248,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds has taken the Battle Royale game mode to a whole new level! The game has tons of weapons attachments and equipment for you to loot and bring to battle. This game is truly about survival wether you are going to hunt people down or sit in a bush it is too exciting. Being left in the top 10 is going to bring your stress level to the max.

2017-07-16,0,0,136,True,Recommended,What I like best about this game so far is that everyone starts on an even playing field. The mechanics are relatively easy to grasp and the good weapons / armor aren't behind a grinding or pay wall that makes the game a chore. In theory anyone can get the best guns and gear right off the bat if they're lucky.That and the learning curve isn't annoyingly high. I haven't really played PC shooters in years and was able to make it to #4 by around the 10th match.I'm having a blast so far.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Best played with friends as you can squad up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-16,0,0,50,False,Recommended,Product received for free. NOTE This Review has been UPDATED! Read the updated part below!After playing this and H1Z1 King of the Kill for a good amount of time I can gauge both equally and say without a doubt I perfer this over H1Z1 for sure.Pros Gunplay feels so much better and it feels like my weapons actually hurt the opponents. Group play is amazing with friends more so that H1Z1 for sure. You can choose where to drop when the game starts (to an extent) where as H1Z1 makes you drop where it wants you to and possibly next to several 10's of people. All methods of playing (Guns Scavenging Surviaval) feel fun. You can choose your playstyle and it can easily be done without worrying too much.Cons There are minor compatibility issues but it comes with most Early Access titles so it is expected. Due to the above this can cause lag spikes and signifigant frame drops randomly. It is very rare on high end PC's however. For $30 it is a steep price for a game like this. I feel like there isn't much here to warrant that price tag but if you can play with multiple friends even if it just one friend it makes it better. I definately reccomend purchasing this alongside 1 or more friends. Don't buy it unless you love playing solo!Bottom line it is a very fun game with friends and it's main attraction works VERY well when the game functions the way it should.Despite the very rare frame spikes and lag the game keeps you engaged as you explore the Russian island that has many others on it planning to murder you in cold blood.I give this game a solid 8/10!UPDATE 1 This update irks me to type. I had this game purchased for me by a friend. But that doesn't really change what I am about to say so bare with me.PUBG was fun when you first start out. At least it was for me. The current problems I am having with this game is being able to not only see people to see them before I am shot and killed from a mile away. This could be a mixture of odd settings me and my eyesight or both. I say this because anyone I play with is able to spot people and direct me to the exact location and I STILL can't see anyone but I digress. Now I have a beefy PC to play this on and it still has frame drops and lag spikes ALL THE TIME.Now this is STILL expected as it is Early Access but then they announce this title is coming to Xbox One as an exclusive? Im sorry what?The game is still pretty unstable not to mention hit detection is terrible and most fights end with someone beaming you without your game even showcasing them shooting but sure lets move it to a weaker platform.That shouts logic!Salt aside the game died off for me very fast. The update that included motorcycles and Crossbows was around the time I stopped wanting to really play. I have absolutely no desire to Solo Qeue and since the previous issues mentioned above still happen I don't even want to do multi member parties.Get it on sale if you REALLY want to dive into it.Update 2 This update is coming at you the day of the 1.0 Full Release of PUBG. After 1 game ONE GAME I was able to say that almost every complaint I had from the last update was fixed. I was able to confidently qeue by myself and was able to see and kill anyone I saw but the game ran at 60 fps 60% of the time. The other 40% was 30 fps but it was all VERY playable! Lag spikes? ZERO.It seems the PUBG team is very much listening to the feedback of how completely garbage this game ran and finally took the big steps to fix it. Since the last update of my review they fixed my issues and added in a few new things as well.Vaulting over stuff now exists making traversing a hell of a lot easier in fenced areas. They added a new gun I believe a repeater rifle. They also added a new map to play on which was a welcome addition to the one my group and I came to enjoy over time.So my final verdict. Should you buy PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds?My answer is a solid yes. If at any point you question the price then I reccomend it on sale if anything. The price right now is still a bit steep even more so if you are going to be playing solo and would rather queue with friends. But all in all the team behind the game is listening to us that is a huge plus.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(I really recommend playing without any Music in the background)But there are some negative points the biggest of them being Translations. The German Translation for example is sometimes so broken you have to guess what the game wants to tell you. But it s Early Access so I fully understand that something as complex as localization is a bit strange sometimes.After all 9.5/10 Would buy again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,138,True,Recommended,Bought it just a few days ago. Still on early acces but already very playable. Can t wait for the final full version! Highly addictive different playstyles possible. I like to sneak most part of the game staying at edge of circle slowly coming to center of closing circle. Graphics are more than decent sound as well. Further optimization is needed but for a 100 person multiplayer game already very fluent operating. Combat system is still something to get used to. I play CS GO most of the time on the PC and PUBG is something entirely different. Often lost close combat situations just because nog being snappy at shooting not adjusting aim correctly. Armor is very important headshots difficult when opponent is wearing level 3 helmet and facial protection. All in all very satisfying experiece after death I quickly join another server. Looking forward to further optimization of engine and combat system as well. But gameplay in general if fluent usefull artifacts scattered throughout the map even on far away desolated places. I give it a 7/10 at the moment if combat system is improved probably a 9/10. Overall look and feel is just great as well as the concept itself. Really hoping this one turns into a final finished version with map upgrades maybe even fog and snow effects. This game is decent at the moment but has so much more potential. Creating team can go a lot further.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-25,0,0,1065,False,Recommended,Lets be serious for a moment. We can all agree that those who are new to this genre will really enjoy it but if youve played from the very beginning you can see the flaws within this game and through the community.The game is fun the first map was great and very easy to learn. The second map is kinda cluster . Too many props and vaulting directions plus the map is huge to run across.The cosmetics is fun to play with but i think they poorly executed this. The playerunknown set was fine until it skyrocketed to unbelievable prices. Then there was the gamescon which i didnt have a problem with but made everyone mad and then they thought that making some exclusives such as the twitch box and pioneer crate to be sold on the market is a big f you to your face. People making money off crates with every individual item inside worth far less is just . The cheat system seems ok thry talk about banning thousands a day which is nice but i dont recall ever seeing someone getting banned during a game. Maybe they havent introduced that yet but lets see. Good job on getting those hackers off this game.Stream bans was funny to me everytime someone actually got banned fot cheating or breaking the rules they think that saying it was the streamers fault makes me crack up. If you were banned from an actual streamer its probably because you are sniping and your just upset that you cant play. Grow up.Overall i think pubg as a whole was pretty good and fun to explore their changes throughout the year. I cant wait to see what changes comr in the future.8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,267,True,Recommended,This game is still being developed but as of right now it boasts a highly replayable game mechanic and is extremely popular in the community.Graphics 8/10 Could be better could be worse. I think we will see a lot more in the future and this excites me. The graphics are already great and camouflaging yourself is a great tactic with the current graphics.Audio 7/10 Not a bad musical score for the menu but in a game like this music is NOT needed. You would be better off listening for footsteps.Controls 9/10 Extremely easy to learn and almost perfect for the game mechanics. The control scheme is very familiar and will make you feel right at home if you ever play FPS/TPS.Multiplayer 10/10 Off the chart! Great interactivity between players and lots of little helpers along the way. Most of the people you meet are jerks but it just adds to the feel of the game. It's like Rust meets Battlefield without the ability to build anything.Overall 8.5/10This game is still in it's early stages and there will be many new updates.

Gunplay was really tough to learn (similarly to R6seige if you can't shoot you can't practice shooting so it's a low practice learning curve) but once I got it I started to get consistent 2/3 kills per game and make it to the top 10 about 1 in 3 games. The learning curve itself wasn't unenjoyable either.The new UI and vaulting system are decent the new map doesn't feel unpolished like I thought and better suits my gameplay style and the new guns are very shooty.

2017-07-16,0,0,1323,True,Recommended,I've never had PTSD from a game.....laying awake until 4am thinking of how I could have won that last round I played at 11 00PM. There is a bit of lag when you drop into a zone with 10+ people but once you get used to that and the overall mechanics of the game it's not so bad.You may play 50 games and not get a win but have satisfaction by getting a couple kills a game. Then the sweet sweet adreneline rush of winning your first game....whether solo duo or squad and yelling because you got that last kill. Chicken has never tasted so good.I'd highly recommend the game as long as you don't have high blood pressure or heart problems because your heart rate will double when you get down to 10 players remaining.

Twice it a matter of just a few games was I killed by someone who had a clear advantage through hacking. Hopefully they will be able to weed out the hackers so the rest of us can enjoy the battlegrounds.

The only thing what's good about it is the main game mechanic the battle royal gameplay. I hope some decent developer will make a great battle royal game because this game is pure garbage. The developers are the worst I have ever encountered making a new map instead of buying decent servers. It feels like you are playing a game from the early 2000's with bugs you saw 5 10 years ago. Many people say that the graphics are great and this may be true but they are nowhere near the AAA games nowadays. Also the optimization is like... well like there is not any optimization at all. With these graphics the game should run like an angel instead it runs like crap. Since the developers made millions of dollars in early access they should have hired classy programmers to do their freakin jobs. Very disappointed with 1.0 you can not even choose which map you would like to play and they are forcing you to play the new map (which is crap) with much higher % of chance.

2017-12-21,0,0,52,False,Recommended,"Ive been reading all the recent reviews and many people are complaining about the people who play the game while not talking about the game itself. Let me start with this This game is almost BRAND NEW. The developers are very active and they listen to what we the players have to say. There are constant updates coming out with fixes and new features and I have yet to see an update ""break"" the game. The game itself is very fun. You parachute down to wherever on the map youd like and survive. Thats it. There is little to no luck involved its purely skill. If you like games where you can easily win then this is not for you. This game takes skill situational awareness and good aim control. The maps (now 2 different ones) are HUGE and creative and it takes many playthroughs to explore all the areas.Sure there are still many bugs but they are getting fixed almost as fast as they are popping up. To sum up Great game great dev support and great fun. I Highly recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Update After playing for a while I've decided I'm alright with the microtransactions. Trading clothes with friends and selling items on the market is fun. As long as there is a way for players to get the items without paying actual cash for them I can live with this. I'm still not very happy about the key system but I can live with it. This is a great game with a huge community. It's fun and it's worth your time.Original review I really enjoy this game and I love playing it with friends. I unfortunatly cannot in good conscience recommend this game currently. I was about to buy a copy for a friend but I feel I shouldn't now. I'm a bit torn by the news of microtransactions.

I'm horrible at the game (only 2 chicken dinners....but would have been more if I didn't accidently hit key to stand up from prone in the final 2 three different times! lol) but man is it fun. Most games I feel like I'm a loot collector for someone else since I lose most fights....but man. When you get into the final 20 the heart starts to beat a little quicker.

2017-12-21,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Altough the game is ing amazingly fun it's broken as I mean it's exiting beta/alpha to get to 1.0 but it doesn't wven have proper animations for things it's so buggy that it's sometimes completley unplayable that is from a competitive view if you wanna be good.Also it suffers greatly from unoptimization it KILLS VRAM and RAM With low graphics and windowed mode I get around 40fps which is not good as my pc I fairly new and can get at least 70fps+ on any game I played on it (on high too!) Also hackers really have no problem cheating as the anti cheat detection and reporting system is just the worst.TLDR it's greatly fun but broken as Also hackers.Honeslty I would give it a negative as the cons outdo the pros but I've had fun and never had really huge issues with the game myself .(expect horrible fps and bugs),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,446,False,Recommended,I have to rewrite this whole review becuase after some thinking i've come to the conclusion this game is a solid 6 1/2 out of 10. My reason for this is because I think at least 200 HOURS OF THIS GAME I WAS JUST LOOTING AND WALKING AROUND. Seriously only buy this game if you have friends to play with because it can be so boring solo. The reward system just doesn't feel at all well rewarding the reason for this is because if you get lets say 7 kills and a win you only get about 1000 POINTS I mean I suck and I proabably can't even buy one loot box with that sh*t. I mean shroud got 34 kills in one game and only got 1600 POINTS why can't he get 10000? Lets talk about the mid game oh wait this game doesn't have any because everybody just camps in houses then hits in the final few cirles but its already been 20 minutes so whats the point. Ok so why the positive review? Because the game has its moments you will never have in any other game and is just too addictive. Did I enjoy those many hours? I mean I could have learned a new skill and done something with my life but i'll just play a trash game instead thanks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My first game i opeded the door to a house and got wasted by a house sitter ( not camper its a survvival game ""camping"" is a great tactic) after that i only wanted to play more and learn from my mistakes. As an early access game they have a long way to go but if the game is this enjoyable at this point then only good things are left to come. I would recommend this game to anyone willing to try something new. My main key points and tips i think anyone should take away from this are.1) Dont expect anyone to teach you how to play ingame even if you are in a squad or duo. Be prepared to learn the hard way2) Be awae of your surroundings sound is key in any situation3) learn how to lot quick and efficiently. 4) When you walk into a house close the door behind you that way you can hear someone walk in if you are upstairs.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It might not be perfect yet but that's to be expected in early access. The feeling it gives you while crawling thru the grass with a sniper and picking someone off from a few hundred meters is great!

2017-03-29,0,0,149,True,Not Recommended,"Here's a completely down to earth and I dare say so honest review of the game. Firstly I'll adress the game itself then move on to the recent scandal concerning broken promises and the devs.So the game It's good. I'd very much disagree with people who argue it's brilliant. It really isn't that brilliant although it being accompanied by rather thrash games such as H1Z1 KOTK and other similar games it's not that hard to stand out and look decent. But what about so many sales? Must be good? In my judgement Twitch made this game. People like Summit1g jumped onto it got very hyped for it. Hence hyping his own community. And when you have a minimum of 20k people watching you that is quite relevant. And then the word about the game slowly spreads other big streamers hop on and essentially the hype does the job for it and everyone wants to get this new game that everyone's playing. And mind you I really AM NOT hating on the game. I enjoy it I do.But to say this game is something unique? It's not. To say it's great? It is in it's genre which is very much flawed. I mean come on. You can't say that the fact every other game in the genre is thrash doesn't by default make PUGB look better. Gunplay feels satisfying a perfect spot between arcade and realism. Vehicles and driving are.. Well they work got some bugs but nothing major at least I barely encountered them but it really does feel wierd. But hey driving isn't really the big point of the game so whatever. Movement is okay no remarks there. To sum it up I'd say the gameplay out of 1/10 would get a 7.5. Once it eventually hopefully gets polished solid 8.5 Not a ten because of personal preference. That is I think there are unecessary RNG elements which have no purpose other then to randomly the player as if there aren't a thousand other things you have to watch out for every game. For example the Rec Circle. I also think the blue circle should serve to simply bring players closer and closer as people die and the map needs to be shrinked so people actually find each other so I'd say the blue circle should be slower but again that's preference.With that I sum it up. Now onto the ""juicy"" part the recent broken promises.The moment I saw a Korean company was behind it a red flag popped right up. RACIST! No.. Not really. But if you've any experience with Korean games most infamous their MMORGPS free to play most usually their companies have a tendancy to milk the living hell out of their games as much as possible. But hey the majority doesn't define everyone just the majority. But here's where I actually lost it where I'd say I ""busted"" them. So for the past how many months PUGB has been the top selling game. Steam summer sale comes along they don't drop the price whatsoever it still remains the top selling game on steam. I think we'd all agree they probably made a LOT of bank. A LOT. What's your point? Here it is They put in the crates which they said they will not put until the game is finished which it is not. And.. Lord this is the most triggering thing I've seen in my life.. The reason for it is because.. They need money to fund their tournament? W H A T THE A C T U A L ? You're just some braindead hater. Trust me I HOPE THAT I AM. I hope that the game turns out to be as grand and awesome as they said they were. I hope they don't brake any other promises. I hope everything is nice and dandy. I really hope and I want that. But wake up folks. You're gamers second in this case. You are firstly consumers. You payed X for X which stated it will have X X X X and it will not do X X X X. But how many of these Early Acess titles turned out like this instead You pay X for X which instead has X other X gets removed for some reason third X is only 30% of what they said it would be and the fourth X is actually a Y. Buy the game play it. It's fun.But for the sake of us all this game BOYCOTT AND DO NOT BUY THE FREAKIN' CRATES. Because they most certainly don't need money to fund a tournament.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are someone that stuck up on things sure they did say that. However when it comes down to the question ""Is this game fun and worth the money?"" I put it down to the dollar per hour rule. If I can put one hour of gameplay for every dollar it costs I feel it is worth it. I can definitely see myself surpasing that rule here. Is it still buggy? Yeah it does weird things sometimes.

2017-06-22,0,0,182,True,Not Recommended,Still a little buggy although highly addictive!This game is still being developed so I was prepared for the occasional client crash and other related problems but its intuitive gameplay and addictive feeling barely make it worth your money.You're injected with a rush of adrenalin from the moment you step your feet on the ground and run to the nearest house hoping you find some weapon that may allow you to survive the first in game seconds. You're constantly suspicious of every house every tree every sound... It makes a 30 minutes game go by like you've only been playing for a couple of minutes and after you die you just want to play it once more.The gameplay could be improved. Specially the interface used to pick up items and use vehicles.In the end it all comes around playability and the server (the EU one at least) is way too laggy at the moment for you to enjoy a nice game. I died countless times without even realizing I was under fire until I got shot like 3 times because of imense and consistent lag. I frequently last until the last 15 or 10 players but every fire fight I'm in I'll most probably die because of the game lagging the moment I'm shooting the other player... Barely worth the 30$ as it is right now. Devs will be in a real trouble if the hype for this game runs out before they optimize it...EDIT The dedicated EU servers are currently overflown with asian players (apparently because of their own overflown servers) resulting in even more lag than before despite the devs efforts to optimize the game. This combined with the recent rising number of cheating players (last night died 3 times in a row to cheating players) makes the game almost unplayable for me... I'm guessing this is the beggining of the end for PUBG...EDIT 2 My frustration in being killed endlessly because of lag led me to this tweaks page (http //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/12299 great tutorial on how to improve performance in pubg/) that improved the game's performance drastically. I'm serious it's a whole new game in terms of playability!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Overall I enjoy this game. It is better when playing with a team of friends. I do wish that squad size was larger limiting to 4 means taking turns. I think the amount of clothing in the game is annoying replace all clothing items in game with a pistol. Rubber banding is an issue but I have not had the same issue with it that others have. Having to pay to change your character is also annoying. Render should be improved so that if I am hiding in the grass I cannot be seen be seen by a player using a scope across the map. I am looking forward to the Full release and I agree that judging the game is still premature. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves an area style shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-23,0,0,940,True,Recommended,8/10 IF you have the pc that can run this your good a 960+ and a i5 6series+ will run it fine i get 120fps with sli'd 1070's id run smoother with a single one until the game is optimized for it. until then i love it so far the combat is good not too clunky only think i think needs heavy attention is the UI for inviting friends and getting into games its clunky lags alot and its next to impossible to connect with other players you meet ingame via steam or any other source.Add a team chat box maybe? Make it so we can add people on steam from the game?either would solve this huge problem.great game otherwiseworth the 30$ in my opinion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-24,0,0,345,True,Not Recommended,I'd like to make it clear that this game is fun but to a certain degree. The game has given my friends and I a new refreshing experience since none of us have played a game such as this one before. Overall I find myself playing this game with my friends but regret most of my time spent on it. Here are some pros and cons Pros Great to play with friends New fresh ideas that make the game fun Adrenaline pumping at timesCons Vehicels such as anything with wheels can and will flip causing you to die. 90% of this game should be called running simulator because you literally hold W and Shift more so often to just end up dying by a camper or the zone. Games seem too long and slow paced. Getting glitched into something in the map. (Rocks Mylta power Apartments..) Redzone is seriously useless. Camping in the bluezone. (seen people sit in houses in the start and kill incoming people) Basically this game is fun but not really worth it right now. The moment they added crates with keys I lost some respect for the game. All of this is my opinion so yeah..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-10,0,0,956,False,Not Recommended,The premise of the game was great. I wasted about a 1000 hours on it so I can't downright not recommend it. Instead I have a mixed opinion of this game. It's really fun for the first 300 500 hours depending on your patience level but then it becomes a grind once you realize that you're playing a game based on headshot accuracy/loot and less on tactical wit. It becomes more like Counter Strike and less of what most people started playing it as in the first place a somewhat open world realistic shooter with some tactical elements. Now it's basically an open world arcade.Also the lag/netcode became unbearable. I've stopped playing because of it. Most fights became RNG shoot outs. There have been many engagements where both my opponent and myself should have killed each other at the same time yet since the game picks and chooses what shots register it instead becomes RNG in close quarters combat. Give it a few days of playing and you'll see plenty of times where you'll see blood register on yourself or the player and the game won't count it as a damage because God forbid if both top 2 players killed each other in the final circle and no one got a chicken dinner. Instead the game chooses what shots count and which ones don't to avoid a mutual. As for people who might be confused on why I'm not recommending this game when I obviously got my money's worth from a 1000 hours of entertainment (adding my hours on the test server) I only played this because I didn't bother exploring what other content was available. It's very similar to when someone keeps going back to an old ex not because they enjoy their time together but because they don't instead put in the effort to find someone new more exciting and ultimately better for them. Simply put this game became a simplistic no thought boredom time killer. TLDR PUBG is the Bud Light of games. Gets the job done nothing special nothing too bad. This game is great for a couple hundred hours until you learn the maps and learn the exploits. Then it becomes a mindless time killer which is great if you can't be bothered to find anything with stimulating above mediocre content.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,528,True,Recommended,The game is great but let me just list some of the issues that are pretty annoying 1 Game still needs optimisation but it is not an issue for me since i can run the game pretty good and this will be fixed in the future but i do get some weird drops like from 80 fps to 10 hopefully this will be fixed.2 Hitreg and desync is a big ing problem that hopefully wont take that long to take care of hitreg with shotguns and pretty much every gun espically shotguns though is very bad and desync is pretty annoying.3 Quite a bit of bugs ofc this will be fixed in the future.4 Veichles need some working on them since they flip for some dumb reasons.This is it for the big cons suggestions for this game 1 We should be able to have a kill cam feature so if someone gets killed in a very suspicous way that person can make sure he got killed by a hacker.2 Add new modes even though we have zombie mode but it's pretty boring i'm thinking about adding like some crazy shit like team deathmatch with 10v10 and we can choose what guns we want that would be pretty nice to get better aim and understand some weapon sprays.3 Add a feature that makes us see how skins look before buying them like if i want to buy a 10$ item i want to be able to see how it looks before i buy it that would be really nice to.4 Shooting range this is for weapons and testing out guns where you have bots that we can shoot and test out how many shots it takes to kill someone that has a lvl 3 vest with an ak stuff like it would be really helpful.This is it for my suggestions i think this game has a great future if they don't it up with a update the game is already succesful and it's going to be even more if they don't it up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,313,True,Recommended,It was fun for awhile until you get circles that are on the other side of the map and half in the water and you have 5 or so mins to loot before rushing over as fast as you can to get shot by the people lucky enough to have dropped their. I really enjoyed the game early but after hours of play the little things add up. One major problem is the driving and the randoming flipping while driving anywhere. Jumping to area that have large groups of people dropping in can be fun if you can find and gun which sometimes loot seems really jacked up since some house may not even have a gun. If you do manage to overcome the getting a gun and engage on people if you didnt get the circle or its not close by better just make a break for it since you dont have much time to fight and loot before having to run for it. So IF you get a gun and IF you have the circle you can have some fun as long as the servers and having issues which has been a serious problem since I started playing the game. The core gun play is fun when you have time to fight but most of your time will be spent running across open fields because you didnt get a car spawn or rushing around looking for so place to setup in the new circle before dashing to the next area. I'm not even going to talk about microtrasactions because I could care less one way or the other since it doesnt effect core gameplay and I dont ever plan to spend money on cosmetics.Edit A lot of the problem have been fixed since I wrote the review. The game is fun again and also runs much better. Seems the devs care more than most early access and keep adding and improving the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The mechanics and feel of the game are a little goofy like movements and the guns themselves. Theres way too may bugs in the game. Like sometimes if you step out of your car after its flipped youll die from falling even though youre only 3 feet off the ground. Cars will randomly explode cars will fly in the air if you hit something too fast or collide with another vehicle. I know it is an early access game but theyre rushing EVERYTHING when they dont have the basics down. Theyre already starting esports tournaments although I bet you half of the competitors will die from bugs alone. This game can be fun with friends or if you win. Thats really it... But you have to get through the hackers and bugs first.I reccommend waiting for them to improve the game or wait until its out of early access and it becomes a full release.Dont buy it YET.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-16,0,0,200,True,Not Recommended,The only good thing about this game is the first person and the gun play. This game is poorly optimized I constantly crash or the textures in the game won't load in (this usually gets me killed at the beginning of a match). The devs need to focus on fixing glitches and optimizing the game instead of adding crates. Over 5 million people have bought this game thats about 150 million dollars in profits. they did not need to add them in at all because now it looks like a cash grab. This game on the highest settings for graphics looks like a CoD game and CoD does not have the best graphics. Anytime there is a patch more things get broken than fixed and its really annoying with the game gets even more broken especial when they have test servers for the upcoming patch. The devs keep rushing out patches without testing them for an extend time. I feel like this game has a speech impediment for how much it stutters. If I was able to I would refund this game its not worth it right now. Lets face it we all know this game is going to be in early access for the next 4 years.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1390,True,Recommended,I love PUBG but not because I love these types of games. I love PUBG because it's so difficult to win and so frustrating when you lose that I HAVE to keep playing another game. It's addictive. The cheaters are horrible. It's the biggest problem with the game. There's no doubt about that. And there are a lot of cheaters. It's a shame too because all the other minor glitches and negative things would easily be overseen if it weren't for the cheaters. The cheaters make it a lot worse. Example I was over a hill there was nobody in sight I was on the other side of a tree on the lower part of the hill. There was nobody around me. NOBODY. The zones would have made it impossible for anybody to survive in a direction that somebody could've seen me. I hear somebody coming over the hill behind me. Hmmm? I peek from behind my tree wondering how where they were coming from. Now even if they had SEEN me go down over that hill there's NO WAY they could've known which tree I was behind but not this person. I peek out to see where they're coming from and this person comes straight over the crest of the hill straight at me with no hesitation and fires three shots all hitting instantaneously and killing me. That player knew EXACTLY where I was out of all the trees I could've been behind and there was no vantage point they could've had that would tell them where I was. I can deal with the three shot kill some people are actually that good but making a bee line straight to me was not possible. I'm afraid the cheating could really ruin this game in the future. How can you really know who is that good or not? You can't. There are other issues like how the ammunition is distributed around the map when it spawns and things like that but I think that all those things can (and will) be fixed in time. But the cheating? Hmmm. Come on PUBG. Would I recommend this game to a friend? Well I'd tell them my experiences and explain about the cheating and then let them decide but I wouldn't recommend it or not recomment it. It's a real shame too. Hopefully as the updates and official release come things will get better. I have to say I'd recommend it here I guess but with that big caveat (cheaters) as I've said above.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-16,0,0,465,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Amazing game but right now it's a hacker's game. Basically the game is extremely good a couple days following patching. But if this game doesn't get some much needed protection I can't see it leaving early access sadly. Just another early access gem that will follow a similar fate. Still recommend it on the off chance it gets taken care of. The game is great but just a tad unplayable.

2017-08-16,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,Game is very much so unfinished. It has very bad spawn rates of items as well (4 helmets in one room Three large houses with nothing but pistols in them etc..). View distance bugs a aweful. Being able to see someone running up a hill hundreds of yards away becuase foliage doesnt load at that distance is just bad. I have also experienced parachuters poping up seconds before landing even though I was scouting for them the entire time I was heading to a destination using the ALT key. Hit boxes seem to be off and melee combat is just getting lucky becuase everything moves around so much and the punching animation takes to long. This game can be fun and is entertaining to watch streams play but after waiting to load into 6 games and dying within the first 20 sec to 2 min becuase above mentioned problems makes this game frustrating so those moments are few and far between. Picking up items is bulky and slow. In a game where I can place the same whether I have no gear and crawl through the weeds or spend time looting to die in combat there is no real point to looting and armor seems to be useless as 90% of the time if someone gets the drop on you you are dead instantly with no chance to run or turn around and fight.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,850,True,Recommended,PUBG is the most competitive game I've ever played even more so than playing mario kart with friends... Despite recent reviews being mixed or negative I see no reason to write a negative review about this game. For the moment it does seem to be poorly optimized but the game is in early access and the developers have promised to have this fixed (to some extend) in a few weeks. But hey I love the crap out of the Fallout series but those games are also poorly optimized! In that case we are talking about games that take 5 6 years perhaps more in development before release and it's still poorly optimized. I've never encountered a hacker but that is perhaps because I'm low ranking and playing in the EU (I mostly hear complains about hackers in NA and Asia). Nevertheless I believe those that complain about said hackers and I wish there would be more done about it because I don't want this game to lose its playerbase. I can't say that I enjoy playing this game solo so for the most part I play it in duo (as 2 players in a team) or squads (3 4 players in team). It is a lot of fun to play with friends but only being able to enjoy it in duo or squads has its down sides. For example I will have to wait for my friends to finish school/work etc. to play the game. Therefore even though I've hade the game for about 2 3 months I've only played it for about 76 hours. There isn't much that the developers can do about that its just the nature of the game. There is of course the matter of lag spikes which is infuriating but those seem to be the worst in the beginning (roughly first 4 5 minutes of the game). I've heard the reason being that in the beginning there are about 100 players online but in those 4 5 minutes about 20 players (often more) die and the number of players drop which subsequently results in a more more managable lag. Also as part of the optimization update the developers have promised a brighter future in terms of a more stable connection. Yes it is extremely competitive! Dying in the first 5 10 minutes can suck a lot or going 5 rounds without a single kill may be discouraging... You will however become better with each round! In 99% of the cases you die in PUBG it's because the opposing player/team had an advantage over you (higher ground better cover etc.) or is simply better than you. A large part of this game is to develop a strategy to plan and (when playing in teams) to co operate and communicate.I thoroughly enjoy this game it is the best online FPS I've played and hopefully the game will get even better in the near future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-24,0,0,886,True,Recommended,I have 400+ hours on the game now so I think I can write a decent review. This game will you off and make you laugh harder than ever before...I'd say atleast 60% of the game is just looting which I believe they need to increase as it can be very hard to come by. The rest is a mix between a walking sim and a shooter. Some people have been banned for no reason and that is not ok. I must also strongly recommend not playing squad games with random players. I have been teamkilled atleast a dozen times late game. This game will make you lose faith in humanity. 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-24,0,0,54,True,Recommended,"To start off I really enjoy this game but there are many issues that need fixed. I understand that it's still in early access but there's a lot of things like lag problems. Sometimes I get rubber banded back which isn't too much of an issue unless you're in a gun fight with another team. One out of a few games me and my friends go through ""network lag"" all at the same time. When that happens if you're moving it makes you constantly move without stopping. If you're at the edge of the safe zone that could easily cause you to die. And as for punching say at the start of a round I could be about 10 meters away and they're able to punch me easily while staying far away from me. Some of the driving mechanics need to be fixed as well. If you hit even the smallest bump it could send your vehicle into a spiral make you take damage from hitting the small bump or flip your motorcycle over and cause you to fly off taking damage or even killing you. Lastly at the start of some rounds none of the buildings loud in and if I try to go inside one I'll either get stuck in a wall that rendered while I was in there or fall through a floor if I try to land on top of a buiding. I still love the game but if these issues would get fixed it would be so much more fun.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im not sure why alot of these reviews say they can barely hold 30 40 fps on a pc when i can play it in 2k with a consistent 60 fps cant do 4k but im only running a single 1080 and like they said it isnt quite optimized yet.Havent noticed much in the way of bullet inconsistencies either if anything i think alot of the bullets follow the correct arcs specially at distance. My big complaint i run into most frequently is the sound. Sometimes i hear footsteps and its from 2 3 buildings away inside.Servers have been slightly laggy lately as well so if you dont have a good connection you will lag. Must introduce region locks asap. And of course its always the funnest when with friends alone i can usually only play 2 3 matches before I need to switch to a story based game.Overall id say 8/10. Needs alot of work but hopefully with their backing well see alot more pushes in content 3rd map already announced and heres hoping 1.0 fixes some optimization.

2017-12-20,0,0,30,True,Recommended,In PUBG I liked many things. I liked how there was options to change your POV and your gun to be an automatic gun a burst gun or just a single shot gun. It is a great game to play with you're friends and team up. All you have to be in this game is lucky and good. Though this game is good it could still use MINOR adjustments. like you should be able to have an option to play a solo game with you're friends that are in you're party. There should be more guns and more things you could unlock in a package than just clothing. PUBG should even make up a mode where you could also just get guns out of crates and use them in a mode where you could play with guns that you already got from crates and are able to make a class. I also think this game should just be a few dollars off for now or just permantly.

2017-08-26,0,0,330,True,Recommended,This game got big quick in my opinion. I'm hooked on it! I've never played the other games that are similar to this genre like H1Z1 but I think PUBG has done very well! This game has great graphics and the weapon selection is great! I really like the attachements for the guns. There are still some glitches in the games issues with lobby being laggy and objects or people phasing through doors or walls. Gameplay also has quite a bit of lag. For the most part BlueHole is great about keeping up with the issues and gettings bugs worked out. All in all it's a great and addictive game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-26,0,0,828,True,Recommended,Very fun and slow paced game. Alot of sneaking around to survive and running long distances across the massive map. The customization for the character and weapons keep me entertained. I love the Duos and Squad modes when playing with friends or other players that communicate. I especially love the game for the great moments of popping out around a corner and getting multiple kills. Gun fights are very satisfying because the pops and bangs sound good. Some core issues I've seen is that it can lag very bad so I have to restart the game and that takes care of it. Also some times the microphone function is disabled for the whole lobby which is annoying when you're playing with teammates. Nothing that ruins the game for me though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I didn't have a single moment of fun in the hour plus I played the game but near constant boredom interspersed with massive amounts of anger and frustration (what is the point of a level 3 helmet and body amor if I get killed in a single shot anyway?)I gave the game a good solid 80 minutes of my time and I feel like the entirety of it was wasted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not only are the Dev's giving all their attention to streamers they put microtransactions into the game which was said to be implemented after the release.

2017-08-31,0,0,125,True,Recommended,This game... there's a lot of great things about it but there are also some huge glaring issues. Let's start with the good it's great fun to play with friends and have voice chat going. It can be a fast action packed game or you can take it slow and build up your player slowly. There's so much replay value I could see myself playing this for far more than the 6 hours I have put in. The gameplay feels great as well tactical sometimes a bit slow but the moments of firefights make up for that. Those are just some of the great things about Battlegrounds. There are a few issues though... The primary one being the performance. It's horrible but still playable. I have an I5 6500 1060 3gb model and 8 gigs of RAM. Not the best but quite decent and I have to run this at very low to low settings to get a consistant 60 70 frames. And still I have a few frame drops now and then. Some other issues are the bugs I've been stuck in a loading screen and had to force quit the game. There's quite a few glitches. But seeing as this game is still in Early Access I can forgive some of it's cons. Overall I would really recommend picking up this game especially if you have a few friends to play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-07,0,0,433,True,Not Recommended,"copied and pasted this review from CST Meticulous7because it says all the things i experienced and i couldnt of worded it any better thanks CST Meticulous7This game is incredibly enjoyable exciting and gets my adrenaline rushing like nothing I've ever played....BUT until the devs stop banning people because streamers say they were ""harassed"" I'm giving it a thumbs down.Devs honking a horn is NOT harassment. Explain to me how that effects someones stream or is harassment? Kill the person if they're doing that and if they're in your squad don't play with that person again (DUH). Also when you're constantly being thrown into random servers the odds of actually ""stream sniping"" someone is virtually impossible. This isn't like other games where you can find the server name and follow the streamer into it. Who the hell made this decision?Also the broken promise regarding microtransactions. That is pretty goddamn shady. That's bad enough but when there are so many glaring areas that need work ignoring all of that to add a feature you said you wouldn't add until release is a straight kick in the nuts to your supporters. Devs don't forget We made you successful and we can undo that by choosing not to buy anymore games from someone who isn't trustworthy and thinks prioritizing streaming to the point of BANNING legitimate players who may not even be aware the other person is streaming is INSANITY. Whoever made this decision needs to be FIRED.You guys have created a PR nightmare for yourself and until you make it right it's only going to get worse.

Except now you decided to blow a hole in the bottom of the yacht allowing it to take on water (which will inevitably sink it) but you choose to pretend the hole isn't there and that you didn't make it.

CONS Buggy Servers are too busy Swallows your PC L A G (due to lack of servers) Hackers and misconceptions can occur although the developers are taking care of the hacking issue.Sure it's got bugs and cons but im recommending this because it's an overall good game and honestly very entertaining with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also you can have a heart attack IRL.Only for you and your teammates your accuracy is the same as a Silver 1 player shooting the m249 in CS GO (Or Haitham (Inside joke)). The enemies have the accuracy of Robin Hood if he had a bionic arm 90x zoom and a weapon with projectiles that break the universe when fired.It will make you suicidal (Credit to one lovely person who knows it's him ) )You will wish that the game never existed.You will want to cry yourself to sleep because you didn't get 1st place.Enemy bullets will bend time and space and hit you as if your hitbox is 3 seconds behind you (Spoilet alert it is a god damn snake if you're getting shot)Enemies apparently have infinite meds and no hitbox.They have a thing called RNG on their side.They have a better position than you even if you think you have the best one.They can only be killed by Shroud.Yeah i guess it's the impossible game converted to Battle royale. I Guess i like hate it.Hi mom hi dad. Hope you liked my review. Can i buy 984 Gamescom crates now? I believe they will go up in price. Trust me please i'll buy you a new house later. Scratch that please kill me.Forgot to mention that the rest of the players will somehow still gang up against you accidentally and then you will get Uranus destroyed from all 83 Directions.You will always get trapped between 2 teams.

Releasing this game as a finished product while the menu has to load for several minutes on a mediocre gaming pc by western standards (poor russians) and having to wait while the game loads the map while your allready in the plane is not acceptable.I m really disappointed and I hope this will be fixed in the future but at this standpoint this game is nothing more than one of the typical ""early acces garbage"" which gamers are getting served now for years just with a different concept which works well.

2017-12-26,0,0,103,False,Recommended,"Note My system specs are listed on my profile if people are interested since performance is obviously relative to hardware.TL DR Review here. Some additional thoughts below.Gunplay 8/10 Fairly unique and challenging but feels very rewarding to learn.Performance BEFORE 1.0 patch 4/10I had pretty bad drops in big cities sometimes as low as 30fps.Performance AFTER 1.0 patch 8/10 I typically run around 140FPS with some drops to 70 80 or so a massive improvement.Movement System 7.5/10 Vaulting added a much needed element to movement and works great.Developer 7.5/10 Bluehole and PlayerUnknown seem to be fairly in touch with the community more so than many dev teams.Overall Score 7/10I think this game could stand to be improved and clearly will be and has been already. Considering how new this game is and how much it has progressed already I look forward very much to seeing where the dev team takes this game. It is absolutely worth your money if you are interested in the genre and it is a TON of fun with friends. Additional thoughts and some comments on recent negative reviews.Honestly I see a ton of negative reviews for this game mentioning performance ever since 1.0 I have been running at or near FPS cap with zero performance issues on either map or settings. I have to call them out for being wrong. My advice buy this game if you have serious performance issues then refund it if not congratulations you now own one of the best games of the year. This is assuming you enjoy the style of gameplay it offers which not everyone does.To speak to the ""chinese hacker/lagger infestation"" people are talking about this is absolutely nowhere near as big of an issue as people are making it out to be. On EU there have been zero hackers in my (limited granted) playtime. I have also never even seen a chinese player let alone died to one. neither have my friends and they are closer to the 600 hour mark of playtime than I am with my relatively short 100 (at the time of writing) hours.I understand this might be different on the NA or OCE regions but I am simply giving my experience. The developer has already mentioned that they are looking into a solution for it so leaving a negative review just because you died once to someone playing on the wrong region is quite childish and only serves to harm your cause.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,still kinda buggy but probably one of the better early access survival games out there. Graphics are poorly optimized be sure to add malloc system USEALLAVAILABLECORES to your launch options to get a 30 FPS boost. The gameplay is really chaotic and fast paced. 9/108/20/17 Update They're just not fixing bugs and have ridiculous rules like stream sniping that a real esport (csgo) would never ban you over. Not only is it extremely easy to avoid getting stream sniped but the reports of it are greatly over exaggerated. Several streamers have been banned for UNAVOIDABLE GLITCHES where a house won't load or a rock will be see through. Maybe I'd understand if this was a legitimate competitive game but there is no ranking system it's early access and these issues are totally on PLAYERUNKNOWN's part but Bluehole refuses to fix them. The game is very enjoyable to play if not badly optimized but PLEASE FIRE YOUR COMMUNITY MANAGER AND GET THE RULES IN CHECK YA DAFT S,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-20,0,0,253,True,Recommended,Pros Balanced weapons Every gun feels strong for what its worth even the pistols Gameplay Gameplay feels rewarding whether its getting kills finding loot or just surviving it feels pretty cool Squad/Duos Because of the nature of the game squad and duo queues are a lot more fun than in gmaes such as H1Z1 (In my personal opinion). Theres a lot more teamwork involved in encounters and if you get caught out on your own you're screwed Variety There are loads of different weapons and mods at your disposal. Whether you choose to be a stealthy sniper or rambo is up to you.Cons Servers Spawing in is horrific. I've noticed it more in solos but during landing (another con) and the first few minutes people will teleport around and you will occasionally rubber band. After a few minutes its alright. Landing Jumping out of the plane fine. Flying down fine. Actually landing with the parachute Painful infuriating and slow. If you're not over flat ground be prepared to decend at around 1 nanometre a second and if you land on a wall or in between a narrow space be prepared to hang there for around a minute spamming F to cut your parachute but it wont let you. Perfomance Not really a con more of a warning but I run the game at around 40fps with a 960 with everything on low. You'll need a beefy card to run the game well.PS Buy the game its great. Once the server issues are fixed I wont see much wrong with the game. For an early access game this is one that I would say is worth buying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-20,0,0,368,True,Recommended,There are a lot of negative reviews recently on this game and I can understand why to some extent. The seemingly random bans some people are receiving are problematic but with near 100 hours in the game I have had zero issues. The feeling of getting your first chicken dinner is incomparable to almost any other game. The crates can currently still be opened for free or traded for steam cash to get their keys. Fpp is an amazing addition and server performance seems to be way up. If you have a friend or two who plays it's absolutely worth the purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-07,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,First off I bought this game for me and a friend because I heard it was much better to play with friends. So I've spent $60 to get me and my friend a chance to play this. I had heard that the optomization was bad but this is just absurd! I understand that having a gtx 1050 means that I wont be playing any game at its best but at the very least I expect to be able to run at 60fps on low (1080p) but I consistantly get 30fps in completely barren fields and drop even lower at times! This game is in desperate need of optomization. Heck I can run Ark better than this! And just to be clear I do enjoy the game. The gunplay is great and the tenseness of battle royal games is ever present. The only thing I'd fix would be the inability to hop anything waist high without crouch jumping. Adding an ability to vault or something of that nature.In conclusion I would like to say that this game is fun bu not worth the money at the moment. The optomization is almost as bad as Ark when it first released and I've also had a few issues with being stuck on the loading screen whilst being able to hear all the audio. And thus a DO NOT BUY (yet). EDIT The game has recently been crashing everytime I load into a match and the optomization has improved a little bit.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,429,False,Not Recommended,From the patchnotes of a game/developer that does it right (unlike Bluehole) and does it in every patch Client stability has been improved.Update Version 1.0 has been released. One could think that when a game is officially released is runs stable. One could think that the release candidate 1.0 has no major bugs.This is false. PUBG ver. 1.0 has major bugs. Bugs that affect gameplay and makes early game sometimes impossible to play. The official forum is filled with bug reports and compared to the last beta version the release version is worse and more bugged.Sadly i could not refund the game since i exceeded 2 hours of gameplay when i got aware of how many bugs there are or how badly the game is optimized.But hope dies last they say maybe Bluehole will eventually hire capable developers and this game seriously becomes a stable game worth to play.Best bug so far run into a wall and die from _falling_ https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 7CI0a9sCO_M,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,This game should be taken in two parts for a good review. Playing solo I would give this game a 4/10 mainly because it is almost unplayeable without a team. It can be enjoyable but you more often then not end up walking around for 5 minutes grabbing gear only to be killed by a guy sitting on a random door waiting for some passerby. If you don't have a group that will play this with you I would pass this by and find something else. If you have that team I give this game a 7/10. I can't give it any higher rating because as it sits right now there are just too many technical problems that need stabilizing before it is a great game. Rubberbanding lag and random crashes plague this but happen at moments that can drive you insane. The team play is awsome and can show some awesome fire fights but they only happen once in a blue moon.I really wish i could love this game but it just drives me insane with both its technical issues and the toxic people who have come to plague it also. If you are into battle royale games sure sure give it a shot if you think this is a stable game with good solo play then at least I would say search elsewhere.UPDATE This game needs a lot of fixing before it is playable again. Rubberbanding is gamebreaking weapons are inconsistent hit or miss hit detection which is on average miss. This is a prime example of another game ruined when it attempts to go out of early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can't even get through a full game without having ""network lag detected"" appear. The problem isn't my internet because I use discord at the same time without any issues.Wait til next year then consider the game.Edit Fix found for ""network lag detected"". Install the game on another drive and move it to another one via properties local files. This fix may or may not work for you. Bugs still persist such as random game crashes.Edit2 Will update review as soon as the new update rolls out with the new map. The test server is showing promising improvements. The game developers are clearly trying to solve the issues present in the current patch.Edit3 After a long time coming the game is out of beta. The development team has done an impressive job updating the game. Optimizations make the game playable on almost any mid range system and the gameplay is impecable.

The new map is amazing game optimization has improved about 20 to 30% a lot less desync a lot less lag in the beginning. Overall the PC 1.0 launch feels almost perfect I'd give it an 85/100. Excellent job Bluehole. Why can I put an 8x on a S12K but not a M16? October 18 2017 I'm not one to complain about hackers but my squad encounters hackers 1 out of every 5 games. Blatant hacking some dude running so fast he's a blur or some guy using an aim bot he kills our whole squad in 4 seconds. Banning these guys isn't working DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT so they can't come back.March 31 2017 A great game for all types of gamers. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or casual gamer. If you prefer to solo or run with buddies. If you prefer going balls to the wall or slow and strategic. Or maybe you're the guy that likes to create traps and ambush people.The dynamics of the Map terrain vehicles and weapons gives you a lot of options. Similar games don't offer this sort of diversity they're either running simulators or driving simulators.The performance for this game is average. With a GTX 1070 it runs at 60+ fps on ultra settings but has big dips occasionally. I keep my settings in the medium to high range to avoid those big dips.It's 100% worth the price tag.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-06,0,0,52,True,Recommended,The trailer introdruces the game way better than the actuall gameplay is.Beside some bugs and glitches a really anoying part of the game is that the movement as well as the aim (in scope) appears to be slightly sticky and hard to controll.Allthough it is fun to roam around with your friends armoring up and start hunting it becomes frustrating really fast as sonn as you want to shoot someone who runs away right next to you and you have to reproach several miles to actually land a shot...I would rate it 4.5 / 10. Because its a funny RPG which can become bored after a couple of matches due to bugs and the same old gamestyle Droping gathering hiding hunting getting killed from behind.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,326,False,Recommended,"I recommend this game as an early access game because even though it has ""officially"" come out it is still pretty much in the same state as it was in early access. Still filled with bugs frustrating at times but when it works it is fun and challenging (emphasis on when it works).In my eyes this game has not yet come out of beta and is still far from a finished product but I believe it has potential to become a great game.I strongly recommend trying this game with steam share with someone who allready has it before buying it as the game may be less apreciated by some than others.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
