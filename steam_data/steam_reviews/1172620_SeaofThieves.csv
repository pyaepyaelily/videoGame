9,77049762,english,"Sea of Thieves I think is best described as a platform for guided player interaction, I don't think the game would be nearly as fun as it is if you could play it singleplayer or in an empty server with your own crew, this however of-course comes with the downside of player interaction dictating how enjoyable the bulk of your experience is.
The game itself is easy to explain, you're a fantasy pirate in a fantasy world exploring for fantasy treasure, the game plays like the glorified pirates of children stories and in media where it's a grand adventure of treasure and loot, with betrayal and all the glory of shooting yourself out of a cannon onto a enemy ship to anchor their ship and set it ablaze all while you're fighting the enemy crew 4v1, there is a lot you can do in this giant sandbox of a game and plenty of cool and flashy tricks you can pull off.
Funnily enough, in Sea of Thieves the gold and treasure doesn't really matter, no matter if you have 10 hours or 100, you will start in the same state as everyone else as far as other people are concerned, the only thing you can upgrade is your cosmetics and factions, which factions only offer you cosmetics and more rewarding missions to go on. which while can be understandably disappointing to some, I think it lends well to the player interaction. There is no upgrading your tools or boat outside of weapons which means everyone is on a even playing field, which makes your decision to run or fight a lot more interesting as it hinges on if you think you're better than your opponent.
Player interaction in this game can be intimidating, tense or just humorous depending on who you run into, since you're on a even playing field you don't know if that ship coming towards you is just passing by or looking to sink you and steal your loot, everyone is weary of other people and I really enjoy the ways people have come to make their intention clear, when we run reapers, which exist to pirate other players, one of us usually swims over to their boat to see if they're worth sinking and looting before using our resources, and the responses to ""hey you got any loot we can take?"" as one of our crew climbs aboard their ship and takes a look at their stash are really fun, though of course it can be really frustrating dealing with people who want to waste your time
While there's a lot of ways you can cause a ship to come to a stand-still, this game tends to give you a lot of ways out to either avoid encounters or just waste your time, for instance, if you want to run you can just sail against the wind which makes it very difficult for someone to catch up, we've had players who were spiteful enough to sail into out of bounds instead of actually fighting back. And on the other side, it's not uncommon to get your ship sunk for sport while the assailants gain nothing from it which coming from my friend who has been fishing for 200 hours of this game, tends to be a bit frustrating especially when you have no loot to give. Not to mention there's always the option that, if a player is confident enough, they can spawn trap you on your boat making your only option to scuttle your ship and start again.
Fortunately you don't lose anything when you die but potential gold and achievements/commendations which doesn't set you back, there is very little risk to dying and sinking which is fine personally so these problems are only frustrations rather than big game issues.

85,76988026,english,"So funny enough this is my first review and first time playing on PC. The community is mixed, but I mostly find a friendly community.


Gameplay: At first it took me an hour or 2 just to get the mechanics, but with the help of some friends and some randoms I got the hang of it quite well. Its easy enough for a newbie i'd say. Probably the hardest mechanic to learn was the ships. You need to micro manage: Sails, an anchor, Wind speed, cannons, directional sense, ammo, food, and if you can do all that youll have to deal with megladons or krakens on a kinda regular basis.

rating: 8/10 This game IS GOOD. I instantly got hooked on this game, The graphics are amazing, the water is nearly real *if your boosting your graphics up to mythic* Theres so many things to do in this game that at times you actually might feel exhausting. I will admit this game is much more fun having a good friend that is easily as cancerous as yourself.. My only complaint at this time is there limited on ships, not many sea monsters as of yet, and a low weapon selection.

Customization: Holy sh1t can you customize in this game. from your ship *including hull,sails,anchor, wheel etc* to your weapons to how you dress and even your equipment etc. Practically no pirate on this game should look the same with thee amount of cosmetics

NOTE: When you create your pirate make sure its what you like, because once you pick it theres no going back. if you choose to delete your pirate then its gone forever including everything you bought for him/her and the storyline. I don't really like that  you have a killswitch on your game that can pretty much destroy all progress you've made. kinda hope they fix that.

Highly recommend this game if you have 4 friends and have been looking for a fun exciting adventure. Thanks for reading this hopefully ill feel like making more reviews.

To be honest it has one of the most asshole community i have seen in sot,i even tried to help a guy who's ship had sunk and he killed me and robbed my loot.even when i try to talk to other players most of them respond with fck off and start attacking me.
Also make sure your system is higher than minimum requirements, otherwise you're going to spend so much time in loading screens especially if some 4 man ship has killed you and now is camping your ship.

95,76978999,english,"Be very aware that this is a completely open PVP realm; other players can attack you at will.  There is also no overarching story that keeps you coming back and on track with things.  You have to stumble across these as you navigate across the open map.  If other players find and kill you, then you risk losing all your progress on many of these.  Some of these quests do have checkpoints, but the checkpoints don't mean anything if your key items get stolen or destroyed, then you have to start all over again.  Due to this, most players jump right into PVP and treat this place like it's Fortnite.  The fighting mechanics are a little tough to get used to, as there are simple combat basics that are taught in the tutorial, however there are some players out there who have expertly honed how to do long distance strikes using a power strike/block/jump combo, that the game itself doesn't teach you about.  All this game really consists of is island hopping and other players ramming into you and then simply chucking firebomb cannonballs at the helm of your ship and running away.  If you are on a island grabbing a treasure and you have no one else in your crew, you're done.  The 30-45 mins it took to get to that island and find those treasures after obtaining your mission leads and setting up your ship can turn into a complete waste of time, particularly if you were not interested in the PVP part, and just wanted to gather some gold and purchase a new vanity piece.  Speaking of which, its all vanity items.  There are no level/damage progressions here.  
I honestly do hate bashing at it like this, the game itself is incredibly beautiful and I really do like the engine it runs on, plus the sailing and social interaction can be quite enjoyable at times, but so can a lot of other games that don't make me want to pull my hair out the other 60% of the time I'm actually trying to earn gold and interact with the main content.  I tried the matchmaking feature a couple times, but you either get teamed up with a couple idiots who don't know how to use a microphone, or some obnoxious jerk who just wants to go and harass other ships.  Many of my gaming friends who are interested in these types of games are turned off by the inability operate this game in Third Person.  Which honestly makes no sense considering that most of the items you buy with gold are vanity items for your player.  The only time you get to see any of those items is when you do an emote or when you are looking down at yourself as your soul leaves your body after you get merc'd.
A few things that could help change my mind here:
-Turn off the ability to throw cannonballs; or at the very least, prevent the fireballs from exploding when thrown and add molotov cocktails that are much harder to find.  ...Seriously, it's all people ever really do.
-Add new content to tutorial; advanced fighting mechanics
-Recruitable Bots - to be part of your crew

Be warned that this is not a game where you can just jump in for 30 mins, an average game would be at least 1 hour 30 mins.

Expect from time to time you will lose all your hard earned work to some salty pirates that will scream abuse at you over comms, however you can also decide to steal other peoples hard work too :) 

The game is much better with a friend. Solo is a little hard but it can be done. 

There is not much to offer in terms of progression as all items are cosmetic, although the higher level you are the better quests/voyages you can buy. 

I would say the main goal of the game is to reach the Pirate Legend Status by getting level 50 in 3 alliances, then you can start the really special voyages.

This game is truly what you make of it. You just set sail and decide how you want to play it 

I have had some of the most memorable moments in this game that cannot be compared to any other game.

18,76944026,english,"Even after all of the time since release, the game feels as empty as the sea around which it revolves. All you do is bounty after bounty like everyone's errand boy. That is all there is to do: bounties for gold to buy cosmetics. There is no actual loot in this game. Nothing makes your ship sturdier or faster, nothing makes your swords hit harder or your guns hold more shots, nothing makes you run or swim faster. Nothing gives you actual in game advantages; it's all just cosmetic. The chase is non-existent and the gameplay loop gets stale asf real quick. 

The only fun to be had is getting your friends together to grief other players. Even that is easier said than done, since finding other people in your instance is a chore. There is no tracker on the HUD, so you have to scan the map to find anybody, and they're usually many miles away, which means sailing for 20+ minutes. Even when you kill them, they respawn in seconds as long as their ship is standing, and sinking it takes forever. 

With that said, you will quickly realize that combat in this game is just as shallow as the rest of it. There's only one sword, and it lets you block, swing, or charged stab. There's 3 guns, all of which hold 5 shots max before you have to stop fighting and look for an ammo create for 5 more shots. And there's some throwable bombs/molotovs. That's it. It's ridiculously bare bones. 

The only real ""content"" the devs seem to care about adding is just more lazy cosmetic skins to ""chase,"" as if anyone gives a flying f*ck what color your pirate's crap is when it all does the same damn thing as the default.

60,76907990,english,"[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] and I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with each other.
The game is great overall, beautiful maps, textures and atmosphere and pretty decent gameplay to boot. The UI is a bit clunky on PC (until you get used to it) seeing that it originally released for Xbox.

[b]Solo/Co-op[/b]
The game is do-able solo, although you really have to know your stuff to survive long enough in a session to make any real progress. The game, however, is fantastic if you get a crew to adventure with. 

This does not have to be friends (although that is advised) since you can drop into a random Open Crew and play with other people. There is in-game voice chat available in case you need it (which you will).

[b]PvE or PvP[/b]
The game has PvE elements to it (fighting skeletons, story missions, npc's, forts etc.), but mostly it's the PvP that either makes or breaks this game for most people.

There is no way to avoid PvP, unless you spawn on an empty server or the people you encounter are nice enough not to attack you on sight. Be warned, you will get ganked, a lot.

[i]Advice[/i]: Stash/Turn in your loot at every chance you get, otherwise it will be lost.

There is an in-game alliance system of sorts, but personally I've rarely seen people use it.

[b]Saved Progress[/b]
The missions system also does not save all of your progress, so be sure to complete a mission before you log off otherwise you'll have to redo whatever it is that you did before.

[b]Micro Transactions[/b]
The game allows you spend real money in-game, but they are purely cosmetic, there is no pay-to-win in this game so it all comes down to skill (which is a plus).

Overall I really do like it, but if you are the sort of person looking to explore a world by yourself, this might not be the game for you. However, if you are prepared to die (a lot), and take precautions against thieves, you should do fairly well and have a fantastically fun time.",1601639855,1601639855,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198060002062,424,4,2274,2274,873,1601829616

The graphics and art style are just outstanding. The only thing is, but just started happening recently, as soon as we join a session, another player crew is already nearby, firing cannons and killing us over and over and we don't really get a chance to do anything. But I suppose every game gets their toxic players, nothing much you can do there. But I wont hold that against the game, just the community.


Edit: After playing this game for a couple years it just gets worse and worse. Honestly the game itself is loads of fun, but everything you do, all of the loot you gain from quests and things is gone as soon as you encounter people. I hate the way other players are in this game constantly griefing, killing, and stealing all of the stuff you work hours for to get. And yes, I get it, it's what pirates do, but you know what, when you get shit on over and over by people who are experts at the game and can't progress at all because of it, how can this game be fun at all? There is literally no point to playing this game, every time I do, I feel like I have wasted hours of my time doing nothing. So I am DONE with this game, I'm sorry. The players are toxic and I can't take it no more. Call me what you want, but I wish it wasn't so pvp based all of the time, they have arena (specifically for pvp) and the normal mode is basically pvp and some pve. Why not make an pve mode only?

Its environment, immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play, explore and experience. The campaign stories (called ""Tall Tales"") are intriguing, inventive and curious to play-through.

When it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns, it feels a bit lackluster and basic. Battling enemies head-on lacks challenge and is relatively simple. That said, the ship battles against Skeleton Ships, Ghost Ships, Kraken, Megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique. The amount of ways to mess around with your opponent, blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time. Moments where you T-Bone an enemy ship, grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that I have yet to see matched in other games. To add, depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4, you will be provided larger ships from a single-said Sloop to a massive Galleon, all with their own benefits and short-comings, making battles incredibly challenging.

Another key part of the game is the progression in the game. For some players, the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing. However, if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards, this may be the game for you. In Sea of Thieves, what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks, access to better weaponry/ships or other in the game.

I would not recommend this game to solo players as you will die over and over and over at the hands of other players unless u like that kind of frustration, (4 man galleon on 1 is what goes for fair in this game). I don't recommend it to players who like to quest. You will get killed over and over and over again by players looting and sinking you ship and taking all ur stuff while u are on land. No PVE servers.  Private servers are coming but just for events, not personal game play.

Now some will say this review misses the point. The game is PVP. And if you are all about PVP enjoy all of the above. I however leave almost every game angry and frustrated.

Anyone looking at buying this game do some research. Google the game. Look at all the reviews of the toxic player base. I've watch player hunters many times just sit outside a port blowing up and killing players as they log (in to fill their Reaper faction flags). Buyer beware.

43,70806323,english,"Appended review after logging a hundred+ hours in game.

tl;dr - Good game when you have friends with you.  Worst part is the toxic part of the community that enjoy camping / griefing for no loot / gain, just the sake of being toxic. And that there is little-to-no 'spawn' protection or anti-griefing methods from the Devs.  But you'll get that in a lot of Online games.

6 / 10.  Will play with friends, but will have a hard time recommending it to new friends unless they enjoy Toxic PvPers as opposed to genuine enjoyable PvP.

Pros: 
- Beautiful game. Some of the best water graphics out there and over all a very visually pleasing game.
- Can be great with friends. Especially with recent additions to events and things to do, you can go for hours and have a great time.
- Fun encounters. Rare does seem to do a decent job of balancing things too, as Bosses / Encounters (I.e the Megaladon) scale to your ship size and things like that.
- Solid progression system and plenty of different reputations and rewards to grind, without high-level players getting 'Super Power Ups' from their rep levels.

Cons:
- No anti-griefing protection from the Devs.
- Too much 'forcing' people into PvP (Fort of the Damned Markers, Etc).
- 2-man Arena is a joke 75% of the time in which one or two crews just camp others for no gain other than griefing.
- The RNG on events working is wonky.  Sometimes you'll have no weather events / boss events / encounters for ages, sometimes you'll have three at once.
- About 50% of the community is very unwelcoming to new players and can be rather toxic (in our experiences).
- Rare's Matchmaking servers and Friends system is not great.  Sometimes your Arena matchmkaing will take you out of your pre-formed party and throw you into a random party.  And Rare refuses to integrate with Steam's friends & invite system, instead forcing connection through Xbox on the PC apps... which is often down.",1592185534,1601521915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198255298483,125,8,13307,1243,13299,1601613811

46,76838972,english,"Definetly a fantastic pirate game, I played this with game pass for maybe 100 hours before it came out on Steam and I can easily recommend this game to anyone wanting some fun pirate adventures. However, be aware that this game requires you to have 2-3 hours of free time to do anything in a game session. Travel times take up most of your time on the seas and that's assuming you don't get attacked by other players or from the random PvE spawns. Naval combat is fantastic and there's lots of skill involved in it, a 1-man sloop can still sink a 4-man galleon if they're good enough and that's insanely hard to pull off if the galleon crew is good. 

Although most of the game is PvE, don't forget that this is a pirate game, you WILL get sunk by some filthy pirate out there and lose your treasure even if it took you several hours to collect it all and that's fine, just remember [b]no treasure is truly yours until it is sold[/b]. You have to always be on alert for suspicious ships or sneaky pirates lurking around you somewhere. Even though there's an alliance system to buddy up with another ship, they can always betray you if they feel like it and that's up to you and your crew to trust them and being ready to open fire on them if they try to betray you. Also there will definetly be ToXiC gamers out there who will spam text or voice chat with insults if they ever fight you, that's unavoidable so just stay calm and humiliate them by sinking them.  

Overall, the game can be a fun casual pirate experience, though the game does have its problems, there are bugs of course and usually the devs don't fix them asap unless its a major bug that crashes the game/servers, you'll usually have to wait for the next major update to the game to get any bug fixes. Also I wouldn't recommend rushing to become a Pirate Legend, there's nothing new or exclusive to Pirate Legends that isn't cosmetics. The voyages you get from it are just a mix of the main quests you have to do from the 3 main factions before you can dig up the legendary treasure that isn't really worth it for gold, its only worth for leveling up the Pirate Legend faction just to unlock a new cosmetic to purchase. Just do whatever you want and you'll eventually hit Pirate Legend, you could also play with someone who's Pirate Legend to still level up the Pirate Legend faction whenever you turn in the legendary loot.",1601514878,1601514911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042681957,76,1,5708,4879,5708,1601462883

Playing solo on this game is fun. But when you have a whole crew full of your brothers or closest friends with you, it becomes a masterpiece. First thing I saw was how amazing the water looks on this game. Rare saved all the complexity of the graphics into the water and it looks absolutely stunning. When I play with my brothers and friends we discover something new about the game each session so far. (78 hrs on record so far). This game makes you feel like a real pirate while also implementing super fun fantasy elements that pique your interest instantly. When I want to get off for the night something almost always happens to where I have to stay on a little longer or I would miss out on a ton of loot. I also love how there is no level scaling in this game and so the PVP is totally balanced. While there isn't any level progression, there are so many cosmetics that motivate you to keep playing! Even if cosmetics aren't your thing. This is a game where the fun totally lies in the journey rather than the destination.

Other reviews have explained the premise way better so instead I'll just explain my gripes. 
-Gold has no value whatsoever except for cosmetics and buying more quests to get more gold
-No progression system for characters besides reputation at factions. I get that this would break early players in an mmo setting but maybe have different servers based on player levels

So you use gold to buy cosmetics and more quests, and you level up in the different factions so you can take on quests that give more gold as a reward. But we already established that gold does virtually nothing. So why even play the game?

Because sailing around and trying to dock you ship but crashing into islands is fun. Like really fun. Fighting other players in ship battles is thrilling. This is a good game to play with friends and drink some grog both in game and irl (if you're into that) and dance around the ship acting like a true pirate. That's where I would lay my ""in between"" review

70,75077674,english,"Well after reaching Pirate Legend and Athena's fortune Champion titles,
I'm finally able to make a review of this game, I hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it :)

Pros :
-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.
-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.
-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.
-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.
-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).
-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).

Cons:
-Intensive grind.
-Boring after a while.
-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.
-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).
-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).
-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.
-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).
-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).

Overall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)

PS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.

Well, edit update: If you get angry easily, don't play. If you can cope with the game, where you run the risk of griefers, and _that is intentionally part of the game_, then you will have great fun with strangers from across the globe. I can recommend using the official Discord to find crews and to use the voice comms, it makes life much easier and you can better specify which strangers you wish to crew with. 
You will be hunted. You will be chased. You will lose loot. But considering all the loot can buy is cosmetics, it's not a problem, really.
This is the definition of a game where you play to enjoy the scenery and the experience. You will win some, you'll lose lots (when you're new) but there's no pay to win and your skill is all that matters. You can learn to be good, you can learn to play better, and the community is generally welcoming to new players (esp. on Discord), but all this leads to a better sense of satisfaction when you get that loot sold.

So now that I've played more of this game, I feel like I can make a better review. The game in essence is a mile wide but an inch deep. It suffers from a lack of pve only servers and developers that don't know what they're doing. This game has MASSIVE potential, I'm talking Destiny 2 potential, it's sad to see it be as shallow as it is. It's good to say that with firewall you can make your own pve server though it is trickery. I'm unsure if it's allowed but it's not like they can notice it anyway. 

All the fun cosmetic stuff is sadly locked away by a pay wall eg; pets. There is no way to buy a pet with gold, you could grind the premium currency or so they say, in my 8 hours I've accumulated 0 of said currency. The game is incredibly shallow as I said before, the only thing you do in it is cruise and slay skeletons with quick-time animations. There is 0 skill involved. Guns only have like 5 bullets and the gunplay is just plain bad. 

What would need to change?: This game could be the Destiny of Sea's; the Battlefield of Sea's. Think about it. PVE / PVP servers, not set in stone but the option to switch,. PVP modes; such as infantry, prep up some islands and create some fun pvp modes like I dunno capture the flag. For that to happen though we need more and better guns; so add guns; levels; perks maybe even. Than how about some big ship warfare. 20 vs 20 galeon ships with 4 man crews each! Do it, just do it already! As for PVE, dungeons, bosses, more dungeons and even more bosses, guns, and guns and even more guns, epic story adventures that you can go on with your friends, instead of this boring grind that they have now. Just take a look at Borderlands or Destiny and translate it to pirates, they'll figure something out.

Would not recommend for any price, since the fun is locked behind a paywall this game is clearly meant to be f2p / gamepass subs who don't pay anything for it.

There is one little problem I would like to point out... For those that want to experience what this game can look like in maximum graphics... Don't bother. 
When you try and put the graphics to max (if your computer can handle it - which mine most definitely can), the game continues to play smooth, until it crashes without warning. This happens sometimes within seconds or minutes of loading into a server. When this game crashes, it is the worst thing that could happen because you lose all quest progress and booty obtained. This game isn't worth playing on it's maximum graphical setting anyways as there is limited differences between max and the next tier down.

Sailing the sea is very satisfying and it is easy to get lost in the vast world of Sea of Thieves but my issue with this game is just that: A vast open world that is as wide as it is shallow. At first glance the things you can do in SoT seem overwhelming. I started playing solo for a few hours and the novelty of sailing had me smiling from ear to ear until I met my first galleon crew that completely ripped me... I then started playing online with randoms which made me realize that this game is meant to be played with a crew (preferably friends). After 6 hours I quickly found that every objective is for one sole purpose: Gold, and you need a lot of it. All for cosmetic gear that looks neat but offer nothing more than vanity. There is no character progression, no linear story line, and it almost feels like there is no purpose. 

Score: 6/10 - A beautiful game that is as wide as the ocean but as shallow as a puddle.

UPDATED - 25 hours and a solid crew of scurvy pirates later...

I am glad I gave Sea of Thieves a chance, although some of the things I said in my original post still hold true, I found myself going back over and over again because it's actually fun. Playing with friends turns this game into a completely different experience than playing solo or with randoms.

But then as I progressed and did a few voyages I learned that you earn gold and reputation, and the currency is used to buy you skins.

You can choose your boat and sail without having to earn or buy them, you can equip any gun as soon as you log into the game as well as tools and musical instruments, 

You can buy a bunch of cool skins for your weapons, for your ship, tools and instruments. The skins you can get do not improve your items, its is purely visual.

The game is good fun to play with friends and chill, but as solo you must really love the game because its either hard to fight some bosses or fight skeletons ships and repair at the same time while driving the boat.

I do recommend the game because its visually beautiful and fun with friends to adventure.

This gaming community is just plain toxic. They are a lot of trolls. However, in the moments, which are very few to none, having a good time on Adventure which some close friends is possible just don't expect much from this game or its community. Bummer that there is no option for a steam controller on this game. I'm thrilled there is a custom server to just have fun in the world. 

Maybe you could allow the option to customize a server to fight ghost ships only, no gold, no reputation. It will muster some confidence and slight skill for newbies. I say this because the Maiden Voyage doesn't really teach you how to fight unless you play the whole thing like fifty million times because there is only one fight with a ship and it ends really quick. While there is a learning curve, people who want live fighting can hop in Adventure or even Arena. 

Other than that, it's an okay game, I probably won't sink anymore real money into it.",1600716574,1601017228,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198162364947,22,5,1438,339,738,1601070972

37,76514905,english,"Too many late nights have I played Sea of Thieves. 
The first experience guided me to the tutorials - called the ""Maiden Voyage"".
There was little to discover at first until a friend explained to me that there was treasures and secrets on the tutorial island.
Like a pirate and a scavenger hunt, both are similar.

Until I got into the servers and played solo on a small boat (sloop), I practically did what any explorer has done - grab a map (quest) and just sail! The water effects and textures are too amazing and it does feel I could throw up due to motion sickness, but I love the game and realism adds the charm. 

Play along with friends or randoms, sail from small to long ships (3 types for selections) and plunder the islands for the gold it holds. Fight the foes from the living and dead and uncover the mysteries that lie in the tall tales texts.

A quote from the Pirate Lord (Maiden Voyage) - ""There’s far more to being a pirate than a blade in your hand and a love of other people’s money. It’s about finding your way through ancient caverns by lamplight, digging up long-lost treasures…
… and raising a frothing great tankard of grog when you live to tell the tale!""",1601004042,1601004042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079396315,47,2,2825,1394,2361,1601209468

40,76457293,english,"The Game is great, I love it, graphics/visuals make it a beautiful game to look at and a great concept of piracy games, excellent gameplay, I've already dropped 83 hours in it at the time of this review and had it for less than a week.

However it shoud be called Sea of A**holes Rather than Sea of Thieves, THERE NEEDS TO BE PVE servers or PVP designated regions in the map in this game. After hours of grinding work wether it is fishing to collect the varieties needed to unlock new rods, or a quest that took hours, to have someone just pull up to your ship while it's anchored and unatended and start unloading cannon fire while you're in the island questing about, sinking your ship for the hell of sinking your ship and not having an honest combat fight, just all out of being oportunistc and not an ethical gamer and making you loose HOURS you've put into the the gameplay, HOURS work and hard-earned plunder and resetting whatever grinding you've done to zero.

PEOPLE USE HACKING SOFTWARE ON THIS GAME TO ALLOW THEM TO FIRE CANNONS LIKE A SEMI-AUTO, AUTO-AIM CANNONS, TELEPORT TO YOU, DISPLAY EVERY SHIP ON THE MAP AND THEIR DISTANCE. EASILY OBTAINABLE FREE TO DOWNLOAD CHEATWARE.

You can drop hundreds of hours into a game, if among those 100's of hours is just replayability of an objective you've been trying to complete for days because other players can just decide to trash your entire progress. Those hours are not worth the money you've put into the game, IT'S WASTING YOUR MONEY AND TIME OVER A MECHANIC THE GAME HAS NO CONTROL OF. AT THE MOMENT. You end up feeling just discouraged to continue and start from scratch all over again and rage-quit from the time you've put in to progress being lost.

Again, it's not the game itself what makes this game suck (THIS GAME IS A MASERTPIECE), it's the people that play it who suck big time and go about doing all kinds of lows because they can and there's no repercussions. I'm a huge fan of ship combat games, Guns of Icarus was the game that got me hooked, followed by Blackwake, so I do like an honest fight against an opponent that will make me work for whatever loot his/her ship has, but not to have low-life unethical piece of sh*t gamers come trash all my progress.",1600909266,1601002075,False,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False,76561198082857412,318,4,11685,7384,5144,1601848321

76,76482792,english,"So before writing this I had a look through some of the negative reviews and I hope this will be of some help to people who would have heard things from others who may have played 1.7 hours and then said it is awful and you just get camped blahh blah all of this . I'll try and address a few of the biggies :)

New players/Playing solo/being COMPLETELY Fresh:

I was gaming when the CDs or the Cartridge in a box came with a manual you could have a nice read of when sitting on the throne but we don't live like this now you have to take a little bit of initiative, you don't have a little manual but you have the power of mister Interwebs which after scratching the surface you will find there is a Sea of Thieves Discord community. Now as in real life communities there are the village idiots and there are the helpful people. No community is perfect in any game and in fact there are a hell of a lot of worse ones but there is a thread specifically created for new people and its constantly full of others willing to help / teach. Youtube now has become the manual for games so as long as you can put up with an ear bleeding American voice (sorry pondies) there is a lot of information to be gained.

Now I don't know where this expectation for instantly being incredible at a game has come from but I personally understand completely that when you start anything , specifically a new game in this instance you will be awful at it. lots of reviews come from playing less than 2 hours or something similar. I feel this is hardly a fair assessment to be able to make a rounded view of a game. We learn from our mistakes and you will learn lots here.  Accept and learn, this is the path to enjoyment. Most of my journey to Pirate legend was done Solo and ohhh so much of it I was being chased and sunk but after each time you learn things , tips tricks to make dealing with this easier.  This can be to the point where you will then get good enough to then take on almost any of the world events Solo and then once you realise what is what you can communicate effectively to make friends (yes this does happen and quite a lot actually) learn how to flee bigger ships using the wind or going straight into it, leading them into dangers you can deal with better as a smaller ship. You will get killed and sunk a lot but you will learn. As is the same with any game PvE or PvP  (assuming you play PvE games on a challenging setting)   You can even have chill nights playing Solo and fishing once you realise how to sail safely away from the busy shipping lanes. It all comes with experience. Any craft takes time to master and once you do it becomes incredible. And as a new player you have exactly the same equipment as every other player...

Concerning some people's negative reviews on not being able to ""upgrade"" things:

 Now I have seen this complained about ""there is no progression"" etc but it honestly think it is incredible that the ONLY thing that others crews will have as an advantage over you is skill from time played (they have accepted and learned too) and maybe more people. (If you wanted to fight 4 people in the street on your own would you expect to win unless you were very talented?)  The progression comes from showing off your appearance, title, skins earned from things you have conquered and people that know the game will notice this. Its a hard life but ultimately a VERY fun and rewarding one. One review in fact said that the tutorial is PVP , It isn't and I can only assume the in-game tips for new players were mistaken for an actual tutorial when there is a whole little scenario called Maiden Voyage for you to do.

""lack of content"" / ""Nothing to do""

Its very hard to review something based on other peoples opinions without being insulting to other people. I say this because in this game if you are struggling for things to do then I feel that you are not a creative person and think in a very linear way. There is a HUGE amount of lore and story quests for you to do that have checkpoints specifically so if you happen to get sunk then you can crack on where you left off. I've even typed/spoken to other crews saying i'm only doing tall tales (story quests) so there is nothing aboard. A seasoned player will realise there is nothing to gain from sinking you upon hearing this. you will always have bloodthirsty semi new people that unfortunatlely Mr Waye, just want to watch the world burn. The beauty of this game comes from the fact that no two play sessions are the same, you create your own fun here so it does disappoint me hearing others say there is nothing to do. I guess its almost pity based on the fact there are so many games that tell you where to go and what to do and how to do it now , it becomes an expectation for titles like this. 

My experiences:

I have sworn at his game (and other players to my shame) many times, felt like my world has ended after losing 6 figures worth of loot, made stupid mistakes, had huge amounts stolen from me, been sunk by completely new players and all sorts of other things. but i've also laughed more than any other game I have played, been in Awe of its beauty , made friends, taught new people and even encouraged a friend to take it up. Rare entered my life with Goldeneye, banjo Kazooie, DKR a whole host of others and its Quality of game does not feel influenced by its owners at all. Microtransactions have become part and parcel of how gaming has evolved from a passion to businesses. This game feels to me like 98% passion and 2% Business. I've mentioned that every player has the same equipment.. so you would only purchase other skins or a pet if you loved the game enough to include thhat in your experience. you are not pushed you are tempted.

My personal view on the ""we need pvp servers and PVE servers""

there is a very strong case for this and I fully sympathise for the people that just want to pirate on without trouble, and I also understand the people who just respond with a popular reference to the game's name. I even think now there are private servers where this is a reality but I feel this is the extent it should be. your experience and fun in this game comes from the thrill of knowing there are other people out there and I would not change it for anything, despite my huge amounts of rage quits insults and being insulted this has to remain as it is to maintain the game's core ethos and feel

Hello if you scrolled down to the bottom:

1) buy this game and love it if you are a gamer that is welcome to learning the hard way and you will have discovered a gem with NO Dlcs, Free content updates, and a huge world of infinite possibilities and astounding beauty that will generate memories and large amounts of laughter to counter the inevitable rage and salt that is almost certain

2) Don't buy this game if you want something to play whilst watching a box set, if you want something Linear and tells you what to do at every turn or if you're looking for a Level up/talent tree/ one shot low level people kind of thing.  War of Worldcraft is much better at that (I think it's called that, I have played a lot of it but I never clocked on) most importantly don't play this game if you expect to be able to pick up a tennis racket on day 1 and beat Andy Murray. Life/games does not work like that my frens.

Rare, you have created a masterpiece. I can only hope enough people come to see it as I have :)",1600959584,1600959584,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198873531250,28,1,34789,4772,30409,1602021961

86,76475852,english,"So what is Sea of Thieves?

You get to be a pirate sailing the seas by yourself or with a group. It can be the most relaxing game on earth or an incredibly chaotic one. You can get on a boat and sail around the seas with no objective, just enjoying the sound of the ocean and exploring islands for random treasure. You can find or piece together maps to find buried treasure, hunt skeleton captains, find long lost vaults, solve riddles, progress through fascinating tales, hunt huge sea creatures, engage in PVP,  deal with volcano's, or just chillax with fishing, cooking, music and good ale.

When it comes to visuals it has hands down the best looking water in a video game, and at sunrise/sunset it is just jaw droppingly beautiful.
I didn't like the look of the pirates themselves at first but the style has grown on me, and there are tons of cosmetics to change your look, many of which involve you having to pull off some commendation (achievement) or another to unlock the privilege of getting.

Sailing your ship is fantastic once you get the hang of it. Melee and ranged combat is serviceable at best, and it would be nice if they tightened it up but it's not a deal breaker. Using cannons and grapplehooks and all of the things you can fire and do with them is really great.

Are you after frenetic fast paced relentless action with no downtime? This isn't it.
There will be quiet times just sailing the seas between islands and if you're with people you can chat and play music and have a laugh. There will be times when out of no where pirates or a sea creature will descend upon your vessel and you'll need to just make the most of the situation. Overall it's a game you can do at your own pace, and I appreciate that a lot.

94,76432265,english,"so, after 90 hours of playtime i can conclude.

tl;dr is at the end of my review.

This game is good, graphics are okay, gameplay are quite okay, the content is good enough.

Graphics 8/10
You will be finding yourself lost in awe because of scenery with beautiful graphics, or lost in fear because of the thalassophobia that you have. Like seriously, i find the sea is quite soothing will musical instrument playing in your hand, Such a good time.

PvE Content 8/10
If you like to explore, like to solve riddle, and it burn your curiosity to finish the quest, the hint, and everything about adventure, i tell ya, this is good game. There is tons of quest or story line that you can enjoy with your friends, lover maybe and this game require you to play with others.

Gameplay 5/10
If you are newbie, come to this game because of these beautiful ads or whatsoever, then you need to do a lot of homework by searching about ""How To Sea of Theives"" because helllllllllllllllll man, game wont tell you what to do, whats the purpose, how to do, and everything, you will need to solve or find it by yourself by reading the wikis, watching hours of videos and everything and then you will find yourself practicing in the ship or in the island, just to get killed by some skeleton or players.

PvP Content 3/10
As i mentioned above, this game require you to play with others, this is what comes into your play time. As you progress with the quest, the riddle, or whatsoever, you will be forced to sail with others player, and you cant choose to not to stay friendly because 80% the others will turn HOSTILE towards you, either just for annoy you, or they just want to loot your 5 hours worth of hardwork. So you forced to get bullied by someone else in the game if youre not good enough with running away.

Dont get me wrong, i love Sea of Thieves, but not the community, i live in ASIA which is pretty much is either cheat, or toxic. 
I enjoy crashing with other people, but not gonna enjoy after doing hardworking quest and killing enemies just to get looted by the end by some 4 people hiding/""tucking"" in your ship just to come out later exploding bomb, or they guy with explosion swim from across the island just to destroy you.

I get it, this is called Sea of ""Thieves"" so yeah, there you have it. Honestly if ""Raft"" has a lot of content, i would be playing that game for long hours.

I am on my way to Pirate Legend, with 55 Gold Hoarder, 30 Mechant Alliance, 42 Order of Soul but meh, im just gonna give up. That 90 Hours of my gameplay is the ""Me"" that doesnt give up.

The game has a great concept and is ok to play but very far from fun and heres why:
people wait and hide and steal your loot every chance they can, as a new player ive tried asking for help and invites so i can learn, all i get in response is my ship getting sunk and getting killed over and over even when u spawn in, i spent hours following a map to a iland dug up the one chest then i got attacked sunk and my loot taken and sold, this games a very poor experiance.

SIMPLE FIX make a pve only server or make a flag when flown it grants you invincabillity from nasty trolling players, i understand what the games about and its a fair point but thier needs to be a way for new players to learn without getting trolled to the point they dont want to play anymore

Music and art style in this games great unqiue and fun to experance but gameplay is poor and lacking for the solo and pve community

Sea of Thieves is about as free-form of an experience as you can get, which is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you could probably spend close to a dozen hours having fun sailing around without ever realizing there is a proper campaign to follow. And that’s when I discovered that even though its free-roaming gameplay is enjoyable enough. And on the other hand, you can chase the campaign missions ""Tall Tales"" which includes lots of sailing, solving puzzles and fighting (since you are sailing a lot the chances that you are going to fight while sailing is very high).
 
 Progression in Sea of Thieves, like its overall structure, is pretty loose. Rather than gaining experience points to level up a character, you increase your reputation with five different Companies by completing voyages, finishing Commendations (similar to achievements), or turning in specific items. 

 Almost everything you unlock is purely cosmetic. If you’ve got a good group of two or three friends to play with, it’s hard to find a game as entertaining as this one!

This game is so weird because the aspects of the game involving playing solo, like the missions and sailing are really fun and casual, yet the aspects of playing against other people, like the ship combat are stressful and obscenely unfun. You really can't play the game solo and have fun without being a total loser, and if you try to play solo it's just like, what's the point?

Also, the game isn't worth playing solo.

I liked the graphics and exploring. If other players were something you could opt in to dealing with, it might be worth recommending.

83,76382333,english,"Let me tell you a tale. A tale of my first few passings within the Sea of Thieves.


When I first awoke to the Maiden Voyage I in fact dared to claim that unlike most that went beofe me, I was likely much more well versed in the arts of sailing than they that came before me. For I informed myself quite thoroughly and waited a LONG time until I even considered the fabled Sea of Thieves. For I made a vow in this regard, not to repeat past mistakes when it came to my hard earned money.

Yet there I was. And I must say that happy does barely describe the feeling of me actually experiencing the wonderfull sights for my own. Sights I so far only ever could ponder about through others. Immideately I realized though, that my knowledge, well prepared as it was, still lacked ... much to even dare call it well versed. Yet now, I had the true ability to learn. And so I did. For quite a long time, and BOY did I enjoy every second of it. From stearing my first rowboat over cooking my first meal up to setting my first sail. Memorys I will treasure.

And yet ... that is but the beginning of my tale!
For when I then arrived in the actual Sea of Thieves I felt completely lost once again. It is hard to even think about something to compare this sea to. So the first thing to do was obviously to search for another crew. A crew to take me in for a while, grant me a cut of their treasure but most importantly, allow me to mirror their knowledge. And I did not have to search for long haha. More precise to say I did not have to search at all.

When we first set sail on our Brigantine I had no real idea what we were actually doing. And while the other mate wasn't exactly what I'd call magnificent, after all one simply cannot expect to get along with everyone, the Helmsman though was especially nice. Furthermore he seemed quite the seasoned sailor aswell. He told me that I was very lucky indeed and that after this journey I would have more Gold than most of my status can even dream of! And by now I can say, that was NOT an empty claim.

The voyage was long. We were sailing from island to island following some weird key compass which I initially could not understand even a bit. Yet after but a few strides on said islands I managed to use it just fine, though I still did not really understand what we were searching for even though the Helmsman tried to explain. At that time, though now I do well understand, all I could make out from it at that point, was 'Vault Run'.

We came to a great stone cliff painted with boars. The Helmsman gathered us and said: Behind this wall there is imense treasure, but we only have a very limited time to carry as much out of its hall as possible so we should hurry and not bother to carry it directly to the ship. And when he opened the wall like door within the cliff, with some kind of riddled key which appearently was our previous goal, I stood in awe!

Yet I controlled myself and focused on carrying as much treasure as possible infront of the enormous door, knowing that it would close soon. So much treasure there was within this hall of stone, I would indeed not have dreamt of it. The hall itself though was obviously more than just a simple hall of a culture that long since abbandoned it. It was also some kind of riddle. And as I later realized a gateway to a deeper, even more secured chamber.

Yet my glimpses at it remained fractued at best for I was fully focused on carrying as many treasure chests out of the hall as possible and that as quickly as possible. Indeed by now I have to confess that then, greed came upon me, greed that should be punished.

Though, through the fact that I was not alone, solid progress was made in completely clearing out the hall, I could not help but wonder why suddenly the Helmsman stopped his carrying and instead fiddeled around with some ancient pillars. Yet I trusted him and dared not disturb, still focusing on my own treasure hunting. Then, another stone wall opened, and behind it ... a single chest that obviously, was the true treasure within this ancient place. And I had the honor of carrying it to safety.
A glorious moment indeed. Yet our time within these walls was comming to an end.

The Helmsman made it clear that NOW we had to leave but there was still so much treasure to save! I thought to myself. ONE more chest! I succeeded. ANOTHER one! I succeeded. AND THAT BIG PILE OF GOLD OVER THERE!

Before I could even lay hand on it, the great wall that was the entrance closed and I found myself trapped inside the hall, that was, to my great shock, with VERY great speed, completely filling up with water. Immediately I had the most terrible regrets and asumed that I had not only lost the treasure but my life to go with it. And relativly quick, I did indeed drown in the hall out of which I could find no escape.
With only the gold still within giving me some kind of comfort.

When I woke up I found myself in an ethereal form. I instantly remembered that I had already seen this in the shape of a man only named the 'Pirate Lord' back when I first started my Maiden Voyage. And much more importantly that I had read about this within the Pirate Lords very own journals and that they stated we were somehow protected within the sea of thieves.

During my Maiden Voyage I paied fairly little attention to this. Yet after what I can by now truly call my ""first"" death, I thought differently about that indeed! I looked around and recalled upon my knowledge about religion. This was obviously the passing afterlife and I was on the ship to cross over. Calling it Ghostship would be an understatement yet what most caught my attention was the hovering man steering it.

I walked up to him and spoke. And he spoke to me aswell.
And before I could say anything else I remembered once more a passage of the Pirate Lords journals.
Speaking about this very Ferryman and that for us in the Sea of Thieves he should be seen with great respect. It honestly seemed like a sad existence this beeing had to endure yet also, he seemed selfless on a different plane indeed.

Then, after but a short time, a portal appeared. And I knew that this was my way back to the living. I hesitated not and a few seconds later I could see the sun again! Standing next to the nice Helmsman on the ship that brought us to the vault in the first place. He already expected me and didn't even seem surprised. I for my part though, was happy indeed, not only to not have failed this adventure but also, and I say that with a tiny bit of greed here aswell, haha ... to see all of the magnificent treasure still just waiting to be loaded onboard!
And so we did :D

Back at the Outpost we sold it all to a price that, so I was told, and once again I was told the truth, was in fact excellent yet even if it hadn't ... I felt like the richest sailor there is for a moment.
In the end we raised a Grog and made sure to remain friends even though this particular adventure came to an end. And thus I was free to go on another. Though much richer and, perhaps even more importantly, quite a bit wiser.

And while this tale ends here. My tale did in fact not. Just the next day I signed up for a Cargo run for the buisnessminded Mearchants guild during whitch me and my crew were attacked by a rivaling crew when in the middle of nowhere a Skeleton Galleon attacked! The fact that we made it out of there alive and even victorious over the other crew could probably make me tell a tale twice as long as the one I already told. And oh great GODS! The next day in fact makes these previous tales BOTH seem almost miniscule in comparison!

For I was taken onboard a Galleon by a crew of Pirate Legends! And boy the journey was LEGENDARY indeed!
Let's just say it ended with a treasure whiches core rightfully bears the name 'Chest of Legends'.

But why simply imagine it ?!
I say grab a Grog and then join in with the shanty!

I REALLY recommend this game. PIRATES, ADVENTURES, COMBATS, GOLD, THE ENVIRONMENTS, and I shall NOT forget our wonderful COMPANIONS that you can have with you aaaaaall the time... Cats, Dogs, Pirates, and Monkeys. For me, I got a black Cat that I have with me all the time. She reminds me of my fluffy dark gray long hair Cat that I had but to me... I will Always and Forever have her with me on my ADVENTURES in real life and during my ADVENTURES in the game. She is in Heaven right now. She's my first Cat that I had for 11 years. 2007 - 2018. We are so CONNECTED together. She's my Baby (My Cat) and I'm her Momma. Always and Forever.~ Another thing that this game makes it even MORE AMAZING, is that I have been play and get to play this game with my Husband!!~ So, this game is AMAZING.~",1599777506,1600715931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198422631393,12,3,9577,786,8470,1601690117

There was romance, suspense, horror, and a deep hatred for Randal the cat. As we were hauling our fat loot out of a vault we were descended upon by another group of pirates.

46,76323204,english,"WARNING:  IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AS PVE ONLY PERSON AND HATE ANY SORT OF PVP DO NOT BUY. YOU WILL GET KILLED/LOOTED.

So, if you are still here, and don't mind pvpve gameplay, then listen up. I myself am a more pve person then pvp, but this game is not as bad as some reviews and community posts make. Yes, there is always that chance of being stalked by another crew, getting in a fight and getting sunken and all of your treasure taken by other people. Yes, as my experience showed me, 95% of close range ships will start a fight and will try to catch you, sink you, board you, kill you, take your loot, burn your ship and what not, but..

There is a thing. You can go for hours and won't even see another ship up close. They may stay at horizon or you won't even see them at all. And when you see them coming at your general direction, if you don't want a fight, you can always run. In most cases they wont even chase or if they do, you still can run and in most cases they will give up.

I myself have played sessions without any pvp encounters, and if you think that someone is after you, stalking and what not, you can always restart the session, which will put you in a different server. I mean, you may get unlucky or lucky sessions, depending on what you want from the game.

So the pvp aspect being out of way, i can say that the game visually looks great, if somewhat cartoony. Also sound design is top quality. Almost every action in the game has a sound clue. From successful hits on enemy ships to full blown wind in your sails. Gameplay mechanics itself are straightforward, yet somewhat not so well explained, such as ship speeds, sail position according to wind and ect. But after you have played and seen the basics, you can look for additional information online, like youtube or steam community. 

Overall games pve or pvp elements on its own are somewhat boring. Get in a few ship fights and you may as well have seen them all. Same thing goes for pve, in itself is very repetitive and boring. You mostly gonna do samish things in sameish locations over and over. And that's where the pvpve aspect of the game shines. Having that real sense of danger over your hand while doing 100th quest for gold hoarders will spice things up. And what a great feeling  when you manage to sell loot worth 200k after being chased across the map by 2 ships and still managed to outsmart/outplay them. Every time  I sell loot in this game is like victory to me. 

So, what can you do in this game you ask? Well, first of all, SoT are sandoxy game, there are no “you must” or “you have” to do things here. If you want you may just sail around and fish out treasures from sea, or trap pigs and chickens in crates. However game have various factions with their reputations. So that would be your “progresion”. Do gold hoarder quests and rise their reputation, put their emissary flag on and have even more gold/reputation from their voyages. And if its your thing You can just sail around under Reapers flag and hunt other players for their hard earned loot. Its all up to you and your skill. Game also have skelington forts, kraken, megalodon, skelington ships and ghost ships and some other world events to take part to. Or you can yust dock your ship at some small trading post, catch fish, cook it and sell to the Hunter faction.
Your rewards in game are gold and cosmetics. With gold you can buy mre cosmetics. So no pay to win stuff. All what others have you can have. Everyone has access to all 3 ships, all 4 weapons, all cannon balls and ect. So by sinking you lose only your loot=gold= some cosmetics what you can buy. And even as noob as i'm myself, i can easily make 100k in a session, and some nice skins can cost as much as 250k. Just be smart, dont sail around for multiple hours gathering loot. If you sink you will lose all, so if your pvp skills are not up to task, then sell quickly, cose all what you turn in is yours and you dont lose gold when you die. I have a rule that if I play solo I go for an outpost as  soon as I have 10ish chests or I spot a ship coming in my general direction. 

And for bad stuff.. Controls feel like a bad port from console to pc, some keys just dont make sense. Game can get buggy. Sometimes i will lose all feedback for treasures sold and reputation gained and sometimes some shops bug out so i can't see my character at the preview window and it may crush me on the desktop.

7/10 Get killed by some “12 year old”, while his mom was shouting at him. Open mic is just hilarious.

Great game with a crew, used Discord to find other newbs to play with and was lucky enough to find a few good people to befriend and cooperate with.  If you are playing with others that aren't team players, it isn't much fun.  

Graphics are beautiful, especially the water physics.  Sailing is a lot of fun whether it's on any of the three types of ships.  Lots of weather events, random sunken ships to explore, and islands.  There's even a Kraken that you could be unfortunate enough to encounter.  

The music is really well done, excellent high quality acoustic instruments, no synths.  Music changes often and always fits the mood of what is happening.  

This game is a blast to play, if you're into pirating and sailing.

The ONLY gripe I have about the game is that there isn't much of a reason to play except for making gold to buy cosmetic and aesthetic improvements for your avatar or ship.  That's it.  No upgraded guns, cannons, sails, speed... nothing.  You just sail around to find gold and plunder with friends.  And you know what?  At the end of the day, that's alright with me.

57,76320563,english,"so i haven't played a ""rare"" game since the n64. not that it matters. this studio is just completely different from the old rare that made donkey kong country and banjo. but that shouldn't surprise you these days. it's pretty normal for a studio to get gutted and replaced with college grads for cheap and they tell you it's a product made by talented developers.

crashes before i can beat the first voyage. tried a couple times, most of my playtime was spent verifying game files both on 
steam and through the game's verification. didn't help, btw. game just refuses to run. encountered multiple bugs when i got out of the tutorial, too. extreme lag when boarding my ship where it would just jump all over the place. getting stuck on the wheel and raising the anchor.

the first thing i had to do was change the fov. it's motion sickness inducing. there's a guide on how to do that on steam.
this is more of an issue with consoles since they have low fov.

nobody playing in solo queue, so enjoy your single player game.
missions are just glorified fetch quests. go here, kill the thing, get the thing, haul your ass back.
gameplay is sluggish and makes you feel restricted. every slash of the cutlass feels like a chore.

audio is meh. no dynamic range, low fidelity recordings, positional audio is non-existent on the water. bgm just pops in when an enemy appears, so it doesn't add to the ambiance.
graphics are meh. its got an... alright art style. kind of reminds me of janky f2p mmos from high school. it's an xbox game, so it's made to be played on crappy hardware. no post-processing, minimal lighting, limited shadows, low physics calcs. looks really bland and last-gen.

sea of thieves is what some would call a ""multiplayer game.""
it has no depth, and it's extremely barebones in order to keep people mindlessly playing.

65,76315626,english,"TL;DR :: It took 10 hours to get a good amount of coordination with my friends. Learning how to manage steering, the sails, repairs, and combat all at the same time was a challenge, but a rewarding one. Early game, solo especially is slow and boring, but once you find a good group of friends and find what you enjoy doing; the game definitely gets more fun. 8/10

Sailing is fairly simple; manage the sails, steer the ship, use the anchor as needed. With practice the Sloop can easily be used solo or with two players. The Mid-sized ship works decently with three or four players and offers some decent benefits for the extra size in the form of additional cannons and storage space.

The game is fairly risk/reward based. You can loot and do quests and have a good haul; but a few too many fights with other players and AI can sink your ship and you'll lose everything. Figuring out what is the best amount for you and your crew is very important for getting good money.

PvP is fun if your winning, not so fun if you're losing. Getting out numbered happens a lot playing with only two players or using a smaller ship. Getting used to the cannons is very crucial to the game play and being effective with the special cannonballs is vital.

Quests are varied enough to give some replay value to each kind; but they mostly boil down to go to X island and do a thing. Fight some skeletons, search for the X on a map, do a riddle and dig up some treasure, move X cargo to X island, etc.

Raids are a challenge worth doing. Sail to the spot on the map where you spot the skull, tornado, etc. Fight waves of enemies until you win. They give good rewards of gold and doubloons at the end, but do have the risk of getting attacked and losing everything on way to port. as with any other time.

Cosmetics are decently varied but not vast. A handful of items for each slot, hats, coats, pants, etc. Weapons and items have the same for them as well. They don't provide any kind of boost to damage or HP; meaning everyone is on a fairly level playing field in combat. The art style is cartoony and highly detailed leading to a distinct, vibrant pallet during the day and a darkened, subdued one at night.

Overall; Sea of Thieves is a fun co-op game with enough to do for players to continue sailing for a very long time. Visually and mechanically this is a fantastic pirate game I'd totally recommend. 8/10",1600665223,1600665223,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False,76561198077695950,1119,58,1161,0,1161,1600644500

Figuring out how to add/play with Steam friends or anyone that's not on your Xbox Live account friends list is a nightmare.

What I would recommend doing is picking up Gamepass. It will give you access to TONS of good games (including Sea of Thieves) and it isn't all that expensive considering what you get. Personally, I think this is a better option than just buying Sea of Thieves.

That being said, do whatever is financially feasible for your situation. Gamepass is more expensive overall than just buying the one game, it just gives you more overall value imo.

Either way, get your hands on some Sea of Thieves and don't be afraid to play with strangers. The seas are much less forgiving to lone pirates and it could put a sour taste in your mouth for what really is a fantastic game.",1593126436,1600609502,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,76561198120831622,134,3,32799,13,32436,1601405574

Like, when you want to cook something, like chicken (which you have to kill), you have to place it on the woodstove and wait for it to cook all the way through before it's safe to eat. If you don't pick it up when it's done, it will burn. Another small thing, is when you go up the ladder to the Crows Nest, you move at an average pace. On the way down, you move a lot faster. You can adjust the sail direction to catch the best breeze. If you partially raise the sail, you move slower. When you lower the anchor, you don't stop instantly, it drags on the bottom of the sea for a second. Reloading guns takes time and it shows you put the ball in the end and cock it, and then you're ready to fire another shot. When your ship takes damage, the damage is exactly where you thought it was, and you have to go and grab wood to repair those holes, and then use a bucket to bail out the water. 
I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. I'm only 4 hours in and I'm loving this game. Only Con so far is that if another player sees you, you're gonna fight, almost guaranteed.

Hyperbole aside, with the right crew you can turn this game into one of the greatest road trip experiences you can find.

The water design is gorgeous, and the orchestra is phenomenal.

This is not one of those games that you play 8 hours a day, it is more like one of those that you play one or twice a week and for a few hours.
I am not an aggressive player, but I like that that it is a multiplayer game, it always keeps you on the heels and alert. You can not zone our for 5 minutes because by that time someone might have come and sunk your ship and taken your loot. It is possible to create alliances as well, then there is this awkward situation where on both sides you have introverted gamers who want to show that they are friendly but do not speak much. It is fun to meet other people and do some quests together. 

This game is not for everyone, all the in game currency that you earn you can spend only on cosmetics and the quests are not that interesting, but if you want to just chill and spend time in a beautiful environment this one is for you.

There are lots of things to do, you can do missions alone or with friends. Probably better with friends though, cause you can do them more easily, if you are alone you have to take care bout the boat, water, cannons, driving ecc. but you still can manage to do it.

16,76171085,english,"[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is a pirate-themed multiplayer action-adventure game taking place on a broad sea with dozens of islands to explore.

The game uses a character creation system that allows players to generate pirates until they find the suitable one for themselves. This feature does not let the players to customize the appearance of their pirates and can be a bit disappointing for some people.

The players can easily understand the basic mechanics of the game by beginning their journey in Maiden Voyage, a well-designed tutorial starting on an island full of secrets.

The game is played as teams by two to four players. It is also possible to play the game alone; however, it will make the game quite challenging. Sloops are easy to control and hard to target, making them a suitable option for a solo adventure.

The players can choose from a decent number of trading companies to work with and become the pirate they want. The quests requiring the player to visit the same islands to accomplish the same objectives repeatedly cause the game to become less entertaining after a while.

The mechanics are quite realistic in terms of naval combat and ship controls. Fighting across the sea can be so much fun, especially if there are some friends on the deck.

The high standard sound design and visuals create a beautiful atmosphere. Traveling the seas while playing your favorite soundtrack with a musical instrument during the sunset is a unique experience.

The game is constantly changing with regular updates. These changes keep the game fresh.

35,76185422,english,"Oh man, Sea of Thieves. I spent $1 for a month of Xbox Game Pass to give Sea of Thieves a try, and I fell in love. I jumped on it on Steam in July despite the game not even being on sale at the time, just because I wanted to keep playing it.

The biggest gripe I have with Sea of Thieves is, like many others, the other players who choose to do PvP battle with you. I've gotten frustrated a lot simply because other players felt like engaging and they either have a better grasp of PvP than my crew does or their internet sucks. It can be, and is, very demoralizing to spend half an hour or an hour on one voyage and lose all of that progress.

However, thankfully, the majority of Sea of Thieves players do not fall into that category. Most players want to do their own thing and not make the gamble to lose all of their progress, so usually you won't even come into contact with other players, or you might end up finding friendly players. If you're aiming for PvP, the Arena game mode exists to provide PvP players the matches they're looking for. In fact, there are communities dedicated to setting up PvE servers, and having joined them a couple of times, they can be well-organized and very rewarding.

New PvE content is being added to the game almost monthly. New treasure hunts, new story quests, new world events, and more, all with unique gameplay mechanics that will keep you on your toes. Some players complain about ""all enemies are skeletons"" but honestly there's a lot of variety in both the skeleton types and the special skeletons like Captains and Ashen Lords. There's genuine feedback to be made about boss enemies being bullet sponges, but other than that the fights are honestly very fun.

It's also really great to have the game put everyone at an equal skill level in terms of weapons and ships. There's no way to upgrade anything for more power. All of the loot goes towards more cosmetics, which is risky because that means the developers put their entire stock in the gameplay loop being fun enough for players to keep coming back, and it definitely paid off because the gameplay loop is definitely really fun.

While other players can be a nuisance at times, I'm always coming back to Sea of Thieves, so much so that I easily paid real money for a pet dog. I definitely recommend everyone gives Sea of Thieves a try by using the Xbox Game Pass for $1 for a month, and then making a decision from there.",1600456214,1600456214,True,58,3,0.803707659244537354,0,True,False,False,76561198044115669,553,89,6703,1095,5317,1601940187

Sea of Thieves is a true Jack Sparrow simulator and the only game that made me feel like a true pirate. There is always something to do and the best part is they are random every single time so you cant look from internet or ask your friends. You need to solve every quest. The game is fun solo but bores you quickly. I recommend you to play with your friends. It is much more fun that way and if the adventure mode bores you after a few weeks you can also try arena mode which is only based on PvP.

15,76118216,english,"Sea of Thieves was just the change of pace I neededAs I'm sure many are already aware, there's not many other multiplayer games out at the moment that aren't Battle Royal or a FPS 15 min matches. If you're like me, you got bored of that same repetitive formula after 2018. Sea of Thieves managed to give me a new experience, where team work is key, and boring moments are rare. You could play this game by yourself of course, but I can't imagine this game being a fun single player experience. This is definitely something to do with a friend or more. That's where it strives as simply getting from point A to point B is a whole thing instead of just holding down 'W'. If you want to have success, you need to make sure you and your crew are doing each persons part. Somebody steering, somebody working the sails, someone making sure you don't crash into anything up ahead, somebody navigating on the map below deck as there's no minimaps. That's simple getting from point A to point B, I will admit that it can become a little tiresome sometimes, but I have found after being on land for a little while, solving puzzles, finding treasure, that resets it for me and I can appreciate the calm of the sea. Also playing along side other players you've never met, this game has a strong social aspect, and a good community too, you'll get some assholes sure, but it's a pirate game after all, you could be attacked, you could just find someone random and chat to them and share a drink. This game absolutely strives in it's social aspect.However, no game is without fault, of course the sword combat, I'm not particularly a fan of, but that's just my personal preference as I feel it a bit clunky, and somehow too slow and fast at the same time. But my biggest issue; The only progression is cosmetic. Sure to start with you'll look all through the store seeing all these amazing things you can get, but once you have an outfit you like, there's not too much of a point to continue. That ever lasting hope for gold leaves, finding a bunch of loot not as exciting as it once was. But I do still love playing, as the experience is far better than the goal.TL;DRBrilliant with friends, but no progression, still fun tho.",1600348409,1600348409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198067951244,50,1,3694,775,2771,1601438679

75,76055942,english,"Is Sea of Thieves a good game? Roman Catholic sign of the cross is upside down, done with five fingers instead of three, is done from left to right instead of right to left, etc. (basically inviting demons). Antichrist's Third Temple will have 8 chambers: a chamber per main religion; antichrist will be crowned in this temple; during crowning, he won't read the ""belief prayer"" correctly (rejecting Christ and acknowledging himself); when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show), many people will see his big nails and will reject him; Patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist; antichrist will kill him. Also, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the 8th ""wolf"" Council; others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. Roman Catholics, Satanists, and Buddhists use the same mudras; if you see these mudras on an icon, then it's not Orthodox icon; Orthodox icon has IC XC symbol (Jesus Christ). Roman Catholics pay drunks and prostitutes to pose for icons; passions of drunks and prostitutes transfer to those who pray to these images. Normal Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Gaad in Ruski = Satan; hence, Americans = blasphemers because they always say: ""Oh, my god!"". Santa (word for Saint in Satanic languages) = Satan; hence, Spanish + Italian + Portuguese = blasphemers. Anathema to Satanic languages; triple anathema. Learn Church Slavonic; no curses in it; curses = prayer to Satan. All religions except Orthodoxy worship Satan. On bread for communion: IC XC NIKA (Jesus Christ Conquers) plus cross = Orthodox; hexagram plus Dusha Maya = antichrist. Jews and Muslims pray head down (either standing, bowing, or kneeling); this is Satanic prayer. Orthodox look into the eyes of icon; energy goes their way; they get healed; head and shoulders come together to reject Satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to Christ and not the devil. Hands cannot be on groin or behind back; either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. Legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. Clergy who will not ""put Buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood"" will be killed; only 7 churches will be left as Pelageya of Ryazan predicted. In 2006 and at other meetings, fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying Orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same Supreme Being; triple anathema; don't let heretics tell you what to do. America will be last country to switch to Euro. Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. Scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists wanted war between Russia and Germany from June 11th to October 11th on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud (Shroud of Milan) on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrected after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies very fast; deceived people will say that ""Christ is here; Christ is there"".",1600238450,1600238450,True,1,1,0.479077726602554321,0,True,False,False,76561197961452799,141,8,4770,292,2983,1601447576

Toxic players, dismissive support, and glitchy game play all equal a title that isn't worth anyones time or money. For anyone who likes to play solo mode in games, AVOID THIS TITLE AT ALL COSTS. You will be attacked by larger ships/crews on a regular basis all while they scream ""IT'S A PIRATE GAME!! YARR!!!"". The Code of Conduct is a joke and only enforced at the developers leisure and pretty much never enforced on toxic players who have figured out how to cheat the system (either by actually cheating or by vocally abusing others over in-game voice chat; the latter of which isn't policed). And on the rare instances that a player is banned, it's often on mistake (search YouTube for ""Sea of Thieves banned"" to see what I mean), but Rare Ltd doesn't admit to its short comings and those accounts stay banned. 

In the end, this game is admittedly a good concept. However, the developers choice to leave the whole world as a ""play it your way"" environment without uniformly enforcing their own lacking rules and regulations only leads to a horrible player base which, in turn, results in frustration for those who would rather not enter into what amounts to little more than yet another PvP ""shot `em up"" game.",1600205127,1600205127,False,3,2,0.471698135137557983,0,True,False,False,76561199040623409,10,1,343,1,218,1600902674

Pros:
Amazing graphics and sea-faring mechanics. 
Lots of contents, which includes but not limited to, treasure hunt, raid, PvP, and Quests. 
Devs take feedback and provide constant bug-fix and content update. 
No pay-to-win aspect. 

Cons: 
At disadvantage if playing solo. 
Buggy X-Box Live integration.
Lack of personal weapon choices. 
You can be attacked and looted by players for no reason, losing all your stuff
(well, not really a con because it says right there in the name ""Sea of Thieves,"" but some people really hates it)
Limited to 4 crew members per ship.

Overall, great game. I would recommend it.

Unfortunately, anytime you try to join your xboxy friends from your lil xbox socials ex dee it sends you...to the windows store. You accept a game invite and it...does nothing. We tried every solution online dating back to almost two years ago and it's just broken, it's buggy, it's not working. Buy this game for solo. I played four hours and had a great time! Same platform friends? Sick, get it. Cross platform? Just punch yourself in the nuts. It'd be a less grueling experience then what we had to go through. I hope this saved someone from making a mistake because boy I wish someone had told me about this before I bought the game. Now I'm just sad. This pretty game with scary giant fish made me sad.

At all times, it's your ship (with between 1-6 players aboard) and 5 other ships - there can never be more on a server. So sometimes you'll bump into tons of other (typically very hostile) pirates, and other times you won't see another soul for 2-3 hours.

The thing is, the experience is so immersive - even solo - that I'm not sure it really matters. Honestly, SoT reminds me a lot of a tropical version of The Long Dark: there's a great deal of exploration, eating, seeking supplies, and defeating AI threats (of varying difficulty, though most are pretty much cake). Still, it's so damned atmospheric that I cannot put the thing down. The behavior of the sea, the sky, and they way your ship glides between the two is almost heavenly (and very, VERY reflective of real life sailing, albeit simplified). And, for me, that experience makes SoT one of the most rewarding games I have ever played.

I love this game to bits, It's absolutely amazing.. but the community has gotten so unbearably toxic.
What triggered this review is me and a friend played a sloop last night and today, and both times got ran down by a Brigantine and a Galleon while we were at full speed. We've even tried to out maneuver the ships, which the sloop is SUPPOSED to be better at it, but because the sloop isn't at fast that amazing turn radius does nothing for you because you can't get away. You end up getting stuck turning in circles, or they outpace you anyway even with the tricks you can try.
Sloop can't outrun anything, and people will bully the hell out of you and destroy you and pick on you at any chance they get so you can barely get anything done, it makes PVE almost impossible to enjoy because of all the people seeking you to destroy you, and then call you shit at the game when they're in a ship that in every way is just better than yours. Even if you avoid people like the plague, they will chase you down and kill you anyway for no good reason. 

We had a ship chase us all the way across the map and back just so they could sink us, we had no loot on us. They don't want your loot, they don't want your emissary, they just want to screw you over.

Got 2 of my pals to play with
Love this game so much. Been playin' with some friends for about 2 months now and i am not dissapointed. One time, we did an Athena's Run (we were 3 guys on a brig) and after we got the last chest we tried to head for the closest outpost. While doing so, we passed by an island which had a galleon anchored next to it, the crew ashore and skulls, gold, chests, you name it scattered across the island from an earlier event which we didn't notice before.
We sunk their ship, killed them and stole every single piece of loot we could find. We tried to head out to the outpost when we realised the enemy crew respawned at the exact same outpost. We changed course, sailed almost half the map only to have them follow us. We tried to lose them near some volcanoes in the Devil's Roar (1 molten rock hit one of their masts and we gained some distance), we had been chased by 3 Megalodons, 1 Kraken encounter and 2 other small sloops. Then, we managed to throw a powder keg overboard which managed to slow them down a little. When we were almost out of hope we saw a ghost fleet in the distance. We rushed through the fleet (taking a bit of damage), then the fleet changed focus on them. We did some turns and managed to lose them after an hour. Best f* gameplay. Best atmosphere. Good story.

I recommend it, but a thing to note is, that the game loop is centered around going to different places on your ship. The Seafarer journey is the core and for some, it could quickly get tiresome. And once you have earned enough to beautify your ship and have gotten your pirate swagged up, the only thing left is high level PvE and PvP.  For some it would be fun, for others it would be tiresome.

There are no builds, just 4 weapons with no upgrades, no skills. Nothing. It makes you play as a pirate, but the RPG factor is quite low, so don't go expecting too much out of it. Just simply going about the world, looting and pimping out your ship and character. Thats it.

There is a lot of content, and big monthly patches with loads of new content continuously coming out, which keeps the game play fresh. I've met loads of people that have been playing the game since it's release. I'm guessing because of this reason. 

No P2W which is a huge plus, considering most games now a'days. But if you do want to spend real money, it's purely for cosmetics. 

PvP is extremely fun! There's no better feeling than sinking another players ship, and taking all their hard earned loot that probably took them hours to accumulate. Yet, there is probably no worse feeling when it happens to you lol.  

Extremely fun if you have 1-3 close friends to play with. However, you can always join the SoT discord to find a crew that knows what they are doing, instead of using the random crew finder.

Ended up asking for a refund, but although I only played through the tutorial, I had been in the game for too long to get any refund :( 

I spent hours in the character selection, and even left the game on while in the character selection. And when I was finally done with that, I played the tutorial and then went straight to change my clothes. Aaaand it crashed.. Sooo I started the whole process again and selected a new character (thought I had lost my old one), so it took even longer. And same thing happened again, entered a chest and the game crashed. After that I started looking for solutions online and tried everything I could find, and even got a friend to help me make sure everything on my end was up to date etc. But no luck.. 

So I recommend people who buy this, to not spend a lot of time making a character.. pick one, and then hurry though the tutorial, and then try changing clothes etc.. If you can and it doesn't crash or anything, you can just delete your pirate (if you're not happy with it) and then take your time picking the one you want.

And to all the people who say that they shouldn't be being robbed. It is called sea of thieves for a reason. And you only get robbed once in a blue moon. Or if you're dumb enough to get caught. There's nothing more satisfying than outmanuevering an enemy ship, or sinking it. And even by yourself it is a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend you get this when you can.

25,74600083,english,"So I JUST updated this review and now my ping will never go lower than 340.

I'm finding it really hard to enjoy a game when I have to sit there for 30 seconds loading my respawn but for some reason it prioritizes loading audio first so I could hear everything going on up until my ship sank, while still loading.

This game would be extremely immersive and fun if it weren't for a few problems that make it feel like an early access game. At first I was so immersed with the game that I was blown away, but as I played more I noticed more issues with trying to play this game solo. I tried playing with crews but having a conversation  ruins some of the immersion so I decided to continue playing solo, to my demise.  I have a low end pc and a low end wifi connection, but it's good enough to play most other games at 30 fps with ~50 ping on my server region, yet the way the servers on SoT works is that the more players, the higher the ping, so my average ping is 70-90 on any server. I also noticed that there are constant lag spikes that are game breaking for solo players like myself. These lag spikes don't work like any other lag spikes where your last input is repeated for a few seconds then you see where you ended up after the spike is gone, no, during the lag spike the game registers that nothing else exists, no boat, no water, only the sea floor, so when you come out of it and get to see where you ended up, you're off your ship and hundreds of feet underwater AND you take fall damage. But those random lag spikes aren't the only lag you're gonna experience in this game, every time an enemy ship gets within the right distance, it loads the entire thing in at once (it should load in loot, and different ship details at different distances to make multiple smaller bumps instead of one large spike) so you get a guaranteed lag spike if you have a low-end pc. I've also noticed that there are problems with repairing your ship, like the fact that the rocking of your ship can bring the wall far enough away that it resets your repair timer. There's also other interaction options blocking your ability to repair holes, the repairing should have priority over picking up a chest. I'm also experiencing extreme frustration every time I fight a skeleton ship solo, because their aim is way too good and they can move faster than max speed forcing me to fight. they have killed me on my ship, with their cannons, without damaging the ship. They have kept me from shooting a single cannon shot for the entire fight because every time I get on the cannon they've already shot a cannonball straight at my cannon. All in all, the only reason I'm motivated enough to write a review this long is because I fucking love this game, and I want it to be fun for solo players to sail the seas and be completely immersed in the experience of feeling like a genuine pirate.  The only improvements I believe this game needs are: 1. change the way the servers work because they feel like they belong to some niche title made mostly for it's story, which this game is the exact opposite of, a billion dollar mmorpg so you could and should invest in more stable servers. 2. separate what is loaded in at what distance instead of having everything load in at once (have multiple small bumps instead of one big lag spike to reduce crashes), sometimes the lag spike of nearing or seeing another ship will crash my game at the worst time possible. 3. simply make skeleton ships less accurate but shoot a bit more frequently, that will make fights far more intense with more cannonballs flying, while also balancing them out, making more holes on galleons and less direct hits on solo players, it also lowers the chance that a skeleton ship will hit a player with multiple of the same cursed ball in a row (permanent sleep/drunk/raised sails is something that solo players can do nothing about, and you don't want moments that force a player to lose no matter how skilled). Sorry for the bad review, I don't believe this game deserves it, but I definitely won't give it a good review until it feels like I'm playing on high-end servers, without moments where I feel powerless to fight or run and I just have to accept my fate.

ps: I am hitting shots that should never hit because, with the way that the servers work, your view of an enemy player's position is just a very close estimate of where they actually are in-game. As a result you can do no damage on a direct hit and deal damage when hardly missing an enemy. how do you expect players to get good at your game if their understanding of how to play is getting mixed up by inconsistent game mechanics. fix your game already, 15 MILLION PLAYERS x $50 = $750M + MICROTRANSACTIONS, you can't say money is a problem, and if no one knows how to program better servers then it's time to hire new programmers.

Yet another side note: The lag is getting worse and worse the more players playing this game. New players beware the fucking 99999 ping. I keep trying my best to ignore the issues because the game play is fun but It's still a struggle to play the fucking game.",1597905462,1599740694,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198094327517,80,9,15607,242,15312,1601374347

Before it came out, and after it did, I would talk about how great it was to my friends and my family, and my brother, being the intelligent guy he is told me I probably liked the idea of the game more than the game itself. I've realized over time that he was right. The game came out to a horrible start. It truly was wide as an ocean and shallow as a puddle. I didn't care though. When I saw how the developers talked about the game in the videos they released regularly, I knew that their enthusiasm about the game was sincere. They really gave a shit about the project. So, instead of giving up right there, they kept working on it, and they fed off all of the hope and enthusiasm, people like me and the people who were still playing the game had and were sharing. It really was a terrible game, but I wouldn't let myself tell me that, because I knew that the developers had a drive to make the game great and that the game had a future.
They made a smart move and didn't release it on steam until it was a finished product (well not really finished, they're still going at it, but you know what i mean.) They basically got a second chance for a review, and instead of getting the 6 out of 10 review they started with and couldn't repair, now they have a 9/10 score on the platform people actually look at. I saw the hope in this game, and they carried through, buy the game.

Find yourself a good crew and this game is really,  REALLY enjoyable.   Solo play is also fun but you fear the sight of other ships.   

I have found there are a lot of players on the game who seem more interested in sinking other playes for the sheer pleasure of watching someone have a bad experiance in game.   I wish they would seperate out the PVP players from the ones who are only interested in the Tall tales,  fiching or merchant missions.   WE already have ghost ships,  Skeletons, Crackons and Meglodons to contend with.   I do NOT need other people killing me over a crate of snakes after I survived all that.  Most of the time the other players attacking do not even attept to see if you have anything worth taking before attacking.   

I HAVE started to find more experianced players who have taken the time to help guide me in the game.  They are a blessing and a God send.   Unfortunatly it took me two weeks of playing to start meeting these people.   Most Casual gamers are not as hard headed as I am and may leave the game perminatly if all they get is greifing from others.   My two cents.

It's got many of the elements you'd find in a VR experience, including a slower pace and moving objects around, but it's an endless grind. What's nicest about it is also the worst part: everything you work for is cosmetic. That said, your focus becomes the gameplay itself a bit more easily than in other games, but it's not very rewarding.

Personally, I get bored very quickly with this game and only bother with it when I have relatives that are already playing on their consoles and want me along. What is there to do, exactly? Steer the ship, fish along the way, look at a map or read a riddle, find a few boxes on an island, gradually fight skeletons, and sell your findings.

The game has a competitive mode of some kind, but I don't know why it exists. Every single thing you do has an atrocious cooldown time, and that includes something as simple as swinging your sword. Weapons need to reload after one shot, and that takes a terrible amount of time. It may not feel as bad for console users, but that in itself is kinda the problem for PC users.

All in all, this really isn't a bad game. It's just remarkably monotonous, and the sluggish gameplay doesn't help.",1599657380,1599657380,False,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False,76561198022568437,174,69,1377,0,1377,1599534361

60,75668705,english,"I would recommend the game but there are a couple issues as of writing this.
1: The only consistent way to spend your coin is cosmetics. Once you run out that's it, nothing left to spend money on.
2: There is no point to make it to pirate legend. Mostly because you'll only get more pointless work for cosmetics. Pirate legends have no special privilege. If you could get access to stuff like the ability to buy a storage crate with like 50 planks, 50 canon balls and ten of five different fruit for a decent fee at the start of every game, and maybe you could buy a rowboat at the start of every game too, being pirate legend would be worth it not because it's an advantage, but a PRIVILEGE. So unfortunately there is little to do other than mindlessly gather and sell treasure. But a solution could be...

Solution 1: Add special privileges like make the black market archives exclusive to legends. The ability to buy previously limited-time cosmetics shouldn't be for just anyone!
Solution 2: Add alternatives to selling treasure for gold. Perhaps instead certain treasure can earn you certain privileges if you don't sell them.
Solution 3: Add more ways to spend gold that are also optional but very useful if you have the coin. These wouldn't be crazy advantages but instead worthwhile privileges.
And so on and so fourth...

In general, the co-op elements and the sailing work very well. Some people complain about the PvP, I didn't find it too bad, but sometimes you will find your ship sunk when on an island for a quest. Most players are not friendly in my experience. 

The main issue I have is that all the quests and main activity within the game revolves around repetitive fetch quests. The tall tales are essentially multi-step fetch quests, the guild progression is extremely repetitive. There are no interesting items to find or unlock, just cosmetic skins for everything.

I keep playing with strangers and so far it was really fun. Only cons are server issues and some bugs. Sometimes me or my crew has to restart due to minor but annoying bugs or sudden dcs but we can't join back. It seems this problem is around for years now, I wish they would fix it already. If you are in mid of delivering an item, prey to god that you don't dc.
Other than that It's perfect. I'm addicted to steering my ship.

My advice to new players:
This is the Sea of Thieves, don't trust anyone. Even if you form an alliance don't let anyone near your ship. 
Don't expect people to be friendly or forgiving. You gotta learn how to avoid fights and play defensive. 
If you don't have enough friends, don't rush to sail with bigger ships, Sloop is godlike. Sloop is life.
There are no skillpoints in this game, you get better yourself and that's what I love. So every battle will teach you something new or show you what you have been doing wrong. You will sink a lot.
You can learn it all by yourself but there is no harm on watching and learning some tips. I learned so many stuff by watching players like PhuzzyBond everytime I'm in bathroom.

87,75542872,english,"I can say after a short playtime that I've had more fun with Sea of Thieves than I've had with a lot of other games. There are so many moments in this game that make me genuinely smile. The game is not by any means complicated, but it doesn't hold your hand and tell you what to do or how to go about it. You end up discovering little things that make it so much better.
Pros:
- Easy to get into gameplay that has a lot of tricks you will discover along the way
- Pretty immersive, you really feel like a sailor when you adjust the rigging on your ship
- Lends itself well to playing with friends, good teamwork game
- Gorgeous graphics and cartoony art style that will age well
- Lots of exploration, however I will come back to this point
- All navigation is done by hand with a map in your ship, sometimes you get a picture of an island and you have to go find that island. It seemed clunky but I actually enjoy the lack of any kind of quest markers or anything
- Permanent progression in the form of being able to ante up and take bigger, higher-paying jobs
- PvP is purely skill and teamwork based as there are no upgraded weapons or ships, only cosmetic skins to unlock (however if you're looking for an RPG with character power progression this may not be for you)
Cons: 
- This game does have a cosmetic-only cash shop. From what I have seen so far, Pets (which are just cute little companions that can follow you around) are exclusive to the cash shop. 
- 90% of the time if you see a player ship, especially a bigger one, your best bet is to just run away. This isn't the game's fault, obviously, but kind of a bummer none the less
- Quests are not persistent between play sessions. Not a huge deal, but the level 4 ones have been taking me roughly an hour to complete (by myself) and it would be nice to be able to take a break more frequently than that. 
- (From what I have seen so far) fixed map. So once you've seen every island, that's it. Not a big deal though because the non-story quests are randomly generated and a bit different every time.

Sea of Thieves is an engaging ""Rust"" themed game made for people who prefer the pirate life of ""riches"" over the survivor life of ""dominance"". The core of the game is to collect various items and bring them to various merchants residing on Outposts. In return the player receives rewards ranging from Gold all the way to Reaper coins. As it is centered around ""piracy"" and sea, a ship is your best friend and controlling one, while defending yourself from enemies, is close to impossible on your own. A crew of friends is, while not mandatory, [b]highly recommended[/b], as playing with random people may not always work out.

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ Vast and incredibly detailed open world, the sea, islands, waves, sun are all incredibly well-made. The world does a fantastic job of ""sucking"" you in, from making you feel calm and relaxed while sailing in quiet seas, to keeping you on your toes during heavy thunderstorms and ocean full of waves in the middle of the dark, cold ""unwelcoming"" night.
+ In-Game events ranging from deep sea battles with Flameheart's endless platoon of Ghost ships, to a mad fight for survival in inky territory with the ancient creature known as ""The Kraken"", these events give out the most amount of rewards for those daring to complete them.
+ Talltales serve as a sort of ""Story"" mode for Sea of Thieves. They are easier than previously mentioned events, however they do pay out less and usually take longer to complete. I still recommend doing them though, as they do form a relatively interesing story.
+ Great element of freedom, as soon as you log in you are free to sail the endless Sea of Thieves and explore at your own will.
+ Features Cross-play between PC and Xbox, thus unifying a bigger player base together.
+ Beautiful art style that doesn't require a monster PC, while still looking extremely solid even in 2020.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- Completing a hard, frustrating event and collecting the treasure doesn't mean keeping it, you are in constant danger of enemy ships. They can attack at anytime and just like that steal all the loot you have potentially spent a long time collecting. That's where the ""Rust"" feel comes from.
- Bosses of events and talltales can be quite ""annoying"" sometimes, as they have a [b]huge[/b] amount of health and it can very well take you 30+ minutes to defeat them.
- The close quarters combat is very ""primitive"", you either swing your sword in light and heavy attack or use one of your firearms to shoot at enemy players.

[b]Neutral:[/b]
* The Steam version of the game still requires a Microsoft account in order to sign in. Many people report that the ""Xbox app"" on Windows 10 is required when playing Sea of Thieves, but that is not actually true, it seems like the game uses it, but if you have deleted the app from your OS like me, you would be surprised that the game actually works completely fine without it. You still log in to a MS account but that's it, afterwards you play as normal, you just invite your friends via their MS account names, not via Steam's invite system.
* Microtransactions are also a thing in this game, you use the currency you buy with real money to purchase cosmetics like emotes, pets etc. The reason I classify this as a neutral feature is because I personally prefer these types of games to be completely equal in terms of ships, weapons, upgrades etc. This game has no upgrade system, nor special weapons and ships everything you buy with real money is cosmetics. Many people like that, many dislike it. Up to you to decide.

[b]Opinion:[/b]
Sea of Thieves is the type of game you play for fun, while chatting with friends. No competitive vibes here, just sailing in a beautiful open world that can be as easy and friendly as you want, or as hard and tedious as you want. My final score is [b]8/10[/b], as for me the pros far outweigh the cons. It's even more worth it if you buy the game on sale !",1599343459,1599385740,True,2,0,0.525146782398223877,2,True,False,False,76561198042690571,770,11,3108,0,3108,1599337255

29,72452271,english,"Honestly, i tried. Again and Again. My Father and both brothers got it so we may all play it. And we tried. Played a few nights together. And I think its because it was a more expensive game we were too stubborn to admit we weren't having fun.

But we were not. It is not fun. Im not going to sit here and complain about every little thing. Thats not the point. This is a warning to players like me.

Does the game do good? Of course it does. However, it does only enough good to smooth out the rest of the bad stuff to leave you with just a feeling of a disappointing waste of time and a bad taste in your mouth.

The game is stressful, the community is toxic, and we are constantly enticed and incentivized to PvE which is immediately dashed by another player for no significant reason other than ""its a PvP game"". 

Then this game needs to stop pretending that it is something that it is not. There is a PvP zone. There is a PvE zone. And the PvE zone has more PvP in it than PvE. Its a game that breeds and encourages trolls. Its not a fun environment at all unless you have that mentality. Which is not a good mentality to have in life really. The developers claim to encourage a ""pirates code"", but its literally a piece of paper on the wall of the tavern. There is nothing to encourage any kind of behavior other than being an intolerable prick that is willing to attack small ships, that are doing story quests, with all of the ""community approved"" signs of peace, just because you can. The thought of fighting off other players is fun. The ship battles are dynamic and exciting. But not when they happen every ten minutes. Even when you do everything to show you dont want to fight.

I bought this game because i wanted to have fun. But i made the mistake of buying a ""mainstream"" game yet again.

So with that said, the four of us are never going to play this again. not unless this game makes a huge push to allow for strict PvE content as well as its PvP. (which can be fun at times.) we had a long and calm discussion of the pros and cons this evening after we initially quit out of frustration.

This is probably the first refund on Steam i can think of for a game i have ever requested. I know i am way beyond the time, but i wanted to at least try. It truly was that bad of an experience for us.

So, as i said, this is a warning. If you like PvE, Doing quests uninterrupted, or have a 'general' distaste for PvP, you will not enjoy this game.

EDIT: 9/5/2020:
While my review for the main game remains the same and unchanged, i have found small beacons of hope for players like me. I found a PvE focused Discord group that sets up entire fleets to work together in PvE content. They are called Athena's Vanguard. They are polite, well organized and i have had good experiences with everyone i have played with. While this helps me, and players like me, my view of the main game remains as i feel these are things the official game should be able to allow for this a little better.",1594406125,1599309978,False,12,3,0.567416191101074219,0,True,False,False,76561198028073279,128,3,2367,0,1550,1599436594

I hope they add more chapters and expand the interesting lore of the game.

SoT is a rage-quiters nightmare.

The game itself, esp the water / sailing effects are beautiful. The problem arises in 2 areas...

1. Other players: Now, the player count (ATM) is low; your chance of encountering another player is slim. But. (9 /10 times) the other player will be hostile. WHY?? I dont know. And dont care.

2. The ""save"" system is, in a word, re-tarded.

See, in order to get to these 'NEW"" areas one must do the Shoudbreaker quest. The quest itself is fine and fun but....there's a catch...


See...once you have the ""shroudbreaker"" if you get disconnected or log off...it goes *POOF* and you have to complete the ( I assume) last subquest to get it again.

This is just stupid.


SoT is a fantastic idea that is poorly implemented.

The game is really fun. I like the little puzzles (riddles) in that game where you need to think what you need to do with a paper of text. It has some nice surprises like [spoiler] kraken [/spoiler] can just appear from the water :D. I just like the game.

We spot a Sloop in the distance, which hasn't moved in a while 
We decide to leave it alone for now, since it isn't doing us any harm
Suddenly, we spot a mermaid in the water, which means players are far from their own ship
We check our ladders, and sure enough, on both sides, 2 dudes are clinged on
We start fighting and manage to kill them
The dudes try to come back again, and are really toxic, so we chase their ship for a bit
The Galleon is much slower than the Sloop because of its size, so its hard to catch up
I come up with a plan to launch 1 person at a time in attempt to try to get onto their ship and lower the anchor
After a few failed attempts, I finally manage to lower the anchor and we fight
We sink their ship after a long battle (The dudes were more experienced but we had the numbers)
They are incredibly mad at us for fighting in a group of 4, despite them provoking us first
We go back to farming stuff via quests and minding our own business, when we spot a Sloop in the distance
We are near an island, so we brace for impact
The ship collides with ours and sure enough its the same dudes screaming through their mics
I decide to distract them by lobbing fire bombs at their ship, so instead of attacking us they go to put it out
They are too late, and their ship sinks, but not before they can get a few more insults at us through their mics
We never saw them again, but it was incredibly funny and intense, and made the game worth it for me

26,73914799,english,"Spent the better part of a month repeatedly downloading and reinstalling this game following a myriad of troubleshooting steps to get this game to work; has not once launched successfully.  Even followed the steps that no respectable company would try to force on Users by so badly designing their application's compatibility (disabling antivirus to play, only installing on C drive because their internal file paths are probably absolute instead of relative, etc).

When none of that worked, raised the issue with Support, and the ticket was marked as ""Solved"" before they even contacted me.  They used the resolution mechanic of their ticketing system to send me the email with what they wanted me to try.  Of course nothing they sent worked, some of it was even pulled from the list of troubleshooting steps I told them I'd already tried, but at least I got the pleasure of downloading the 50GB install for a 6th time.

I've turned one last ticket in to their Support Site, and if it works, fine; if not, also fine, as long as I can get refunded.  I'm kinda past the point of marking this as something I'd recommend, even to my enemies, but if they do at least get it working I'll update this with a slightly less negative tilt.

EDIT:  Second ticket marked ""solved"" before they contacted me again, but this was expected.  Half of the recommended troubleshooting steps they sent in the ""how was the support you received?"" email were steps they had recommended on the previous ticket (gave them the first ticket number in the second ticket, but of course why would they even glance at that), and the other half of the troubleshooting steps were to fix download errors in the Microsoft Store downloading process....unfortunately for me, this is neither a download error, nor from the Microsoft Store.

Going after a refund, but Steam policy did mention that refunds are usually not granted after 14 days; sorry, but if the thing is 50GB and they tell you to reinstall it 6 different ways to try to address the issue, it'll take some people more than 14 days to try to make it work...fingers crossed...

FINAL EDIT:  But of course!  No refunds after 14 days, no matter that it takes a month just to run through the recommended troubleshooting including 6 repeated downloads of the 50GB of game files, or that the game not once successfully launched.  Maybe it's like the ""line ride"" at the crappiest state fair ever, and all that garbage I was doing with support WAS the game?  Regardless, well played Microsoft.  You can crap in a box, call it a game, charge 40 bucks, and as long as the game files are so massive you're safe from refund requests from people unfortunate enough not to have fiber optic internet service.

PROS:
Sea of Thieves is visually appealing.  You'll never find better looking water, nor a ship that handles quite as wonderfully.  Sound design is professionally handled, from thrumb of your cannons right down to the smallest insect chirping.  It's a world you can easily become immersed in.  Even if you don't get to design the starting look of your pirate, there is more than enough customization to truly make your character feel like your own, even if they are just ""borrowed.""  If I was IGN this game would get a 10 from the sole fact that it was gorgeous to look at and brilliant to live in...

CONS:
...But I'm not IGN, and this game has issues.  Lots of them.  Sea of Thieves is the ultimate time waster in a number of ways.  Since PVP isn't something you can opt into/out of, your average experience will be investing hours of time hunting for treasure, tackling bosses, raiding fortresses, only for another band of players to skulk along after you've done all the hard work and take it all away in seconds. This is a REGULARLY OCCURING thing, and in my opinion hurts the game far more than it helps.  I understand that this is a core concept of the game, but it doesn't change the fact that no matter what kind of gamer you are, having your time investment amount to absolutely nothing is just not fun.

Aside from the glaring pvp issue, the game has numerous technical issues.  Frames skip regularly, rubber-banding and teleporting are common occurances.  The game looks amazing, but it clearly can't handle its own beauty.  

CONCLUSION:
The game is in dire need of some work under the hood, as well as the option to opt out of open world pvp.  I'd feel more comfortable recommending this game if it didn't have such an astounding knack for wasting precious time and energy.  But as it stands it takes far too much effort to have a fun time in Sea of Thieves, compared to how little effort it takes for that fun to be ruined.

54,75337343,english,"Initially bought this game for my 12 yr old daughter. We both absolutely love Sea of Thieves now.  Mainly for the sense of exploration and how detailed it is when sailing your ship across the ocean.  Working together on the ship while keeping an eye out for other players, the actual ship combat, and pvp is freakin great and so much fun.  LOVE the sound effects, weather and storms, the night and day change, the music is so well done and matches every situation you find yourself in.  Graphically I think the game is gorgeous especially when out in the ocean.  LOVE the use of all the equipment (compass, maps, spyglass, bucket, mugs) and love how you can grab an instrument and play.

The only ""complaint"" I would have is...  treasure you find seems to be ONLY to hand in and gain reputation points (which is definitely fun BUT) - would be nice if we could also find an occasional vanity related item (rare skin for example) OR making SLIGHT changes to pvp and allowing padded armor (to raise protection from gun fire or swords just a bit) or maybe weapons that do just a bit more damage than normal.  Nothing crazy.  I'm talking like 5% at the most?  Decorative items for the ship maybe?  Just to make treasure hunting a bit more fun and hopeful.  Definitely NOT a real complaint at all.

72,70539962,english,"Let me tell you a tale; a tale of old that sea dogs told 'bout an accidental alliance between pirates at sea, and a fleet that came forth worthy enough to challenge Flameheart himself.

The tale begins with two adventurers, in this case two crews allied with each other since long ago. The alliance consisted of two ships full of honest pirates, both commanded by officers who knew not of what they were doing. Commodore T. William of the [i]Sea Dragon[/i], a formidable Brigantine crewed only by the finest men; Ensigns G. Kitsu and K. Sikil. The other mighty vessel was the [i]Roaring Anglerfish[/i], a sloop agile and hardy enough to out-maneuver any vessels who dare to get in its way; commanded by Captain I. Kristofer and his first-mate M. Reccing.

Our alliance traveled across the Sea of Thieves in search for adventure and treasures of left behind long ago by pirate legends long before us. For nights and days we sailed across the seas. Then one day, there it was! A dark, mysterious cloud in the sky in resemblance of a ship. The two ships set course for the mysterious cloud and stood by waiting for whoever, or whatever, is waiting for them. Waves splish and splash across the hull of both ships, water poured in through the top deck, the Wilds was no happy and peaceful place! It's waves almost felt like they were about to tear the ships to pieces and leave our pirates to meet their fates on the Ferry of the Damned.

Then there it was before them, a lone sloop sailing in the middle of sea just where they needed to go. Hesitation arisen and many believed that this sloop would be filled with cut-throat pirates! But before anyone could take action, there it was, monstrous vessels of legend, vessels with the appearance of death, ships began rising up from the sea below as if ships sunken from years past were spat back out from the locker. Never have they seen anything like this. Ships emerging from the depths below, crewed by what seems to be a skeleton crew. No, not a skeleton crew as in a minimum amount of personnel needed to run a ship, but a literal crew of cursed, walking, living and breathing rags and bones, nasty things. Maybe not the last two, though. 

The battle was gruesome. Cannonballs exchanged left and right, holes were placed across their ships. How can you possibly sink something that [i]came[/i] from the waters? The skeleton sloops were easy to dispatch due to their nimble and fragile hulls, however the large skeleton galleon? There's absolutely no way they could take that out! They were outnumbered and outgunned. Then it happened, the brave commodore and captain orchestrated a plan to take out the final galleon one last pathetic barrage of cannonballs pointed towards the galleon, they only needed to put at least one or two holes in it for this to work. heroicly, they both jumped off their respective command ships and boarded the hostile galleon. It was absolutely horrific. Skeletons emerged from the floorboards, bones rattling, swords slicing, and blunderbusts blundering. The two pirates fought bravely against the horde of seemingly never-ending skeletons on the galleon and finally they only needed one more hole to finally sink the damned ship. The Dragon and the Anglerfish were both far too far away to do anything effective, and the time it'll take for them to get in range could mean life or death. Then the unexpected happened, cannonballs shot coming in from the starboard of the galleon. It was them, the sloop from before with its sails dropped down and displaying a large, gaping maw of a shark. The final shot needed to take out the wretched ship from the depths, and there it went down back into the abyss where it game from. While it sunk, it left behind mystical treasures and mysterious skulls. Gems taken from the cursed merfolk, skulls of the captains who used to serve on-board, and good old gold and doubloons. 

The sloop introduced themselves, they were the Gaping Maw, hunters of the legendary Shrouded Ghost; a great, giant shark only told in legends, whether it exists or not still left a mystery to most. Our initial alliance offered them to join, they needed fine pirates to travel in their journeys. Once offered, the crew of the Gaping Maw agreed to ally themselves. There, a mighty fleet was formed.

It wasn't over. At a nearby island not far from where they were, the skies turned red and the winds turned warm. They saw a tower of ash and wind looming over them. What did our adventurers do, you ask? They did what any rational pirate would do. Set sail towards the obviously dangerous threat! Arriving at the island that sourced the ashen winds they meet a man. But he was no man, nor was he merfolk. Dead he was not, neither was he alive. He donned a large overcoat and a mighty fine cutlass, his red skeleton structure radiated heat around him. His name was Captain Grimm. Is he why the undead emerged with their ships before? Doesn't matter. The time for talk is none, the skeleton captain was in no mood to talk. The battle was heated, figuratively and literally, and our pirates feared that this may be their last. Captain Grimm was a talkative one, said something about Ashen Lords or whatever, dunno. He took no notice, didn't even flinch, to any damage done to him. Cutlass slashes were shrugged off, so were bullets from flintlocks.

However, hope was not yet lost. Our pirates continued to fight and strive for victory against this evil foe. Could this have been an Ashen Lord? They thought that was merely a legend. The crews fought tooth and nail against the evil skeleton captain and his hordes of undead. Finally, Commodore William dealt the final blow on Captain Grimm with his trusty cutlass. He was defeated, however not killed. The skeleton captain vanished into thin ash to not be seen again. Our pirates won the battle, but something told them that this was not yet over. What of Flameheart? 

Unfortunately that is where this action-filled tale ends. The Sea of Thieves is a wonderful place full of excitement, adventure, and stories to tell. Take on the pirate's life and set course for the Sea of Thieves, where rare treasure and riches are vast, from pirate legends in the past. Share a voyage with a faithful crew, and call to sail the ocean blue.",1591715182,1599017269,True,3,0,0.570707082748413086,2,True,False,False,76561198079382471,138,63,7109,614,6233,1601365361

if you ask me ""describe the game"" ill say, ""this game has flourished into a class of it's own""

This game is amazing, the graphics are beautiful, and the tasks available are very entertaining.

It was night, and I was heading to a nearby outpost, with my first booty. I come across a brig, behind a rock. My heart jumps, I start to panic, but, then in chat the captain says;

""ahoy there""

""all ok?""

""all good"" I reply. 

I feel so relieved, We head into the same outpost together, and hand in our booty. Then, without goodbye, they leave as quickly as they came. 

What I love about this game is that everyone/ thing is balanced, everybody can access the same weapon, the same ship etc. the only thing different is cosmetics. 

By completing adventures and handing in chests/ items, you level up your reputation with the three guilds (which allows you to earn more gold and cosmetics). With gold, you can also buy new quests, that earn you more money, and also give an interesting adventure. (I have not tried these out, I just noticed them). There is also free adventures available, but they earn you very little amounts of money and are relatively bland after some time goes by.

 The graphics are aced, and the time it takes to cross to areas on the map are not to long, and not to short. I wish you could hold more ammo, but that would take inventory space, and maybe more food. (you can hold 10 cannon balls but only 5 bananas?)

My first experience was amazing and I love it. my only 2 complaints is the inventory wheel which you press, which then allows you to hold your weapons/ equipment. It feels strange to use. I have never used something like it, and I will probably learn quickly., and also the anchor time, it takes way to long to drop Anchor (not raise it that is aced). Perhaps, the time it takes to drop anchor could be dependent on the depth of the water. 
Also, seeing graphics for the chain and anchor in the water would be nice (it is the little details that count).


Graphics: A*
speed/ frames: b-
gameplay: A
idea implementation: A
PVP: (no experience so far)
PVE: B+ (enjoy killing the skellies, but there is a lot more than that)

I would recommend this game 100%

It's a great game, and its really fun, especially if you have friends to play it with, however; the toxicity can be a struggle, but thats just pvp for you. Once I got into the game after the tutorial, it was just me on a little sloop only had 30 minutes at the time, immediately being hunted down by a Brig, and a Galleon. I didn't have treasure, I had just started the game, I didn't know what I was doing, or how to do it. Yet these people chased me across the map, yet I had the wind in my sales, and was faster than them. 

Suddenly, the wind changed direction, I had lost the speed, there were ghost ships ahead of me, and I was still being chased; I tried to escape around a large rock, but was cut off by the galleon. They boarded my ship, two started attacking me, while the other two were lighting my ship on fire, and firing the cannons. I had no treasure, and I was alone, I didn't understand why they were after me. Thats when they finally spoke up.

""You're trash at this game, ___!"" - ""I bet your mom is a ______."" - ""Killing noobs like you is the best part of this game!"" - You get the point.

They were clearly suffering from mental issues, so I didn't use my mic to talk back, I just let myself go down with the ship, as a good captain does. However, I vowed to get my revenge, even if I must do it from the depths of Davy Jones Locker. I respawned with my ship, and immediately got to work, I hunted down loot with a stranger that joined me, and together we made some money. I bought an outfit, because I needed to look the part.

I had seen the same Galleon hunting down one of the new Ashen Winds skeleton lords. Together with my shipmate, we sailed towards them, and found their ship undefended, as they were fighting. We waited for a while, out of sight, our ship hidden behind an outcropping of some rocks. We let the fight go on for a while, before we lit their Galleon on fire, and sunk it to the depths like they had done to me. Once they had all died from the Lord, and respawned wherever their ship was. We went in and finished off the lord, and took all the loot to the furthest outpost we could find on the map, to lower the risk of the Galleon finding us. 

We got plenty of good loot, and made lots of money. All in all, for my first 4 hours of pirate adventures, I'd say it was absolutely amazing. You should get this game, and maybe we'll sail the seas together, or I'll sink you to the depths of Davy Jones with my Sloop.",1596817549,1598893637,True,251,76,0.910735785961151123,9,True,False,False,76561198333538094,78,3,1172,0,298,1597071287

There's plenty to do, whether it's deciphering riddles to find treasure or running bounty missions or even just sailing around and looking for visual clues to sunken treasure. It's all about getting that loot. The cartoony visuals are refreshing and fun and the sea itself looks amazing. 
My only issue is how hostile the in game playerbase is. Yeah i know it's a game about Pirates, murder and theft but even then you'd expect to meet another player at a outpost and be able to share a grog and do a jig. 22 hours in and every player i've came across is instantly hostile, whether it's a group that's spotted your ship then chases after you for 10 straight minutes who then go on to linger around your ship to keep killing you when you respawn to having players sneak up behind you at outposts and blast you to death for no other reason than that they can. 

It's definitely a great game and even though i have my frustrations i personally chose to sail alone.

57,75196380,english,"Sea of Thieves has easily become one of my most played games in its short amount of time being on steam. The two main modes in this game are adventure and arena. Adventure is the main mode of the game which has open world while arena is a mainly pvp mode. All my time was spent in adventure and I have only played one or two rounds of arena because no one plays it. It took me about two months of playing to hit pirate legend, which is the main goal in the game that you achieve by hitting level 50 with the three main factions, the gold hoarders, the order of souls, and the trade merchants. This can be achieved much faster if you wanted to grind. Although I focused on the Tall Tales and just having fun, I barely had to grind to hit pirate legend.

This game primarily shines with friends although there is a way you can play with a random crew, which often either puts you with a crew without mics who are all doing different things or a crew who has mics and will be a good time playing with. Being an online game you are going to meet some toxic people, especially with there being pvp and voice chat. The toxicity in this game isn't as bad as others but can still get bad. With that being said the experiences in this game are like no other. Such as the time my crew were going to sink a sloop with another brigantine there but all forming an alliance and getting onto one ship to practically from an 8 man crew. Or the time my crew and another brigantine that we had an alliance with got a toxic galleon almost sandwiched between us and blasted away at them until they sank, which felt like a scene straight out of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

I highly recommend this game especially with friends. The memories you make and experiences you have together are well worth the $40 price tag.

Pretty to look at.

The gear you start with is the gear you end with. No pay to win or veteran advantage in gear.

There are plenty of different things to do.

Great when you have a few friends to play with.

Cons
Can be grindy if you care about being a pirate legend.

The skeleton ships can have absurd agility, speed, and insane accuracy making facing a galleon damn near impossible alone.

You need to restock your ship every time you start playing making the first 10 to 20 minutes just annoying.

Can't continue missions when you log back in. ( I understand it can mean some people exploiting it to avoid losing treasure, but I feel like there can be a compromise somewhere.)

It doesn't look like there is really any reason to become a pirate legend. Like you can have rewards that don't provide unfair advantages like an Island where you can store stuff for your ship.

You have to leave the game if you want to change ships losing all progress you have done that session and needing to restock your ship.

42,74964720,english,"Sea of Thieves is overwhelmed with PvP at the moment. If you're planning on buying the game to enjoy its PvE content, you'll soon realize many players have played the game for so long they are only looking for PvP at this point. And they will lead you into a fight no matter what your intent is. They can't take no for an answer, so you will be insulted countless times just because you're here when they are. They will be very creative at making your experience terrible for their own enjoyment, it's pretty rare that they'll just take your loot (if any) then leave without pushing it further for 15+ minutes. Most likely they'll sink your ship and kill you repeatedly, even though it serves no purpose besides wasting your time. The community is toxic beyond belief and their ""debate"" over private servers is yet another proof.

The game itself is very immersive, with gorgeous graphics and ambiences, awesome characters & ships design, and most of the PvE content is enjoyable even in solo... It's not too casual yet not too hard, though you'll definitely need a good team to unlock what this game has to offer. Menus are confusing at first but you get used to them pretty quickly. To be honest I'd be 100% recommending this game if the players base was not so despicable. I've not met anyone friendly in 40+ hours of gameplay (and I truly mean NOT ONCE), despite what some people might say. I don't mind PvP every now and then but I despise toxic communities, and this one is the worst I've seen by far, over nearly 25 years of gaming. I cannot recommend this game to new players: mixing PvP and PvE together isn't a terrible idea, but right now people are playing this game as if it was just another team-based competitive FPS, and you can't really enjoy PvE with that many bullies and trolls around...

I've given this game a chance (twice), and I still enjoy its content and gameplay very much, yet I uninstalled it again and I'm considering asking for a refund because toxic players can't even understand when they're going too far. I feel like people are asking for private servers mostly to avoid toxic players at this point (not just for roleplay with rewards disabled), and I cannot blame them for asking that much. This shouldn't happen. What a shame for such an amazing game...

EDIT: Anyone complaining about toxic PvP players in their review are receiving tons of judgemental comments, which (again) proves how toxic this community is. Just browse through negative reviews (sometimes even positive ones) and see for yourself! Besides trolls and fake reviews this topic is present in almost every single review. The same guys that are bullying players in the game are finding cheap excuses for their toxic behavior in the comments around here. No good will ever come from such community until PvP is somehow restricted, and toxic players are effectively removed. I don't believe this is happening anytime soon, I've watched pro players streaming SoT ever since release and even though they're nearly unbeatable at the game, they're still annoyed by all these toxic behaviors.

Go to https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Settings?

Sea of Thieves is a multiplayer game where you join a crew that's normally 3-4 players in size. 

You do a variety of quests although the large majority are ""Go to this island, dig on the X, get a treasure chest, and bring it back to sell""  Every other crew is doing the exact same thing, so whether you attack other ships and steal their loot or you find loot yourself is up to you. 

[b]Keep in mind you can spend over an hour finding loot only to be attacked and lose it all in an instant *feels like Rust*[/b]

[b]The Good:[/b]
+ Very social game, everyone is expected to talk in-game and communicate with one another 
+ Cross-play between Xbox
+ Team-oriented and great fun co-op gameplay
+ BEAUTIFUL world, they did an absolutely wonderful job on creating an amazing sea with a variety of tides
+ Open world and somewhat of a ""create your own adventure"" as you and your crew set out at your own pace
+ The voyages (Quests) allow the players to figure things out on their own. I particularly like that it doesn't ""hand-hold"" the player when it comes to directions and figuring out what to do or where to find buried treasure. You actually have to map out your surroundings, use the compass to orientate yourself, and coordinate where your ship is going.
+ The ship battles are pretty fun, shooting cannon balls across the water trying to sink another ship before they sink you. Bailing out water, patching holes, etc. All in real-time with multiple people working together on your ship.
+ Interesting world events and more elaborate quests


[b]The Bad:[/b]
- VERY Poor integration with Steam. You can NOT invite friends on steam to join you. You must use the ""Xbox Companion App"" and create an Xbox Live account and add friends. 
- No in-game ""friends-list"" or messaging system. Again it just makes it very hard to add people  or message people when its all done through Xbox and not through Steam.
- Can-be ""Toxic"" community. Sometimes a huge ship with a larger group of players will just circle around blowing up every ship it sees. Sometimes people will just hide out and wait at ports so when you come back to sell your stuff they ambush you and steal all your hard earned loot. (again like ""Rust"" you sometimes lose A LOT of progress, especially considering this game can take hours to gather loot and complete quests)
- The close-combat system is pretty lame, mainly just swinging a short sword willy-nilly hoping you hit them more than they hit you.
- To make things fair, the gold you earn is only used for cosmetic purchases. This leads to a feeling of ""what's the point"" or ""why am I doing this?"" I would have liked to have seen some sort of upgrade system or a more meaningful progression system, 
- Microtransactions... On a $40 game....    


[b]Overall:[/b]
Definitely a great game to play with friends or other people who want more social interaction. Its the type of game where you can EASILY sink 4+ hours into in a single day and feel like time just flew by. The world is beautiful, and theres always a sense of danger with enemy players around which adds to the ""thrill"".  I do think $40 is way too high for a game like this though, so I would recommend waiting for a sale.",1596534663,1598464185,True,145,6,0.681041061878204346,15,True,False,False,76561198020125851,14329,802,2753,0,2231,1599899395

My biggest gripe with this game is how boring the event bosses are, especially the Ashen Lords. The boss it self is pretty fun. They have a variety of attacks, fun (but repetitive) dialogue, but one major flaw break me: HP. They have so much HP it felt like our hp is tiny compare to them, it's almost game-breaking in my opinion. And yes, if you're wondering, I did write this review because I got my ass handed to me by the Ashen Lord. I usually don't mind this, as bosses are suppose to be difficult. But, this one is not difficult, it's tedious.

Oh you thought it was over? No.

Who in Rare decide to not let people join their friends mid-session? It's just plain stupid, I don't have anymore word for it. This is not some match where's there's a beginning and end, you play until you get tired, or in SoT case, until your friends wants to play with you.

I'm getting bored writing this. So yeah, if you want to get it, get it. but don't expect to do any events solo unless you're GAMERGOD88. Thanks.",1598457354,1598457354,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198115280717,125,4,2925,1,2134,1601992249

51,74916853,english,"The game has so much to do that it's staggering. Fighting players, battling it out with NPC skeletons, captains, and their ships, Captain Flameheart and his massive ghost ship fleet, there's the fleet with several skeleton ships to fight with plenty of rewarding loot (when you have the time to grab it), megalodons, the Kraken, ashen lords, tall tales, reaper's chests (you'll find some player combat surely if you have one aboard), skeleton forts, and more. Not to mention the fact that you can become an emissary for pretty much all factions for more rewards from doing voyages and digging up loot on the islands on the massive map. The player interactions are, four times out of five, more toxic than botulinum toxin, but that makes the game more interesting.

From a solo standpoint, the game is difficult, as it should be, a solo pirate should not get too far without a crew. With a full Galleon, however, I got 70k coins from just messing around with my friends and destroying player ships, the fleet, and getting reaper chests, all gained within a few hours (IN AN OPEN CREW, NO LESS!). I didn't even get too angry when we lost a ship with an estimated 20k coins worth of loot, because the coins don't buy much except for cosmetics, and it was fun getting the loot in the first place. (We ended up taking the loot back from the people that stole it from us but still, I wasn't even mad at the time.)

Overall, a great game with more toxic than wholesome players, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The occasional wholesome friendly group or solo slooper is heartwarming, and toxic encounters are engaging and give the game character.

This is the first game I spent money on in an in-game purchase, (for a pet because why not), and sure it was a waste of ten bucks, but now I have a cute little birdy boy on my adventures.

75,71003258,english,"UPDATE ~ I have nearly 300 hours in this game now, and I still love it just the same!

Sea of Thieves is a satisfying adrenaline rush and surprisingly balanced if you enjoy PvP.

I'm always on the lookout for new co-op games on Steam. When Sea of Thieves popped up, I mentioned it to a few friends and one of them was ecstatic. He insisted that I get it ASAP so we could play together. I'm so glad I did. Within the first 10 hours, this became one of my favorite co-op games.

Things started out a bit rocky. My boyfriend and I simultaneously booted up the tutorial. After I beached and un-beached my ship, I shambled through the rest of the tutorial on my end, a little concerned about whether or not I'd ever handle the multitasking that's required to be an effective pirate in this game. Soon after, our good friend joined us and I went into full-on panic mode. There are other players? Right now?! All around us?!!?! I knew there was a PvP element, but I thought we were playing a private game and that we'd be able to do that in the future.

It wasn't long until we were raided by another ship, and it was definitely just for lulz. The three of us were at an outpost with zero loot. It wasn't long until it was over, however, and as we watched their ship sink and I came down from the stress, I grinned. [i]That felt amazing.[/i]

I never envisioned getting so hyped about PvP. I avoid most PvP anymore because of cheating and toxic communities, but Sea of Thieves does it quite well and I've had, so far, a very fair experience. While I've lost some battles, I've never felt that something was unreasonable. I've had people cuss me out for swiping their loot, killing them, etc. If I could offer any advice to a new player, it's [b]learn to pay attention to your surroundings as much as possible.[/b]

This isn't a game where absolutely anyone can easily sneak up on you without you having ample time to do something about it, and this isn't a game where people are required to leave you alone. If you decide to stop at an outpost to sell your loot when you see a player ship in the distance, then you're setting yourself up as a target. If you truly feel a player is harassing you, scuttle your ship and spawn somewhere else. With almost 60 hours in this game now (now well over 100 as of June 30. 2020), though, I really have a hard time wrapping my head around just how people feel like they can't get away from other players. The only thing I can conclude is that they're just not paying enough attention to what's around them.

I've played on all three ships now by myself and with a team of friends. If you're solo, the sloop is fast enough to outrun any ship against the wind. It's actually very easy to completely avoid other players on it if that's your jam. The brig and galleon add the thrill of teamwork and communication. As with any PvP game, Sea of Thieves is not without its toxic players. This is honestly why I primarily play solo or with friends because I just don't personally enjoy teaming up with random people. I've met nice players, trolls, and jerks, and it's really nothing different from any other PvP experience in my opinion.

The rewards for completing anything in this game are purely cosmetic. While I was lukewarm about that at first, I appreciate how it levels out the playing field for players of any skill set. Even with micro-transactions, there's no pay-to-win mechanic.

While players are certainly a threat, there are plenty of other things that can sink your ship, from The Kraken to a rainstorm, from ghost ships to a poorly placed gunpowder barrel (a good place for them is in the crow's nest, FYI). It's difficult to deal with some of the PvE threats when you're solo, but it's very possible with practice and patience!

Sea of Thieves is also graphically and musically beautiful. It easily has the nicest looking water I've [i]ever[/i] seen in a video game. I'm normally a little thalassophobic when it comes to large bodies of water in video games, but it's just so darn gorgeous that I'm always ready to jump in and swim around. Further, I knew I recognized the composition style from [i]somewhere[/i], and it's none other than Robin Beanland! That's just another plus for me as a gaming music nerd.

80,74889464,english,"This game is an open ocean adventure. Emphasis on open.

There are no roles.
There are no rules.
It is up to you how you wish to go about it.

Today you can decide to move some cargo for the Merchants Alliance, raising their flag, and carefully transporting goods across the sea, avoiding what conflict you can.

The next you can be a mercenary for the Order of Souls, going from island to island, killing skeleton captains and their crew for their heads. Defending your loot from the sea and players alike.

Or, you could go all in, raising the Reapers Bones, your crew skillfully sinking every ship you encounter, and sending every player you meet to the Ferry of the Damned!

But, sometimes, you will be yourself, whoever you are, another soul on the Sea of Thieves, exploring with your friends, approaching other ships with your Alliance flag raised, recruiting other crews to the sea police, using your amplified words through your megaphone to convince others to help one another, and simply go digging for treasure together.

These are the open waves. Bring a friend, where I may be kind, I will gladly wait for you to leave your ship, hijack it into the ocean, and leave a piece of Snake Meat on your ships stove, simply to watch it catch ablaze. A reminder of the choices you make, and the consequences that may follow for being a rude dude.

TL;DR It's a Pirate themed Rust, but without screaming children most of the time, and one of my favorite social pirate themed simulators.

Oh, it also supports crossplay with Xbox players!

37,73399921,english,"I am sure you have already read plenty of material about the Sea of Thieves.  And overall it is a great game, A game that I really love and one that I am going to keep playing.  Now, why with that would I rank it negatively and tell you to run from this title?   Well let me try to explain my love/hate relationship with this title.

Ahh, yes this incredible game, it really is a fantastic experience UNTIL you run into another person.  Wait, Mikey, you say its great until you run into another person?  Isn't this game full of other people?  Ding Ding, Why yes it is Johnny.  It is full of the most awful despicable people you will ever meet.  There will be those that say well you should get Gud, or play better, but the facts of the case are these.  

A game really should be something enjoyable and if someone in this game wants to make your life hell for a few hours, that is doable and really easy to accomplish.  For example, lets say you are playing for an hour, have done a few small missions, played around and have a few pieces of treasure and along comes someone else who wants to take it away from you.  Well if you play solo, odds are you are already outmatched and are about to get 2v1 and thats if you are lucky.  Because it can be 3v1 or 4v1.  Sound fun yet?  Perhaps to you this is challenging but delightful.

Perchance you will flee from those horrible odds except that getting away in this game is not possible unless your opponent gives up on chasing you and completely turns away from you.  You see if you are in the 2 man sloop you are the slowest ship in the game unless you go into the wind.  The 4 manned galleon and 3 manned Brig are FASTER than the 2 or 1 man ship with the wind.  However in the case of our 2 man sloop you are supposedly the fastest going into the wind, but since the wind shifts eventually the guy behind you can literally track you and follow at a distance.  If someone wants you and continues to follow you around, you aren't going to be able to play the game.  You can't run ashore and do a mission because the second you do, here they come to blow you up. You can't fight because they outnumber you or are just better than you in general because this game doesn't have a rank system of any kind and they lump everyone together.  
As an example:  So you have been playing for 2 days?  Meet Mikey who has played for 400 days and knows all sorts of tricks like the ""Hide"" emote where you can hide on a persons ship and you can't see their name plate.  Well I am sure there is gameplay that explains that right?  Nope.  And he knows that if you stop at one island over he can use his rowboat to row over an explosive and prep to blow up your ship so when his friend comes over your ship is blown to pieces before you even get back.   In essence If you don't read up on these things you are gonna be awfully surprised the first time it happens.  Well now that you read it, you won't, but I hope you can see where I am going with this.  

Perhaps you say to yourself well I have very little treasure on my ship at a time so it won't be a problem.  Well other players don't know that, and they won't know until they have killed you and sunk your ship.  So they are going to sink you and all that time you spent collecting things for your ship are now gone.  But hey, my mama didn't raise no fool, I am not gonna  just let them steal my stuff  so I will out sail them.  Good on you for making the smart choice to run away from someone better or perhaps there are more people than you but did I mention they can chase you down for your entire game time and not bat an eye about it? No?  Well they can, there is no where that is safe and fog and storms only hide you so well.  
So your next choice is Well I will turn and fight and I will stop their ship so they won't pursue me.  Well odds are, they know all the tricks you know because there aren't a heck of a lot of them to employ to begin with. The most common are Hitting their anchor, setting them on fire, and hitting them with an explosive barrel.  That's what you got, and if one person is watching the water/ladders, you are not going to succeed in any of those.  Sure, you will hear the odd story of someone not paying attention and able to stop a ship, well there is a problem with it.   I have tested this in pursuit of someone, and they did the anchor thing a couple of times, (I had lost fair and square to two of the worst people I have ever met in gaming and I pursued them for quite some time)  and No matter how many times they stopped my ship, I was up and moving again very quickly and still after a few minutes of expert sailing I still caught up to them to fight.

If someone does not choose to break off and go do something else you are in for a miserable play experience because you are literally trying to bore the other team into leaving you alone. 
When someone chooses to do this the experience is not enjoyable and it happens VERY OFTEN.  It is harrowing if you just spent 60 minutes playing and now someone comes along to render that time spent moot.  It makes for a great story to tell people for sure, but the reality is, Being chased and blown up when you don't want or feel like fighting horrible odds 1 vs 2  or worse is an awful experience.  Imagine being chased for 3 hrs, yes it has happened to me, it was Horrendous.

But Mikey, you must really suck at this game and should just get better or make some friends that play.  Sure, I could get better at the game, better at distrusting anyone that comes near me is more like.  Rank Paranoia is what this game causes.  You will come across nice players that will ally with you.  Ahh yes, the alliance.  So, remember those two people I called horrible beings above?  You see, I took a 10k piece of treasure off a ship, which shows your location at all times, and I was delivering it,  They came sailing up and asked for an alliance.  I said sure, why not.  I used to be fairly trusting early on thinking my allies won't hurt me.  I bet you didn't know that allies in this game can shoot and hurt one another so if they decide to betray you, like in this case you, like me will decide to never trust anyone.  So to continue the allies' names appear in purple, but they can screw you over at will and in this case, they did.  They waited for me to pull up to the Reaper's hideout and walk to the entrance and they threw 4 bombs in my face and stole the chest and blew my ship to pieces while I was dead. 

Which also brings me  to another negative about the game.  You see, if you play more than 40 hours and die here and there you will learn where on a ship you will spawn.  there are literally SET points.  And if you stand in the right spot, and for a sloop that would be the roof, they can continue to throw bombs at you and you can't do anything.  Oh, and did I mention that you spawn 1-2 seconds before you get control of your character?  That means the boarder has the advantage. and can kill you before you get your weapon out.

Are you Excited about the sea of thieves yet!?!

Truly I have enjoyed some epic and great battles but at the end of them, if you lose and I have lost some and won some.  Winning feels great but I have been on the side of losing, so guess what? I don't do it to other people unless they come looking for trouble and then I will give it to them.  But think about it for a moment, do you like someone stealing your things?  Well guess what, they built a simulator for it, the Sea of Thieves.  I mean its in the name, but if you read the cute signs they have posted in the taverns the company that made it asks you to be nice to fellow players.  HAHAHAHA, Have these developers met a single human being?  If you can be mean to someone and its part of the game, its highly likely going to happen and this game is literally geared for it.  The plot of the game: Steal from your neighbors, Don't be nice, be a pirate, and be hated for it.  No I mean it people are going to really hate you.",1595911572,1598253564,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972379554,126,4,31489,1590,15850,1601797730

52,74096676,english,"Now that I have played the game for 100+ hours I gotta say its fun. the treasure hunting and ship combat is amazing and fun there is a story and a few bonuses for through exploring. Best part is that the game dose not hold your hand all the way through the game it dose give you some tips here and there on how to lvl rep up and not die but that's about it. when hunting for some treasures instead of ""you go here dig here take chest back to outpost get gold"" you get a map or riddle telling you an island and a vague area to look and rely on land marks and NESW.

However to every good thing there is a bad, the pvp is a touch...broken. people spawn camp the hell out of you if they board and your unable to do squat until they leave or you sink and hand to hand combat is dull and repetitive. That and some players just don't die you can blast and slash them to your hearts content and they somehow don't die people say its cheats some say its the that pc players have an advantage (oh and quick note THIS GAME IS CROSS PLATFORM WITH XBOX) and others say its ping/western and eastern players playing on eachother's servers and becoming almost impossible to hit even though you hitmarker them to hell.

all in all the game is fun ship combat and treasure hunting is fun pvp can be fun if you don't get spawn camped or face an oddly immortal player and hand to hand combat is fine most of the positives outweigh the negatives and the negatives are very minor things that are most likely to get fixed in the future and if they don't? hey I ain't giving up this game since I find it fun.

I do recommend the game, there are micro transactions just its all purely cosmetic items.

Pros
-Sailing is Fun
-Gives a real sense of Adventure
-Fighting off random events can be rewarding.
-The atmosphere of the open ocean
-Conquered my Thalassophobia 

Cons
-Hyper aggressive players
-Lack of progression
-Clunky combat
-Imprecise controls
-NPCs are very forgettable

Notes:
-The tall tales were fun. The adventure was the best part of the game.
-You sail to accumulate money, but you don't ever get to spend it on anything that will make the game more easy/fun. So what is the point of doing it all?
-Players are always hostile. 100% of the time. Some will even chase you beyond when it would be profitable to them. They waste your time and you waste theirs. There is no tangible reward for PVP. The game does not even keep track of boats that you've sunk. Why even do it? And yet players will chase you across the entirety of the playable map just to get some shots at you. Players will chase after you for no reason. If you see a player in the horizon, the best course of action is to change course. PVP becomes a barrier to you enjoying the game.

They made some fundamental errors in the design of the game (primarily that they forgot to design the game). There's no progression, griefing is terrible because nobody has anything to lose (because no progression), all the outposts look the same.

Things I want and this game doesn't have:
- Let me own a ship and upgrade it. Maybe ship ownership is more like a roguelike where if you lose the ship, it's just gone. That way I'm very nervous about engaging in a PVP battle.
- Have way more player ships in a world and let there be default alliances. Like by default everyone affiliated with merchants are on the same ""team"", so to speak. So you can always have at least some backup if need be, etc.
- There's a sign in the bar that says ""all crew members are equal"" or something. That's a load of crap. Give us Captains, and first mates, and let us mutiny. 
- Let us parlay with other OTHER captains and strike deals, etc. Huge missed opportunity on not adding in a ""pirate code"" or something.

48,74727129,english,"As may come as a surprise, this is with the caveat that it is fun with friends. Several. 3+, which can be a tall ask with today's wealth of games. VERY much a sideways thumb.

It CAN be fun without them and, in fact, they have a boat specifically for single-players, but it's near impossible to play as all any crew wants to do is PvP and grief. There's fishing and cooking and treasure hunting and shipwrecks to explore and sea monsters to hunt and a story and entire alliances devoted to these things, but the content is essentially locked off as people will camp outposts or chase any smaller crew to the end of the earth regardless of whether they're hostile, have goods, etc. so it's extremely difficult to actually cash anything in. This is exacerbated by the fact that there are in-game alliances incentivizing it, which is honestly very confusing as it should be it's own ample reward to have a sweet back-and-forth before looting the wreck. Everything is rendered superfluous by the Reaper's Bones since you get everything for the other alliances from it. None of this is a problem with a decent crew, but they'll just want to be aggressors too so I guess it is all unnecessary background in the end. Even with a crew, trying anything else will likely just get you blindsided and, ""that advantage makes the battle,"" as they say.

Also confusing is their focus on arena-specific events. Yes, there is an arena mode in this. It's hard to utilize it because it's seemingly pretty sparse, but it's there. Everyone wants to PvP, but not in the specific mode. Ironic.

Ship battles between two competent crews are exhilarating if not sparse and sailing the high seas with just your compass and a map or spotting a ship on the horizon with your spyglass and deciding if they're worth it based on the flag their waving is great. Landing that long-distance as a ship is getting away with the chainshot is priceless. Hell, skeleton raids are super fun when other players aren't just camping them in a big-ass galleon. When it's hits, it hits on the head.

tl'dr it's half a game because it shoots itself in the foot on every step but open-world PvP and that half is only accessible with a handful of friends, but boy, what a half a game that is.

Proceed to set fire to their ship with a few more bombs I'm carrying, kill them both with my sword, and turn THEIR ship toward some rocks before bailing out in THEIR rowboat. XD

That'll put many people off, but depending on how you look at it, it's also a good thing.

Highly entertaining game! It's easy to learn the PVE/PVP & ship mechanics but hard to master some of them.

Open Crews can be a bit frustrating due to lack of gameplay experience or bad comms from your crew mates, although there's always a good chance you may queue up with a decent crew. 

There are many things to do in this game: Arena (sloop arena is easier to queue vs galleon arena unless if you have a premade crew), Events, Emissary runs, Emissary hunts, Tall Tales, Commendations/Achievements, go guns blazing/sneak in Forts being completed by another player crew and take their loot etc...

[b] Short Review [/b]
This game is simply beautiful and alluring. If you like pirates, loot, group or adventure games then you should already have this on your wishlist if not in your cart already. 

[b] Long Review [/b]
When this game had first came out I wanted it but I didn't own an XBox, I enjoy looting games and the graphics were simply eye gasims. I was sold when I had seen gameplay;  [spoiler] of someone getting sucked into a tentacles of a kraken. [/spoiler] I just wasn't sold on buying an Xbox for one game.

When this had recently come out for Steam I won't lie, I was hyped as my want for the game had subsided after a year and a few months.  But me being me I didn't want to pay full price, I rarely ever pay full price for a game, I want wait as I have for two years for this game, but low and behold my gf seen me on the store page of it during the Summer sale and I told her that I was going to pick it up but that it wasn't on sale, low and behold spending x amount resulted in a discount so that's what I did after she pointed it out. So as I was installing it I decided to read up on the game... I learned a lot but with you have to do it to live it.

My first day out I went alone and didn't know what to expect and people would randomly join in and out of my game.
Second day out I went out alone on my sloop and alas this has been the way it has been for me as I have now countless salty sea dog tales. 

This game has reminded me many key points in life.
1. You start with nothing.
2. Everything can be taken away.
3. Friend or foe, don't trust anyone you don't know.
4. The greater the risk, the greater the reward!
5. Megalodons are not real, but sharks are.

There is a stigma about this game. i.e. Solo/group/pvp/pve

First and foremost yes you can solo in this game, I do it all the time with plenty of screenshots and loots to prove it. I have heard that it's the game on ""hard"" mode. To some extent yes to some extent no. The sloop is the weakest out of all the ships, but the fastest. Yes 3 pirates vs 1 you may seem kind of bad but they are on one ship and you can take them down I promise, as I have. My worse encounter has been while battling a megalodon, one player trys to get credit for the kill as well as sink me in the process, while that is all going on another ship was on fire coming toward us and had 2 skeleton ships chasing that which added on to the chaos... long story short I killed the meg, down a skeleton ship and let the other 3 play with each other while I got away with a meg kill and a few chests from the skeleton ship. It was the most chaos that I have seen all one area at one time. Most other times I will randomly come across other players. 80% of the time they are hostile. I do randomly meet other friendly sailors but always be weary as a few of them have tried to sink me while not watching as well. lol #Piratelife

There are two modes of game play.
The first being of open world, quests, voyages, tall tales, etc.
The second is more of an Arena where it's 15min matches, up to 5 ships compete for silver, and a Chest buried on an island that all the ships are after.

I highly like this as I can jump in and out of the arena for quick matchs or I can burn a day away hunting megalodons as it is my new favorite thing to do.

In conclusion, I rarely ever write reviews, but this one deserved not only my praise but my kudos as well, may they continue to make great things in this game as it has plenty of content and gameplay to keep a salty sea dog busy for hours.... I have played toooo many games that there's consent trolling... I can throw this game on set sails... I seen no flames... unless I am setting them upon skeleton ships. I see no trolls.... unless they are pretending to be a friend then then jump off my ship with a chest. 

If you like or love anything to do with pirates. Buy this game now, come join us!

11,74673834,english,"Base game is fun. But cannot play solo or generally with random people. so unless you have a group to play with EVERY time you play then its not worth playing. People are either salty or always on the hunt. So forget doing anything PvE related like the many world quests and such since someone else will show up 99% of the time to kill you and take what you just worked an hour or more for. Only way to really see if someone is sailing around attacking people on the map is if they voluntarily put up a reaper flag, so that's a useless system...all in all, game is very well designed, PvP system poorly designed, making it annoying/frustrating to just play if you just want to jump in and casually play. There really needs to be a bounty system that marks pirates attacking/killing other players and rewards anyone who sinks them.

29,74341742,english,"This might possibly be one of the greatest MMORPGs ever made.
The reason is simple; unlike most MMORPGs those games put gimmicks and tricks into the player experience to keep them playing and paying a monthly subscription.
Those MMORPGs such as WoW put you on mindless quests, fed Ex quests, and needless grinds for EVERYTHING.
Its like going to a 2nd job.
Then there are the Free To Play MMORPGs that bait you into playing for Free, then frustrate you into buying a subscription for yet another endless grind of an MMORPG.

Sea of Thieves CHANGES everything and BREAKS the WoW model all MMORPGs imitate and cram down our throats.
Sea of Thieves does this by providing a rich, beautiful, totally immersive gaming experience that holds your interest so well you can't wait to play it again.
You will not wake up thinking as you do in other MMORPGs ""oh my I have to play just to keep up and not lose the race"".
YES, all those OTHER MMORPGs are one big race to get ahead of everyone else and accomplish everything fast fast fast and then grind over and over and over.

In Sea of Thieves, just hopping into your ship and going for a joy ride is always an interesting experience.
You contend with storms, rough seas, occassional nasty critters that pop up out of the water when you least expect it. This unlike other MMOPRGs where MOBS just stand there grazing and waiting for you to kill them.
The quests are so rich and varied, with everything from riddles, puzzles, to stories, you name it.
So many different types of quests its varied and REFRESHING.
The graphics although at first seem cartoony, especially the pirates and NPC's;  HOWEVER, you will be amazed at the beautiful and epic vistas so much you will wear out the Steam ""Screenshot"" key.
I hate cartoony graphics, yet somehow this game seems to blend them into something beautiful to the point where if someone walks by your PC while you are playing they will stop and say ""WOW!"".

The quests are fun and challenging and you are not forced to take ones you do not like.
For example, I have a hard time with riddles, but the community is so vibrant there is always an answer somewhere if you cannot figure it out yourself.
Unfortunately, many of the Tall Tale quests are bugged and the games design does a POOR job of deciding when to keep or discard your progress.

There are mobile companion applications, guides, and videos to help you if needed.

PvP in Adventure mode is exciting, don't whine if a player ruins your day.
To quote Captain Jack Sparrow when accused of playing unfair: ""Pirate...""
Like the game ""EVE"" its a cruel world, but in Sea of Thieves you dont lose anything except ""time"".

Please remember, when you first play do not blow off the Maiden Voyage quest, even if you do not like the art style, etc., just DO IT to learn the game.
Then be amazed as you progress thru it.

Don't worry about real money, thats all just for cosmetic items, emotes and stuff like that.
The $39 was well worth spending and as a whole this game is better than most if not all anything I have played recently, if ever.

Keep in mind this is mostly a sandbox MMORPG, and you will not get much hand holding.
Which is a GOOD THING!

All is not peaches and cream, as you will die many times trying to do a quest, and lose all your stuff that you found, but with the exception of quest items that can be obtained again by just repeating the quest or any quest other stuff can be found all over the place: Food, Ammo etc etc.
However, unlike other MMORPGS you can go back to the spot say where your ship sank and pick up floating debris from it. Been finding alot of that lately, some mine some others (?).
Regardless, loot is so amble its not a big thing.

***BAD***
And now, the BIG BAD of this game...The game does a horrible job of maintaining your quest progress. Thus, you will find that for whatever reason the next time you log on your quest state is gone unless reaching a certain milepost or chapter within it. But sometimes even that 
 DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED. 

Also, Tall Tale quests are BUGGED. 
Good example of this I completed the very hard and long Shroud Breaker quest, started Cursed Rogue, only to find the next time I logged in the Cursed Rogue quest was gone and so was the path I needed to restart it.
In fact, the Shroud Breaker quest was back, despite having already finishing it and getting the Accomplishment for it etc. and rewards.

As a result, if you can deal with these GAME BREAKING quest bugs, then by all means play this game.

If you cannot deal with such stupid bugs or poor game design of how quests are handled, then this GAME IS NOT FOR YOU.",1597487563,1598007517,True,3,0,0.539391398429870605,0,True,False,False,76561198019219227,149,57,3541,0,929,1599648425

Sea of ​​Thieves is one of the best multiplayer coop experience you can currently get. It highly depends on your crew, you and up to your 3 friends can join to have your own adventure. The beauty of this game is that it does not have any progress in developing your character. At first it may seem pretty repetitive and boring. There is no way to make your ship stronger, or character do more damage. This makes every encounter on the seas challenging. The only progress that you can make is by knowing the core mechanics better, and use them to your advantage. By smart managing your ship and using all variety of different cannonballs it is deffinietly possible to sink a 4 person galleon while flying 2 person sloop. The only things that you can buy for money are clothes and different skins to your weapons and equipment, but you won’t get any benefits by using endgame and rare varieties of this skins. You can look whatever you like fitting in many different sets of clothes not losing any stats. Game had a pretty rough start in 2018 by a lack of content but now Rare took a good care of their masterpiece by adding regularly new content and even new core mechanics such as fire. Rare is one of the most transparent and connected to community companies I’ve ever seen. They love their game and care about community. The updates are well thought out and makes changes that make me go back every time the new update is released. However this is not a game for everyone. Its mainly for people that have lots of free time to spare. Quick in-and-out voyages can become a long hours of traveling thru seas collenting more and more loot just to the point that other crew will decide to attack you and steal all the loot. Yes this game is PVP ONLY. That doesn’t necessarily mean that everyday you would find someone so desperate to kill you, that he will chase you thru all map and eventually get you in confrontation. BUT loosing your hard earned progress just a few minutes away from outpost in with u would cash in your loot is a part of the game. I literally have a THIEV word in the title so by setting sail be sure that you will eventually lose many thousands of cash by other players. It is in my opinion a great test whether you really like this game. If you would sail for like a 4/5 hours on duo sloop with your friend just to be downed by a galleon of reapers bones, and after a break to chill after this loss you would still want to play and maybe make up what your lost . Trust me you won’t regret.",1591966029,1597910285,True,94,5,0.78071361780166626,6,True,False,False,76561198381703420,556,16,18643,2163,1062,1601984181

55,74484969,english,"Sea of Thieves is an open-world, sail-the-high-seas pirate game. Easy to learn and hard to master, there's not much bad I can say about it; the graphics are beautiful, there's always something to do, and unlike MMORPGs, there's no real difference between a new player and an old salt beyond raw skill and game knowledge. Every person loads in the same.

When you load in, you are given the option of a sloop (1-2 players), a brigantine (1-3 players), or a galleon (1-4 players). You are then given the option to play by yourself/with friends or with other players online. Playing with others is the heart of this game - whether with friends or strangers - however, it may be difficult to decide on what to do. When you load in, there is an active ""event"" on dictated by the clouds in the sky, visible across the entire sea. For example, if you see a skull in the sky, there is an active skeleton fort to take on, and if there is no cloud, that means the kraken is on the prowl! If you get tired of fighting, there is lore to be discovered in ""The Shores of Gold"" quests, and plenty of other things to find if you search...

The game has monthly updates full of content, with stories progressing if you're watching closely - as I type this, the Ashen Winds update has been released, and Flameheart's generals are unleashed upon the seas. Things change all the time, giving the game a fresh feel each month. Very few games can do this.

I often play solo, which is only recommended if you have a stomach for unfairness; commonly, my ship will get taken down by a 4-man Galleon who just feels like causing trouble. I understand that this is part of the game, however it takes some patience and often if I am tired I'll just give up. There's a lot of patience in general required for the other members of the community - there are some toxic people who will find new players and spawn camp them until they quit, will chase you all the way around the map, and will keep coming back even after they've been sunk multiple times. This can be exhausting, but don't lose hope! This is only a small part of the experience. Most of the time, other players will either offer an alliance, or sink you/be sunk and go on their way, unless you steal their loot.

TL;DR: I have over 300 hours on the Xbox version and I can heartily say that there isn't a game like this anywhere else. Unforgettable graphics, in-depth and out-of-sight story that makes you feel like you earnt it, and monthly updates make this game feel completely unlike anything else. Throw in some friends, and you're in for a night of fun.

71,74478210,english,"Sea of Thieves has huge potential, but ultimately I don't recommend this game at the current time (August 2020).

This is a negative review, so let's start with the bad:

- The game is quite pricey. It's greedily priced by the developers for what it offers compared to other games.
- Combat mechanics are very basic for person-to-person, the cannon combat seems more fun, however.
- No personal/coop PvE only mode available. This is probably the strangest problem. For some reason the developers are hell bent on not having/keeping more players. If the developers wanted  more success, players who want PvP would play in the normal area, and then a completely separate gold/rep/quests etc area/instance would be available for casual players to play at their leisure. No crossover of gold/rep etc. between the two. I see a lot of complaints that this would ""split"" the player base, but this is false. The people who would play PvE would simply not exist because PvP isn't much fun for them and they would just quit. If they quit they aren't part of the player base anyway. Ergo, having two modes means you get casual players, plus the sweaty PvP people. The only reason I can think of to not split things is if the developers are worried that more sweaty PvPers will quit if they have no noobs to grief than the number of PvE players who will quit. Surely the developers want more people to play??
- Lack of PvE only mode also means the game really misses its potential in terms of RPG/leveling/experience. Because the game is pure PvP, it has to be balanced with zero leveling or upgrades or experience. A PvE side of things would allow a much richer experience where you could upgrade cannons/weapons/ships. This may potentially take up too much developer resource time, so I can partially understand why they wouldn't bother, but it seems like you would bring in a huge amount of players who'd like the coop RPG side of things without sweaty PvPers ruining a chilled out experience.

Ok let's look at some good things, despite the developer's insistence on having fewer players than potential:

- The game environment is beautiful to look at. The engine for the water and weather is great, everything looks really good.
- The sailing experience is quite fun solo on a smaller boat, or with friends on a larger boat. Not too complicated, but you still need to take account of wind direction and such.
- Quests and riddles are basic, but fun.

So the TLDR here is, the game has potential to be great if a PvE mode is added, but is overpriced and essentially unplayable solo. This may be fixed in the future if the developer discovers that more players = potentially more money. Until then, avoid this one.

Last thought: The PvP only mode with no solo play realistically available (current game) is maaaybe worth 50% of the purchase price right now, so if this is ever on sale at least 50% then it may be worthwhile.",1597707569,1597707599,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198016107458,31,2,3527,310,796,1601090780

The game mechanics seem alright at first. Until you join a public session.
It is impossible to play solo, let alone trying to survive with a friend around normal 4-player crews with bigass ships. Ship physics need time to get used to, while the combat is impossible to master (because it is very badly made).

As for myself, i disliked the game at first. I owe that to being so new and just getting frustrated with the mechanics and running in to enemy players that were better than me and slaughter me. However, SoT grew on me and there are way more positives than negatives.
Positives-- Great music, interesting storytelling, beautiful graphics, smooth combat, rewarding, humorous, and there's plenty to do.
Negatives-- Takes time to get used to everything which could lead to frustration, community can be toxic, and could use some QoL updates (like holding more resources while at an Outpost or something of that nature).

The biggest issue here is that the game is run by a bunch of communists and Rare is entirely controlled by Xbox Game Studios. I play with a close group of family and a friend, yet somehow Xbox is monitoring my voice chat and banned me with no warning and no reason.

17,74355180,english,"101 час за ~полтора месяц. Пару минут назад я сдал Легендарным Пиратом, что далеко не предел, ведь мне открылась новая фракция, на которую я должен буду потратить в три раза больше. Но тем не менее считаю, что имею достаточно игрового опыта и наигранных часов для рецензии, так что сейчас я расскажу, почему я потратил на нее больше тысячи рублей и остался доволен:

- Полная свобода действий. Игра не загоняет тебя в рамки. Зайдя в игру ты можешь заняться тем, что тебе по душе. Хочешь лампово посидеть в дискорде с другом попутно выполняя задания фракций? Вперед. Хочешь немного экшена? Ивенты на сервере не дадут тебя заскучать: захват форта скелетов, сражение с Призрачной Флотилией, Флотилией Скелетов, убийство Пепельных лордов (которые сделаны, по моему мнению, очень хорошо: обладают таким количеством разнообразных атак, что схватка с этим боссом не выглядит скучной и монотонной) - эти ивенты идут друг за другом и поучаствовав в одном ты сразу же можешь направляться к другому. Не говоря уже о случайных ивентах, таких как нападение Мегалодрона, Кракена или корабля скелетов, выплывшего из глубин океана прямо на ваших глазах. Ну или ты можешь отходнуть от всей этой суеты, остановившись где-то в укромном месте, чтобы порыбачить. 
- Отсутствие РПГ составляющей и доната, влияющего на игровые механики. Вам может показаться, что раз уж в игре нет прокачки персонажа и корабля, то она скучная и неинтересная. Эта мысль у меня развеялась после того, как я наиграв 10-15 часов со своим другом уже мог спокойно противостоять довольно опытным игрокам, которые в ином случае просто задушили бы нас, будь у них сильнее корабль/больше хп/больше урона и так далее. Мне очень нравится эта игра за то, что видя перед собой корабль, ты беспокоишься только о том, чтобы в бочках было достаточно ядер и досок, чтобы стрелять и чиниться, а не о том, насколько прокачанные там игроки. Сражаясь непосредственно с игроком 1 на 1 у тебя абсолютно равные шансы, ведь оружие нельзя прокачать и сделать его сильнее.
- Нет сейв зон. Для меня это именно плюс. Игра не простит тебе, если ты, заполучив огромную гору лута, довольный и расслабленный пойдешь сдавать его на ближайщий фортпост, ведь там тебя могут ждать другие игроки(или проследив за тобой, подплывут за спиной, пока ты сдаешь свой лут). Хоть и звучит это довольно сложно, но стоит отметить, что на сервере ограничение: максимум 6 корбалей любого типа + большая карта + много фортпостов и встретить на фортпостах другой корабль довольно маловероятно.
- Наверное стоило бы отметить этот пункт как один из первых. Управление кораблем. Оно довольно продуманное и многофункциональное: якорь/штурвал/паруса/гарпун/ветер влияет на скорость. В бою тебе могут отбить мачту и твой корабль будет фактически обездвижен, ведь паруса упадут. Гарпуном ты можешь на скорости стрелять к скале, таким образом изменив свою траекторию. Так же гарпуном можно притягиваться к другим кораблям, притягивать лут с пола и даже людей.
- Мелочи, которые я все объединю в один пункт. В игре есть различные музыкальные инстументы, на которых вы можете наигрывать разные мелодии(в игре их больше 10-ти) как самостоятельно, так и со своим товарищем на разных инструментах. Довольно лампово и может скрасить долгое плавание. Алкоголь. Куда же без него в игре про пиратов? Тут все просто: у тебя есть кружка и бесконечные запасы алкоголя на корабле. Только не пейте перед битвой, эффект опьянения в этой игре довольно неприятный и затрудняет любое действие. Можно стрелять собой из пушек! Вы гонитесь за какой-то командой но никак не можете догнать? Пульните своим корешем и, если повезет, он попадет к ним на корабль и сбросит якорь. Так же есть проктялые ядра, которые дают разные эффекты кораблю в который они попадают. Довольно много разнообразных скинов на корабль. оружие, персонажа. Все из них(кроме донатных) можно купить не напрягаясь.  Вам не нужно донатить и покупать золото ради того, чтобы купить носовую фигуру. Вы спокойно можете заработать на это сами.

В общем, хоть я и описал многое и в голову особо ничего не лезет, но я уверен, что это не все. Попробуйте сами. Возможно напишу еще один обзор, когда достигну 10-го уровня Сокровищ Афины, так что встретимся через пол года +-

26,74344488,english,"[h1]Short review:[/h1]
An immersive pirate sandbox where interacting with other players is dangerous and exciting, scary and hilarious. Sailing the ship with your crew is lots of fun, and progression comes from finding new adventure opportunities and learning new strategies, instead of unlocking skills and gear. Highly recommend playing with friends, and I think playing with voice chat is essential. 

Overall if you enjoy player-led, openworld, gameplay, and the mayhem ships filled with gunpowder can offer, then Sea of Thieves is for you. 

[h1]Longer review:[/h1]
I remember when I started to get tired of mmorpgs. I loved the player interaction and the feeling of exploring worlds, but I found they didn't seem to evolve much over the years. I wished for a new gen mmo that placed a lot more emphasis on adventuring and exploring. I feel like Sea of Thieves is in some ways what I was hoping for. 

There's 2 modes to choose from, Arena and Adventure. Arena is a pretty straight forward PVP mode, where crews of pirates attempt to sink each other for ingame currency. Pretty straight forward. Adventure is the openworld, sandbox aspect to the game, and in my eyes the main attraction.

Adventures start on an Island, with a ship waiting at dock. Players can suggest a quest at a captain's table or just set sail. Quests can be ones designed by the developers (Tall Tales from NPCs, messages in bottles etc), or something you just come up with as a crew. The sense of freedom is impressive. We've often chose to sail to an island we like to look of, and proceeded to get tangled up in all sorts of madness. The game has a way of turning a fetch quest into Homer's Odyssey. 

Most things are totally player driven. You're required to use your compass to tell the direction, hold your lamp up to read things in the dark, gather around the map to make a plan, pay attention to the wind to set the sails accordingly. There's no HUD markers to highlight objectives, in fact HUD in general is pretty minimal. I don't suppose there's much competition, but this has to be the most immersive pirate game ever made. 

I think it's worth pointing out that nearly all of my experiences with this game have been playing with friends over voice chat. There's always a possibility you get matched with some tool that messes with your experience. 

As for major criticisms, I can't find many. I think the login process is a bit tedious, and the fact that you can't chat whilst in a lobby seems a bit silly (although I suspect that is to reduce the likelihood of people dropping out of parties due to toxicity). One criticism that I've heard is the lack of power progression for your character. Sea of thieves only offers tangible progression in the form of cosmetics: outfits, weapon skins, ship decorations etc. For some RPG players I imagine this feels unsatisfying or shallow. But as I said in the short review: progression comes from finding new adventure opportunities and learning new strategies, instead of unlocking skills and gear. It's brave from Rare, but I think it makes for a very unique, fair and immersive experience.

Overall, I'm really enjoying Sea of Thieves. I never thought I'd get to feel like a pirate, but somehow it's happened. Avast! Log in and let me steal your shit!",1597491686,1597491834,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198028574307,220,6,2990,99,1443,1600985847

Still a lot of bugs. I've encountered floating megs, gotten glitched in many trees, swam on land, glitched through the boat, etc. 

The hit reg is still pretty terrible despite some reworking and you have to get used to the fighting style in this game. I come from CS:GO and there's no advanced movement in SOT  like strafing etc. I haven't noticed much inaccuracy while moving as well. Most people I've seen in this game just jump around with blunders like maniacs. The guns are also really easy to learn how to use which is a plus for casual players. 

However, there really isn't much to do in the game. Without friends, the game gets boring quickly. There is no real progression in this game; once you hit Pirate Legend, you just end up doing the same old voyages over and over again. 

The game is also targeted towards casual players in my opinion, but some of the voyages like thieves haven runs can take a while.

TLDR:
First off, it's a really easy chill game as far as controls go and understanding the game. So it's a nice game to play with casual and competitive friends alike. This review covers all the details that you won't typically see in game-play videos of the game. It's not a perfect game, and if you are solo or with a partner is SUPER easy to get pooped on by a group or an Alliance that REALLY wants to sink your ship. There are many who will follow you for quite awhile. All-in-all, It's a fun game with dedicated friends who can sit down and play it for longer than a couple of hours at a time..


*Deeply Impacting Negatives*

1) Need committed friends to play with you ""just to make the game playable!"" Without that, and you will be hit with so much time lost and wasted effort. 

2) The Cross platform play makes communication with randoms impossible. 

3) You are unable to quickly and efficiently send friend requests to console players ""just so you can communicate with them.""

4) The glitches and lag turn high difficulty situations (when involving enemy players, which is often) into near impossible situations to get out of.
Example 1: Lag makes players unkillable.
Example 2: Be sailing while being chased by other players and ""POOF"" you can no longer see wind streams to help you get away from your pursuers.
Example 3: The Faster connection will always win. i.e. blunderbuss, sword strikes, and ranged attacks.

5) SERVER TRANSFERS mid game ""Constantly"":
- This will royally bone you so bad. 
Ex: Imagine sailing for almost ""2 hours"" constantly against the wind, resulting in even slower speeds, FINALLY find a clear Sea Post to turn in and sell all your loot from adventuring, and right as your docking... ""BAM"" a 4 man Team/ship spawns in RIGHT NEXT TO YOU... but it's okay, you manage to turn your ship away just fast enough to start to get away- only to have a Kraken show up, LOCK YOU IN PLACE!!! Thus allowing that 4 player team, who just spawned, enough time to swim out to you, Spawn kill you over and over because you constantly spawn in the SAME PLACE on your ship- and them reaping the rewards of YOUR 6 hours in total (which includes constantly traveling around to find a safe place to offload your loot.
((NOTE: This little scenario, just happened to me 30 minutes ago, which is enough to push me over the fence to finally write a review for this game.))

6) Impossible to report people in game, almost as if to facilitate conduct that in other games is a bannable offense. i.e. horrific verbal outburst, speech, insults, racial slurs, team killing, team sabotaging of the ship or dropping your loot off the boat, or even swimming your loot out to enemy players.
7) PVP Area, Sloop Arena is pretty good if you don't have #6 of these negatives on your team. However, Galleon Arena is unplayable unless you have your own 4 man team of friends. You pretty much win at that point in Galleon automatically, you just have to go through the motions of getting some chests and turning them in during the match. The reason for this is the majority if not ALL of the other teams will be down a player, or even down ""2 players"" (making them absolute fodder and fun targets for your team to shoot. In the even there are other teams of 4, fear not, they will almost always have a player or two on their team that is addicted to playing music and not at all helping, or they LOVE to just drop your anchor constantly freezing you in-place to get shredded up by the enemy teams, or they like to shoot the harpoon gun at anything they can to make you turn off course to constantly miss your shots or get you to where you can go to actually get some points.

8) 90% of the clothing and character aesthetics from color/shading to the style of them, looks like an 8 year old thought them up. I don't have a nice short and concise way to put this, sorry devs.

Lastly, it's a game that is done with so much love and hard work that it's truly sad to see it wasted because of those impacting negatives.



*Positives* 

(only if you have ""Committed Friends"" to play this with, because there are no, ""hey lets sit down for an hour- maybe 2 to play some sea of thieves..."" No-no! This is a game that you have to be prepared to sit down for AT LEAST 2 to 3 hours to play, ""IF"" you REALLY want to turn in that loot!
((NOTE: There are too many positives if you have committed friends to play this with. It's a game that you can truly have a blast in. You just have to always keep the frame of mind that it's a game, and not your precious time being taken from you because of something beyond your control or cautious measures you take to ensure success.))

1) Breath taking world to sail around in from water physics, to how far you can see things all the way to beauty of the world itself. The Sounds are so perfect from ambiance to sound effects of every little thing... and the music, SPOT ON! The warning system with ALL the different types of music is insanely good.

2) SO MUCH content. UPDATED MONTHLY to boot.

3) Incredible replay value with endless hours of doing something you haven't done before in game.

4) Awesome lore.

5) SO, many things to do, many, MANY different types of NPC encounters.",1597154562,1597444242,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198053319138,90,21,4979,0,4851,1599411785

Frequent updates.


Bad things about the game:
Not very beginner friendly in terms of PVP.
Can get annoying when you are constantly killed.
A bit overpriced.

11,74275057,english,"I love this game, but it has so many flaws that I'm tempted to not recommend it.

*Pros* - 
Great PVE gameplay
Gold is only really used for cosmetics, but it makes the grind feel good
Boat mechanics are great
Graphics are beautiful at times
PVP can be fun at times, when the person doesn't run (they basically always will though)
Music is amazing!
Very fun with groups of friends

*Cons* - 

One of the least polished games I've ever played. Every single time you play you'll encounter an extremely annoying glitch that has a chance to ruin your gameplay. (Didn't expect it to be this glitchy considering it has a $40 price tag.. This game isn't finished whatsoever.)

Mermaids.... That's all I need to say. They never work, they're complete rng, half the time they swim away as soon as you get to them *if they even spawn*  and there have been MANY times when my boat is still up but I respawn on a random nearby island instead of my ship..

If you want pvp this community is not for you.. The learning process of the pvp is amazing and the more skilled player will almost always win, but that's if people actually fight. Players run 90% of the time and if they do fight, they usually try to guilt you into going away instead of truly fighting back.

Crossplay mixed with bad servers causes people to teleport a lot. I'm on the East Coast of America and I get servers with Chinese players that are stacking 3 galleons and teleporting around as they run.

*Glitches that I've encountered that haven't been fixed in at least 5 patches* - 

When jumping into water you have a chance for your audio to glitch and BLAST your headphones with bass that's so loud it's painful.

Worst hit registration I've ever seen in any game.. By far. You'll see a hitmarker but it does no damage to the player, or you won't see a hitmarker at all and they'll die. It makes no sense and I don't see how this hasn't been fixed since it kills MANY pvp fights.

Swords can literally hit you through walls at times. If someone is below deck and they swing at the roof it can hit a person above. 

Blackscreens when they make no sense. There's a mechanic that sends back to your ship if you get stuck in a place that you can't get out of, but I've had this happen while casually running on an island. If you're trying to be sneaky stay away from rocks because instead of making them so you can actually walk on them, they just made it so you sink in between them and blackscreen back to your ship..

Every single play session you will most likely run into a glitch, especially if you do any pvp... If you only PVE these will only be minor inconveniences (most of the time)

*Summary* - 

This game has so much potential and I LOVE the general idea. They just need to stop putting out updates before actually fixing their glitches. Every patch has been filled with more and more glitches and it's starting to kill the fun. I love active developers, but hate when they say they've fixed something in 2 different patch notes as it actually ends up getting worse.

Graphics: the water is the most beautiful I've ever seen in any video game. The textures are a little cartoonish at first but you understand the necessity for that soon enough and it all merges and blends in together stylistically. And when it's night time and the sky is cloudless? Look up. This game is beautiful. 
Gameplay: It can be a tad frustrating getting attacked by another more skilled player for the first time, but at the end of the day you have to remind yourself that the game is literally called ""Sea of THIEVES"".  Learn the tricks of the trade, and in no time you'll be a Pirate Legend (or a happy-go-lucky gold hunter, like me :D). 
Updates: the dev team (Rare [yeah, THAT Rare]) releases updates to the game on a fairly regular interval, keeping the game fresh and exciting for veteran players while giving new players that much more to explore. The Ashen update that came out recently added some tough new enemies and items that make me wonder what they're gonna roll out next. 

Important to note: I was not aware of the difficulty of playing this game single player. Not to say that it can't be done, mind you; I've often set out solo into the wild blue yonder and returned with arms bursting with booty (alongside some cuts and burns, admittedly). I do confess the game is significantly more fun with at least one other on your ship, so invite your friends! 

10/10 game, though.

58,74137081,english,"Pros:  

1. It can be pretty. The sea is done well.
2. If you like to gank people this is your game.

Cons:

1. The character creator is a lazy gimmick. Its an exercise in ugly. 
2. They sell you real cash potions because they know you will hate the character you create, rather than fixing (1)
3. 16 players a map. Its basically a tiny multiplayer game where you end up hoping you dont meet other players when you solo and hoping you do when you have a group.. but totally random if you do.
4. No customization other than cosmetics. No skill  trees or character growth or any kind of RP functions. You are like everyone else - which should be good for balance but....
5. Experienced groups can just grief you as a new player. Nowhere is safe. It's a gankfest of the worst kind.
6. There is no end game. There's no point. Everything is the same. In the end you just play for useless cosmetics. 
7. It is really samey. All the islands are the same. Same monsters. Same pigs and chickens. No variation whatsoever. It reminds me of a game called Worlds Adrift: same lazy-ass approach to the game world where nothing stands out as unique. Its all cartoony skeletons and stuff. 

This game is a very superficial ripoff of archeage sea battles. Someone in Rare played that and thought ""hey lets cut out all the interesting stuff like character building and just make a treasure hunting gank-fest"". 

Untlimately it got very boring. When I played solo I was ganked. When I played with a few people I ganked. ^shrug^ After a day or 2 playing i struggle to find any motivation to continue.

Managing your ship in tough conditions and dealing with the many random events always keep you busy. You never know what to expect when you sail the seas. There is nothing more satisfying than cashing out all of your loot after the end of long voyage. Combat is not too diverse but is still really fun I'm not sure what else they could add to it and ship combat is a little weird to get used to but still fun. The emissaries are all diverse and let you play the game slightly differently and with a few updates you're not stuck grinding a emissary you don't enjoy. Sadly the money you make is only for cosmetics but that doesn't matter to me.

Very different game style from other popular games.  Good adventure quests.  Lots of things to do in game.

Con:
Difficult to play solo.  Many things tutorial does not teach you.  There are some bugs.  Random teammates are high chance of getting trolls.  Troll teammate trying to sink your ship or make you lose all your loot.  I was on a sloop and made a skeleton sloop sunk, then two skeleton galleons ship appeared on both sides of my ship right after.  This setting seems way too difficult for solo/RT player.

Extra:
You could feel sea sick.  Chance to run into aggressive players that will rob you(pirate game duh).  Many random teammates are so bad at this game, they are worse than my first day playing.",1595862261,1597249522,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198000360643,14,12,5374,0,257,1598107797

66,74149858,english,"First thing i must admit about this game. Its beautiful has some very solid cartoon look to it. One of the best looking games. But other then that its very boring. The game doesn't really explain much to you. There is a short tutorial that introduces you very quickly. You learn about the items and tools how to setup a voyage which is a quest mission. Once your done with that you go into one of the games many random trade islands. This game is water world meets Zelda Wind Waker feel to it. So you start in this island and every island is different you look around for the 3 trade factions, one is delivering or trade goods, the other is a treasure hunter looking for chest. Then the third is a skeleton bounty collecting skulls.. You have to gain reputation with these factions and move up. There is also like a main adventure voyage guy who is in the inn and he starts this epic voyage line that is actually pretty tough and i thought was the most fun. You must play with friends or a group playing by yourself is boring and tedious because you have to run the ship yourself. The ships are not very complicated they have mechanics to them like dropping raising anchor sails, loading cannons repairing damage etc what you would expect from a pirate game. The game is full PVP once you start the voyages and collect loot, anyone else who comes across you if they choose can attack and steal your stuff. Sea of thieves. One thing i noticed is everything is cosmetic you always have the same items weapons but only make them different buying different looks. There are no stats in this game.

But this game is very fun. If you have friends to play its even more fun.
Also for the people with no friends like me looking at this game restraining from buying because they think they might die all the time from playing solo. Let me tell you something. This game is very fun soloing, And if you think that you will lose fights 100% of the time. YOUR WRONG. I've played this game solo alot and defeated galleons on my sloop. And if you are looking for a crew because you want a galleon? Go ahead and go to the Discord server where you can look for crews and potential friends!!!
All im saying is every negative review i've seen is just butt hurt people who cry everytime they get there loot stolen. They complain about the game having to many ""Mean people"" In it.
But Its in the name of the game!

Sea of Thieves is a lot of fun to play with friends (but you can also queue with random people too!). I can spend hours sailing the seas and searching for buried treasure, fighting skeletons, and sinking enemy ships. The graphics in this game are beautiful, and even on lower settings still look nice. The sailing mechanic seems pretty realistic, and on a larger boat you'll definitely need more coordination to keep it running smoothly.

60,71159619,english,"The games itself is fun but lacking depth, it is much of a Arma 2 DayZ type game to me where the progression isnt really there, the world, interactions, and fights are what keep you playing.
However, the people are some of the most toxic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you'll ever see. (including myself)
Also if people message you or you message people on the xbox app the reporting feature can be easily exploited to trigger automated communications bans which basically means you cant send messages, you cant use the party chat function of the xbox app (not that any self respecting PC player ever would), you cant type in sea of thieves (or any other games using the xbox app/your microsoft account), you cant talk in sea of thieves, you cant hear others talk in sea of thieves. You can still receive messages from people so what a lot of people will do is rage message you insulting you so they can bait you into saying something they can use trigger the automated comban then continue to talk ♥♥♥♥ without you being able to respond unless you block them. If the easily exploitable nature of these bans being easy to trigger wasn't bad enough they also increase in duration for subsequent bans 1d/3d/7d/30d
As to what triggers it who ♥♥♥♥ing knows. I was banned for 3 days for calling somebody a loser then a week or two later someone called me the same thing and i figured id test their system a bit.
What i found was for whatever reasons innocuous insults like loser and a$$hole trigger combans but racial slurs and other insults that are more specific to the person for example things regarding young/old/rich/poor/fat/skinny/gay/straight do not seem to trigger the com bans.
Not that i give a ♥♥♥♥ its just that Xbox/Microsoft deems it harassment and apparently will ban you if you insult people on the basis of those things which is the only reason i bring them up yet ""loser"" triggers a commban and broke boomer f@ggot does not... (none of which actually describe me but you know how people are when they lose in games)
The other elephant in the Sea is the hacker problem on Sea of Thieves, Rares handpicked streamer cabal, forum and discord shills will tell you they don't exist when there were and still are numerous sites offering paid cheats for Sea of Thieves. The game has no anti cheat and is frequently sold on sale for 1$ through the game pass which lasts a month...
Your anti cheat can be the result of a decade long joint operation between NASA and the NSA and it still wont do ♥♥♥♥ about hackers if you sell the game for 1$ and not ban anyone for cheating. Where it stands you're more likely to catch a game ban for saying naughty words than you are for cheating your ♥♥♥ off openly, especially because rare has given power to these outsourced ""community managers"" that will legit just temp ban people because their friend said so, no proof needed and when you get game banned (where you actually cant play) you don't get an email where you can see the reason for the ban like with comm bans, you're just banned. You can try and take it to the SoT Discord but those same community managers that banned you run it like a PC Mafia and you'll likely just get told nicely or not so nicely to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and that's if you even get a response unless you're already friends with one of these CM's.
Remember that old meme about having a friend or family member that works for Microsoft or Xbox. In Sea of Thieves that claim isn't even remotely far fetched, aside from the streamers that have Rare ban anyone who kills them for ""stream sniping"", there are also over 20 of these so called community managers and many more that aren't able to be found as easily who are given power enough to ban people from site (SoT Site), service (xbox app functionality), and game (SoT itself) but have no accountability to anyone except for the head of community who does little else but pick these ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of these CM's play the game themselves which in theory isn't that problematic but in reality you have many CM's that play with their group and if they run up against someone who's better than them, they'll slap them with a 3 day game ban for saying a naughty word (which who knows where that line is drawn when 72hr bans are being doled out for calling people losers) or their friends will say super ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ (death threats and wishes in many cases) to again bait a response from someone chasing them ingame then send the 15 second clip off to their CM friend and have them ban the people chasing them which unfortunately happens all the time.

The saddest is part is somewhere underneath all that grime and filth there is a good game that Rare has resigned to a slow death that gets closer with every patch.
But i'm sure instead of changing, fixing or adding anything when the numbers start to get low they'll use some of that micro money to pay summit to come back and stream the game for a week or two, that seems to usually do the trick.",1592800296,1597083864,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198293121229,70,5,11453,3,10331,1601084591

17,74044442,english,"I want to start this review off by saying I have severe thalassophobia, so I play 99% of this game above water unless I'm forced off the boat to go to shore or am unfortunately knocked off by some very notable monsters.
As someone who screams and turns the game off the moment I'm knocked too far away from my boat, I 100% recommend this game to anyone who's interested in a pirate's adventure!

Graphics:
Just... look at the trailer. That trailer is accurate to what it looks like in game: it has that beautiful Rare style to it with a nice blend of realism when looking at the ocean. The light effects, the fog, the different types of oceans... 
There's very few things in this game that look off-putting or wrong, and usually it's just your pirate's face.

Sound Design:
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Do you love the sound of creaking wood? Water? Gun clicking? Sword swinging? How about when the music picks up because a kraken just spawned underneath your boat for the SECOND time in a single day? Then you'll love the ambiance in here!
Also, the cats purr directly in your ear. Highly recommend for anyone who loves cats!

Gameplay: 
Depending on your hardware and how high you have the graphics cranked up, the game can lag for you. If you tweak them, everything should RELATIVELY run smooth like butter.
Some people complain about the sword swinging: ""Why is it only 3 times?"" That's because of PVP my fellow plunderers! Everyone in the game can be killed in about 3 sword swings, AKA one solid combo on an unsuspecting pirate. With how health is managed and how respawn works (15 seconds in timeout before you're allowed to respawn back on your ship), this is purely for balancing the game and works quite well once you've played enough to realize the design nuances. Ocean fights with other players can be VERY intense because of this, so try to focus on sinking their ship as fast as possible!
Digging treasure out with your shovel is possibly one of the most satisfying things I've gotten to do, and fishing and cooking food is more entertaining in this game compared to others.
Sailing your ship is where you can tell most of the care went to though, even if the instruments and lantern and opening and closing your pocket watch is fun. The controls for each ship vary depending on how big it is, just like in real life: it's considerably easier to pilot a sloop than it is a galleon, but with enough practice, you'll get a feel for how each one sails in no time.

Everything is highly accurate in this game in terms of aiming, no janky hitboxes here! I main a sniper rifle and frequently practice my sharpshooting from the crow's nest if I'm not the captain for the day, and I can confirm that if you're in bullet distance, you CAN hit things as long as you aim and account for bullet travel, disruption from waves, enemy movement, etc. 

General Enjoyment:
Despite being a big chicken with my ass firmly planted on the boat, I REALLY enjoy this game! I'm hoping it'll eventually help calm my phobia of the ocean and the monsters in it over time. So far, I can't bring myself to even jump into the water to help my crew loot shipwrecks, but this has forced me to know how to pilot each and every boat perfectly.
I can't jump in the water? That's okay! I'll just gently ease the boat in place and just harpoon everything up myself.

So far, other players have tended to heed my warnings and I've only encountered 3-4 hostile ships. My friends (one of which is a high-ranking PVPer) warned me that people disable VC in this game and to not trust others, but most of the time when I pull my megaphone out, I get positive responses and people adjust their course, realizing we don't want to sink their ship for no reason.
I have yet to fully turn to the ""kill on sight"" mentality my friends possess and seek peaceful resolutions first... but if someone ignores my verbal and written warnings, then I'll happily participate in a brawl.",1597000281,1597001206,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198096342965,55,1,6210,0,2613,1599773294

19,74041365,english,"The game I have been waiting for, for a very long time.

For a game so simple about sailing, there is so much detail put into it, the water, the puddles on the floor of your ship moving alongside the waves, the music, the voice acting, all of it, it is just perfect.

Nothing is pay to win, the only thing you can pay for is cosmetics, you get every piece of equipment available, no hassle or grind which is a huge relief because every other game I played made me grind for experience or money to enjoy myself which really ruins the fun of games, I don't wanna work to enjoy myself.

There is plenty of content to keep you busy, quests, PvP, random events, all of it blends together to keep you very entertained and on your feet.

Sailing back to an outpost after going on a long voyage to sell your loot, you then hear a noise then all of a sudden all of a sudden a huge ghost ship comes up from the ocean beside you then you have to fight to keep yourself afloat and save your loot.

It is an amazing game and I could not recommend it more.

[i]If none of the whining below strikes you as a problem, you might have just found a new favourite game.[/i]

[b]Purely from a solo adventuring standpoint, this game sucks[/b] if you want to play at your own leisure.
Also, roaming for random goodies (decent profit sometimes) or sidequests (abysmal money to begin with) feels like a waste of time when you realise [b]all the gold you make essentially gets you nothing but cosmetics which have no functional improvement whatsoever[/b].

While it is reasonably easy to escape bigger ships with 3+ players in it if you don't let them get too close, escaping is pointless when your quest target is an island in their ""hunting grounds"" since you either have to go back and get targeted yet again or lobby and rejoin the game to start again while hoping the quest target won't be near jerks this time.

That said, [b]the game is filled with jerks[/b]... Absolutely FILLED TO THE BRIM!!
I haven't had a single reasonable experience with another player in this game. To the point that if you die, you literally HAVE to scuttle your ship or they camp and repeat kill you which doesn't even give them any benefit.
As such, the emote system is useless, the alliance system is a sham, the open crew option is useless, etc...
[i]I know the game is literally about pirates and thieving, but there is a difference between taking everything someone has (which is usually next to nothing to begin with for a solo player just starting out) and completely forcing them to capsize their own ship and respawn across the map.[/i]


The straw that breaks the camels back for me is that [b]everything you've accumulated in your ship is trashed when you logout[/b].
All those storage containers filled with food, cannonballs, wood, etc... Gone...
Why pick them up in the first place? The ship's existing containers can hold more than you could ever hope to use to begin with and even they get emptied back to the starting amount.
The additional containers remain if your ship is sunk, you say? So what?! They've either been looted by the time you get back, are being used as bait by the crew that killed you or are so far away from your respawn point that you might as well loot the random barrels at your spawn point and move on.

The only things that permanently follow you are the cosmetics you buy but they don't provide any functional benefits so what is the point of anything in this game?
There is no real progress other than faction reputation which, in the end, only gives you more opportunities to gain gold and buy more useless cosmetics...

All in all, the aim of the game is to look pretty and barely have a fighting chance unless you can force your friends to buy a game they can only ever really play when you also have the time to play.

Also there are hotkeys and console spiral menu things and they don't interface with each other nor with the use of a mouse.  You have to hold Q and press numbers to swap tools.  So the combos are Q+1 and Q+2, etc.  Give those combos a try while using WASD.  Yeahhhhh, console.  You have to learn how to play, then remap every key because nobody that designed this game has ever touched a keyboard before.

Consoles are worse than butt AIDS and if you play a game on a console you should disown yourself and either become a hermit, a mime, or a monk with a vow of silence because absolutely nobody wants to hear your opinion.

____________________

The PROS. The visual of the water and the experience of the actual sailing is very well done. The water looks great, the feel of the ship riding over the shifting waves and through storms and all is very well done. The main graphics are cartoonish and a lot like Team Fortress (concerning character models and textures.). But as far as the water and the feel of sailing, it's very well done.

The ship-to-ship combat is a lot of fun. It's pretty simple, but it's an addicting experience to unload your cannons into the hull of another ship, or to screw them up with the ridiculous specialty cannon-balls that you can find and use.

There are some cool things in the game which make it interesting for a while. The fishing (which could be implemented better), using rowboats, trying to find different rare treasures to sell for a decent value. 

____________________

The CONS

The melee and gun combat is horrendous. The sword-fighting especially. It's very clunky, and feels more primitive and worse than the old Daggerfall game.. Unfortunately, there are a handful of very vocal and subjective fans to the game that instead of trying to better the game, act as purists and treat the game like the Holy Grail it isn't, and pretend it doesn't need to be improved upon. 

There isn't nearly enough variety in the weapons, or the fighting. You get four weapons to choose from (But you can only carry two at a time.) The Sword, Pistol, Sniper, and the Blunderbuss (shotgun). And each are quite underwhelming, especially the cumbersome sword.

This is more an opinion but one that is highly shared. The lack of any improvements to anything in the game. You can't purchase better cannons, better equipment, better weapons. Nothing. No matter how many hours you put into the game, you will never gain anything from it besides the purely cosmetic features for your ship, and your character - and different titles. The small group of subjective loyalists will scream like banshees that this is the purpose of the game. To keep ""everyone on a level playing field"". Which is fine as a concept, sure. But ultimately, it provides no incentive and it relishes in a boring long-term experience.

The biggest issue with the game, is its portrayal of itself as a full-fledged gaming experience. But after you put some time into it, you realize it's more a sandbox demo experience. It still feels like it is in early-access. It leaves you just wanting more. It delivers a salivating little experience which is all far too short and too shallow, and just leaves you wishing it were a better game with more depth.

Is the game worth it? Sure! If you can get it for free, or for a very cheap price. But the game definitely isn't worth any full price. I'd top it off at a $15 value at best.",1596909334,1596912594,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197978779479,67,9,1360,0,1360,1596908465

When you launch the game for the first time, it wants you to log in with Xbox Live, which is you know, unusual, but why not i guess.

I connected my accounts, picked my character, and started playing. The game was locked at 30 fps stable which i spend 15 minutes on fixing it - it was so confusing i dont even remember how i did it at this point -. I didn't also had a proper tutorial, just some texts that tell me which button does what, but thats it. 
Needless to say, usage of buttons were also bad, you had to press a button to climb stairs, etc. It could be a simple thing for new players but after playing lots of games unlike that, it was a challange to me.
Gravity seems to be broken. I instantly fell down and glitched out in a few situations without understanding whats going on. Animations didn't also impressed me all, they look like they are made by a 12 year old.

But other than that, graphics look cute, and i liked the particle effects, I think it could be more optimized though.
Doesn't worth the money, not sure if i'll play this again, maybe with friends.

Edit: I tried to play with one of my friends, and Xbox Live wasnt really helping us at this point. It felt like they made it confusing so users would spend too much time on it to decrease refund rates.. 

TL&DR: Everything is just too confusing. The UI, The game itself, the mechanics, etc. It's clearly not beginner friendly. Didn't give me a good first impression, not recommended.",1596877119,1596885368,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198836843977,47,17,126,0,26,1598736681

i love the stories in tall tale.
but it just a bunch of repetition when doing voyages and gathering money.

its fun when played with friends and random crew.
but feel a bit lonely when played by ourselves.

love the : music, graphic, gameplay, riddle and stories.
its too hard to find people who want to play together randomly tho.

i recommended this game if u have friends to play with.
if you are a lone wolf i dont recommend it.

btw, the player in a server is too low i think. its really hard to met other crew when we are sailing or stopped in an island.
i want to met people even if it means fighting other crew or just playing music and talking together.

63,73901357,english,"Still just earning my sea legs, but here's a review of my experience so far.

Hours simply sail by. The tutorial is an incredible safe environment for you to learn the mechanics. From handling all the different pulleys on your boat, to how to sail a ship, how to hunt for treasure and all the good stuff. (If you are thorough, you can even leave the tutorial area w enough gold and doubloons to immediately get yourself a nice piraty look.)

Once you finally reach the Sea of Thieves you are treated to gorgeous environments, a neat small port where you quickly get acquainted with the different factions and shops, and from where you can start sailing.

I haven't had any PvP yet, so I'll focus on the PvE. Cannons feel great to fire. The sound, the way they move, having to lead your shots, everything adds to it. The sloop is extremely easy to solo sail, so you'll get a good feeling for what you have to do. Guns are incredibly powerful, but the ammo is limited, which is a good way to keep things balanced. Melee is simplistic. Some polish wouldn't hurt, as sometimes it's hard to proper block and counter, but it's something you can get used to, nonetheless.

Visually speaking, the game is stunning. Be it at the break of dawn, or the dark of night, the sea looks incredible, the sky reminds you of how small you are, and the tropical feel of the islands around you make you feel like you're back in the Caribbean. The audio is also quite immersive, helping you forget about the world around you as you sail the waves and run around the deck.

Navigating is pretty fun. Using the map for the quests, locating your destination and then setting sail there feels excellent. It can be tricky to find the right island in the cabin's map, but once you do there's a tingling feeling of wander and you just want to set sail.

Overall, if you want a game you can zone out to, if you want to explore gorgeous islands for booty, or even just take your sloop to high sea, salvage wreckage and fish for a while, this is the game for you.
You might not enjoy it if you're looking for a story-driven game, then you might want to look at Tempest or something like it, but I strongly recommend this game if you just want to enjoy a great experience.

6,71201568,english,"This game is very pretty and for whatever reason it's really enjoyable to sail around on a boat in the ocean, something i would hate to do irl. It's great to play with friends but playing solo is viable as well with a smaller ship. If it weren't for the PvP i wouldn't enjoy this game nearly as much, but it's cool that you can fire cannons at other players and sink them and take all their loot. It has a bit of a learning curve for some because a majority of the game is spent on the sea and not everyone is used to piloting a boat. 

The stuff you collect each time you play is lost after the session like cannon balls and food and wood, but when you sell the valuables to the traders you keep all the gold and get a fresh ship each time. The size of ship to choose depends on the number of people you are playing with. You can play with 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4 players and playing solo is not necessarily a disadvantage if you know what you are doing. I haven't really played a game like this before and i enjoy it. You can really lose track of time just sailing around to different islands and braving storms.

On my last adventure i was greeted by other players at an outpost with cannon balls, so i reciprocated and then managed to escape. Unfortunately in doing so i had ventured out to the location of a big chompy boi who did not hesitate to circle my ship and then take a couple bites. The second time knocked me off the ship which zoomed away and left me in the ocean. Big chompy boi seemed to have left but to smaller chompy bois had arrived for lunch.

You will get hit by lightning, and you will catch fire. Get to know your bucket well, because you'll need to scoop a lot of water, but also might want something to puke in so you can toss it on your friends.

Edit: The game is beautiful don't get me wrong. It looks exactly like the store page images even more pretty. Gameplay mechanics are very good and easy to learn.

(3 months of play so far):  I'm really liking this format for a pirate game so far.  Open world and lots of choice each time you play of what kind of adventure you want to play that day: could be a grand Tall Tale, a couple quests for various factions, hunt and loot other pirates, explore, or just casual fishing and scavenging... the choice yours.  And I like that idea a lot; especially because pirating is supposed to be about freedom and this game gives that freedom while having a very intriguing and interesting ever-evolving storyline / lore.


Lots of fun once you get into it.  Watching others on YouTube and Twitch helps a lot if you're new (or need tips).  Good way to learn; and it's really interesting how no one can 'buy their way' to more power in the game ..... you actually have to get better at the skills in the game .... what a concept!

Graphics: Absolutely gorgeous. 

Design: The only thing I that about the game is that the avatars are FUGLY. But you don't ever ""see"" your avatar so I forgot about it after a while. (and plus it is probably more realistic lol). Other than that, the rest of the game is downright wonderfully designed. If I explain too much it will take away from the game so I will just leave that there.

Social: This is pretty good. You can play by yourself or with other people (but its REALLY hard to play solo).  They have an in-game chat (both voice and text). You can also fight other people, but I'm the kind of person to run away. lol.

Game-play: When you play for the first time you are going to be confused out of your mind so follow every tutorial and REMEMBER them. HOWEVER, this is actually an allure of the game. You get to experience what it is really like to be a pirate. 

Mechanics: The mechanics of ship sailing is awesome. I feel like I learned a thing or two.

16,73710213,english,"This game is the top of the line, make your own adventure type game! I was a participant of the Closed Beta and it is amazing to see how far Sea of Thieves has progressed. 

I have been asked by some friends, ""what do you even do in Sea of Thieves?"" The answer is really, its up to you! When the game first released, there was:
-Gold Hoarders (Go out and find buried treasure by solving riddles and looking at maps)
-Order of Souls (Go out and fight skeletons)
-Merchants Alliance (Go and collect materials or animals to sell)

But now, they have added soooo much more:
-Skull forts (take on wave after wave of skelletons to try to take their loot)
-The Kraken and the Megaladon (frightening random encounters, which happen more often than you might want when cargoing loot)
-Skelleton ships (a worthy aponant from the depths of the seas)
-Ghost ships (equally as menacing)
-A battle royal mode to get you into some action quickly!
-The ability to team up with other ships using ""Alliance Flags""
-The ability to stack/upgrade your gold intake by hoysting an ""Emissary Flag"" giving you a boost of one company for how much you work for them.

And that is all the stuff that you choose to do on your own, not to mention the ""Tall Tales"" which are basically like the games story mode, with some sweet items to get if you complete all the achievements!

Now, note before you buy:
-I have bought both the Windows 10 store version, and the steam version. For some reason, I have better quality gameplay on the Steam version. Faster frame-rate, better connectivity, less issues connecting to friends.

A couple things I wish were changed/added (If the Devs See this)
1. It would be amazing if you could change the type of ship you have from the outposts. If a new friend comes in, instead of having to re-start the crew, we should be able to change from a sloop to a brigantine or galleon in the game.
2. It would be awesome if we could hire/buy AI skeletons to run the ship like the ghost ship, especially on a Galleon, 4 people almost never feels like enough.
3. Kind of on the same note, it would be amazing if we could change how many people could be on a ship, even if that means seperate servers for ""Double Crew"", and have 4 people on a sloop, 6 on a Brig, and 8 on a galleon. I know I have more than a few friends who want to be on the same crew.
4. OR, if we cannot have that many on one ship, it would be amazing if MULTIPLE crews could join the same server easily. So, two brigs of friends could spawn in, make an alliance using the alliance flag, and then sail away with eachother.

I hope that the Devs see this, and for the players reading, I will see you on the Sea of Thieves!",1596474300,1596474300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129170586,127,55,8194,0,909,1599075102

Three new trashy sailors buy their way into sailing their first voyage, and with excitement and minimal preparation they set of. as the captain looks upon the treasure map, he realises it is glowing with embers. he warns his fellow crewmates, but none of them becomes scared of the luring danger. the treasure is said to be great, and a great treasure is only alluring.
as the sails are set and the wind hits them, they fare of with great speed, towards the island described to them with nothing but a picture.
the first island was a piece of cake, so they venture forth to the 2nd island with courage and self-confidence. as they near this omnious island, they hit a thick fog - within seconds the ship hits shore and rams straight into a volcano, 2 fly of screaming, as the ship roars and crashes into this volcano, and the captains frantic efforts seems to no avail, as he is now left alone with 7 holes and water flowing into the ship. the ship gets fixed, and they nervously venture forward. 10 seconds later, another volcano erupts into flames and giant rocks of lava hurls down upon the ship, breaking the mast and setting everything on fire, while the ship sinks faster than you can think - the crewmates frantically screams and tries to fix the ship, while these gigantic balls of fire rains down upon them.

[spoiler] Well... I`m a big fan of competitive games (CS,Dota,SC,OW).
But... the only thing is...  There is no any competition. At all. Most of the players are looking for EASY fights. No one sniping ACE player from another team, or trying to hard carry etc.
It`s not about fair fight. Most of the time galleon attacks just respawned empty sloop and it`s mostly fights 4 vs 1-2 players. And if you try to fight sloop vs sloop - everyone just... run away ) Even those guys with shiny skins (wtf?). 
PvP in this game looks like fighting with the rats.... quite rare guy will fight with you 1vs1 or 2vs2... but if you are outnumbered... well... ""now lets do it"" )

The sound design is brilliant, with contextual music and great sound effects. Overall the atmosphere of sailing the ocean is unlike anything you've played in another game, and is enough to recommend Sea of Thieves.
There are a few things that could be improved. Melee combat, which feels a bit floaty and disconnected. More enemies, island styles and themes would also be interesting. The megalodon and kraken are so intimidating and interesting, it would be nice to see more sea leviathan style enemies and dangers in the ocean. 
Overall SoT is a very original and innovative game and it deserves credit for that. As long as they keep adding content it should be well worth your money and time.",1596366895,1596366895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970460797,817,265,12367,183,3524,1601313622

31,73636570,english,"The core gameplay loop is great, fantastic even. The combat feels weighty and scavenging for supplies to boost your performance in a fight is a fun little mini-game to play alongside the core pirate swords and sails gameplay. However, until they fix these two critical issues this game is a waste of your money and your time.

1. No progression. There is literally no progression in the game. Every gameplay element is either unlocked from the start or available to find in the world. The only thing gold is good for is buying cosmetic items. Can't purchase supplies, can't unlock upgrades, just cosmetics. Other than the gameplay itself there is literally no point to play and no point to even care about the loot.

2. Respawning. Currently, if your ship is sunk you and your crew will respawn a short distance away with the bare essentials by way of supplies. I played four hours today and two of them were spent fighting another ship that we had defeated fairly the first time... and then again, and then again, and then again, because they would keep rushing back to fight. And a barebones ship is still a threat, make no mistake. You have to stop and address them. We didn't even get the loot because they'd managed to suicide bomb our ship with a powder keg they'd found, which caused us to dump the loot in the water, thus queuing a mutual zerg rush to lose ship after ship on the beach next to the loot repeatedly.

The devs don't and won't read this, but until they implement this single simple fix this game is practically unplayable:
Sunk ships respawn on a new server. Simple fix that prevents the zerg rush, and while it won't make the loot worth a gnat's fart it at least will stop fighting over loot from being a soul-crushing, frustrating, tedious slog.",1596339287,1596339287,False,3,0,0.523615658283233643,1,True,False,False,76561198037565180,432,14,285,0,285,1596337916

79,73608968,english,"Sea of Thieves is a really fun game and is quite enjoyable. I do recommend playing it with friends as it not only gets easier to manage everything but also becomes a lot more fun. 

In Sea of Thieves you cannot play offline and grind for fun you automatically play online on servers with other players. With my experience and how I encountered the game the more players you have the more players there will be on the server (that was my experience and how my friends and I encountered it). Playing alone puts you on a tiny ship where another player can be. When you are on a 3 man the boat gets bigger and harder to manage I do not know whether it changes again with 4 people I played in a 3 man group. The 2 man boat is the easiest to not just control but also to manage but it isn't as fast as the 3 man ship.

It has a fairly nice grinding mechanic to it. You find an island, plunder the stuff that is there (if you don't have a mission) and leave. If you have missions you find the island you are suppose to go to and do either solve the riddle or dig up the treasure from the treasure map that you will receive.

The game do have events which are showed in the sky (you'll know what I mean when you see it) which all players can see and go to.

The game can have people that try and just kill you and your boat which is a bit annoying but it is to be expected when the game is literally just ""plunder all you can"". If you go into the game and play it when you see another ship you can expect it to either see you and go for you or not see you and just go away. There is some players that will ally up for some time so they can complete what they have and then just sail off.

Overall the game is really fun and puts you somewhat into the shoes of a pirate and how it technically could be. Super fun game really beautiful to look at as well and is definitely recommended to play but mostly only with friends as it becomes even more fun. More so when you bully them a bit :)",1596290600,1596290600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065445346,141,29,1194,0,446,1596394716

While the gameplay itself is relaxing and simplistic, the game does not respect your time. A lot of time is spent navigating the seas, uncovering treasure, and having it all taken away in a minute by a stranger. While this might be the intended playstyle, a pirates life, it isn't conductive for good gameplay. Spending an hour scouring the beaches for loot to have it your boat sunk in a matter of moments is a night-ender. 

There are also many infrastructure issues in the game, and I have not played for more than an hour without annoying lag, or unresponsive systems.

On the positive, the game oozes style and beauty. It really is a marvel of a game visually, and scratches that Pirates of the Caribbean itch.

[b]A day like any other[/b]
While heading to an island for a bog standard treasure hunt on a bog standard evening sail, my brother and I complained that the hunt would be difficult in the fog that had unfortunately spawned around it. As we gathered closer the newest event also spawned at that very island, meaning we were so close we had a chance to take it for our own before the rest of the server arrived to challenge us for the newest loot.
Being the skeptical pirate, I rested our Sloop at the rear of the island that backed onto the map edge, meaning anyone approaching the isle would not see we were there. The fog only aided this more.
We begin this event fighting a skeleton pirate lord, a multiple stage fire breathing pve nightmare vs two lads and their swords in one hand and their bananas in the other. With such a large health pool we had been kidding ourselves thinking we had time to complete this solo!
In the final stage of the fight, another Sloop arrived who sat just off shore without approaching. The two aboard did not fire on us, but they did not assist either. That’s fine, we can fight them off later or share the loot to make things easy. We did not expect a 4 per Galleon to arrive not long after who were also friendly but assisted us in completing the event. With the boss down and loot spawning all around, we returned to our Sloop to bring around the rowboat and divvy the loot. 

[b]Mistaken Identity[/b]
Unfortunately this is when the other sloop entered the island in our place, and split the loot with the Galleon. By the time we had brought around the rowboat the Galleon was anchor up and sails down, heading towards the nearest outpost to sell. Gadzooks, I hid the Sloop too well. They didn’t realize there was a 3rd crew!
I jumped from our rowboat into the waters, stealthy boarding the Sloop who was following the Galleon. While clinging to the rope ladder hanging from the side as the two aboard organized the ship, I found a moment they were both below deck and sprinted and climbed to the crows nest to hide unnoticed. Success!
A few minutes later, the Galleon ahead had the misfortune of running into a Kraken, who’s inky surroundings halts a ship in place. Karmic laughter from my brother and I over discord, we were keen to see how this played out. As the Sloop approached the Kraken to assist it’s demise, I call out over in-game chat that “I don’t trust these guys, shoot them!” to which both ships knew they were not the ones calling out.

[b]Mistaken Identity 2: Electric Boogaloo[/b]
One misplaced shot at the Kraken that hits the Galleon later and war broke out. Boarding, cannon fire, firebombs. Within seconds a cannon hits the crows nest and I’m sent flying back into the waters. Eating my last banana while swimming back to the surface, I find that the Galleon is set to sail directly overhead! Adjusting for turning and speed, I grab the rope ladder hanging from the side and catch a ride to see how this plays out. Again waiting to hear all footsteps below deck I chance a moment to sprint to the back of ship to hide again.
But, what’s this? The loot from the island is still on the rowboat strapped to the back of the ship! Without hesitation I jump in and detach, calling over discord for a ride home. 

[b]Great Escape[/b]
Rowing away from the fight I noticed another ship had approached the Kraken laden Galleon to strike opportunity. This had become a three way fight, of which I was leaving the victor.
This entire time my brother had been keeping our Sloop close but not engaged to support a quick getaway, and one masterful hand brake turn at full speed while I attached the rowboat meant just that. We’re away and sailing directly into the wind. We know the Galleon is the fastest ship on the seas with tailwind, but the Sloop is the fastest with headwind. They give up after a couple of minutes and we’re safely disengaged with the brand new, rare skeleton lord skull.

tl;dr: convinced two crews to start a fight, stole the good loot while they’re both distracted

85,73543498,english,"The Positive: Extremely fun game to play with friends! Beautiful graphics and performance.

I remember watching game play of this back around when it was new, once I seen it on steam me and my bro decided to give it a try. The graphics are beautiful! Doing the quests feel exciting and rewarding, It's not pay to win or anything like that, everything in the shops and what you can buy with the in game currency is cosmetic only; so your on even footing with every other player out there. You can play the game however you want, you can hunt for other players and steal from them and believe me they can and will steal from you eventually. Figuring out what to do for the quests involving riddles is very fun, I usually can figure them out but there's been a few I had to look up. Controlling a ship with a crew is some of the most fun Iv'e had playing online, there's so many little things that Sea of Thieves just nails to give you the feeling of being a pirate on the open seas. 

The Negative: Toxic Players, xbox account is required (don't need xbox live), players can hide on your boat and be near impossible to spot

The game is doable Solo, although it's so much harder to deal with an enemy team who is dead set on getting your loot. The players I have encountered while solo have been some of the most toxic people I have ever had the displeasure of playing with. I'm still pretty new so I don't know how everything works, Iv'e been chased all the way across the map while putting up a good fight, keeping my ship afloat and killing the enemy players pursuing me as they try and board my boat.  I'm not sure yet how to deal with a scenario described above but I do know there is built in matchmaking so playing solo is a choice.

Conclusion: Sea of Thieves is a fun game that offers some high risk high reward pirate like adventures with friends and foes on the open seas. I'd give it an 8/10 overall and would recommend anyone that was on the edge of buying this game to give it a try with some friends.",1596166361,1596166361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052728334,57,5,3478,0,2432,1597726975

Sea of Thieves is a game developed by Rare Ltd. and published by Xbox Games Studios

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Sea of Thieves overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great pirate adventure game to play in short bursts!

IF I WERE TO ADD ON TO THIS GAME **COUGH COUGH DEVS**
-> More weapons/customization: We're pirates. We throw crazy parts on our weapons and make them the ultimate death machine. Add more weapons and add part customization to weapons.
-> Ship customization: I'm not talking pay-for aesthetics. Running down to the bottom of a galleon for supplies sucks. If we could move item crates and customize ship layouts in a pre-game lobby (that we can save and re-load when we start new sessions), that would be awesome! Cannons on the middle level, anyone?

The core mechanics run smoothly and feel just right, there are bugs from time to time, mostly audio related, however, they are easily fixable.

The lore, main quests and voyages are quite addictive and can keep you on a single server for hours, especially if you represent a faction/company.

The PVP in this game is fun and engaging, sometimes enraging. The bullet shots are not hitscan and there is a bit of a learning curve, however, there is no weapon bloom if aimed downsight. Bear in mind that there are other factors that would change the trajectory of the shot bullet (shooting after being launched from a cannon; shooting while in a moving ship etc.). Losing your loot to another crew would be demotivating and rage inducing at first but you get used to it eventually and git gud. There is also an Arena game mode where you can practice your PvP skills.

Overall a great sandbox game! It might become bland from time to time but Rare amps it up with a new update including different activities, new items, loot and cosmetics

16,73482520,english,"What's that? You don't care? Apparently neither do Rare.

What initially posed itself as a game i've been waiting a long time for, from a company I regarded as one of the best in the business, has now for me become an emblem of the failures of modern day gaming.

Image and hype generates more profit than quality or substance. That's because rather than people having to work to earn money, and then decide how they're going to invest it, they are instead being given money, for doing nothing, by either mommy and daddy or the state, and spend it frugally on anything shiny waved in their face.

Why does my opinion matter at all? I've been playing videogames since I was 4. I was a big RARE fan, played kameo, enjoyed viva pinata a lot, and loved BK Nuts and Bolts. I'm a massive pirate fan (not historical, but fantasy piracy), and I love experience-centric, immersive, non-grindy games. I'm a game designer of about 7 years experience and i've played many games across many genres and formats and cultures.

The concept of sea of thieves is very close to the exact concept I'd use if I was given an experienced games development team and 4 years to build a game. The core design would be pretty much identical.

So to be honest, if the game doesn't appeal to me, it has failed to appeal to the very people it should be tailored towards. Instead it seems to be tailored half towards office workers who don't see the outside world very often, and half towards bored fortnite players who want to stream footage of themselves being pirates for the views and lulz.

The kraken was a dissapointment. Rank 50 with the guilds was a dissapointment. The firt pirate legends was a dissapointment. 50% of the voyages where you sail for 10 minutes, search an island for poorly written riddles or fight awkward enemies for 15 minutes, sail to an outpost for 5 minutes and then get 80 - 200 gold as a reward is a dissappointment. The sailing is exactly the same everytime. The pvp is exactly same 90% of the time.

A worst of all, worse than the poor quality design, the lag, bugs, glicthes, pc / xbox combat disparity, lack of content and lack of variety, is the community. A spattering of logical, sensible individuals attempting to constructively critiscize the game in order to improve it being drowned out by waves of loyalists and zealots, mindless defending the game and defaming any opposition without even a single logical point or relevant argument in sight. Moderators that close entire threads rather than ban offending individuals. A tolerance of opinions and users who are clearly not interested in discussion or debate on a DISCUSSION FORUM, but who are more than happy to tote their opinion as evidence of the game's merits.

And this game they claimed 'isn't COD or PUBG, it's unique and revoutionary and doing it's own thing'. Meh, being unique is dandy, but being unique and lazy and complacent is no more commendable than being a high quality, committed clone of another product. If Sea of Thieves being 'unique' and somewhat unusual is the only merit you need to enjoy this game, you're standards are exceptionally low.

Okami was unique. Pikmin was unique. Journey. Fable 1. Rock of Ages. Limbo. Undertale. Makai Kingdom. Viva Pinata. Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. Spyro. Metal Arms: Glitch in the System. Pirates: Legend of Black Cat. Overboard! Brutal Legend. Left 4 Dead.

All games I could argue are good for reasons other than 'because I like them'. All games released with a variety of content. Narrative / progression of some sort, not necessarily vertical, or even horizontal. Consistancy of design (if a shotgun to the face kills you, so does a pistol round. Quality across the entire experience.

Sea of thieves lack ALL of these things. There are two way this goes now. We continue with this culture of false respect, hype and over promotion compensating for lack of sustance or quality, and find the games we're playing becoming ever more dissappointing and worthless investments of time and money. OR, we stop supporting trash beyond the point of sticking with it through years of deveopment, tens sometimes hundreds of hours of design and suggesiton, and force them to improve their attitudes, approach and commitment by the only means they understand, money.

When the money stops pouring in for trash and starts moving towards quality games and quality developers, we'll all start seeing more games like what Sea of thieves should have been, and less like what Sea of Thieves actually is.

Quite frankly, if you're going to spend £50 / $60 on a game based purely on what they tell you you're getting, you're a fool. And fools don't do the playing, they get played. Play demos. Read reviews. Listen to freinds. Watch footage. Don't pay until it's been earnt. I've put 80 ish hours into this game, for virtually no reward, and fairly hollow memories when compared to actually leaving the house and meeting real people. I've not paid a penny to play it. And that's the way it should be.

This is my last thread anyway. After 50+ detailed suggestions for the game and what I guess is around 400 - 500 responses to other threads, ""I wash my hands of this madness"". ""Doldrums, sir, has the entire crew on edge.""

19,71672094,english,"As you may guess from my playtime, I do like, and sail, the Sea of Thieves quite a lot.
So why the negative review?
Simple, some people shouldn't touch this booty with a ten foot shovel.

At its core this is a bastard simulator.
There is pve, where you are going to find treasures, battle Kraken or deliver plants that die unless watered(Yarrrr).
But in a true pirate fashion, pirates, as in other players can, and will attack you.

And here the problem lies.
You are going on your first journey, spending 10 minutes sailing, an hour on the quest, and then, when you are sailing to a port, to cash in your reward, you are boarded.
You did not see or hear the boarding, as you are up against players who have 2000+ hours in the game. They know tricks.
Or they just sail up to you, as there is no tutorial explaining how to effectively sail, and you suck at it.

You are now repeatedly killed. 
The games tutorial is a bad joke, created for old players going archievement hunting, no one told you that shotguns are useless unless you aim with the right mouse button.
You do not know how the sword works, and you do not know that cooked food passively regenerates your health.
You are up against people, who do know that, and every other trick.
So why do they kill you over and over again?
To loot your ships supplies if you are lucky. Because they are ""real pirates"" if you are unlucky. 
They are going to tell you in the latter case.
Of course you can scuttle your ship, to avoid respawning into renewed rounds of humiliation.
But that option is hidden away in an options menu under ""my crew"", so as a new player, you don't know of it.

This deliberate crippling of new players seems to be by design, new players are supposed to be ""EZ LOOT... jk"", as the loving moniker for steamplayers in official communication is.
This is best shown by a range of emotes that, while some are free, must be purchased in the real-money store.
The emotes in question are the ""hide"" emotes, that also hide a players name.
A new player will not know that this is possible.
Veteran players use it routinely to ""tuck"" on ships, and then spring the trap after the ship in question got loot, or is vulnerable.
Which is fun, If you know of the possibility.
Not so much if you don't.

If you do not like pvp, if you do not like to lose hours of playtime, without a chance to prevent it, or retaliate, then stay away.
If you do not like to be helpless prey for the first many, many hours in game, then turn around and never return.

If you can laugh that away, then this game might be for you, and then all the nice stuff everyone else writes is going to come true.

In any case: Before you buy, you should watch lets-plays. 
And remember: You are going to be the butt of that joke.

Edit, to clarify, after reading the comments: 
I wrote this review shortly after reaching pirate legend(the first big grind) at around 200 hours. I am still playing, mostly as a reaper(the pvp faction). 
If you think I wrote this because I am bad at the game, or don't like pvp, you missed the point entirely.
I would choose pvp-servers, should they decide to add pve-servers.
I do however think it fair, that people should know that pure pve is not viable, and that hey are going to be at the complete mercy of a certain kind of people. 
On that note: A big thank you to everyone commenting, much appreciated.
I also wanted to give some hints to new players.
All the stuff I wrote, that I did not know?

Gameplay:
Interesting and fun PVE adventure game play, awesome character and ship customization. 

PVP gameplay is both thrilling and exciting, everybody has the same stats so the playing field is level, however, although rare, aimbot cheaters still exist on the server.

Graphics:
Probably this is the game with the best water simulation and the sceneries are simply stunning.  

Server issues:
Previously there was a server issue that caused players losing all of their progress on that day, the bug existed since two years ago and they still haven't found a solution to that yet.

Then we had another go and got eaten by a kraken.  At least that seems fair enough.

If this sort of 'welcome' continues I will not be finding out if the game has anything to it more satisfying as it will become one of the very few things that gets deleted off my hard drive.

78,73431343,english,"Alright you little wanna be pirate king's, I've felt that I've wasted enough of my life on this game that I should tell you all how I feel about it.

This game itself is AMAZING... at first.
Graphics are astonishing, it runs smoothly, the controls are very fluid, and the some-what story line is very engaging.

Anything else after that is just revolving around repetition.

Going to the same islands, fighting the same monsters, completing the same events, obtaining the same items, reselling them to the same merchants. Naturally, that's going to be boring, BUT that's not the main issue here.

The issue occurs when you have a ton of loot and have to carry it onto your ship ONE by ONE whilst being UNABLE TO SPRINT so you have to walk from point A to point B. You could be holding something as small as a key and still have to walk at the speed of a broken leg and to me personally, this is a literal joke.

Another major issue is the imbalance between players. See, as a single player with a 2 man ship, you could complete one of the skull events and get completely screwed over by some losers waiting in the distance with a 4 man ship, and the fact that there is no safezones, even at major locations such as the ports or harbors adds onto the fact that you've wasted a few hours of your life farming loot just for people to take it from you and there is LITERALLY NOTHING you can do about it. 

Well...  at least on the bright side you won't have to spend another hour or two putting it onto your ship AND another hour or two taking it off to sell to merchants.

6/10 from me.

Some thing's I'd highly recommend to improve the game's QOL.

1. Monster variants. I'm tired of fighting skeletons that run away from you and sharks that swim around in circles around your boat.

2. Safezones. I don't want to have to add another 2 hours onto the 2-3 that I've invested running from User5849872 cause he saw me comming from the direction in which he was headed.

3. Allow people to run or speed walk while holding items. I can understand that not being able to run with a chest is logical but bro, you telling me that the key I gotta use TO OPEN the chest is almost as heavy as the chest itself? C'mon man, get it together.

2,72310568,english,"Game is immensely fun and easy to understand.

Pros: 
- You don't need a strong PC to run it.
- A LOT of achievements to collect. 
- Game is extremely beautiful to look at.
- It's not a pay to win game.
- The cosmetics does't help you in any shape or form.
- Campaign is fun and satisfying to do.
- It's a simple grinding game, you need gold for everything. 
- Game will take at least 600 hours to have done every main mission and unlocked every cosmetic. 
- Friends can join your crew without leaving the server.
- Game isn't difficult, you just need to understand riddles and figure out traps and puzzles. 
- There is no fast travel, so it's a race to the chest and fight till you survive. 
- Fishing is fun, more then I can say for other games. 

Cons:
- You WILL struggle to play this game alone, most people play a party of 3. It's not impossible to play alone, it's just when you are alone and have chests or other treasure to give in and someone attacks you, you have almost no chance to win, because you will sale a Sloop (max 2-person that is the slowest ship) and fight against a Brigantine (max 3-person), and the Galleon (max 4- person).
- If your ping is over 200 vs a player with 90, you will lose sword fights.
- People can attack you anytime, anywhere! There are no safe zones.
- You can't save anything you collect, when you leave the game, all the stuff you horded on your ship will disappear.

But if you aren't expecting opposition from other players (especially in a game about pirates)  you don't need to be playing video games.

and to those that whine about soloing, there's open crews, also it's not that fucking hard to make a friend unless you really are just a completely unapproachable person, even online.

(Hoo Boy, this'a long 'un!)

You don't specifically need friends to play this game, as you can access open crews and be matched with random players across the globe.
The world is beautifully crafted with a well built lore surrounding it, the graphics look great even on lower end settings.
The quest system is fantastic and fun, each step of the journeys upon which you may embark have their own little jovial tune, making the adventure much more memorable.
The core gameplay loop of ""buy voyage, sail to island, perform required task, sell task item"" may sound droning, however with the variety of chests to dig up, the number of skeletons to fight, and however many times you'll meet the Ferryman all add to the overall adventure, making each journey unique in their own little ways.
Each trading company has their own unique types of voyages, allowing you to pick your favorite!

So what are you waiting for? Get a voyage from a trading company, fill your sails with the roaring wind and embark on your adventure!

And remember!

Problem 1: People camp on near islands to wait out the raid that you fought for. What happened to me, : I finished the raid got the vault unlocked then they came over and killed me and sunk my ship.""
Problem 2: When in a alliance  you should not be able to damage or sink other friendly ships and not be able to kill you. ""I got betrayed two time and then got kick out of the alliance."" 

Fort Solution 1: Disable the fort entirely.
Fort Solution 2: You can use the merchant method witch is the paper with the signature on it, In this case it will be inside the fort and who ever claims the paper can and only get the reword even if some one steels and sells it. The paper should or will be with your unique gamer ID

Alliance Solution 1: If someone ask you if you what to become allies then the power should stay the same as when not on a alliance  but you can not kill or sink each other. when you join the alliance the persons can ether join or not but if they do the only they can choose when to leave the alliance. 

P.S In future updates with the custom severs you should give the option of PvP or PvE on Adventure mode.

I loved this game in concept, but within 7 hours of playtime I saw people using clear cheats (invisibility, teleporting) and using racial slurs in chat. I'm super disappointed.

Reasons to Play:
(1) Lots to do! There's literally something to do all the time and a large variety.
(2) Fun to play together! Random people to play with can be hit or miss, but regular friends to play with makes it oh so much better.
(3) Beautiful scenery! The game is stylish and beautiful. This is down to the different styles across the game including customizable outfits, weapons, ships, and more. Not to mention the literal scenery around you.
(4) Anything can happen! At any moment, you could run into another player ship, a ghost ship, the Kraken, a giant shark, and more. Every time you set out on an adventure, you never know what you will find.
(5) Unravel mysteries! There's a deeper lore than most people realize to this game. You just have to find it!
(6) Play music! Together or alone while your shipmates sail, the mood is set by your own instrumental choice.

Reasons NOT to play?
(1) You don't like dying occasionally! If you're going to get easily frustrated by setbacks, then either suck it up or drop anchor and play a game that doesn't have other players in it. Oh, and its not just the players that can kill you. The ocean is dangerous!
(2) You don't like pirates! If so, then why are you reading this anyway or considering this game?
(3) You don't like playing with others! Well, you don't HAVE to play with others in this game, but it's bound to happen eventually. Or go play a single player game.

All in all, jump in the blood-tainted ocean with us and go on an adventure! SEA YOU THAR, MATEY!",1595874137,1595874137,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976929132,195,11,1945,0,1891,1596591891

If you and your friends want some fun by exploring the pirate world , buy this game. The gameplay will be explained during the tutoral which last only about 10-15 minutes. Afterwards you know every important item and its use in the game. I would recommand to play the game with friends since playing it alone is not so funny and really difficult. It is an open world where everybody can attack you (players and NPCs). You are a pirat which means you can steal from other players , attack other players/NPCs and explore the world. You can go on an adventure( tall tales) or simly sail with your ship around the world and search for a fight. 

One of the best points in this game is that a player who has played this game for 100 hours has no advantage towards new players. There are treasures in the game which you can sell to receive in-game money but this money can only be used to buy skins for your ships or your character. These skins will give you no adantages in a fight. You can also use real money but only to buy pets (only cute and funny but have no real function) /emotions/special skins which again will give no advantage to the player. The game is fair since every time you start your game , everybody starts with the same conditions. The canons, foods and planks you collected the day before disappears when you finish your game. 

The game will give you no instructions what you should do. The point of this game is living a pirates life, do whatever you want to do.

It's relaxing sailing on the sea with the sounds of the water splashing onto your boat, and the game's graphics just make the world really beautiful to look at.

17,73333522,english,"So I've watched this game for many months, thinking it seemed very fun and was excited I could now play it on my new computer.

Loaded in and had a cool tutorial setup.  Wasn't an issue to grasp, had very pretty visuals and good musical cues.  I do know it will take me a bit of time to get acclimated to the inventory wheel system and hotkeys.  Unfortunately, as I was trying to get my feet under me and follow the tutorial, an NPC skeleton sloop spawned next to me within maybe 1-3 minutes of the voyage, killed me twice with cannons, and then sank me.  Respawned, brushed it off and set off on a new heading.  Was nearly at my first destination for my first castaway chest dig-up when another sloop came up and over the span of three to five minutes, killed, boarded, killed, and then sank my sloop.  Irritated, I tried again, got on the ship, headed for the isle, got there, dug up my first chest, started for the nearest outpost and another skeleton vessel spawned.  I managed to outrun it.  Okay, fine, but then between me and the nearest outpost was this glowing ship i think called a 'reaver?' that came up.  Tried to wave and avoid but they chased me down, killed me, and took my chest.

Overall just a really unpleasant, oppressive feeling start to the game.  I barely know where my wood, food, and sword buttons are and I'm getting roflstomped repeatedly.  It'd be nice if there was a way to flag your ship as ""New Player"" or ""Less than 10, 25, 50 hrs"" to try and promote a more pleasant experience where people don't just kill off potential new community members.  

Tempted to refund it.  Only reason I won't is due to the chance to play with friends.  If that doesn't happen soon or the same thing happens while with others I will likely do so.",1595805359,1595805359,False,3,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198068789486,73,2,101,0,101,1595804673

37,73323318,english,"Absolutely gorgeous and enjoyable controls  and game mechanics around sailing that, in itself is sufficient to have a lot of fun.
The game is some kind of sandbox where there are tons of things that could randomly happen, between missions you can request to kick off your journey, random encounters or parchments and journals laying around.
And the great thing is that you'll have to balance your greed and safe playing. Globally, roughly 16 players will be playing in teams, most probably against you but hopefuly, the map is huge.
It's pretty probable that a PvP encounter leads in catastrophic consequences and you lose everything so think twice before taking that new mission while you could head back and sell your precious loot.

So many things happen:
- Meet the Kraken
- Skeleton crew ships floating back from the deaths in the middle of your trip
- Megalodon that enjoys the wood of your tasty sloop
- Tough Skeleton captains which skull is valuable
- Treasure chests hidden under the X or behind a well thought riddle concept.
- Mermaids gem stones
- Ship wrecks
- cursed chests that will either burn or flood your ship
- Terrible storms that you wish you didn't underestimate.

The commands of the ship are simple but very fun to use:
Anchor, sail length and angle, navigation wheel, canons and balista. You may even manage to outrun your tail with a bit of skill.
Use fire or holes to sink your opponents so that they can't respawn, chop down their mast, board their ship.

Over all a super fun game that may only be slightly tainted by its PvP side.
It's possible to get away from most players but at some point, you will be hit by them and it could be frustrating.
And even if this is possible, I do not recommend playing this game alone.",1595788153,1595788538,True,1,0,0.505988001823425293,0,True,False,False,76561197967219542,520,79,3790,136,688,1600858652

Everything from serverlag for the entire EU servers, to an event that caused non of your progress to be recorded. See, even when that bug was active I still played because the devs and the community were claiming that even if my progress isn't showing up it is still being recorded. About 5 days later, with constant updates everyday from the devs on their progress to restore the progress, they dropped the bomb. The progress wasn't recorded and we were given a useless compensation that wasn't worth the while at all.

69,70426784,english,"Updated Review, older impressions below:

The game is just beautiful, honestly I wish there was more content in it, because I feel like I'm playing an openworld Windwaker, but the game is still incredibly shallow. I know it's a PVP game mostly, but the PVE stuff in it, is incredibly shallow. Game looks big as an ocean, but is shallow as a puddle. Other than that, PVP shenanigans are fantastic, the game just needs a lot more depth to it. Can I recommend a full price purchase? Only if you're like me and know it's a game where you make your own fun, the game will not help give you any fun after raising the water level to your toes, you'll have to find ways to have fun. 


Old impression: Wow, wow, and WOW. The closest I had to this game on PC was Blackwake, which is already amazing, but Sea of Thieves has literally blown me away. How does this game run on max settings on my pc at 1440p above 60 fps easily and my PC doesn't even break a sweat not even when I start recording, the fans don't come on, I don't get weird overheating framerate drops, my cpu remains steady and the game is super stable at high frame rates, but a 2D game with some 3d effects like Darkwood causes my graphics card and CPU to go into overdrive and I have to turn the jet engines on to cool my pc, and if I even think about turning on recording, the game has random freezes, especially Hunt: Showdown.

I will update this review as I play more of the game, but honestly, the first ten minutes just looking around and enjoying that classic RARE artstyle, it's the next best thing to Viva Pinata, AND sailing around with a friend, you feel like you're playing COOP Windwaker or something, the art style is gooooooorrgeous. I hope the gameplay lives up to these graphics, I'm all about looking to troll and be trolled by piracy in this game, I'll never moan about losing or dying in a game like this, it's all about the experience, especially in coop sailing.

72,73298253,english,"This review is going to be harsh yet honest. If you play solo this game is going to make you hate yourself and thank steam and sweet baby Jesus that there is a refund button. So this was my experience with the game, I started up the game and was greeted with a half ass attempt of a tutorial and was given a ship and told to sail to a nearby island. Steering a ship solo in this game is not fun because it feels like the night before Thanksgivining and your mom told you that the annoying grandma is coming and you now need to focus on cleaning every damn thing for the next 24 hours. So you start off by raising the anchor, dropping the sails, and steering the ship in a general direction. By the way when the sails are you literally cant see anything. You might as well get in your car throw on a off brand, off white pillow case on your head and drive around your neighborhood yelling you are a pirate while destroying every fucking mailbox along the way. So to remedy this, i  had to run up to the front of the ship look around and pretend i knew what to do, run back to the map room and realize i know fuck all, then finally run up to the steering wheel and frantically turn because that is a rock and i am a naked pirate. i finally got to this island and it felt like i landed in fucking Oklahoma. There was nothing there but empty land, skeletons, and my will to live which was rapidly depleting each minute i endured this. I slapped a fish, slapped a statue and realized it hurt me so i started swinging faster but it broke before i could end my misery. I finally found out i had a shovel and started looking for my will to live but instead i found a chest... wo. I yeeted it onto my ship and did everything on the ship like a crack fueled sailor until i literally slammed onto the island i needed to be on. i turned it in and got enough gold to buy a gun that looked like it came out of a great value fallout. So i was like hey maybe playing online is better. I joined a random crew and was immediately locked in the brig and couldn't do a damn thing which forced me to leave the game. My friend then told me he also makes poor life decisions and bought the game as well. We joined up and realized YOU CANT USE YOUR STEAM FRIENDS LIST! I literally had to go to the damn xbox website add him manually and then visit my local priest to cleanse me cause... xbox. After an hour of fighting microsoft we finally managed to join up. 5 minutes later we were attacked by a galleon of 4 players and had to start over. I said fuck it and started drinking. The next day i tried again i joined up on a new crew and it was actually going ok until we decided to chase down some schooners. We chased them for over an hour and couldn't do a damn thing. The people on said schooner kept jumping of and boarding our ship and dropping anchor. Why is this a big deal? Because raising a galleon anchor take like 30 to 45 seconds dropping it however, is instantaneous! Does this track in real life yes it does but nonetheless it was insanely annoying. The entire crew rage quit so i was like eh i'm going to join up on my friend and join a bunch of other people you like to waste money. We all got into a galleon and set off. Our team was communicating and everything was going amazingly and we stumbled upon an enemy galleon we decided to fight them and ill admit an intense 30 minutes ensued as we blew each others ships to pieces followed by the most bullshit hour i have ever seen in my life. It all started when we got close together and started to board each others ships. i went over to the enemies ship and stole all their supplies but they somehow magically got all of their materials and ammo (cannonballs and throwables) back. Over the course of the fight however, both sides died and we waited in the respawn area to come back however, the enemy team just jumped in and jumped out while my crew sat there for over minute waiting like we are in the damn DMV. We came back to our ship which was now on fire, sinking which symbolically represented my aforementioned will to live while their ship which keep in mind was in worse shape then ours 30 minutes ago magically repaired itself and went to therapy or some shit. So we fought as hard as we could but they just died and immediately came back like the second coming of Christ himself. We all died broken and beaten like the brave 300 even though they were all killed at least 20 times. To celebrate their lack of morals, they proceeded to dance on our corpses and brag that they were better at cheating. Oh yeah by the way you can hear your enemies talking and you cant mute your own team members this game forces communication down your throat and does not give the courtesy of buying you dinner or altering the settings. So to put it plainly, the best part of this game, was me pressing the refund button if you love yourself, wait for skull and bones.

Even though I'm still new to this game, I've had many memories that are so fun and interesting, I've actually felt like I'm having real life adventures. You never know what your next play session will take you. Fighting sea monsters? Making alliances with other ships? Raiding other players, perhaps? The balance between how you can play vs what you can do in this game is unlike any other I've played.

However, I don't think this game is perfect, far from it. Under all that pirate glory, Sea of Thieves still have a lot of potential to be dug up. Swordfights are sort of bland, islands should have more in it, territories could be added, etc. That being said, Sea of Thieves is way more fun with friends, playing solo is doable but you'll feel that more manpower is needed and it gets boring faster.",1595320442,1595737899,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198315148219,22,10,3567,0,654,1598630481

Although i haven't really met a lot of people in multiplayer, most of them are really chill and might help you out. I never really got to speak to them properly and none of them used their mics so the experience could be better for me at least if there was more of that. 

As for PVP in the game i have only encountered 1 person that attacked me and my friend even though we were on an outpost. It didn't go well for that person as we barely shot our cannons so we had too many cannonballs to spare and sunk his ship lol.

Riddles can be super confusing and working them out can be pretty frustrating at times depending on the riddle you got, plus there are still unsolved riddles so if you are stuck on one there might not even be a guide on how to solve it.

Pet system is cute and all but i wish there was a way to earn your pet and not though my wallet, i know its all cosmetic but i wish you could earn it though gameplay.

tl;dr Fun chill game, grab a friend or if youre as lonely as me grab a body pillow.

You simply have to learn and practice the varied mechanics to improve your sailing and combat proficiency. As you learn the game you'll be able to succeed at progressively challenging content. Teamwork and communication with your shipmates are key in Sea of Thieves.

19,73277355,english,"At first I was very reticent about purchasing this game. I heard and read many differing opinions on whether or not this game was worth the commitment; it's certainly worth the money, I wouldn't argue that, but more so the time sink.  

I also had a very unpleasant experience with trying to purchase this on the Windows Store before coming to Steam. I had both store and xbox companion app issues with my computer, and even being tech supported through it via remote access, no one was able to fix the issue...and I never got the game and said 'fooey' to Microsoft. 

Fast-forward to the Steam launch, and my son's willingness to jump in with me, and here I am 25 hours later enjoying the hell out of it. Even as a solo-rolling lone-wolf I enjoy myself. Truth be told, there are moments when I'm alone that are more immersive than when I'm with someone. This is because the truly immersive environments that this open world creates. Regardless the playful artstyle, the detail in the world and the sound design, play to a truly captivating experience. When I'm alone, and I stare off at the massive hulking supercell a few miles off, slowly encroaching on me, I'm honestly terrified. Hearing the far off thunder-claps succeed each potentially damaging lighting strike, gives me the chills. And that's just from a mile off. I honestly don't have the gamer guts to just sail off willy-nilly into a supercell...heck no. I had the displeasure of being caught in a storm once, with the high velocity winds, massive waves, pelting rain, and lighting strikes which can and will harm you...it's nerve-racking. But...inspired. I respect those storms...and I stay away from them at all costs.

Let's briefly talk about water. It's a pirate game, so it goes without saying that there will be a lot of water. I think this game should teach a master class on how to create water and physical waves in a 3d medium. The water is absolutely beautiful. No other game comes close to the fidelity of this undulating water. The movement, the complex shaders and myriad different looks and feel depending on the surrounding environments time of day or weather....it's astonishing. Again, the immersion aspect here is so successful. When I stare out at this ocean, I feel small. I fear what can not be seen, lurking below the surface--this could be the Kraken, a Ghost Ship, a Megalodon...or who knows what else. The same fears and reservations I have about the real world ocean, I share with Sea of Thieves. It successfully puts the fear of the ocean (and ocean floor) in me. How deep is it? What's down there? It works. And the tension is palpable. 

In terms of gameplay and loop, I'm still such a newbie pirate. But from what I've scratched, to watching streamers and tips and tricks videos, I can see that I have a myriad content to play through. Months and years to mull about with. 

I realize this review isn't in typical format, nor does it go over much of the game and mechanics...but I wanted to write this to share my experience with the world and its immersion. I get the same tension from this game as I do with Alien Isolation, Outlast or Deadspace. It's true! Sailing the ocean alone in Sea of Thieves provokes the same adrenaline and tension as those aforementioned horror survival games. Of course you could be a min-max gamer, plunder till your hearts content and ignore all the immersive elements...but I choose to get lost in them, and that is WHY Sea of Thieves shines for me.

As far as sailing mechanics: I'll briefly just say that they are very satisfying. I feel like a sailor. I feel like the rotating of the mast to catch the wind, or the raising or lowering of the sail to control my speed is all very intuitive and just feels good.

In terms of PVP and PVE: in the few dozen hours I've sailed around in 'Adventure Mode', I've only run into a handful of try-hard murderous human pirates. So far it's been the perfect sprinkle of PVP in a pretty vast PVE world. There are plenty of baddies and bosses to fight and find, and occasionally you will run into another human on the open seas. Sometimes they will be friendly, but always prepare for a fight.  

Is it worth $40? Absolutely. I urge you to go read more reviews, but I can say if you are into sailing, pirates, the open seas, mythical creatures and locations...this game will deliver in spades. I've got no major bones to pick, and I can say a pirates life is for me.",1595708589,1595708916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197965602056,109,23,3606,0,1558,1600832709

This game is fun, the art style is beautiful, and there is a lot to enjoy in the game. 

You might be wondering why I don't recommend the game. Why is that? Well there is another feature in the game that I failed to mention. Specifically the fact you are not sailing the seas alone. This is not inherently a bad thing, in fact I have had some good experiences involving random players. I do not advocate for changing the base game, but the toxicity of the community is really off putting and I feel that a mode similar to the PVP arena mode should be created to allow players to enjoy the game with friends without being harassed in PVP. Basically a PVE adventure mode, that focuses on doing voyages, tall tales, and PVE fighting and events.

A PVE only mode would not affect people who enjoy the base game, and I feel there are plenty of ways to enable its functionality. Like increase the amount of PVE events, cause more skeleton spawns etc. Sometimes you don't want to deal with other players, and a mode should be there to allow people to enjoy the game a bit more casually.

The main game mode is fine, but sometimes a few bad apples can really ruin an experience for people. The amount of toxic responses people who ask for some kind of PVE mode receive from others just proves a point of the toxic nature of some people.

Do not get into this game expecting a good time if you do not have a group of friends to play with, and even if you do people who only play this game to prey on you and make you miserable  may show up to ruin your day.

If this was reality, you were surrounded by psychopathic killers. all the time. and yoj can read it in the discussions about this game that they never realise that they might have done something wrong, in there opinion you had to even thank them for getting killed. absolutly toxic. only way you could enjoy this game is to get toxic as well... but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone, its like say your kid ""if somebody takes a gun to school you should also take a gun witj you"".... absoluty toxic",1595659204,1595659204,False,5,0,0.476176142692565918,0,True,False,False,76561198032994830,98,19,6024,0,6024,1594753529

Playing in a one player ship has huge advantages as you have to simultaneously control the wheel, the sails, and the cannons alone. While it is definately a chore, it's still possible and even fun at times.


What really sucks is it's nearly impossible to do the harder activites by yourself. Doing Skull Forts is a day long chore, as you get overwhelmed with bodybuilder-esque skellys. Fighting Megalodons is quite easy, as you only have to sail in a circle and shoot him while maintaining your hull.

These things being said, when you find a group to help you out with you quests, the game gets immensely more fun. Sailing the sea gets less lonely, and major schenannegans ensue.

The random server changing is ruining the game. Game doesn't warn you about the server change. When you play an event for an hour and finally get your loot, the game can change the server you're playing and everything you gathered is lost because game didn't give you any time to carry them into your ship. Sometimes you see bunch of loot in the sea or sink another ship but you can't take their loot because they disappear after the server change. This happened to me couple of times, basicly you waste your hours for nothing. 

Let us know atleast 10 minutes ago when the server is going to change. It shouldn't be that hard. Or when the server is going to change, it should be delayed for atleast 10-15 minutes automaticly and the game should warn you about that.

Other than that; there are really low variety of characters, most of the skins are awful and you don't know what to buy because everything looks bad, galleons are really slow even though they have 3 sails, cheaters or screaming childs and game gets repetitive...

49,73197460,english,"I was really excited for this game and the first impression was great. I enjoyed the well-crafted tutorial and was stunned by the beautiful water graphics and physics.

However, this first amazement didn't last long and unfortunately I cannot recommend this game.

I hoped for an open-world pirate game with cool quests and some RPG mechanics where I could level up my avatar and my ship. Maybe something similar to EVE Online, but much less complex and more beginner-friendly of course.

However, this game offers nothing of that:

The ""quests"" are boring and repetitive. The only reward is gold that can be used to buy cosmetics. And this game is all about cosmetics. You cannot level any skills, there is no character progression, and you cannot even really customise the physical appearance of your character to your liking, just buy new clothes, hair styles etc.

And, what I find most curious for a pirate game: you can neither buy new ships nor weapons, nor can you upgrade them. You just select one of three standard ships when starting a new game. And when your vessel get's destroyed, you just receive a new one for free.

All you can do is grind lots of money and buy various cosmetics that give your character, ship, or weapons a different appearance. That's all there is.

Furthermore, most progress is not saved when you quit the game. You can loot all kinds of stuff like wood (to repair your ship), and you can even cook food after you e.g. hunted animals. But you neither have to learn certain crafting skills to do so, nor does it make sense to stock up on any of these things because they disappear the moment you log out anyway.

Overall, after a couple of hours one has seen most of the game and there is not much left except from grinding lots of gold to buy lots of useless cosmetics...",1595575335,1595575335,False,6,0,0.470230162143707275,0,True,False,False,76561197990686403,392,20,839,0,839,1595524864

Managed to get my irl friend to get this game, $40 honestly seems like a steal considering this is the most fun I've ever had in years.

We had our great pile of loot stolen from us by some more experienced players; they sunk our ship and headed to the nearest outpost with our stash. Feeling not quite defeated, I stated we should try and return where we were, get our stuff back or die trying. We looked at the map and set sail for the island near where we were sunk.

Ended up seeing their ship docking in the distance, I grabbed a TNT barrel they tried to kill us with, and suicide bombed their deck, sinking them in the process. My fellow crewmate picked up the treasure we had been robbed of moments before.

The Merchant’s Alliance wants to build a civilization in the Sea of Thieves, and to that end they task pirates with gathering resource parcels, herding animals into cages, and making deliveries.

Many crates for the Merchant’s Alliance have some gimmick associated with them to compensate for their missions being less adventurous than the others. Crates of plants need water, jumping with a crate of rum bottles can cause them to break, and pigs herded into cages need to be fed.

The Order of Souls is interested in the esoteric history of the Sea of Thieves, and wants to put the sea’s roaming skeletons to rest.

Nothing is sacred, your loot can be someone else's in a matter of moments, with them laughing as your ship sinks, only for you to do the same thing to someone else later. No one is ahead of you in weaponry, the only thing you can buy is cosmetics and the game's purely about who is the most skilled, [b] no pay to win [/b].

This game has the highest highs, and the lowest lows. Don't buy this game expecting to invincible. Don't buy this game expecting for others to leave you alone.

Sea of Thieves is a clever sandbox multi-player ""Fantasy\Pirate"" action game. I did not bother with this title around it's original release because it got so much negative attention that I didn't want to waste my money\time on it. After several patches and added concepts and it's release on steam I 'rightly' decided to give this game a try and was not TOO disappointed.

Based on what I experienced during my time with Sea of Thieves it became clear to me that this game has something to offer a player of every skill level. With that said, depending on your skill level as a player may determine the amount of fun you have and how far you take your adventures. 

☼ Graphics ☼
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☑ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic

Why?
Graphically the game is beautiful. The art style is very on theme with the game and like others before me have stated the water physics and effects are super immersive. There isn't quite a another title that can match the sailing experience in this game. It's cartoony, goofy and just a fun look and encapsulates exactly what the game is underneath. 

♬ Music ♬
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☑ Good
☐ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic

Why?
It's exactly what you'd expect for a cartoony pirate game. It's right on theme from what I heard before quickly turning the music off because..immersion obviously. On top of the music you can play musical instruments while in game and it's pretty great. If playing with friends and playing different instruments you will all sync up with each other and play old classic pirate songs as a band.


☠ Difficulty ☠
☐ Easy
☑ Average
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Hard
☑ Unfair

Why?
With the addition of the tutorial this game is easy to learn. The tutorial is done well and explains the basics. Depending on where you choose to take your adventure will determine the difficulty of this game. (For the most part.) Danger is everywhere in this game. Sailing in the open water can be a bit nerve wracking because you never know if some other crew is going to pop out and wreck your day and jack your loot. Other players are probably the biggest threat in the game but besides that you could encounter sea monsters, skeletons, ghost ships and other dangers. Supplies in this game are abundant and you'll probably never run out of anything during a normal 1-2 hour session. The puzzle treasure quests are really cool too and require you to use your brain. I like that about this game. 


§ Bugs §
☐ Bugs destroy the game
☐ Lots of bugs
☐ Few Bugs
☑ Nothing encountered

why?
I haven't encountered any bugs so far. 

☯ Story ☯
☐ There is none
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☐ Fantastic
☑ You make the story

Why?
I wouldn't say this game has a story but it definitely has lore that you uncover as you play the game. However there is no linear story mode to this game. It's all just sandbox and player driven. Whatever you choose to do is the story. 

⚔ Gameplay ⚔
☑ Frustrating
☑ Sleepy
☑ Boring
☑ Fun
☑ Challenging

Why?
Since there isn't a linear story guiding you through one part to the next, the game is about as fun or as boring as you make it depending on what you choose to do. The replay value from this game is based purely on the motivation to earn cosmetics. New costumes, hair, weapon and tool skins, ship skins. You buy these cosmetic upgrades with gold. You earn gold from turning in quests and treasure. You'll never encounter a sweaty player who is more powerful than you just because he's played more than you which I imagine some people probably love! The only things that are stacked against you in an encounter with another player is Crew size v Crew size which those odds can be overcome with skill. I think this progression system is risky and a little bit lazy to be honest. You could play the game for 1000s of hours and all you have to show for it is a costume you earned in the first 5-10 hours of gameplay and some title no one cares about. To me the time sink to reward isn't there to keep me playing every day which might be the intent of SoT. I like the idea of a leveling, unlocking, skill/perk system at the very least that to keep me engaged and wanting to develop my character. Truth be told I have no idea how i'd implement it in the game as it now and I doubt we'll ever see a progression system outside of cosmetics and titles and I think most of the players are probably okay with that. It keeps things casual for the most part and keeps people focused on just having fun as opposed to grinding for power. Another thing thats cool is there is an arena mode for purely PvP encounters.. although that doesn't satisfy the urge to grief does it?


۞ Game time / Length ۞
☑ Really short (0 - 3 hours)
☑ Short (4 - 8 hours)
☑ Meta (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]
☑ Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything]
☑ Very Long (61-100 hours)
☑ Extremely Long (101+ hours)

Why?
This game doesn't require a set amount of play time. There's usually as much time or as little time to do whatever you're trying to do.

☑ Wait for Sale
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund it if you can

Why?
If this is the game you've been waiting for your whole life just buy it. If you're on the rocks about it, wait for a sale. If none of this game appeals to you whatsoever just don't buy it. I will say that it's a fun experience best enjoyed with friends.

0,73151473,english,"PVP sucks and is undeveloped, simple, no risk for people to 4 vs 1 you. they should at lleast have some alternate attacks. basically run behind your opponent and spam attack, thats it. or shoot them in the face with a shotgun.  you can clearly tell when you are playing against people using controllers because even I could own them in my first hour.

the respawn system is horrible. i killed an entire team TWICE but the first time they killed me then it jsut allows them to spawn camp you on your boat while they sink it. it snot skill based PVP, clearly i killed them all more. 

The PVP ship piracy part of ArcheAge was a million times deeper than this entire game when it came to combat, battles and rewards. So was the merchant cargo runs portion of that game.


PVE spawn mechanisms are garbage, it literally will spawn a ship on you that you cant outrun and cant beat as a solo unless you jsut smash them right out. angles dont always allow that., its impossible to repair fast enough and still fire back once you start getting hit. I just had to fight two of those glowing ships back to back just trying to go to port. got shot off my boat and going through 30 boards trying to repair. just trying to run the first stupid tall tale and getting attacking me nonstop. i dont know if you are alone on the server, maybe it just keeps spawning on you. you will lose hours of time. 

if you dont mind losing your entire night of gameplay rewards to NPC's auto spawning on you, have fun. sure you can cash out... doesnt always work that way. it snot about the ""gold"", its about the real life time sink.

Ive  had a ghost ship, regular NPC and a meglodon all spawn on me at once. the meglodon actually bit the npc pirate ship, the one with red flags. that was funny.

Volcanos apparently have aimbot and will destroy you, doesnt matter. i was literally at the fish shack place and a volcano far away nuked my boat. its a stupid mechanic and I can't imagine anyone likes it. it needs to be tweaked.

the create a character  is awful. it gives you premade characters and you can shuffle them. they are all ugly as hell too. if you want to look cool or have one look liek you, you cant. its honestly reaaaly lame for a game that you are suppose to have one character and play over and over forever and they have to be some ugly ass piece of crap. i dont know if unlocks are character bound or not. 

OH PS... dont liek their crap system for create a char? you can pay them Real Cash to reroll it. Of course, this isnt explained until you start playing and have made a character. That is straight BS for something that should be a basic part of a game. Any attempt to defend that is complete BS and should be ignored.

lastly, for them to be braggin about ""15 million players"" the world seems empty most of the time. and the vast majority of player interactions will be negative. 


""become a pirate legend"".. no one will know who you are except your friends. there is no ranking system or any kind of system to track anyone. there is no way to add custom flags or clan tags, you all literally look basically the same and are interchangeable. an ocean full of nobodies who don't matter. no one will see your title or cosmetics either because the PVP fights last about seconds to drop someone. could be anyone, you dont matter.

 Ive had some fun but this game seems like its an early access title, low amount of content. should be 19.99. Ive had fun with friends but most of my time is solo, its not worth it, go get something else unless you are always with a party. quest/voyage progression takes forever and if you die you lose all your rewards. has potential. i wouldnt recomend it unless it was free to play or on sale.",1595493384,1595525959,False,5,0,0.484969615936279297,0,True,False,False,76561198078232192,142,15,6936,0,6003,1595740778

On the one hand, the first few hours yield you little to no content.
On the other, as soon as you get your basic understanding, it showers you in so much to do that, quite honestly, it would seem like a terrible grind.
On the third hand (pretend you're a Kraken), you will find pure joy just from hanging out in the game - think of it as of a VERY PRETTY VR chat with ships and high-quality wave physics, I guess? Better yet, it does fulfill the fantasy of sailing with friends, and my best moments of the game were when my friends and I took a six hour long trip.
And yet if you play it long enough to go through the initial grind, you are only met with more grind. The rewards are cosmetic only, and even such are much easier achieved through microtransactions, and, beyond decorating the ship, there isn't really any endgame.


So, would I recommend it? Hell yes, I got one friend to buy it, and gifted it to another. It is a perfect way to waste half a day, and still feel satisfied. The problem is, it does not work for long. If you want to get something that will keep you company through the months, absolutely do, it is an endless supply of joy that will never end - but if you want to binge a game for a week straight, you will find yourself seasick.

81,73120647,english,"Cannot recommend this game. It has tremendous potential but there are three things that just ruin it for me.

First, there's no actual character generation system in place worthy of the name, tho there are evidently quite many options on how your character COULD look. Instead it's a frickin dice-rolling system. You have to just be ready to spend a few hours rolling for frickin characters until you get one you can live with instead of just being able to create it yourself, and of course, they want money for further attempts (also in the ""character selection menu"" most of the characters shown do some sort of gesture or facial expression that heavily distort their looks so it's hard to tell if your character will actually look decent ingame or utterly ridiculous).

The second and even more annoying problem is one that way too many games have nowadays. Forced open world pvp. Honestly this game is one I'd like to play for a bit after coming home from work to relax a bit with a friend or two, however the way the game is set up you're going to invest hours and hours into accumulating loot... and it can all be taken away in just a few minutes by some griefer crew coming along just blowing up your ship while you're landed at an island somewhere faster than you can have any chance to defend yourself. 
Why in bloody hell does this game not have a frickin PvE Exclusive playmode? ... The way it is it just rewards griefing, is all I'm saying.

Last there's the annoying forced profanity filter for text chat. It is completely useless and very counter productive as most people in this game just insult you via VoIP anyway and it interferes heavily with text based conversations in ANY language other than english.

But if you can't do either then be ready to be run over by people who make it their priority 1 to ruin your day along with anyone else they come across.

The game is harder when playing solo, but not impossible. However, playing with friends is where the game shines. The only limit to your shenanigans is your own imagination.

A light, but romp on the seas with a healthy serving of total anarchy.

[list] The Good:
[*] Hands down the most satisfying sailing in a sea faring game you could find.
[*] Ship combat is absolutely brilliant.
[*] Story Mode is A+
[*] Rich in emergent gameplay and storytelling experiences. Every voyage feels like an adventure.
[*] Fabulous with friends
[*] The look and feel of this world is sublime, the Pirates of the Caribbean vibe is so rich and full of life. 
[/list]

[list] The Meh:
[*] Multiplayer is the main focus here, even though solo play is fun and tense, it's not for everyone. 
[*] Pvp is your biggest source of excitement, everything revolves around whether or not you're safe from prying eyes and bloodthirsty bandits. 
[*] Open Crews are a total toss up.
[*] New players are tossed into the thick of things pretty quickly. The tutorial is decently robust doesn't prepare players for pvp.
[*] Sword Combat is spammy, but has potential.
[*] Gun options range from very good to mostly ok. Nothing major to complain about outside of balance
[*] Lots of downtime is offset by the active sailing mechanics and constant lookout for player ships
[*] Gathering loot is time consuming and tedious, but constant vigilance for other players keeps this from being boring. 
[/list]

[list] The Bad:
[*] No real progression to speak of. Everything is in the cosmetics and what isn't is just the promise of quests with better loot.
[*] Quests and tasks are fairly same-y, its a lot of go here, do this, sell stuff. 
[*] There is not a lot of variety, there is lots to do to keep you busy, but session to session gameplay is largely the same with a few exceptions
[*] There is no end game. Reaching Pirate Legend is essentially status only and only promises longer, better paying quests. 
[/list]
    
Mid-Review Tl;dr
[i] 7/10 [/i]

Lots to do, little variety. If you can accept cosmetics as upgrades and play for gameplays sake, there's a lot on offer here that will keep you playing for a long time. However, make no mistake: other players and your interactions with them are the real core of this game. Be ready to protect yourself, kindness here is the exception, not the rule.

Review

I've got a feeling i'm going to stick with Sea of Thieves for a long time. Despite its flaws, the gameplay is just too compelling for me not to keep playing so i'm just gonna gush for a bit. There's a lot to love in Sea of Thieves and its come a long way since its release a few years ago. The devs have been incredibly active and gave this game a serious glow up. First of all the sailing is second to none, the moment to moment gameplay is honestly masterful, especially with a crew. Bailing water, fixing shit, firing cannons, boarding other ships, its all there and its all good. Sea of Thieves really has this secret sauce to it and that's the players. Love em or hate them, this game is pvp right to its core and it revels in that fact. Tasks might not be anything special, but nothing gives you quite the adrenaline rush that cashing in does after you've successfully defended your hoard. It takes run of the mill missions and amps up the energy tenfold. The pve events are also great fun. They don't change much but they offer a nice break in pace from the usual gameplay. Fort of the Damned, Skull forts, Flamehardt fleets, Skeleton Galleons, Krakens, Megalodons. Each one really pumps in a breath of fresh air especially when tensions are already high. Not even to mention the content that marks you right on the map, broadcasting your position to everyone. Reapers bounties and emissary flags just kick things up a notch. High risk, high reward, its fantastic. God damn, and every voyage feels so exciting, you just feel so plugged into the world. Everything just drips with flavor and its easy  to spend a few hours just getting lost in the grind.

This game isn't for everyone, it really isn't. Not everyone will appreciate the lack of progression, the limited variety, the grind, or the pvp, but if you're on the fence, i truly recommend it. Find a group of friends, or sail alone, sit down with a few drinks, find a few new friends, make even more enemies and just be a pirate for a little bit. To be honest, if you were sure you didn't want it already you probably didn't make it this far.",1595123365,1595364622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198043033329,175,10,8461,319,1483,1601763101

Best played with friends.  you'll have to server hope on open server for a decent teammate.  It can be fustrating and impossible with a teammate that is unwilling to focus on the tasks at hand. 

After 100 hours grinding for loot,  I still have a long way to go.  It's important to select a faction first that you want to level up.  gold horders, order of souls, merchants,  reapers.  buy quests  (and their flags) from them then and do those quests. its quicker than just randomly going about.   There is loot everywhere. in the water, on the islands, shipwrecks. nearly everything aquired can be sold to someone.   The grind is for stuff you buy with the money in game you make.  Does stuff make you happy?  Does a title that everyone else has make you happy?  you need at least 5 hours a day for that!

There is fun to be had with friends.  but at a certain 150 hour mark, you are really done with it.  Unless you just want to troll other players.  

 But, you  are not going to listen to reason are you?   It's a game where you are allowed to be a d!ck to other people.  PVP and PVE are not separate.   Cooperation in this game is a joke.  Your partner will most likely not speak english or have a mic.  

And this game seems kinda dead. It's been out a while, past it's prime.  Probably why the toxic and trolly behavior has surfaced.   You can't be a friendly in this game just trying to level up yourself.  It's you  against the entire world of bitter, repressed,  and psycho a$$holes.  you really want that?",1591743770,1595319642,False,7,7,0.366710662841796875,0,True,False,False,76561198326031917,118,20,13806,281,450,1601833936

In spite of the cartoony graphics (which are actually often-stunning) there's a real feel to actually being on the high-seas. It's crazy fun when you're feeling like an adventure. 

I can imagine though, that spending many hours doing the somewhat tedious tasks, only to be slaughtered by an experienced and mean crew (which is ultimately the major promotional point of the game) would be annoying.

Here's the catch though: Since everyone is essentially the same, there's no reason to get upset about it. It adds to the adventure that someone shows up when you least expects it and tries to take your loot. Suddenly you are in some fight with a bunch of randoms and if you're victorious, all the sweeter when you carry the loot into the sellers (another tedious task).. but if you lose.. what have you really lost? You had an adventure.. you didn't lose anything besides the ability to buy some pointless asthetic.. so don't worry about it! Have fun!

My only issue is the tedium.  There are lots of tasks that are annoying to undertake in large numbers. I am hopeful though that the monthly updates continue to bring more content, because this game has massive potential.

17,73025085,english,"Points for aesthetics and musical score.  Demerits for toxic PVP, lack of separation between PVP and PVE, and shallow gameplay.  Definitely not recommended if you are a solo player; especially if you're a solo player who enjoys working with teams.

The endgame content of this title is literally ""Go Ruin Other Peoples' Experience""

The core gameplay loop is very repetitive: Sail around either: 
1.) digging up treasure chests 
2.) shooting skeletons 
3.) playing UPS delivery driver.  
There is extra content, (giant sharks, krakkens, PVE raids) but in terms of progression, that's about it.  You learn very quickly that most side quests (random quests of the 3 varieties listed above that you can find in the world, via RNG) aren't worth that much, and you're better off doing the missions you buy at Outposts.  There are extra PVE quests with lore and fun characters, and they do attempt to expand (if ever so slightly) on the core gameplay.  Finishing these quests however, can be a bit more difficult, due to long runtime of the PVE quests, and the high chance of getting waylaid by another player crew.

The main problem arises with the PVP aspect of the game.  There is no distinction between PVP and PVE on the servers, so there's a very high chance another player (or group of players) will sink your boat, and nullify any progress you might have made toward a specific goal.  Unfortunately, when you have a niche-audience game that has been in release for multiple years, you wind up with these super-sweaty players that have literal hundreds of hours invested into this game, who are actively looking to ruin other peoples' play experience, since there's literally nothing else in the game for them to do.  There is also a high percentage of team-killing troll players who join open crews via the matchmaking feature just to cause mayhem.  Good luck trying to start, let alone finish, a PVE raid.  

It's pretty disheartening to attempt to unwind after work, and then have your entire play session feel pointless because of the toxicity of other players.  These are the same players who jump into messages boards going 'iTs sEA of ThIEVes, nOT sEa oF FriENdS!'

Good concept, pretty screenshots, amazing soundtrack, but unless you're tying to troll other people, your money and, more importantly, your time, is better spent elsewhere.",1595289336,1595294506,False,21,9,0.552354216575622559,0,True,False,False,76561198094484208,189,3,11874,0,11874,1595288365

I want to start off by stating that I will revisit the game and plan on updating the review in the future. After 3ish hours this was my experience.

I played a duo sloop on adventure, we worked our way through the tutorial just fine and began our adventure. After spending multiple hours exploring a few islands and doing voyages with various riddles. We were attacked. Keep in mind, neither of us had even shot a cannon yet. Now an enemy with 8 or so people decide to raid and attack us. We were outgunned, outmaned, outleveled and, outmatched. The battle was over before it started. I marked an outpost on our map so we'd have the chance to sell our stuff before we were destroyed. We quickly discovered that they were much faster than us and they were tailing us to the outpost. We crashed the ship into the outpost and started gather our things. They rear ended us and immediately killed my friend. We tried respawning but eventually scuttled the ship. The PVP is so heavily imbalanced to whoever has more experience and friends that it's not even worth trying for a new player. We felt as if we had just lost all 3 hours of our progress with nothing to show for it but 1k gold. It was an extremely demoralizing experience and we decided to take a break. The tension we got from the fight was great but if we weren't so outmatched we would have actually had fun.

""IT'z sEA of steveS not See OF FRIAnDs""

jokes aside this is probably the most immersive pve/vp game in years, I really don't care about more serious games of the kind like Ark or Rust where you are pretty much f*cked if you don't ally with other groups. I'm a pve guy, simple as that. And this game offers enough replayability for me to come back on a daily/weekly basis, the tall tales are a nice addition to some already dense content. Your sessions can last from anything between 15 minutes to 1 year. I really like how each sessions are a fresh start, playing the game doesn't feel like having a second job like Ark/Rust where you basically force yourself to log in everyday without having any single ounce of fun. SoT is for everyone from the most casual pve player to the most toxic kind of pvp players.

13,72966945,english,"This game is a riot! While the main gameplay can be a little repetitive and the enemies (mostly the skellies and snakes and things) can sometimes be tedious or annoying, the true fun comes with interactions with player characters. There are only a few other players per server so you're not overrun and constantly fighting for your life, which I really appreciate. You can also ally with others and work together, or take them on and steal their plunders, which is fun depending on your mood. Plus playing with some pals is a really awesome way to hang out in this current climate. It'll suck your time away, be warned.

One thing I'd like to see are some kind of quality of life upgrades to the game. Not necessarily stronger guns or something where new players will just get pummeled but things like an better zoom on the rifle, a faster reload upgrade, or 2 more shots in your ""magazine"" just to give you a little edge but something that doesn't make you OP. As far as I can tell, all upgrades and items in the game are purely aesthetic. Maybe if the devs are responsive, they may consider something like this. I like the idea of keeping the playing field level, while at the same time offering up some little perks to give you a slight improvement.

I am also hugely grateful for the cross-play with Xbox players. Half my pals play on there and we link up with only minor issues revolving around the team chat settings, but there are work-arounds that are simple enough.

Lastly, I think the game visually is really really cool. The style is consistent, and there are little details that make it really fun to engage with and explore. The sound design is also AWESOME. You can hear cannonballs scream past you, feel like you're truly drowning if you fall off the ship in a storm, and experience the chaos when you're attacked by a Kraken! The ocean is really cool too, the shallows are rich with ocean plants and fish, but if you're out in the middle of the water and jump in, there is no bottom and it gives you that feeling of a deep dark ocean.

Overall I'd say highly worth picking up if:

- You have a few pals who will play with you.
- You're not too hung up on a story or progressing a character via upgrades.
- You have creative ways to engage with other players (befriend them, battle them etc)
- You enjoy the thrill of accruing treasure knowing it really doesn't lead to more than making your character more interesting to look at.

I really like it and have gotten a whole bunch of my friends hooked too.

24,70458568,english,"TLDR: Good game but don't buy this on Steam, get it on Microsoft store.

As someone else has said this game is horizontal in nature not vertical meaning you can do everything at the start of the game. This spooks some of the people who like grindy games to achieve a nice skin or new weapon but not I. The games core mechanics are very fun and I would definitely recommend the game if you are interested.

Only issues I've found with the game is that playing it from the Microsoft/Xbox application is a tad buggy and doesn't have ease of use features like choosing and SSD for an install path. There are also microtransations for currency that's used for skins which is a bit irritating in a game that already costs £35.

Getting this game on steam has no difference to getting it on Microsoft, for both you need to log in with your Microsoft account and you can't right click and ""join friend"" via steam - its honestly easier to do it through the crappy Xbox program.",1591562219,1595182362,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198125478912,190,33,6800,0,30,1595127103

   The good
    The game has beautiful graphics in terms of the water. Sunsets are rather prety, lots of time sailing, you can be plundered by other players, this was not a huge issue for me and the game is pretty fun with others.

    The bad
     For me the fact that all upgrades are simply cosmetic and there is really no system of improvement for characters the game felt very empty to me. Could use a leveling system for the characters, maybe a skill tree.

     Didn't put much time into it but i'm already bored with it. Its fun and its pretty well made so I wont give it a thumbs down and would still encourage others to try it if they wish but for me it was hollow and unsatisfying.

47,72948725,english,"Really good game. Really fun. However, very hard for new players like me to get started. You kinda just have to hope and pray your on a server with people that couldn't give a sh!t about plundering actual players. Basically, learn how to battle really fast. For me it's been 50/50. Your either in a server where every other player wants to kill you. Or your in a server where you never run into another player for hours. Right now I'm just trying to get more money to buy things so I don't look like a noob cos I feel like that's why I get targeted. No one appreciates new players, just takes advantage of that fact they are new and still learning the game. 

I do play this game alone. But only cos I'm trying to get more gold, and get far in the trading companies so that hopefully it's a bit better when I actually play with my crew. Game is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more fun with friends than it is on your own. But it is possible on your own. I actually defeated a fleet of ghost ships on my own.. Sure.. I lost my boat and was fighting from an island.... But I still did it. 

Ship battles are basically impossible on your own. While your repairing the ship they are still shooting at you. So, you have no time to shoot back at them. 
Also do be wary that I swear people teleport on your boat. Sometimes you will literally turn around and there is a person on your ship! 
Other than the awful PVP, I still recommend this game, mainly if you play with friends. You can play on your own, and if your okay with strangers, you can join a random crew. I did that once and got paired with a French man.. I can't speak French so I quit because this is the type of game where you need to be able to communicate. And this is why I wish I knew other languages but I can barely speak English sometimes.

The combat sucks. It's basically one of those mash the button if you've got a sword, and aiming a gun is stupid! I'm usually pretty good with aim in games, except games that DO NOT make it clear on where the gun is aiming..... Like this one... 
The quests can get frustrating at times. But they are still really fun. It's one of those frustrating moments that isn't necessarily bad, and it's probably your fault anyway. Like misreading the directions for example. I think in games it's okay to get frustrated. That's part of the fun. And I REALLY like games that it usually is your fault. I HATE games that glitch, or are just unfair and it usually isn't your fault. Those suck. But with this game, I always felt it was MY fault, and I think that's a good thing, cos the last thing you want in a game is for you to mess up and you KNOW it's not your fault. That is one of the worst things. But luckily, I've not encountered any of that with this game so far. 

Overall, really fun experience. Quests are fun. Better and easier with friends. Combat and pvp sucks. Some of the players suck. But I have seen some literally just ignore me before. Unless they just didn't see me.

It's also a sandbox game that used to be fun, so it needs at least a safe zone where nobody can't hurt us, just like any other f*cking games. Even the worst game that you wh*res*ns probably think, Fallout 76, has a player protection (No PVP if you don't hit them back). 

Come on, it's not a f*cking TDM or Battle royale that will always force you to PVP.  IT'S A F*CKING SANDBOX GAME, WE JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN!!

Oh, and also, there is a PVP mode called Arena.  Why don't you go there if you want a fight competion???

All the reviews im seeing are ""HAHAHA funny le pirate game haha guys eat le banana"" and no one wants to speak about the actual problems of the game.

The sword & gun gameplay is as flat and stale as a board and feels boring
you'll find yourself going from a to be to solve a riddle or find an x mark on your map to then return to a dock to hand everything in. Rinse and repeat & yes the ""Tall Tales"" are a more intricate version of what i just mentioned, you literally just go from a to b but it has uninteresting characters spewing dialogue & at times more fighting but it doesn't mean much when the combat is just woeful. This is literally it, too often you'll find yourself just mindlessly sailing going nowhere fast.

The ONLY progression in this game is cosmetics, so what is there to do when you've purchased the outfit you like best? i play with 3 friends and most of the time we were so bored we were forcing ourselves to make our own fun, we struggled to find many players & the arena lobby we joined failed to start after 30 minutes of us running around the starting lobby.
We defeated the ""mighty"" Kraken twice, both times we bombarded it with cannons and it just withered away into the water after a few minutes and left little to no reward.

52,72176363,english,"This game isn't for everyone, it does cater to a certain type of player and it is somewhat of an unusual beast, sitting in an odd place between casual and sometimes brutal, but always forgiving. The three main complaints I see for Sea of Thieves are it being boring solo, it's too grindy and the PvP aspects being too much. 

If you are the sort of player who likes to be given objectives and focus down, ignoring anything that isn't to do with your objective you are going to struggle with this game. Likewise, if you are the sort that enjoys grinding out max ranks as soon as you can and being rewarded with having the best stats in the game, you are unlikely to find much value in SoT. At the same time, if you were expecting a relaxing, sailing and sight seeing game and nothing more, you should think twice. 

Sea of Thieves is essentially a huge sandbox, with loads to do but nothing particularly telling you to go do it. The sort of player who can set their own goals and enjoys going and doing things because 'why not?' will find this game really rewarding. Sea of Thieves has so many little mechanics and very few restrictions or rules, it really encourages creative solutions to situations. If you enjoy this in a game and can accept that your rank and currency increasing is just a by-product of this and not something to obsess over, you will be right at home on Sea of Thieves. 

If you are expecting a persistent world where your actions change things long term you will probably be disappointed, there is a story and it is entwined with the landscape, characters and seasonal events, but it is never changed by a PvE event. For some people, this in a Sandbox PvPvE world is a deal breaker, but the PvE content serves a different purpose than usual. It is there to guide players toward interacting. This game really is about interacting with people, be it keeping well away from them or not. This game is the largest game of trust I have ever played. 

The game facilitates all kinds of interaction and it's why the blend of PvE and the PvP is perfect, because you find yourself making decisions and weighing up situations continually, which in turn gives you plenty of opportunity for creative problem solving. It's why there are no stats and why items are cosmetic, it levels the playing field and when it comes to PvP, having experience and not XP does pay off. This is where Sea of Thieves is fairly unique in the realm of Survival/Sandbox type games. You will learn that loot isn't anyone's until it's turned in, but at the same time losing it (and you will) to another crew or an angry sea monster isn't going to mean you are set back on levelling, unlocking gear and perks or upgrading something, there's no long term impact. That sort of penalty is eliminated here. 

The servers aren't persistent either so there's not the worry of having 'clans' or crews dominating a map or having people instantly gank you every time you try to play. The game is forgiving enough that it has lots of things in place to help you escape PvP situations too. The game is better with friends, as is most games. There's an auto-fill for your crew if you enjoy playing with randoms too, I have had mixed results with this. I still find this game very enjoyable solo, but it does change how you play depending on your crew. 

Lastly, I think it's really important to mention the way the DLC and seasonal content is handled. You can leave this game for months and still jump back in without any penalty. You never have to worry about log in bonuses and so far all the seasonal content, including map expansions, has been free. With the nature of the game, it kind of has to be. The only paid content is cosmetic/novelty such as pets which do nothing but look cute. You never need to feel locked into playing every day or worry that if you miss an event that you will be at a disadvantage and I think that from a game now days is rare. 

If you are the sort of player that enjoys, to coin a phrase, the journey and not the destination, you will find a lot of value in what Rare has done with SoT. If you can accept you will rank up by doing just stuff and you don't obsess over min maxing numbers, if you enjoy creative open game play and you enjoy the oddities of interacting with other players, you will hugely enjoy this game. It isn't for everyone and I can see why but I think there's value in a game like this and I can happily recommend that you give it a go at least.",1594056608,1595059752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198044004536,157,32,3811,0,3158,1595193270

97,72857593,english,"I dont think I would recommend Sea of Thieves unless you for sure plan on playing the multiplayer aspect. It feels like a very aimless game where all you're doing is grinding to increase your rank with the trade unions, but there are zero upgrades for your characters, just tons and tons of achievements and challenges you're meant to work towards if you desire it. The only stuff you can purchase with in-game currency is cosmetics, so at the very least a new player is at the same playing field as someone who's played since day one.  Its definitely comparable to Elite Dangerous, but as opposed to a space ship galaxy mmo where its very wonder-filled and relaxing to journey through space, Sea of Thieves has lots of lore and stories to go through but leans more heavily on the journey rather than the destination. Its even built such that you can die and have your ship sink, but you still respawn with generic items for healing and shooting, and you can't keep items persistent between sessions, so unless you complete quests and purchase cosmetics, it feels like there's no unique loot for you to acquire and can get repetitive easily (which is why I dont recommend solo play).  Its sailing mechanics are also pretty great and top notch, if you have knowledge of real-life sailing practices you'll do well.

The community is honestly one of the worst i have played with, almost everyone will attempted to grief you and steal your loot.

 Some of the game design just allows way too much griefing, such as being able to stay on an island while the rest of your crew is half way across the map, giving no indication that you are about to get killed and griefer hands in all your loot while you respawn wasteing hours. this isnt just a rare occurence this happens almost every other time i try and hand my loot in. Dont get me started on the spawn killing once they kill you once on your boat

The game is fairly enjoyable in almost every respect, save for forced random players ganging up just for sh*ts and giggles, clearly this game needs a lot more thought especially in its PvP aspect. For example, Sloop/Brigantine/Galleon only servers, or a non-PvP flag for those who just want to do some solo voyages to get familiar with the game. Or Friends Only servers. The point is I want PvP when I say so. Getting respawned after being ganged up a few miles away from my target is a waste of time.

[b]My Review Score as of 7/16/2020:[/b]
 - Gameplay: [b]6/10[/b] (Open world multiplayer PvE/PvP, PvP is unregulated but PvE is decent)
 - Mechanics: [b]6/10[/b] (Easy to understand, moderately challenging to do)
 - Story: [b]4/10[/b] (Not really, but I get that's not the main point of the game)
 - Graphics: [b]8/10[/b] (Vibrant and toonish, yet enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly well animated)
 - Audio: [b]9/10[/b] (The sound and music in the game is pretty fantastic)

The quests are fun, with treasure maps like X marks the spot or sometimes word puzzles.

Loot is sold for dubloons which are used to purchase cosmetics only, so there is no pay to win, and indeed, it truly does not matter at all if you lose all your loot or not.

76,72814440,english,"So first off I want to say I absolutely love this game. Never bought it on Microsoft but I kept my eye out for a Steam release and when it finally came I waited till I had the time and funds to really sink my teeth into it (got injured from work so all I have is time right now) and I've had quite the experience so far.

The sailing is immensely fun. Being behind every single one of these ships is a pure delight and it feels just plain good to have control of either of the three ships provided. 

The non ship combat feels good to me at least and each weapon you get is well suited for their roles.

However, I do have a few negatives, but instead of bashing like I have seen before I thought I'd put my two cents in as constructively as possible.

The PvP has been fun at times and there's hardly been a time where I have even come close to getting upset with losing loot or something else. Now this comes from another highly loved game Elite Dangerous that I have played on and off since the beginning. 

Solo servers where you can only invite friends as well as open servers I think could be amazing, as the trailer does a very good job convincing you there IS a place in this game for solo players, and from what I have both heard and experienced first hand it can be, but is not always, a very tough task to accomplish. So here are a few things I have drummed up in my head while relaxing with a bit of fishing in game. 

1. NPC faction ships. This would be AMAZING as Elite Dangerous has random NPC ships you can encounter. Although the number of them in open servers would be minimal due to players currently playing and the size of the map. It could even go into you having an emissary flag on your ship and if you take down another NPC ship flying another flag you get a little bit of rep with your faction but ultimately not counting towards any multiplier.

2. Safe zones. I know I know, this probably rubs some people the wrong way, but in the instance of griefers and especially in the case of larger skeleton ships, there are some times where you are vastly outgunned by say a larger player/skeleton ship. Having an area where you are unable to sell anything or are unable to injure a player/damage a ship is almost like having a hub in MMOs where you are able to meet players and interact with them, and if done right giving an incredible social aspect. 

3. Ship scaling. There have been times where either solo sailing or with one other friend I have been decimated by a skeleton Galleon. It wouldn't be such a bad thing if the skeleton ships were proportional to what you were sailing especially since they are incredibly fast/accurate shots and love to use special rounds in their cannons. 

That's all I have really thought up in the amount of time I have played so far, and I just want to say I do not hate any part of this game nor do I think it is bad in any way. I genuinely love it and just wanted to say these few things as a means to maybe make this game even better. 

Again I absolutely love this game and haven't stopped playing since I have bought it and these are just plainly opinions and suggestions and honestly I have no clue how they'd implement these things. I tried to keep from sounding like I was complaining in the slightest and if it comes off that way I do apologize, because I've had a ton of fun so far and just wanted to say these few things as a means to maybe make this an even better experience not just for the PvP crowd or the PvE crowd, but for all types of players so that this playerbase can flourish and grow more and more as time goes on.",1594945374,1594945772,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198059271849,336,10,6753,0,4277,1595310121

You will play this game, and you will have a story. Maybe that story ends abruptly, from the business end of an enemy cannon. Maybe it's about the first time you ran into some of the world's obstacles. Or the time you soiled yourself mistaking a guard tower for an enemy ship on the horizon. Don't lie, we've all done it. But you will at the very least have one good story to tell your friends about the adventure you had in this silly little pirate game.

Another plus is Xbox and PC players can play together!

[h1]Full review[/h1]
Good game just buy it.

[b]But seriously. I would recommend it, here's why.[/b] 

Most games i've played are quite linear or at some point start to give you an impression what you can expect the next time you play. This game is an unique experience every time you play. You can encounter other players that will go out of their way to make your ship sink. Or you meet people that will offer an alliance while downing a grog. Sometimes you won't see many people at all and you're busy getting some sweet loot and fighting off PvE enemies such as megalodons, krakens and skeleton fleets/ships. This randomness can make for great experiences thus making it one of the best story games out there since you write your own stories.

[u]Just be warned that Thieves is in the name, stealing loot or getting your loot stolen is part of the game as painful as that can be sometimes. But remember that it keeps it tense and fun, even if you disagree in the heat of the moment.[/u]

I'd say the two major issues are bugs and pirate legend being useless. Sometimes it feels like it lacks content and like the content is so one dimensional because, well, it honestly is if you don't make it fun yourself. PVP is probably the most fun thing to do, but sometimes athena quests and PVE (like grinding the FotD) are the thing you want to do most. It's a sandbox game and that really describes it well imo. It has one dimensional content which is maybe not the best game design, but it's a fucking playground. Go play and make it fun for yourself. Don't complain about silly things or things you can't change, but learn to accept them and then use them as fuel for your endeavors.

This game has many issues but overall I'd give a big fucking thumbs up for this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it, but you gotta know what you're getting into before buying it yourself.

Sea of Thieves was one of my highlights since the time it was launched on Microsoft Store. Not being a big fan other platforms, I hesitated to purchase the game in order not to strict myself with Xbox and Microsoft's features and only particiapated a little in free trial of SoT. And those 30 minutes were the best moments and I cannot trade it with anything else. And now, Sea of Thieves is here alongside everything majestic it brings.

[list]
    [*]Gameplay
In Sea of Thieves, there is [b] vast adventure and experience [/b] awaiting for you and when I say vast, I mean it. Prepare yourself for continuous interruptions for your expectations. Are you planning to do a voyage? Expect countless PvE and PvP encounters. Planning to land on an island? Perhaps it will erupt. Sailing from one island to another? The things that are awaiting for you in the sea...

In Sea of Thieves, you have two dominant objectives. Exploring and earning. By exploring, you will experience various weather conditions that shape the gameplay (fogs, thunders, big waves), new locations that differ from eachother (volcanic islands, islands with PvE encounters). Your main tasks for gaining, however, has many ways. You can do voyages that require you to do a treasure hunt, fight, or package delivery. 

When you look through a narrow perspective, Sea of Thieves sounds like a ""reputation farming"" game. But the maing thing in Sea of Thieves is not just these quests but everything else you encounter throughout these voyages and quests.

For those who hate [b] Player-versus-Player [/b] experiences, I highly advise you to get your team of pirates together and dive into this experience. The community is always welcoming and you should take advantage of this to sail together to have the maximum experience.

[*]Design
I believe it is an obligation to create a sub-category for this in Sea of Thieves. The aesthetic of the sea is the highlight of this game. In all of the conditions, sea has a different role and an appearance and all of them are unique. Truly the ""sea"" in Sea of Thieves is one of the most aesthetic features in the game. Other than that, the game shares not-entirely ""cartoonish"" look from its character design to monsters. The ship cosmetics also provide no benefit, but surely they are one of the most beautiful things to explore between tons of varities.

[*]Soundtracks, Microtransactions, Final Note
The team behind music of Sea of Thieves crafted such beautiful components that you can feel each and every experience in the game in a different way. Got a massive shark attacking your ship? Here is your intense theme. Raiding a fort? Here is your sinister theme. Attacking an army of ships? Here, have another intense theme. The soundtrack is amazing.
Microtransactions in the game provide no gameplay benefit, so it is just cosmetics. Additionally, you can purchase pets that are only available with microtransactions.

[h1] Sea of Thieves is the game that we all needed for both PvE and PvP experience combined. It rewards you for your enthusiasm and participation in the game and keeps you playing.

Rare is very persistant on catering to the casuals, dumbing down the combat, and removing mechanics that in my opinion only adds depth to the (already shallow) PvP experience. The upcoming removal of wallbangs being the final nail in the coffin for me personally. Rare recently issued permanent bans to a ton of great PvP players due to ""toxic behaviour"", and a lot of them appear to be unjust. Some of the players that were banned didn't even have game chat enabled, but were banned for ""toxic"" comments in a discord server.

- The hit registration in this game has been an absolute joke since launch. They've attempted to fix it with multiple updates, but have seemingly only made it worse. In the coming update they are making more changes to the hitreg, but at this point, after so many ""fixes"", why would I believe anything is going to change.

So let's summarize what to expect:
1. This is a [b]full online[/b] game. You will see other crews and they can attack you as well as you can attack them. You are not alone on the sea.
2. [b]Sailing[/b] a pirate ship [b]is not easy[/b]. Set Sail, retrieve anchor, turn sails in the ever turning wind, use the steering wheel and shoot with canons are individual stations. While you have to repair the ship under deck.
3. This is [b]mostly a coop/group game[/b]. While you can play the game solo, I would recommend to have at least 1 friend. The more the merrier! And it makes ship fights easier and even Captain Jack Sparrow had a crew most of the time. Your crew size is between 1 and 4 people with 3 different ship sizes (1-2, 1-3, 1-4) each having pros and cons.
4. [b]Expect to lose your loot[/b] at any time, especially in your first few hours. The Kraken whose weakness you dont know perfectly, other players stealing your stuff while you kill some skeletons on an island or losing to an enemy ship in an epic battle.

    Its a Unique game with a forgiving sailing Mechanic so anyone can get on the high Seas...   I didnt think I would like this game because I played ATLAS already but I found the 'NEW'ness of the world, the lore, and the artwork it to be refreshingly delightful.
CONS:  
    While I was selling my hauls in Port I heard the sounds of Cannon Fire. I Turn around to find my Ship being blown apart!  I was able to get back on board, patch one hole, fire 1 cannonball, and take out two of their crew (not bad for 1st time imo) before they sank my ship and latter sliced me up in the City...  
This was not something I expected in a City PORT, their should be a place where we can all congregate and talk freely without worrying about our ship being sunk 5m later...

Bosun Bill was known throughout the port,
a truly dreadful pirate who was always getting caught,
not one scheme for stealing he could hatch
cause someone would spot the treasure he'd got and Bill they'd snatch!
one day bill awoke laying on a distant beach
the last of his grog was just out of reach.
he groped around with trembling hands
and struck something in the sand!
he'd stumbled upon a part
of an ancient chart
strained and torn, the old map told
the way to find a stash of buried gold,
so...

Bosun Bill set out to find a crew,
but everyone he asked replied, ""i'll never sail with you!""
'til at last, he plied a man with ale
to lend him his craft, a rickety raft, then bill set sail!
all by himself, Bill trembled in the dark
he lost both his boots and his hat to a shark.
he followed the chart 'til at last he saw
the gleam of a far off shore!
the trail led into a cave
silent as the grave
Bill stood gaping at what he saw...
a hoard of treasure piled from roof to floor!

Bosun Bill stuffed treasure into his sack
he loaded up the boat, but heard a mighty crack.
he'd taken too much plunder when he should have kept it light
the raft and all the gold sank out of sight!

Bosun Bill let out a terrible curse.
he'd had a chance at glory but he'd only come out worse!
to this day he's trapped on the island still.

99,72727907,english,"I've played Sea of Thieves for a few weeks now and there are both pros and cons to this game...

First of all, I highly recommend playing the game with friends! I've played both as a solo player and with a group, and the latter is a much more enjoyable experience. Don't get me wrong, playing solo is fun as well but you become easy prey for larger crews/ships who can overwhelm your one-man Sloop in literally seconds - meaning that your hard earned loot can be easily plundered - making the past hour of treasure hunting completely mute.

Pros:
- The game looks truly stunning! The stylised design keeps the game lighthearted and the environments/ocean look exceptional.

- Managing your ship is a lot of fun. Players have a choice between three types of ship: the Sloop, the Brigantine and the Galleon. Each ship is harder than the other meaning that you will require more hands on decks to help with the sails, look-out and cannons.

Players need to actively resupply their ships with food (to regain health) wood (to repair the ship) and various types of cannonball. 

- The supplies in this game are completely free. Each dock you start at has a number of supply barrels with the supplies you need. All you need to do is simply pick them up and store them in your hold. You can then find a great many supply barrels or chests throughout the world to stock up.

- Combat is fun! Especially with a crew! But watch your ammo - this can run out quickly if you've forgotten to resupply your cannonballs!

- Every player...and I mean EVERY player have the exact same weapons. There is absolutely ZERO play-to-play in this game! Player have limited ammo on their person but your ship has an ammo chest with unlimited ammo and a weapons chest where you can change your weapons loadout. Weapons CANNOT be upgraded with more powerful ammo, stopping power etc - winning a fight is purely a contest of either skill...or greater numbers.

The same goes for the ships. Although the bigger the ship - the more cannons - but the cannons, themselves, are all the same.

Sails cannot also be upgraded, nor can the hull. Unfortunately, the bigger the ship - the more sails - therefore; more speed!

- The puzzles for missions or random treasure hunts are really fun. It requires you and your crew to decipher clues which require tasks or just finding the spots that mark you to that all important 'X'.

- Navigating storms and coming across ghost ships or skeleton ships adds to the random events in the game. You could be sailing happily with your crew, playing a sea shanty with your instruments and then a ship will literally emerge from the ocean and start attacking.

The storms throw your all important compass off, meaning you or a member of your crew need to relay instructions from the interactive map, below deck, and the rain from the storm also floods your ship - which means someone also has to be on bailing duty! 


Cons:
- There is a severe lack of progression in the overall game. All money you earn in the game is only spent on cosmetics (which is fine) but it would be nice to add GTA V style businesses in the game i.e. owning your own docks, buying a pirate lair or a trade business and then trying to fend off rival pirate clans etc. This would add a lot more depth into the game.

- There is rarely a friendly player in the game! You are literally, constantly scanning the horizons or nearby islands for other sails.

Bigger ships tend to also prey on smaller ships for easy kills and loot. If you're in a Sloop and you spot a  Brigantine or a Galleon...you better sail like hell! 

- There are NO safe ports in Sea of Thieves! You and your crew can be docked at a port either buying cosmetics for your ship or character, finding a new mission or even getting drunk at the local tavern and then all hell brakes loose when another crew decides to attack your ship as it's docked, raid any supplies you have or even kill you.

- The servers are extremely odd and can make for some painful experiences!

You may log onto a server and be on for an hour or so, but there may only be you or another one or two crews - max - on the server. The server will then decide to migrate everyone onto a more populous server - however! It does not relocate you to another server within your region, but rather one where you will get the HIGHEST ping known on the seven seas! Meaning that you can expect regular disconnects, major lag and clipping.

This server issue is even more annoying as a player cannot just reconnect to another server from the in-game menu. To do so, one has to completely log out of the session (loosing all your supplies and or booty) and then reconnect and start from scratch! 

Conclusion:

All in all, the game is a lot of fun - especially when you're with friends. Graphically it looks amazing, the gameplay is fun and doesn't require a lot of practise and the sailing mechanics/ship management only adds to the pirate experience. 

Solving puzzles, taking on hordes of skeletons can be challenging and can often be rewarded with an ton of gold and or riches, however, with no real progression system the game can feel a little lack-lustre here and there. Trolling players can be a real pain in the ass and the servers REALLY DO NEED SORTING OUT!

15,72713468,english,I started playing this game a few weeks ago and I have to say I am impressed. The game has just the right mix of pvp and pve that I like as a player. Yes you will like in every game that has open world pvp find some toxic players who enjoy killing other just for the tears but in most cases I have enjoyed the fights against other crews for the gold. That is the point of the games since it is called Sea of Thieves. One very positive aspect is that the PVE aspect has a great story line behind it and I  have enjoyed doing it. The rewards are also good. So as a player you can in most cases avoid active PVP and just do PVE content. I am an old school player who played Ultima Online and the PVP/PVE mix of this game reminds me of the Pre-Trammel days and I love this.

27,72702937,english,"GREAT GAME (A review from a solo slooper)

This game reminds me of CSGO a bit. Hold up, keep reading.

The mechanics, and controls are unlike most other games you've ever played, especially if you've never played World of Warships, and don't know how to aim arms from a ship. You'll need to learn, even with a crew, to balance all 3 aspects of maintaining the vessel. Captaining, Shooting, and Bailing. CSGO like learning curve? Check.

The community gives no shits that its your first time playing. They dont care that you have no clue what your doing, and they don't care that you JUST spawned. Why would they? Aside from being a game about PIRACY, who would know how new you are? Just hurry up, clear out some barrels off the dock, drop that sail and get a move on! You can at least see possible enemies and strat your way out of danger. And if you do get sunk off the rip, who cares? Go fight the guy, die, and you'll respan with a fresh ship on a lonely a$$ island. Soooo CSGO like comunity toxicity? Check.

But once you get over the newbie starting line, figure out how to sail a bit, learn to read the ocean and the skies, all the mechanics BLAH BLAH BLAH...you suddenly realize you can hang. Once you realize you can hang, you start ""gittin gud"" and then you'll be just as well equipt as anyone else in the server. Even as a solo slooper. Sure as a solo I avoid fights like plagues, but it doesn't mean your toast because a Galleon rolled up on you. I've solo toasted a 3 man Galleon. It aint easy, but big ships are full of dummies that can't play together or communicate, so the fire of anarchy lights as soon as they take a round. CSGO like addiction rateing? As I'm writing this, my ENTIRE keyboard and moniter is swaying. I physically feel like I'm on the waves, despite only playing this game for a few days now. Check, yes, most DEFINITELY CHECK CHECK CHECK.

If your OK with a BLISTERINGLY challenging learning curve, keeping your wits on you at all times, and possibly setting up in your bathroom so you can continuously puke in the tub until you get your sea legs, get the game. Do the Maiden Voyage, at the start of the game, jump into an open matching on a Galleon, and refuse to captain it. Use the crew to help guide your learning curve, then try closed matching by yourself in a sloop to learn to sail like a boss. You'll get there.

Oh, a quick tip: NEVER, upon finding cursed cannon balls place them in the ships barrels. You sink, they sink. Keep them in your invin and you'll respawn with em after death.",1594770355,1594770355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198451819566,60,5,5139,0,2973,1599785560

Hopefully you paid attention to that intro.

The game is not PvP or PvE, the game is PURELY PvP and PvPvE. There is no pure PvE mode (hypocritical on Rare's part, there is a PvP mode)

If you are looking for a Rust style game based on the sea, then you get Rust in it's community glory. The PvP is ok, the people are garbage human beings, and it's all sweat all the way down.

If you are looking for family friendly fun time, easy sailing, or anything calming and enjoyable, (As the style and Rare would like you to believe is possible) DO NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.

The intro alone means you can't refund the game due to the starting length based on steam's requirements.

I repeat, PVP is how the community sees the game. It may be a PvPvE game, as the mechanics show, but the community is Shoot and Kill first, be friendly so far to second that first died of old age.

To recap, if you spend 3 hours having fun with a friend, you WILL have your things stolen and all your hard work removed with no way to get it back.
There is no progression system, so you lose everything.

41,72692677,english,"First things first: I am not a big fan of pvp only games and since nobody of my friends was willing to buy the game, the first two hours I was alone on my sloop. 
In fear I just rotated in the crow's nest with the spyglasses in my hands, looking out for others players. 
I even took it that far, that I was searching for a pve only solution for the game.
After the third hour, without seeing any other player, I finally calmed down a bit and started to enjoy the unique style of the game.

Then in the fourth hour, of course with treasure in the hold, I met a crew of three players.
Anchoring in front of an island I ran back to my ship, of course frightening that they will just drown my sloop.
But instead I was lucky, they just waved and sailed along.

Then I realized, the pvp part is adding the thrill. 
Humans are interesting little unpredictable little fricktards.
A pve only game would become easy to predict after a while.

So all in all, it is nice to have a quick jump into the game, playing solo, enjoying the atmosphere and playing at my own pace, but obviously the game is meant to play with others.
So I tried the open crew feature choosing a sloop and met a really nice guy, who was willing to explain me the basics. 
The next day, hyped from the day before, I tried the feature again, this time for the three-master.
And hey, I can say, I really cannot recommend to do that :D
Four completely random persons on a big ship, two of them without a microphone, the third sounded like he was sitting in a meeting in homeoffice, playing SoT alongside.
It was a mess!

If you play solo or with a crew, I can just recommend to use a headset.
First part is to enjoy the great ambient noise, 
the second is about communicating with others, 
without typing mile-long sentences while the ship is sinking.

If you are new (like me) just try it solo on a sloop, I mean, there is nothing to loose at all, 
since all rewards are cosmetics only.
There are youtube channels from experienced players who are explaining 
what you should consider while playing alone.
There are also discord channels with other people looking for a crew.
And since I have no friends............ that are playing Sea of Thieves of course,
I am also happy about every invite to play SoT with you.

This review I am writing after 7 hours into the game.
Maybe I have to adjust it after a few more hours,
if I was just lucky so far and now I am approaching many more hours 
of toxic behaviour and seal clubbing :)
But I really hope it is the opposite!",1594755082,1594755082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198009868604,168,10,709,0,441,1597955542

With that out of the way, however, the game is a great time when all goes well, easily able to steal hours of free time as you sail from harrowing adventure to harrowing adventure.

81,72666821,english,"TL;DR: Yarghh Harghhh, the seas be a cruel mistress but opportunity for glory be a foot! Errrr, rather, a peg there matey.

For someone who has been looking for a pirate game for a real long time, having played Sid Meier's Pirates, Black Flag, Atlas, and a few others, this game feels like a happy ending to my journey searching.

When you're on the ship, the water feels real, the sailing feels heavy, and aiming your cannons feels like it makes all the sense in the world. Are the quests a little repetitive by nature? Yes (each of the 3 main factions sports 2 types of quests). Is that what this game is about? No. As many YouTubers, Streamers, and people who play the game will tell you, it's not completing the quests that makes the game fun. When you're sailing from island to island completing the various quests, it is what happens during that time that makes the game fun. Your map will never be going from Point A to Point B and back to Point A again. Sure, it will be dead sometimes, but maybe another player shows up, a Kraken, a storm, skele galleon, or you accidentally sail into Flameheart. ""Oh wait, is that a fort over there? FotD? Let's go."" Maybe it's all of the above.

I've only played for around 60 hours and haven't really noticed any bugs. If there are any, I haven't really noticed them because I was too busy enjoying the game. Can sword and gun mechanics be a little wonky? Sure. Am I a pro? No. So I could very well be making mistakes. I also don't feel that my negative interactions with other sailors is worthy of if the game should be considered good or bad, solo slooping ain't easy, that ain't the games fault.

Whatever problems I've had with the game, have been blended in with all the good content that I've enjoyed. Highly recommend to those people who love a good Pirate RPG.

For the creators: I think an idea for future content could be 4-8 rare NPC pirates like Blackbeard or w.e. that rarely spawn on the map. Have their own faction as well with an island in the center of the map, maybe that island has a map that shows if there is a current NPC on the map and where but that would be the only place you could see their location unless you stumbled on them. After killing them 5-10 times, you could unlock their livery's. Their loot could be something different like a special flag like the emissary flags that you could sell to that centralized island for big money. Maybe make the initial wave like 2 of their captains on the map before they themselves spawn so you have to kill them first.",1594722191,1594722191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198043785160,321,2,8805,0,3458,1599810143

95,72657277,english,"I'm writing this review, because at the time I bought the game for myself and my daughter, I had no idea that it was PVP only. And I think it's important that people know it's PVP only, and that Rare has no intention of adding PVE...EVER. So buyer beware before you invest in this at-times fun, but frequently frustrating time-sink of a game.

For all its piratey goodness, Sea of Thieves by Rare has a single wart...and it's a big, nasty one - there is no PVE mode and there are no PVE servers. Try as you might to enjoy the PVE aspects of the game, the PVP'ers will not leave you alone to quest and PVE in peace - it can mean literally hours of wasted time, since collecting and turning in your loot is a time-intensive process. This is doubly annoying because the game is so grindy when gaining coinage and reputation.

All of the PVP'ers are folks who have been playing for 100s of hours and have mastered the game - so when they prey on newbies like myself and my daughter, it really is indistinguishable from griefing. There have been dozens if not hundreds of requests for Rare to release PVE servers, and deep down inside the Rare devs must acknowledge there's a problem, and keep the PVE'ers from fleeing the game after more than a couple of hours. 

First, Rare released PVE-style Tall Tales, which are fun, but you will still be PVP'd while trying to complete them. Second, Rare released the Emissary system, which attempts to put a bandaid on the PVP / PVE situation, but all it really does is create bonuses for PVP'ers - it doesnt protect or disincentivize the PVP'ers from preying on the new and unskilled. Finally, Rare has gone to great lengths to ensure new ships that spawn into a server, spawn far away and isolated from the other ships that are already there. Rare is clearly aware of the issue but only bandaids the problem and doesn't deliver the real solution - PVE servers or PVE/PVP only flags.

Another tell here is that anytime someone requests a PVE mode or PVE server, the PVP trolls come out of the woodwork to try and shut down all discussion. Which makes you realize, the anti-PVE mantras of ""its how the game was designed"" and ""its a PIRATE game"" are just cover stories masking the truth: the PVP wolves need a steady supply easy-to-fleece sheep to maintain their egos and their loot supplies. They know that if Rare ever released PVE servers, the PVPers would be stuck to themselves - funny how they don't want THAT level of PVP challenge.

It's a mystery to me why Rare has its head in the sand regarding PVE and chooses to miss out on all the revenue the PVE community represents. In any case, once my daughter and I finish all the Tall Tales, we will be sailing on to better games that value PVE customers - I hear Deep Rock Galactic is pretty fun.",1594704421,1594704421,False,12,3,0.550921738147735596,6,True,False,False,76561197982760802,419,3,4964,0,4213,1597004735

27,72640882,english,"Best Pirate Game that you will find out there! I am amazed how fun and addictive this game is, I've spent around 100 hours playing this game in only 2 weeks after purchase! There is so much content aside from PvP, from quests,tales,events and much more! This game is perfect if you have friends to play with. It isn't really great playing alone, but don't worry,there is a really good system that connects you with other players and let's you join their groups. If you are looking to sail the vast seas, full of many islands and treasures, encounter other pirates and fight them or make alliance with them? Fight the Kraken and Ghost Ship Armies while playing pirate shanties*, this is the game for you!!!

Pros :
1. Amazing world with many beautiful places to visit.
2. Great and tense PvP.
3. PvE is amazing, it contains many tale stories, various different quests and great riddles to solve!
4. Awesome balance between the players when it comes to PvP, there are no upgrades,skills or improvements you can do to get stronger, it's all pretty well balanced so that every player has a chance to fight and win, depending on your skill to sail the ship and handle the weapons.
5. The customization is awesome when it comes to ships and characters, various skins and colors from which you can choose from. You can customize your ship,weapons,clothes,music instruments,compass,spyglass,bucket and so forth...
6. AMAZING PIRATE SHANTIES TO PLAY WITH YOUR CREW !!!!!!
7. Unpredictable events that can make you're journey tougher.


Cons :
1. Absolutely none.

Game is worth every penny I guarantee it! I wasn't sure myself when I was getting it, but hell I was wrong. This game is something refreshing, something new that isn't out there on the market, and they implemented everything perfectly within these past years with updates, hence more updates are always being released with a lot of new skins and events!!!

You can embark on voyages, and dig treasure, you can do Tall Tales, which are playable stories throughout the world. You can solve riddles, puzzles, etc. It is also a shared world, meaning you can come across other players, who more often than not are very hostile.

This is essentially an open world shared pirate experience, and it's amazing. However, this game is very much for the experiences. No progress is made whatsoever, you can embark on legendary quests and recieve tons of gold after completing them, but this gold is only spent on cosmetics. The game is about playing, earning money, and buying yourself some cool stuff essentially. There is absolutely no purchaseable items that progress you.

44,72560917,english,"Don't waste your time. This game takes all of the worst elements of End-Game-MMO's and makes it the core gameplay. There is no progression; no story progression, no weapons to buy, to upgrades for you ship, you are as powerfully at the start of the game as you will ever be. The only things you can actually buy are cosmetics for a ship you barely see as the game is entirely in first person. There are no classes so there are no different skills or play styles to choose from, only one type of enemy. All of the quests are procedurally generated fetch quests ; go to this island that's like all of the other and kill skeletons/collect animals/ dig up a box.

The blurb on the steam page says you can do the following :

Sailing : This is true...yay...

Fighting : you only have a sword and gun, one attack animation, and no upgrades. There isn't anything to fight except the same skeletons over and over and over again. Maybe you can fight other players but I haven't seen any, or seen a reason to fight them, especially since the game now has a dedicated PVP Arena.

Exploring : There's plenty to explore, but no reason to. The islands are all the same. Beach, a few trees, a cave with nothing in it. There is nothing to find except the occasional journal or piece of ""treasure"" if you're lucky. Because you start the game as powerful as you'll ever be, you can go anywhere from minute 1 and never feel like you're making progress through the world.

Looting : The only reason to kill other players or go exploring is to get gold. The only reason to get gold is to get cosmetics, That's literally all it is good for. You can't even buy consumables like food or cannon balls because those are found littering every island you go on.

Additionally, it seems the multiplayer aspect of this game is gank/grief oriented and Kill-On-Sight. Every player I've met so far has immediately rammed my ship, killed me and stuck around to kill me again when I respawned. Even when I'm off my ship on an island, they highjack the ship, with no treasure on it, run it aground, and kill me when I come back and spawn camp me afterwards. It's toxic and annoying and the community practically encourages the behavior. 

This game had a lot of potential but squandered it on lazy design, it's all of the tacked-on ignorable features from every other game lumped into one large disappointing pile of nothing. Hour 5 will be same as hour 500. If you want a good pirate game go play AC:Black Flag. If you want good naval combat go play Blackwake, if you want good story based island hopping go play The Raft.

Do i recomend it though....ehhh
SOT is a very fun game, especially with friends and it certaintly has done a lot to fix the issues it had at launch, but there are a ton of issues that make me occasionally a bit mixed on it.
- Forced microsoft intergration. It does allow cross-platform but it is a pain to deal with. You cant even join friends over steam. Because of Microsofts crappy feedback and help and randomly locking accounts, i got locked out of this game for a good 2 weeks. Oh and by the way, once an account is locked to SoT, its locked to steam. If you lose it, tough.
- Glitches, my god. Minor stuff like constant t-posing to massive audio issues, loot despawning, teleporting and all sorts. Half of them have been unfixed since *launch*
- No bounty system makes pirating rather boring and doesnt give a good risk or reward to doing or fighting against it
- Tall tales are mostly very boring and repetivie, when the game asks you to beat each of them *five times*
- Server lag and performance issues, still very problematic
- Zero progression. Money is for cosmetics and nothing else. Progression though the emissaries gets more cosmetics. Pirate legend gets more cosmetics. Theres *nothing* tangable gained from your progress at all. 
- Impossible to join servers. Got more than 4 people looking to play? Tough.
- No saving at all. Your ship and all its contents are lost the moment you log out or sink.

50,72628209,english,"Sea of thieves is an amazing game to play, solo or with friends.

Unfortunately it got a bad reputation at launch. People (correctly) called it out for a lack of content or things to do in it, and most people have stuck with that opinion regardless. The developers, much like No Mans Sky, have worked tirelessly to fill the game with plenty of content but that reputation remains. Only after buying the game for various friends did I manage to shake their perception!

The game has two states. It can be very peaceful, almost zen. Sailing the seas, hanging with friends, fishing off the deck while you wait for the wind to change and pick up speed.

It can also be brutal, attacked by a kraken while fending off another player, trapping you with them and low supplies while you desperately try to protect your treasure.

All in all, if you're on the fence, I say check it out. With steams refund system you can play the tutorial and do a mission or two before your two hours are up and decide if this game is for you.

If you have Windows 10, search for ""xbox"" in the search bar, and open Xbox Console Companion, and you have to make an account in the Xbox platform when you open the console companion, there will be short instructions on how to make an account (almost like making a google account). And after you made an account, and start the game it will ask you if you want to attach your steam account to the xbox account. Press ""Yes"". And then you will be able to proceed to the game!

This game is definitely worth the buy. This pirate game is about teamwork and plundering gold from islands and shipwrecks, sometimes if ships you've beaten yourself. In the game, you play between 3 different ships, each one of them being different from each other but is used by either 1/2, 3 or 4 crew members. You have to manage sailing through the tough seas of thieves as you try and build reputation with 5 different alliances. Each having an objective of their own.

I don't want to write a very large review so I'll try and conclude. This game is really fun with friends and even by yourself if you enjoy the pirate's life at sea. Due to it's style, modern computers will be able to run this game well and at good quality.

30,71900272,english,"Man... what to say about Sea of Thieves... This game is fun honestly and with a group of people its a blast and there's quite a bit of content to keep you and your friends playing for a while, but its got some major issues. Ill detail my thoughts on those.

When I say there is a lot of content, there is. There are different factions and lots of levels to grind and rep to grow and lots of add on's for the ships but the big major flaw here is its all almost the same. The factions have you do a few different mission types whether its killing skeletons or digging up treasure chests, but in the end its all the same. If you go to dig up chests, you will fight skeletons, if you go and deliver loot, you will most likely find some maps for treasure... and skeletons. It just ends up feeling all the same, go here kill some stuff, sell the loot. It's fun for a while sure, but its empty. The longer it goes on the quicker it wears out its welcome. 

The game is pretty risk free and you really start to notice, I have over a million gold and so nothing really matters if you die, the worst is that you will lose some loot on the boat and really this is only a big deal if you havent sold stuff in a few hours and if you are smart you can basically pass by outposts and sell a few things here and there and thats if someone is really REALLY chasing you. Most people just give up.
The risk free part makes fight worth a lot less and to be honest if someone really wants to get away from you, they pretty much can, unless you are able to catch someone sitting in the water or they have the anchor dropped, its hard to catch someone who is just focused on running away. I dont have a good solution to this but Ive had lots of time sitting in the boat sailing even pace with a boat in front of us, waiting for them to stop or turn or do something and then an hour has passed and we get bored and pull off.
I dont have the perfect solution to this, but it seems to many things are focused around the game being safe and honestly pretty easy. 
Give us a way to up the stakes.


I'll talk about a few positives before I talk about my biggest gripe.

The sea is amazing, it looks good, it feels real honestly this game is a boat sailing simulator with pirate stuff added in and thats a good thing, they did a great job. Skeleton forts are fun and can be a bit of a challenge from time to time. This game does a great job of adding a lot of value playing with more people, its honestly not to good alone but every time you add another person you really feel a different angle of play.

So on to my main issue. This game has so many bugs! Bugs that honestly really mess with the game play and are sometime game breaking and these reasons are the biggest reason I cannot recommend this game. 

1. The compass on the boat sometimes will just not work, its annoying having to let go to check your personal compass.
2. Music often wont play with instruments, but often times shipmates can hear it but I cant or vice versa. 
3. Sometimes me and my friends cant drive the dingy, it simply wont let us grab the oars and drive.
4. I experience a game breaking bug where my pause menu will open and will not close, I've tried closing it time and time again but the only thing that will work is closing the game, this is crazy detrimental to the game because I cant eat or grab wood, if this happens I pretty much have to close the game down instantly and reopen it.
5. The game often thinks you are stuck and will go dark and teleport you back to the boat for no reason?
6. You will get stuck in a rock or in a tree... and wont teleport you back to the boat.
7. Loot will constantly sink in the water, pretty much if you see seagulls in the sea above some loot, move fast because as soon as you get close it will drop. This use to happen once in a blue moon, but recently its about every time or more we go to loot in the water.


The game is fun and I dont regret my time put into the game, and I hopefully will keep playing but this game has been out for years. Fix the bugs. If the game continues to run in this state, I know I wont stay for long.

EDIT: I'm just adding on to this review. Its been another 20 hours or so since I wrote this review and the bugs are continuing to grow. Loot is dropping more rapidly and it seems about 1 out of 3 skeleton boats are not dropping loot, and I have taken a few screen shots of my boat floating into outer space....

42,72570019,english,"If you want some swashbuckling pirating adventure time, I feel there's no better game out there currently. Since Sid Meier's Pirates came out, I have been in need of some good action in this department, so me and a couple friends picked it up.

After completing the Maiden Voyage, I decided to hop into a sloop solo just to fart around and try to get used to things. I picked up a Hoarder's voyage just for fun. After plotting my course, I set out, thinking it would be all fun and games. Less than a minute after leaving the outpost, the sea turned nasty, with huge waves crashing around me, and the wind howling. The skies turned dark, and I became slightly alarmed. A deafening roar filled the air, and the fabled kraken rose from the depths and surrounded me. I knew it was in the game, but I didn't expect to see it on my first mission. Its sheer size filled me with dread, and I had no idea what to do, as its massive tentacles wrapped themselves around my puny boat. Leaks were springing around everywhere, as I feverishly ran two and fro trying to patch them up. It was to no avail. Soon, my ship was slipping under, into Davy Jones' Locker, with me inside. It went down so fast, I had no time to get out of the hold, and the water was so dark I didn't know which way was up and where to swim to escape. I accepted my fate as my lungs filled with water, and I faded out of existence......

My eyes blinked, and I saw light! I had escaped death it seemed! I got up on my feet on a sandy beach, and took a look around me. My faithful sloop was not far away from the shore, rocking gently in the breeze. I searched the tiny island for supplies, and thought, ""Lets try this again"". I left, heading for my original goal of buried treasure before the Kraken had its way with me. Suddenly, in the distance, A sail! I whipped out my spyglass, and determined a 3-4 man team was headed straight for me. I let down the sails, and headed with the wind at full speed. They soon gave up the chase, as the wind was on my side. I was now back on course. Suddenly, another storm arose, and a cannon shot slammed into my ship. A skeleton ship had risen from the depths, and was trying to make sharkbait of me. I feverishly patched holes while keeping on going, and eventually I escaped them too. As I came out of the storm, I emerged next to a beautiful mountain peak stretching into the sky. ""What a beautiful yet intimidating island"" I thought to myself. Suddenly, an earth shattering boom filled my ears, and the mountaintop exploded as truck sized boulders came flying out of the sky all around me. Let me tell you, being right at the base of an erupting volcano is no joke. I thought I was dead for sure, as a giant flaming rock flew straight down at my ship, only to have it narrowly miss me. I zigg zagged my way out of there, surviving some how, with deafening booms all around me. 

Afterwards that, I found the island i needed, found my treasure, and sold it back at an outpost. What an incredible journey. I feel I almost got the full rundown of what can happen in SoT, all crammed into my first mission.

The biggest problem with the game is how to play with friends. The game does not help you at all in getting set up with this. You have to download the xbox windows app manually, and add your friends on it to play with them. Simply linking your steam account does nothing, at least for me.

Game doesn't hold your hand too much, but teaches you the basics of pirate life in a tutorial mission or your ""Maiden Voyage"". The world itself you need to experience and see yourself, so you know not to hit that ground on shallow water at that one outpost or know the location of those uncharted islands. You'll be able to learn more advanced maneuvers with ships, the worth of each type of treasure, and when to run from a skeleton ship fight as you play. Gameplay is more session-based, in that you should sell your loot and do any quests you want before ending your session. At the start of each session you should stock up on extra cannonballs, food, planks etc. with your crew before heading out.

All in all, about 18 hours in and with some guidance I have gotten my wife playing this as well, even though this is more challenging and more PVP oriented than what she usually plays, this has been fun for both of us.

The gameplay itself is potentially a bit limited, at least if you approach it with expectations from other games. There is no leveling, or buying better gear, or upgrading. Victory or defeat rely solely on what actions you take in the moment, and the enjoyment of the experience is very tied to the immersion of existing in the world.

Best played with other people, but still enjoyable as a single player. I played with friends in a group of 4, and over the course of about 4 hours we... got attacked and sunk by a kraken, got attacked and sunk by our own stupidity, got sunk by other players, and finally sunk an enemy ship by ramming it. The game alternates between beautiful and peaceful moments sailing the ocean, and frantically intense moments trying to survive against all odds.

I'd not played any good pirate game for years but after getting my hands on this one, I immediately fell in love because this game is realistic in many aspects, from solving treasure riddles to sea battles and countless unexpected encounters you can get while sailing the seven seas. Beware of the clock because Sea of Thieves might suck a ton of time from you, as longer session means more gold and usually you want to keep playing forever because there are just so much to do in this game. And also, the graphics (especially the water) and ambient audio is incredibly good, which contribute to the realistic pirate experience you'll have when playing this game.
I cannot give it a perfect score yet, because there are still some issues in gameplay experience. Controls and item browsing can be messy sometimes since this game is also designed for consoles. Sensitivity for different items are not 1:1 and it is not adjustable, I don't know why. And personally I am stuck with a bug where the Y-axis of my mouse is inverted by default and I tried everything I could to fix this but nothing worked, so I had to find a workaround by enabling the Invert Y-axis option in order to look around normally, but it inverted other stuffs such as viewing the map table or using the harpoon/cannon.

76,72479169,english,"I initially didn't want to review this game because of my immense bias and love of anything that has to do with pirates... but I think anybody that's willing to purchase this game already has a closeted pirate niche. 

This game is a grind. An open world, multiplayer, do-whatever-you-want grind. The missions are repetitive (outside of Tall Tales) and the payoff can be quite infuriating compared to the effort you put into it. But this is a game about the journey not the destination.

You and your crew raise an emissary flag for another day of plundering on the high seas, stopping at nearby islands to dig up their treasure. On paper, this is the same monotonous task over and over again. Read a map, solve a riddle, force your shovel into the sand, repeat. But there are many dangers on the sea that make the journey incredible. Reapers tracking your emissary flag on their map attempting to steal your haul for themselves and their vile order. Krakens and megalodons waiting in the depths for an unlucky band of wretches to pass into their waters. Ships crewed by the undead sailing quickly underwater and surfacing at your port side, broadsiding you relentlessly with metal and curses. All of these devastating hazards bring the life (and the pirate) out of your crew and win the day, especially making your measly 5 captains chests seem much more earned in the end. 

Of course there are the world events as well like Skeleton Keeps and Fleets, Flameheart's Fleet, and the Fort of the Damned. All of these can be conquered by you and your crew. However you may opt to be more of a bandit figure in the Reaper's name and wait for another poor crew to complete the event and sink them to take their earnings for yourselves!

The concepts in this game are fantastic, and the implication is just trailing behind that. There are a few issues regarding hit-reg due to the game being incredibly complex with how the engine makes the ships solid objects while crashing on waves, loot objects and your player models being able to stick to those surfaces, and general rules of motion. But the issues don't show their colors unless you truly look for them or play somewhere over 100 hours, when you're sure that ""that musket shot should have hit in that situation.""

4,72463109,english,"Sea of Thieves had a lack luster launch back in 2016. Reviews and many different voices explaining their experience with footage put me off of it for awhile.

Recently it was recommended to me by a friend and while reluctant I said I'd give this game a solid chance and it delivered with a simple yet enjoyable pirating experience. Lore through detective work and Tall Tales, large scale battles on skeleton forts, amazing ship to ship combat, great faction aesthetics, and a swanky soundtrack that syncs up with actions from the player that not many other games have tried save Doom 2016. Getting full wind in the sails only to hear the same calming track wisp over you with the crashing waves doesn't ever get old.

Combat while simple is surprisingly nuanced. From keg rushes to sword lunging off your ship to get closer to the enemy without the use of a cannon. To burning a banana in an enemy ships frying pan with kegs next to the stove, the food catching fire blows up the entire lower deck, and chaos ensues. I don't want to touch further on this because first time experiences are important.

Cosmetics are great and easily earned with a little reaping or looting. You can buy things with actual money but everything is surprisingly cheap. The only major cosmetic complaint about this game I actually have is surrounding the pirate creation menu. Finding a good looking pirate is a test of endurance and patience since there is no slider or any form of customization option in the facial and bodily features your pirate has. You have to roll the dice a lot on a pirate generator. It took me roughly two hours and three 'Pirate Appearance Potions' to find the right pirate for me.

There is a lot I have left out but mainly because like I said in my combat segment, ""-first time experiences are important."" My input while valuable is going to ruin other things you should learn while playing the game because learning is fun and mastering something is even greater.

I'd recommend this to people that like a relaxing exploration game and to those that crave that PVP rush after beating an opponent into the ground.

  The game looks good but has a cartoony feel to it  the rest is utter garbage. Every thing in the game  is cosmetic there are no better swords or guns just different skins, there are no lvl's for your guy, you don't get to buy new or better ships you have a choice of 3 ships small medium and large didn't know ships were like drink orders at a fast food joint. The game play itself is repetitive and you can't buy or store supplies for your ship; you have to gather them from barrels that are located all over the islands and oceans in the game. weird fact  did you know a person can only! Only! Carrie 2 bananas apparently humans can only carry 2 bananas or they explode lastly its constant pvp so watch out for other players who want your booty, It took about 2 hours of gameplay to figure out the game is worth about 5-10$ so if you see it  for that much get it otherwise steer well clear of this dumpster fire of a game don't be like me and get denied a refund  because you spent the first few hours trying to get the game to work.  on a final note this game Requiers you to log into microsoft xbox live service which means you have to make or have an xbox live account. What does this whole review mean the game sucks and steams return system/team needs to acutely review a refund request.

I give this game 5 Dumpster Fire’s out of 5 avoid like the plague

You can navigate a ship, manipulate sails, change the angles to catch the wind, fight skeletons and skeleton bosses, do special events that allow you to shoot cannonballs at enemy ships, dig up treasure on islands the old-fashioned way with a bright red X on a map, farm gold, farm reputation, PvP, fight megalodon sharks, fight the kraken, find as many treasure chests as possible, and even sink another player's ship to steal their loot. It's the most fun with a group of 4 (imo), but you CAN play solo.

It took me a while to get into this game because the streams always looked relatively boring, but when you start playing and start figuring out how everything works, you realize it keeps you busy and you ALWAYS need to be on the lookout for other players' ships and the swimmers that sneak onto your boat. It's rewarding to find a ton of loot, but it crushes your soul a little when all of it is stolen; with that being said, the fact that it can result in such a wide range of emotions means it's good enough to get you invested.

It is called Sea of THIEVES so yes, you will be attacked by players and your loot you've worked so hard to get will be stolen. But the honourable players will sink your ship so you do not have to suffer the torment, take the booty and leave. 

Then the grievers will postpone this and you will be subject to being killed over and over again to the extent you leave your PC waiting for you to respawn somewhere else. They will justify this by saying its called Sea of thieves, but this is a thin vail.

If that sounds fun to you, then you [i] arrrr [/i] going to enjoy Sea of Thieves!

Sea of Thieves is a game that puts you into a pirate's shoes (or rather, [i] peg legs[/i]). Which means, you get to do what pirates normally do! For example, getting killed by the Kraken,  searching for One Piece, dueling skeletons in a sword fight because apparently they have a [i] bone to pick [/i] with you! (They also eat bananas to regain HP, just like in real life), and FISHING! I guess..

My main point is, you have a lot to do in this game, such as the campaign a.k.a Tall Tales, sidequests, and you can do it at your own pace. Want to fish all day instead of sailing the seas? Sure, why not? Want to get pointlessly killed and robbed by other players? Sure, why not? Whatever [i] floats your boat. [/i]

At first, the game might be intimidating because of how overwhelming it is. Atleast to me. Trust me, initially i knew [i] jack [/i] shit about how the game works. Gave it some time and now i'm [i] hook[/i]ed. Heh, [i] sea [/i] what i did there? See what i did there again just now?

Graphic wise, the game looks beautiful. It's so vibrant and colorful, and i will never get tired of it. The most impressive part is the water graphic and animation. Seriously, it looks so good! If that Miiverse person who bought every game on Wii U and reviewed its water graphic still plays videogames until this day, then they'd be proud and crying [i] ocean [/i] of tears upon seeing Sea of Thieves.

So, [b] why should you buy Sea of Thieves? [/b] My answer would be ""immersion"". The game is very immersive and a blast to play with friends. I can't say anything for the solo players but i assure you, grab a friend or two and you'll see what i mean. You fight with the terror of the seas, explore, loot, duel with other pirates, and the game makes all that experience immersive and feel great. Not a lot of game can pull this off.  It's truly a [i] rare [/i] experience, heh. I'm sure i will [i] treasure [/i] all these moments because they're just [i] gold[/i].

If you're a solo player, please read other reviews and think twice before buying. But, if you're planning to play this with friends, then i strongly recommend Sea of Thieves. Do not miss out on this [i] gem[/i]. Heh.",1594138265,1594243888,True,176,69,0.915388286113739014,7,True,False,False,76561198148661644,733,56,1924,0,1185,1595960476

It has now   turned it into nothing more than screwing with other players as much as possible. Not only killing other players for no gain other than the sheer pleasure of it but disgusting mean-spirited taunts laced with foul language seems to be the norm. Not my idea of a great time.

Yeah, I get its PvP, but its pretty hard to enjoy the game (or even play it or do quests) when other players just hunt you down and kill you or simply camp out at the starting outpost and cut you down as soon as you enter the game. I'm not talking about attacking your ship, that is expected. But when a four man crew chases down a crew of two (or even one) after they have sunken their ship and taken all of their booty just to kill them, what is the point in that? Then rinse and repeat, over and over and over. It gets pretty old. The SoT community is rife with immature adolescents who make the entire point of the game to insult and harass new players.

How about some safe zones in and around the outposts so you can't be sunk while anchored at the harbor or cut down as soon as you enter the game? I was under the impression that the game was about sailing the high seas and completing quests and finding treasure and ship to ship battles. What it has turned into is 4 person crews simply screwing with smaller groups of players. This has nothing to do with sea battles and taking their booty (definitely expected) its just simply hunting down smaller groups so they never finish any quests or enjoy the game.

I probably have just scratched the surface of all of the cool things the Devs have put into this game. I have seen riddles for treasure maps, an island dungeon laden with traps, interesting and unique treasure chests, megladons, kraken, ghost ships just to name a few. Unfortunately, it has been next to impossible to actually experience any of this fully  because of what this game has become for a large number of players; an opportunity to bully others from the safety of their basements. 

I guess for some folks this kind of thing is fun. So if this is what you consider to be fun I say go for it. For me, however, I just want to enjoy the game and explore what it has to offer with family and friends. I was expecting a 'normal' PvP environment with a few safe areas (there are none) and encounters with other players resulting in someone losing their ship and treasure, not an environment where killing and ridiculing other players was the entire goal.

When I launched the game I was floored by the look, feel, and flavor of the game. The visual design is inspired. Truly, they nailed the Disney pirate aesthetic. The sound design is far better than it has any business being. The feel of piloting a functioning pirate ship as you tack into the wind and brave inclement weather is jaw dropping. The core game engine reaches levels of perfection I have never experienced but have always wanted to. There is however a flaw in this game; a flaw so enormous it beggars belief. 

Money is worthless.

Yes the very thing that motivates people to be pirates in the first place is completely worthless. Suddenly you realize every single thing that you could possibly do in the game will get you no further and make you no more powerful than a person just launching the game for the first time. In one heartbreaking moment you realize the entire game is set on a hamster wheel, destined to take you nowhere. 

The most painful part of this game is how near to perfection they came without seizing it. I remain hopeful that the developers will realize what this game is missing and add it in, but considering the size of the flaw its hard to believe the oversight was NOT an intentional decision. 

In conclusion, if you want to roleplay as a pirate with your friends and just do pirate things then this game might be for you... but if you want to play a game that goes beyond the surface experience and truly motivates you to continue playing I doubt you will find that here.",1594217105,1594217105,False,14,1,0.592776358127593994,9,True,False,False,76561198095649692,167,3,1982,0,949,1596236073

[b]Update 07/08/20[/b] I decided to repurchase and reinstall the game to seek revenge. I watched alot of tutorials, highlights and tips about the game. My first voyage was peaceful so I managed to learn the basics. 
Then one fine day, There is this ship marked as wanted on the map I don't know what it's called but you can change your flag to hostile to everyone so I went to their location and noticed they were treasure hunting at Kraken's fall island.  I hid my ship behind a rock and saw that no one was guarding their ship so I swam all the way to their ship, raised their anchor, threw their treasures one by one and then this dude spawned right in front of me. He said something, and yes it was a Chinese so I didn't hesitated and shot his face. I crashed their ship to a random rock and jumped out and spawn to my ship. I felt victorious.
[b]BUT[/b] they were so pissed. I checked the map and they were heading towards my ship. So I ran and ran and the chase took almost half an hour. I was gonna fight but I remembered I had this chest called uhh [b]Ashen Chest[/b] or something that you needed a key for it so I had no intention on giving that up. Then I remembered watching some youtube guides as a solo player, that you can use the storm as your ally. (They were using sloop as well) So I went inside the storm and I was so scared but I had to keep going. I can still see their sail rushing towards me. They managed to close the gap and I heard their open mic saying some random stuff and I was so afraid (They were 3 of them) then I saw this pile of medium sized rocks and decided to take that call and hoping for a miracle. As I stirred the ship left and right to dodge the rocks, I heard a crash and I thought I was done for because I can't repair while leaving the ship at the storm then I heard another crash but this time there was a rage voice .. As I looked back and boi for sure that put a smile on my face .. They were sinking and I can hear their voices arguing. I don't know if they raged quit but after a few minutes their hostile mark on my map vanished. That was one of my best experience in my gaming life.

98,72264302,english,"I think I'm kinda done with this game for now. For multiple reasons, i really don't want to return to this game unless it gets updated.

The first reason being what you work for, the vanity. 
Vanity is the only thing you can spend your money on. even the wiki says 'It has no skill based advantages, only cosmetics.'
So you might think 'damn, those vanity items must be epic is that's the only thing you can buy in this game!' Well, No. 

It just feels creatively bankrupt. Everything is bland, not to mention all around the same price. Some cost a little more than others, but those are usually a recolor of a cheaper vanity item. You don't work your way up to a wicked outfit/ship vanity, its all just the same price. So you play the game for 15 hours grinding to your favorite vanity set, and that's it. Why waste money on other items that you like less? You don't start bare feet, pay a little gold for rags, then some more gold for normal clothing, and then a lot of gold for the cool shit, no. Its all the same level of expenses. And yes, you are able to unlock some vanities with missions but they ain't that much different/better than the already unlocked stuff. Nothing is out of the box, nothing is eye catching, nothing is super cute, edgy, or silly. Which is a shame, because the art style would totally work with over the top items! You have 20 jackets and they are all the same concept, it's a jacked. Why can't I chance my skin color to purple? Why can't i have ghost legs and float? Why can't I dress up as a fucking unicorn or a banana. Let me kill the kraken 10 times and give me fucking tentacles on my face/back. I want my boat to be glowy or painted like one of those hippy buses with flowers on it from the 80's. Don't hide the good shit behind a pay wall ether, because this is literally the only reason I play the game. If you make me pay for it, I wont play your game! Give us something special to grind for, because that's what this game is. Just grinding money with fetch quests.

That's my second problem with this game, how stale the actual game play has been so far. For a game which is marketed like an epic pirate adventure it feels more like an empty-daily reset bundle of fetch quests. Get a voyage, sail to an island, dig up treasure, smack some skeletons, sail back, sell loot, repeat. There are some big events and tales, but if you do not finish them in one go, you lose all your progress when you log out or get killed by some dude that had nothing to lose. So when you get killed, you feel like you lost a lot while in reality you lost nothing but time and that's what makes it feel empty. Why would I start all over again after getting spawn camped instead of just leaving the game to go play something else? Now don't get me wrong, we did have a lot of fun with random encounters! The moment a fucking meg came while we had JUST killed a kraken AND a volcano started erupting in the background? That shit was fun. It was, until other players came and shot our ship down to take all of our loot..


And that's my final problem with the game, the players. 

Combat doesn't feel fair. People with nothing to lose/no loot on them engage on people that just mind their own business or have just killed a big enemy, and grieve the shit out of you. There are guns that insta kill you, so forget about an epic 1 v 1 pirate battle like in the movies. So while you were digging up treasure or recovering from a big encounter, they both manage to set your boat on fire and also sink it. All your shit is already gone and yet they still wont leave you alone. You are stuck on The ferry of the damned for half a minute each time they insta kill you, fully taken out of the game. And the second you are back they are waiting for you again to insta kill you. Its just never fair. You cannot fight back with loot in your arms. You cannot fight back when they spawn kill you. And even if you win, you don't actually win, because they had nothing on them to begin with. And they knew that, that's why they went for you. Its not fun like a skeleton ship, because you will never gain something from it. There is no honor in this game, which makes it hard for players that want to earn their money fair without ruining other peoples game. 

Pretty lame to talk about 'fair earned money' in a pirate game, but we are not real pirates. We are players, and the loot has to come from somewhere. Do we just expect the passive players that just want to play with friends to always be fucked over? And I get it, not ever game is made for every type of player, but the moment you market it all around defeating flame heart and ghost ships, the order of souls and phantom mines, then I expect you to make a game where I can actually do those things without being grieved by other players. 
So you may say 'you are playing the wrong game' but then make it the right game. Because it got advertised as a pirate adventure for me and my friends. Not some type of pvp lobby fuck fest. 
And its all there! The content they advertised. I just can't fucking reach it because I don't want to keep fighting other players every 5 minutes I turn my back on my boat. Its all just hidden behind a wall of assholes and that ruins the game. I'm stuck doing boring ass fetch quests because if there is barely anything you gain from it, it's not that bad to lose everything when you get fucked over by someone else. Why not allow local servers, for only me and my friends? Or some kind of item/flag that disables both damage to us and our damage/interaction to other players? You have AI. You have enemy ships and land enemies and a story/quest line. The other players are not crucial for the game play.

So how do you improve this game? Go wild with vanity. If i have to grind 10 hours for a new set, it best be extra. 
And two: make private servers. No more shitty ass players that set your boat on fire when you are gone digging, spawn kill you 4 times, making you stuck on the ferry of the damned for 2 minutes, only to call you noob and not leave you alone even after they took your shit.
Is this game good? Hard to say. We did have a lot of fun with it! We also rage quit like 5 times. It looks amazing! Art style is fantastic, and the water is beyond gorgeous. Vanity is disappointing, especially if that's all you're working for. I love controlling the boat, i truly feel like a pirate. One to One combat with AI is fun! One to one combat with players is a lot less fun because they one shot you, and you are taken out of battle for a full 30 seconds only to get insta shot again. Fucking around with friends is great, I love the music and dancing we can do. I'd give it a 4/10 for now, and if they added private servers and more vanity, a 7/10.",1594167932,1594167932,False,10,1,0.529953598976135254,0,True,False,False,76561198171593975,58,2,1904,0,1904,1594161350

16,72257921,english,"Had bought this game just two or three days ago. I dived right into the atmosphere of the game alongside a few of my pals. We headed straight on into the open-world, all four of us in a galleon without a clue on how the mechanics worked. Yet, we got moving, we saw a Brig up ahead and chased it, a sprawl of cannon balls showered the sky and the fight began. It was very enjoyable and a great experience just for only playing the game for about 2 hours.

Pro(s)

- Endless opportunities and voyages to be done
- Surprises at every corner, whether it be a ship, storm or AI.
- Customisation is vast, allowing you to edit your character, ships and weapons alongside tools such as; lanterns, musical instruments. 
- Making in-game money is fun and every voyage has different outcomes, some may be more dangerous and fierce whilst some may be digging up sand, regardless, it is a huge variety and all outcomes are fun to make gold.

Now, the cons, as for someone who has only played the game for fifteen hours, this may be more of a personal outlet. 

Con(s)

- Game is very much playable solo, however - you rarely encounter solos and you'll experience a lot of difficulty as a solo, especially if you are just starting out - however, some may enjoy playing solo and the thrill of it.
- Shooting aspect of the game feels too simple and tedious, guns are only loaded with 5 bullets and combat with AI feels like shooting plushies. When it comes to PvP, it is more of a 50/50 chance and how well someone elses' movement is. 
- Lack of enemy bosses / ships, you have a megladon, kraken and those ghostships with the regular AI.
- The price is terrible 

Overall however, if you don't mind the price, the game is worth it with friends as you can find yourself either laughing, scouring or worrying. The game provides different scenarios every minute with something new happening.

The visuals of this game are stunning, likely some of the best i have ever seen, and the ship and all it's aspects and little details you can tamper and interact with is a joy to experience. Coupled that with all the other things such as the effects, animations, soundtrack, level design and artstyle, but also the dedication and love you can see in being poured into the missions, lore and quirks of the game makes Sea of thieves very charming with visuals far ahead of many other games

However, Sea of theives suffers from an incredible dose of repetitiveness. 
Islands and biomes are most of the time samey, the enemy variety is very lacking, animals too, missions are repetitive and usualy burns down to simply just delivering items. This is more subjective but i personaly found the player encounters and interactions to be... not very engaging, infact i find it to be far more frustrating and tedious. Going off by my own experience, player encounters are either neutral or negative, and there are only two kinds of people in this game: The ones that want to be left alone, and the ones that want to kill you, it's a bit of a 50/50 situation, and the latter is always a frustration to deal with as the offensive ship will usualy always have the upper hand against the one they're targeting, it either ends quickly or drags out for an eternity. Generaly just extremely discouraging and disatisfying to play against. The combat is also slow and clunky, takes a million years to reload your gun, and swinging your sword is a slow process too.

However the worst aspect about the game is probably just the lack of progress. You'll level up and gain better missions, but all your rewards go towards cosmetics. This game has no other thing you can spend your money at, no upgrading system, no different items, ships, weapons, etc, and meanwhile i do appreciate the lack of an upgrade system as it puts everyone at equal measures, it still leaves me with no desire to keep playing once i had bought all the cosmetics i wanted.

TLDR: Charming, visualy stunning game, with a supreme dose of repetitiveness and an almost completel lack of noteworthy progress. An OK game, get it on sale.",1594155585,1594155585,False,2,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561198082073893,250,56,2076,0,2076,1591891269

If you are going to play alone, you will definitely get bullied by the other players from other ships; you will encounter those events like Megalodon, Kraken and Ghost ships with mysteriously high possibility; you will be busy of sailing, repairing your ship, firing cannons, supplying, etc. Others with friend will just bully you are a lonely guy.
Moreover, sometimes you will get lucky with some nice guys who try to be friendly with you, but the friend system of Xbox works oddly, once you follow their accounts and try to play with them next time, you will figure that they always are offline.

However, the game isn't perfect. This game is NOT solo or small group friendly. At the bare minimum I would play with 2 other people. If you are playing by yourself or with 1 other person you are going to get obliterated by a Galleon with 4 people.

A quick summary for those who hate reading: 

Should you buy Sea of Thieves? Based off of what most gamers look for in video games then...
If you enjoy adventure, PvE and/ or PvP then YES. 
If you enjoy game lore then YES. 
If you like constant action then NO. 

It is worth full price.

Here is more detail:
Pros: 
[*] Beautiful graphics. The prettiest skies and the most amazing water details in any video game.
[*] Multiplayer is fun! This game is perfect for playing with your friends, you can all venture to find treasure, do PvE and/or PvP. Everyone on board has a role and can help manage the ship and fight together.
[*] Single player is fun! You don't need friends to have a great time. Playing solo allows you to be sneaky and sneak onto enemy ships, or get things done your own way.
[*] Satisfaction of progression. Almost every aspect of the game leads to progression of some sort. The achievements are fun, challenging and relevant.
[*] Lore/ Story line. Although not a huge fan of lore myself, this game packs so much detail into the reasoning behind why things in the Sea of Thieves actually happen. For those who love games with a story, this is one for you.
[*] Community. From my experience, the community is extremely friendly and helpful, and not all in-game encounters lead to PvP.
[*] Updates. The game is always receiving updates, and they are FREE. Enjoy free content.

Cons: 
[*] Slow progression. Some of the trading companies take a long time to level up and can become frustrating. In particular the merchant alliance was so boring for me, it is the most tedious company by a long shot.
[*] Solo PvE. This is doable don't get me wrong, but you'll have more fun fishing. PvE as a solo is far too time consuming and can become frustrating. (The skeletons are the most accurate shooter AI that I have ever seen)
[*] Minor bugs. At this stage in the game there are super annoying audio bugs, however they aren't game breaking, they are infrequent and they usually fix themselves eventually. Sometimes for myself, treasure maps have failed to work but this has only happened twice.

I just completed about a 500 minute gaming session in this game. Yes absurd, but what better is there to do during quarantine? I found a couple of people that allowed me to join into their crew and let me play with them, pretty nice group of guys I would say, had a good laugh or too, but they new what they were doing, unlike myself, only at the time having about 8 hours in the game. We played did some PvP, and eventually ended up beating the skull in the sky thing with all the different colors and shit. Obviously i'm new so idfk what i'm talking about, all I know is you light your lantern and kill skeletons. In the end we ended up making 200k gold, but also at the end I realized that for the first time in a game I felt truly happy. It felt like the old Minecraft days where you would finish a build after hours, and feel so accomplished. And the music, the music just brought it off to the top, when that old sailor music started to play and it, I don't know how to explain it, it was just so beautiful, and amazing. That gaming session took me hours, and in the end I profited so much, and it made me just feel happy, like that sensation I got when completing a build in Minecraft, or just  being able to happily log off after a day of survival in Minecraft. This game overall brought me to believe that there is still hope and happiness to be found in games other than boring, repetitive non stop grinding, a stupid ass story, or solely competitive environments. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who is looking for a great game to play, and not having to pay that new game expense of $60. 10/10 good job devs.",1594101485,1594101485,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198819758958,28,2,3253,0,753,1598402265

98,72207226,english,"PVE content is fun enough however game still feels under polished. All the quests amount to fetch quests with some light puzzles occasionally thrown in. PvE combat feels like a hack n slash with no depth other than run away from the exploding units due to them being a suicidal nuke. There is no progression system other than reputation grinding with factions that just allow more cosmetics and ""harder"" (longer) quest for do. It is nice that everyone has roughly the same baseline they work with but longer play just leads to collection of reasources that are lost on death and ultimately unneeded as you are basically supplied with what you need on each respawn anyway.

The online community is the worst I have ever been apart of. The new player experience is just avoiding every other player as no matter what you have or say they will attack and steal all of your booty. There are no safe zones, and there are often more of them than you can handle. The game is also extremely grindy with every quest boiling down to carry what's worth gold slowly back to your ship, race back to a port and pray you can unload it faster than any other players can you see you do it. Otherwise they will come gank you and steal all your gold turn in and set you back to where you started. 

PvP does not feel rewarding as anyone that you will be matched against will feel like a borderline hacker due to the immense skill gaps. The experience is not fun in the slightest, so good luck with playing enough to get good.

Huge improvements I feel could be made would be advanced and beginner servers/lobbies to help remove the frustration from being ganked constantly by players with a much greater mastery and understanding of the game. Or just a small implementation of not 100% safe zones, but guards that will help quell aggressors in more relatively ""safe"" zones.

My play style typically emphasizes PvE which would lose almost all tension/suspense without the possible presence of PvPers wanting to ruin my day. Caution and vigilance go a long way to staying safe as a PvE player on the SoT.

There is a steep learning curve which requires seeking the help of other sailors/pirates or countless online videos. Do not trust that the Maiden Voyage has prepared you in anyway for what is to come.

The Sailing and wave modelling is pretty good, though there remains a maddening bug that encourages you to square your sails to the wind when heading directly into it. 

This is meant to be a social game and strongly suggest playing the game with a microphone and a crew. If you do not have friends who play, join open crews to slowly gather a set of like-minded friends, though expect to have highly variable experiences when open crewing.

This is a giant sandbox that repeatedly provides you with grist for your story-mill. To a certain extent, the game is what YOU (and often others) make of it. There is, thankfully, no one way to play. You can, ""Be more pirate!"" You can be a top-notch chicken merchant, You can engage is Goonies-esque multi-tiered quests. You can let your inner Sea Dog out by playing ship battles in the arena.

7,72140991,english,"First day playing, I saw a boat on my map, sailed over to it alone in my little sloop. Big galleon parked next to an island. I had yet to engage in any pvp. Brought my sails to half mast, locked the wheel all the way to the left, and opened fire. As my boat lazily went in a circle off the shore, I was running back and forth between my cannons taking pot shots at the galleon. Since it was parked, it didn't take long for it to sink.  

I thought it was an npc boat or something because it had showed up on my map. But then I immediately saw tiny little people jumping up and down angrily on the shore. Proceeded to trade rifle shots, and killed all but one of them, who was stubbornly guarding a rowboat and kept trying to swim out and board me. Got fed up trying to snipe him, and just went back to cannons, which ended things quickly, as he disappeared in a satisfying plume of water, sand, and debris. 

Things were calm. I nervously scanned the horizon for any sign of incoming ships, and then swam over to the rowboat. It was stacked with more treasure than I have ever seen since then. At the time, I didn't realize I could attach the rowboat to my ship, so I would grab one treasure, swim over to my ship, drop it off and repeat. But I was also constantly on the lookout because I knew they would be coming back with a vengeance. 

And sure enough, after a few minutes, I could see their ominous silhouette on the horizon, coming straight at me. I dropped what I was doing and swam back to my ship. Even with a slight head start, they were gaining on me, because they had a larger ship and knew what they were doing when it came to sailing. Every time I looked back, they were closer and closer, until I could see each of them individually. I realized the only way I was going to make it out of this was if I tried to outmaneuver them, since I had the smaller vessel that was supposedly good for that. 

I tried weaving around rocks, changing directions on them, and at one point even got attacked by a megalodon, but they would not give up, chasing me what felt like across the whole map. On several occasions they got within firing range and put a bunch of holes in my ship. I had to hastily figure out to patch the holes and bail the water, while leaving the navigating unattended. 

Finally decided to try a handbrake turn, which I had seen in a video prior to playing so that I knew how to sail. I knew it would put me briefly in direct line of their cannons, but if I pulled it off, it would take too long for them to turn around, and I was hoping that distance would allow me to get clear of them. I swung the wheel all the way and dropped my anchor, turned sharply, nearly got blown off my ship by several cannonballs, but then managed to pull up the anchor in time and sailed clean past them. 

10/10 most exhilarating experience I've had in a game in a long time

8,72139671,english,"Despite the best possible initial experience with the game, as a longtime gamer it still left me jaded about the state of Microsoft's first party $60 game.

Combat

Let's start with the PvE combat. In 8 hours we fought some skeletons. The same skeletons over and over, with the lone variation a ""boss skeleton"" that was identical, just with more HP. Let's just say that the PvE enemies and combat mechanics are utterly rudimentary, hardly befitting a first tier gaming experience.

Graphics/Environment

The game looks good, but mostly due to the well done lighting and water models. The stormclouds and rain were nice. The rest is average cell shaded ""bleh"" and at times shockingly subpar for a 2018 game developed by one of the richest companies in the world. The art style and environmental objects look almost identical to Torchlight, a 10 year old game that runs great on my 10 year old laptop. The islands are tiny and have minimal variation.

Gameplay Loop

It's a FedEx game, but not for better gear to kill bigger and badder enemies. You only get cosmetic upgrades and they are ridiculously expensive. A chicken fetch quest yields 500 gold. A decent hat costs tens of thousands of gold. I kept expecting a different mechanic to arise, new enemies, but sadly the only variation was ""go kill this skeleton boss"" or ""go dig up a treasure chest which we have marked precisely on your map."" Appalling.

The Sailing

Probably the best part of the game, as you can't open a map while sailing so a crewmate needs to guide you from belowdeck via voicechat. Some will find this infuriating, but making basic navigation a challenge keeps the sailing authentic. If you hit something, you have to bail water and patch holes but this gets boring pretty quickly, so you'll want to avoid crashes. You can change the angle of the sails for higher efficiency, and you need a good crew to sail properly. Many will find this utterly boring, but it is simply not a high paced game. It defines ""chill game."" Well done Rare, I say - at least they did one thing right.

Sandbox Play and PvP

I played for 8 hours with a couple longtime Xbox Live friends. We were ready for anything. We found nothing but barren seas - good thing we had grog. We love sandbox games, but there was so little in the sandbox our creativity was limited. We found an extra cage and kept a pet chicken named Eddy in it. The most exciting thing to happen in the first 5 hours was Eddy falling off the bow and me diving in after him. Finally, after 6-7 hours of super basic, simple fetch quests and exploring caves only to find nothing, we see another vessel. Immediately we decide to attack, if just to break the monotony. We hunt down the smaller caravan and begin firing, and a cat and mouse battle ensues which at times felt like a true historical naval battle, with the smaller ship outmanuevering us and the tension rising and falling with each volley of canonballs. This went on for over 30minutes, mostly due to inexperience and the difficulty of getting enough consecutive Canon strikes to sink the enemy before they could bail and patch the ship to full health. At one point, our ships touched, and I jumped down onto the decks of the smaller ship, only to be greeted by a cutlass and promptly killed. A cool moment, to be sure.

Amazing Moment / SPOILER ALERT

Finally, something actually amazing happened. During the height of this tense naval battle, off the starboard side I see a giant tentacle rise up. ""IT'S THE KRAKEN!!!"" Our ship was seized and while my crewmates fought valiantly, they were picked up and tossed into the sea like breadcrumbs. Our ship was pulled under, and we all died. The end.

CONCLUSION

Despite the epic final 45 minutes or so, I had a hard time believing that Microsoft could A) release the game with so little content and B) charge $60 for it. The game feels like it is still in beta. It feels like a tiny, inexperienced dev team made it and then added some high priced water and lighting models and a kraken. The world is small and repetitive, the quests are worse than even a budget MMO would offer, and the PvE combat is insultingly bad with only a single enemy type and extremely crude mechanics. After experiencing the very best moments the game has to offer on my first play session, I can't see any reason to go back. That's a BIG problem.

How can this be acceptable for a $60 game from a major publisher? Sadly, the answer is that people will buy it anyway, because it will be very well marketed. I expect the game to get bad reviews, but still sell very well, because that is the world we live in now. It is a sad state of affairs, and Microsoft should be ashamed to be taking part in such shenanigans. Bait & Switch is really scummy, but it is also really really profitable.",1594010925,1594010925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198819082223,6,1,7277,223,5861,1600891497

I haven't seen a full game of players and it just isn't that fun.  However, the adventure mode allows you to pvm while at the same time in a world of pvp anywhere.  If you don't like pvp I still wouldn't let that deter you because it is pretty easy to avoid conflict.  I would recommend having a friend cause playing solo can be difficult.

Otherwise if you can force some friends to tag along for those hours the mechanics are sound and there's enough to do I suppose.
If your connection is not the strongest, stay away from this game as well, you will rubber band everywhere including clipping straight through your ship. Doubly important as there are sections you'll want to have fairly good jump accuracy with, but instead of landing on the ledge, you'll end up at the bottom of the sea.

When, not if, you do get griefed by this toxic community, abandon your tall tale or sail away until the item despawns or something, when you restart it the checkpoint should return your item to your ship.

Also extremely buggy, especially the Steam version judging from other posts in the forums as well. Your character will glitch out, if not your ship, respawns will randomly throw you across the world so you have to swim out to a mermaid to get back to your not-sunken ship. You will pull out your musical instrument instead of your weapon when trying to fight, etc.
Oh and the servers are wildly unstable, merges that will cause all sorts of problems with loot, or sometimes merge you into another player. enemies will spawn on you nonstop so you cannot do missions until you clear all of them away, again these are problems others are also seeing on the forums, but the devs don't leave any feedback regarding so not sure if it's intentional or not even.

The mechanisms are overall pretty good. Manning the sails, exploration, navigation, ship maintenance, and the sort of mini-quests that spawn on your way to treasure make for a very appealing experience. Environments are beautifully designed and feel vibrant and alive. Combat is bland and overly simplistic, but they can't all be winners.

However, the entire gameplay experience comes apart at the seams when PvP gets involved. There are zero restrictions on PvP, meaning that an hour long journey of hunting treasures and fighting various NPC threats can be capped off by an onslaught of other players jumping down your throat to steal all your hard-earned loot. 

The way the game's PvP is designed basically means that if you're interested in doing something that isn't 'killing another player to take their stuff', you are the product being sold, not the customer it's being sold to.

The game does have a solid goal of reaching level fifty in three factions to unlock a new faction to do quests for.  

It also does not have anything great in the way of story. Aside from the odd tall tale here and there. 

For those just seeking a very simple fantasy pirate simulator it will do that just fine. For those seeking to just hop in and not think about upgrading anything and just have fun, it'll do that just fine.

Pirates. Lots of them too. No doubt hired by my mentally impaired cousin. We outnumbered them 20 to 1, and had surperior tactical knowledge. We were going to win. We engaged them through ship to ship combat, some boarded us so we drew our willies and engaged in schlong duels. We were crushing them. What could my mentally impaired cousin be planning?
Then I saw it...
They had horse urine at their disposal. My one weakness, my cryptonite. How did I not see this coming?
We were being torn apart, and they took my meth. 
I was in a dark place, and thinking of ending it all. But then, like a holy beam of succulent testies Sea Of Thieves was released onto the steam store. It completely changed my life.

63,72043819,english,"I played this game while I was suffering from COVID-19. Had a hard time breathing, and honestly thought I was on the verge of death so I thought 'why don't I give this game a shot?'  I threw my 50 bucks in and realized I had a hard time focusing while playing the game. I felt like just sitting there, staring at the water.

Honestly, now that I'm feeling better, this was a great purchase. By default, PvP is on in the game and it's unclear if Rare wants to disable it. The game itself is simple but it's still a story generator. The game is pretty much 'bring x to y' or 'loot an island and bring it back here'. The entire game revolves around fetch quests. However, the game is designed in such a way that you will encounter random events that make the voyage interesting. 

I remember travelling the waters and being randomly attacked by a Kraken. While fighting the Kraken, we had a bunch of PvPers attack our ship. While they tried to stay away from the Kraken, it attacked them anyways. It was now two ships fighting each other while also fighting the Kraken. Not only did we drive them back; we sunk their ship, killed the Kraken, took their chests and killed every last one of them. It felt like we were in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

You will match with other players unless you set your ship to 'private' (although I HIGHLY recommend keeping the default 'open' setting). If you're a solo player and don't like interacting with random people in games, this game is not for you. You will have a hard time doing anything as you'll run into other players, random encounters and just bad luck in general. If you're a more sociable person, you can also invite your friends to your ship and head out into the big blue.

I'm a huge fan of Atlas and honestly enjoy that game a tremendous amount. However, I found that game to be time consuming to set up a proper voyage as it could take 5 hours of real life time to just load all the materials you need onto your ship. In this game, all the materials are already on your ship, you just raise anchor and set sail.

This game is suited for children and people with busy work schedules alike. It gets into the nitty-gritty without the horrors of pirate life that Atlas portrays (no, you can't own islands and hang people).

What's the point of the game, then? It's to build a reputation with the different companies in the game. What's the point of THAT? Beats me. There is no point. It's a bit of a grind and the joy of the game is not in the grind itself, but the journey to becoming a pirate legend. When the game first came out, there was nothing to do other than sail from island to island and find treasure chests. PvP encounters weren't really a thing as you couldn't really damage other players' ships. The lack of excitement is what killed the game for many fans until they came out with their more recent updates. The game is DEFINITELY worth getting now compared to how it was when it first released.

The game gets an 8/10 from me. It would get a 10/10 if there were more things to do (such as a proper storyline with cutscenes), had Windows 7 compatibility, and generally favoured solo players. The game does have a storyline, but it's more accompanied with procedurally generated quests that honestly feel a bit shallow. It's understandable though, given the massive size of the map.",1593892897,1593892897,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False,76561198010371788,540,148,2418,0,97,1600703532

+ it looks amazing, I love this sharp and vibrant style
+ music and sound design is great, enjoyed that part
+ some parts of (some) Tall Tales are quite fun and creative
+ interesting inventory design choice, you are a pirates after all, not a trading company

- it feels like there's no real character progression, only cosmetic changes [i](very average, basically recolors)[/i]
- you are as powerful and as effective during your first hour as you are during your 500th hours played
- there's nothing to unlock that actively changes the way you play the game, everything you see at the beginning is everything that there is in the game
- no abilities, no skills, no unique items or gadgets, only recolored cosmetics
- no way to change ship type mid-game, you have to leave the session
- awful combat system, with what appears to be only 3 different moves (light attacks, charged attack and block)
- PvP is kinda cool, and I like that it exists, but I never enjoyed it because of the respawn system
- if you leave the session, you have to log in again and watch (or skip) the cutscene, every single time
- minor stuff like connectivity issues with XBOX Live, bugged quests where the enemy spawns inside the wall or ground, etc

It just feels like a chore to play, knowing that everything you do amounts to sailing from one empty, samey looking island to another. To turn in a quest and see some numbers go up. Characters have no personality or flair, everyone looks the same but with different colors. The game just has this aura of meaningless monotony and sadness.

98,72009045,english,"If you are looking to become an adventurer on the seas, this is the game for you. Absolutely awesome game full of trolls, mic-spammers, snakes, roleplayers and bananas. It basically has something for everyone.

The aesthetics of the game, the sea, the stars and the generally goofy look makes the game beautiful, mysterious and intriguing. I've spent most of my time within this game just in awe of how beautiful it actually is.

The gameplay aspects of the game include pvp, pve, pvm, puzzle solving, bossing, lenghty story quests etc. The pvp aspects of the game creates this dynamic of hunter/hunted where you always feel nervous of pvp encounters. Altough most people seem to be aggressive, the few that arent are super fun to come across. I've had some nice rp moments that I can look happily back at. Pve/pvm in this game is basically any random boss encounter (Kraken, Megalodon or Skeleton ships) and the voyages you take on. 

The game also has these lengthy story based quests/voyages that are called ''Tall tales'' and these will keep you occupied for hours and hours trying to solve the mysteries behind them and finding the treasures for that gold metal that is so shiny. For this you basically need a crew that you enjoy playing with, otherwise it's more of a hassle than a fun adventurous experience.

Performance wise, this game is so well optimized my old computer from 2012 handles it very well on medium quality. How they managed to creature such a lively sea is beyond my knowledge but it's one of the key features that had me hooked.


Looking forward to play more, sail the seas, explore and find hidden treasures.

19,71995568,english,"This was a game that I pretty high hopes for when it was first announced at E3, and to me personally, I was let down at first. Not because the game was bad, I had no idea how the game was, but because I wasn't able to play it, nor want to, due to it being on the Microsoft Store.

Now that being said, it's now on Steam and I've owned it for about a month now and I gotta say.. it's everything I could have hoped for. For me I was itching a pirate game that both intense and lighthearted all at the same time, and this game checks those boxes for me perfectly. While for some the gameplay leaves more to be desired in I, I find myself great bliss in being immersed within the world and grand atmosphere it puts you in, and I never want to leave.

This game is wonderful and to me there's only one minor issue, the multiplayer factor. It is not because of the fact that it exists, that would be senile of me to even state, it's because of the fact that is still uses Microsoft's servers to run everything including the invitation system for lobbies prior to getting your ship. Now I don't mind having to deal with the extra step, that's not the worst thing I've had to deal with in order to get the job done. The thing that I hate is the fact that I deal with Xbox players. Now don't get it twisted, I have obviously found great people both knowledgeable and humble, even added a couple people because of it. The issue is the people who toxically will repeatedly spawn camp and sink your ship, taking your booty in the process.

While I have mentioned the main good and bad, one thing that I like about this game that likely has turned off quite a few people is likely the fact that absolutely everything you get in this game is sheerly cosmetic and does absolutely nothing functionally to make you stronger in the game. To some people this is the weakest point in the game, due to what can feel as a complete lack of progression. To me I believe that this is one of the games strongest, as it implies the player(s) get good(better) at the game in order to surmount their obstacles. This can be seen in every aspect of the game, and to me adds even more to the piracy-feel of it all, do you really expect a pirate to invest in anything significant like a new cutlass or gun anyway?

Overall, the game's atmosphere is extremely strong, and I love everything about it save for the fact that I'm huddled in with Xbox players and haven't seen a single PC, let alone Steam player, solid [9.5/10]",1593837824,1593837824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198054670222,292,6,4351,0,2385,1596255611

There is not much progression beyond the cosmetics, which wears off pretty quick.

What really did it in for me, was locking what I think is the coolest cosmetic, pets, behind a premium currency paywall. This currency can be obtained in small amounts by finding a rare ancient skeleton that will bury itself after 10 seconds.

Replay Value ★★

A great pirate theme PvPvE game out there rn. The game has been released for several years but it still get regular content updates. Players can explore the sea and islands with their ship, encountering different types of AI monsters, skeletons, and of course other players. For players who enjoy combat, there are tons of chances to do ship battles, gun shooting, etc... And for casual players, just drive around, exploring, fishing and you can call it a day.

Yeah... no. If you played any PvP Survival Game, you played all of them and SoT is no difference, except that there is no Point in Playing this Game except for getting Gold to be able to buy Skins, thats it. No Survival, no Building, No Leveling, no Progression. While this is good for an PvP Game since everyone is granted the same chances SoT itself is just the wrong Game to implement such a Mechanic, as a Pirate i expect Progression and want to show it off to others.. but Skins arent very Satisfying.. no matter how long you Play, the Characters will always look like Hobos, and the Ships are all preset, except the Skins which all look.. meh.. 
95% of People i met so far are Hostile.
The Community is Toxic against new Ideas.
The Game offers not much Content. Its just drive from A to B, Grab some crates/find a Chest/Fight a Skeleton/kill a Player, get back to A, get Gold.. orr get fucked by other Players / Random annoying event like an Giant Seamonster which is just annoying to fight against. 

The Only good thing i can tell about this Game are the Graphics, the Game is gorgeous and has an very good Art style.
But Gameplaywise its just very shill, and the Price is WAAAAAAY too high for this Game. I had more Fun with Atlas, both in PvP and PvE.. and Atlas is a buggy mess. Oh.. right..

Before you buy:
If you’re a solo warrior type of player you’re going to have a semi fun time getting started. I definitely recommend playing the game with friends or joining a discord community as co-op is one of the most crucial elements to success in the game. Playing open crew with random people is possible but not recommended as most are either half your age, afk farmers or utilize a potato as sound input option. Both PvE and PvP will be challenging without proper communication.

Quick Facts:
-The game is quite grind heavy so be prepared to sink some hours into it. 

-Amazing visuals and physics engine

-Frequent and free dlcs/updates

-Developers that actually listen to the community

-Microtransactions only for cosmetics

-A few bugs here and there but most will be hotfixed or addressed in subsequent patches

-Decent learning curve with many tips and tricks 

-Many helpful people but also quite a few toxic players that are twice as fun to clap up

-Open world sandbox with countless things to explore

-Tall tales with more deep lore than dark souls

Hunting for Treasure, fighting the npc's both in events and out of them.

79,70384886,english,"I wish there was a neutral review for games because that is what I would rate this in its current state.  


***Pros***

Graphics:
The game is beautiful.  In fact, it is the best-looking water, sun and sky I have seen in a game.   The colors are vibrant and pleasing on the eye.   

Sailing:
Sailing is meditative for me.  It almost feels real and listening to the ocean is relaxing.

PvE Quest: 
They are enjoyable.  I really like finding a riddle in bottle and trying to solve it. Tall Tales are great (if you are able to complete them without people killing you).  Digging up treasure and finding other items is also really fun.


***Cons***

Forced PvP:
I understand what they were trying to go for, but humans suck and they go out of their way to ruin your gameplay.  They either need to add PvE servers, private servers or allow you to host a game and have your friends connect.  People say doing this will ruin the game, but they are wrong.  Ark and 7 days to die do it and those games are doing just fine.

Being killed in port:
There are pirate rules written on the wall when you first spawn in the pub that say all matters will be settled at sea.  Well guess what, people aren't following those rules.  If they don’t want to make PvE or private servers, then make ports and islands neutral where you can’t attack people or steal loot.  However, once you get out into open sea it can become far game then.  That would be a test of skill for all these die hard PvPers then.

Toxic community:
Being killed is one thing, but being harassed while it happens is another.  Kids and even one time a kid and his Dad were yelling and saying horrible things while killing my wife and I.  This is another reason for private servers, PvE servers or local host game play.  

Community in General:
I absolutely LOVE everything about this game except the community.  We can’t play without people attacking non-stop and then you lose an hour or two of work and gain nothing. You are always out numbered and no one, and I mean NO ONE will help you.  Everyone just shoots at first sight.  There is zero cooperation in this game.  PvP would be fine if it was a fair fight (1v1 or 2v2), but it never is.  You are ALWAYS outnumbered and those people think they are good at the game because four of them killed a solo sloop.

Needs more PvE:
Needs more enemy types and more variety of quest.  The ones they have now are fun, but they just need to add more to spice it up a bit.


My wife and I still want to play this game, but if we continue to be killed and harassed, we are just going to have to quit.  We just want to play a relaxing pirate game where we can hunt treasure and do quest.  I really hope they add PvE because you are isolating a HUGE demographic of people that would pay to play your game.  

Be smart Rare and add PvE servers.  You will make more money this way.   Other games do it and they are successful.  

This game would be a 10/10 in my opinion, but right now it’s a 4/10 with the forced PvP.  Way to stressful for people who just want to relax and treasure hunt after a long hard day of work.

_______________________________________________________

Update:
Screw this game, screw the toxic community and screw Rare.  Do NOT buy this game and support this type of behavior.  Wife and I are uninstalling.  

Rare goes and creates private servers, but no gold or rep farming?  Why?  It DOESN’T impact ANYONE by playing solo or PvE.  Everything is cosmetic so who cares!!!  I could spend hundreds of hours just sailing around and treasure hunting by myself.  That is fun to me despite people telling me it would be boring.  They don’t get to decide what I think is fun or not.  

This game definitely needs some PVE servers.  Rare if you implement this I will return and even pay money in your in-game shop because I do like some of the ship cosmetics.  But until then, screw you and your toxic game.   

You don’t understand people at all.  Give them PvP only and it will bring out the worst in people.  You don’t even listen to the LARGE community asking for PvE.  Terrible company.

Outpost camping and ambushing is real and there is no way to avoid it regardless of whether or not you've taken steps to ensure nobody is near before you dock. Until a form of safezones or private servers are implemented, this is not subject to change. 

It's a fun game, but after an hour or two grind each day just to have it all lost to a crew of 4 sailing by per chance, is immersion breaking and undoes everything you've done or tried to achieve in your session of playthrough.

36,71856743,english,"I went to try out the game for myself after seeing the positive reviews on the game and in hopes of seeing improvements of what to do. so, i went out and joined the game with a couple of friends....

...and it was alright, until i hit a brick wall of reality that the core game play is essentially the same it has been since it's first launch. same doo doo different update. sure, new places to dig up a chest, but still that's it. you do a couple quests and then you are already burnt out by the third time you did it, so then you get drunk and then fire yourself or an animal aide out of a cannon. every once in a while, you have to fix the ship cause no matter how many times you try you can't get the ship properly on port, or one man on a mission walks up to your ship and asks"" Are you friendly?"" as he is firing his blunderbuss at you.

Here is the biggest complaint i have about the game.
it is too. bloody. dark.
I can barely see a single thing when im in my ship with 6 lanterns on all over the place.  it could be to reinforce the use of a lantern, whereas it would be just a useless trinket of piracy if this wasn't an issue, but my god is it so obnoxious that there is no option to raise the brightness. other games like GTFO have this same issue, but that game at least had it like that for a reason.  i went on local forums about the issue and it's a pretty mixed bag about any answers that should come up. most of the time, it's just some jolly joker who is like ""Just use the lantern bro it's there for a reason"". If i can't even be able to see in what appears to be a well-lit room in 1700 standards, there's an obvious issue going on. 

the next issue i have is the fact that you can't just invite friends over via steam, nonono, you have to go hit that win+G and then friend them on their microsoft account if not already then you are able to invite them. oh, and also let's just add another stupid overlay on top of your steam overlay and geforce overlay if you have that. 

the nail in the coffin for my interest for this game is the fact that if the game is stripped of tedious point a-b at 4 knots an hour across half the Atlantic game play, there is pretty much nothing going on for the game. sure you can fight other people, but that's not interesting. if you go against a smaller ship, it's like drop kicking a baby. if you are the smaller ship, enjoy losing everything even if you had nothing to begin with. ""but wait, at level 50 there's more quests!"" I will staple my balls together and have a smile on my face when offered the decision between that and get to that point of the game. why bother arguing that when for the previous 49 levels, it was rinse and repeat? i got an achievement for vomiting and that was the most exciting part of my venture through the sea. of thieves.

overall, a dissapointment even with positive reviews.

if you see this mike, it was nice to play, but it's a shame i can't refund it.

63,71845107,english,"My impression after playing around 10 hours:

Negative side:
- confusing mechanic and lack of tutorial...
- Islands is very small, and consist only around 10% of full size map which majority is the water
- The ship is not upgradable. Can only be customizable with cosmetic.

Between positive and negative:
. Playing alone is quite overwhelming, but possible
. More fun if you play with a friends
. Limited crew in one ship (Sloop with max 2 crews, Brigantine with max 4 crews, Galleon with max 6 crews)
. Asia server quite calm. 
. frustrating puzzle

Positive side:
+ Huge map
+ Many islands
+ Story is very fun to play
+ The water effect and physic is very cool
+ Dynamic weather system
+ Official discord server is friendly toward people new to the game. There is even a section for a new player who want to sail together.
+ Even though the puzzle is frustrating, it's quite fun when you actually solve it...
+ This game based of skill, not gear, so everyone in the game has a same chance of winning.

All in all, however, it's a game with tension and laughs and style, and it can feel very satisfying to pull into port with a fortune or equip some unique item from a tall tale or a commendation.

96,71663665,english,"Probably the most balanced game in the history of video games since all the unlockables are simply cosmetics and titles that you can wear and use to show off your accomplishments. Personally for me this is the most chill game I have ever laid my hands upon. This game is all about creating your own adventures like solving riddles and navigating treasure maps to dig up treasures, killing skeleton captains for their skulls and bounties or just being a merchant sailor collecting and delivering cargo to different outposts. Then there is the skull fortresses that you can do, those are basically skeleton compounds that spawn waves of enemies to defeat until a boss will spawn,once defeated will drop a key to the stronghold that is full of treasures and valuables. Story missions? Got em too.
The details in this game are also beautiful! you can drink beer then vomit in a bucket and throw it on your friend. You can blow up a barrel near a chicken and it will spawn a charred piece of chicken. You can play music to a snake to tame it. You can get hit by lighting during a storm if you are wielding a sword. The water will start boil if volcano erupts.
The game world is just satisfying to look at from clear blue waters with big tropical islands, to deep black waters with volcano islands that may erupt. 
The game world itself is also riddled with dangers, from Megalodons and Krakens to Ghost Ship Fleets and other players. PVP aspect in this game is my favorite thing, it feels balanced and satisfying. The sound of you hitting a rival players ship and watching it go down, or jumping on board of their vessel and hacking them to death with a sword or shooting them is one of the most satisfying feelings I've ever felt in a video game. There is so many creative things you can use to your advantage when fighting other players from movement to explosive barrels and magical cannonballs. Strongly recommended, double the fun with friends but there is also a matchmaking system that will allow you to queu up with randoms.
If you like adventures, random hilariousness, epic fights and jaw dropping moments then this game is for you. If you ever dreamed of being a pirate then now is your chance.",1593446549,1593574143,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561197989734896,155,39,7350,1878,4055,1602010048

From the resistance of the waves and wind against your ship, to the sounds of the creaking boards and cannons blasting into the beautiful horizon, Sea of Thieves keeps you immersed in it's world during your session. 

Mind you, it's not for the feint of heart. It's a straightforward game that's ""easy to learn, hard to master"". There are no upgrades or leveling up. What you see is what you get, three different sized ships meant for appropriately sized crews. You'll need good communication in order to maneuver properly in a galleon. That being said, soloing is not impossible, but can be incredibly difficult as you will be at a disadvantage. Sailing in a small sized sloop is you're only option when by yourself. No matter what your set up is, be prepared to sink. You will die in this game, but each time you'll be a little better, kind of like Dark Souls. It's expected.

I almost didn't get this game due to not having friends to play with, but watch some gameplay videos to get a feel for what it is and maybe you'll be convinced like I was. A good place to start is PhuzzyBond on YouTube. He has a great beginner's playlist that I highly recommend.

All in all, I'm having a blast!

even the worst part of the game as critiqued in several other reviews -- the universal pvp -- feels organic enough that it can be overlooked or embraced depending on what kinda gamer you are. it's pirates, after all, why wouldn't they sink you for whatever you're hiding below deck? and there's enough utility via cursed cannonballs or clever navigating that you're not forced to engage if you're paying attention to your surroundings.

+ No pay to win (from what I've seen so far). All gear upgrades are cosmetic. So you won't fall prey to someone who's paid for a special cannon.
+ Minimal information (can be a con if you want). The game doesn't explain much, but the solutions are logical, so you can figure it out. i.e. use a bucket to bail water from inside your boat and throw the water over the side. No minimap = Use the map and compass to navigate. Eating raw meat can make you sick = cook it!
+ Can pick up a quest whenever and do whatever.  
+ Fun little things you'll discover along the way. Just sail into a storm and fight the ghost ships! Find a note in a bottle, solve the riddles for a treasure chest!
+ Meeting other ships will be a lesson in first contact diplomacy. Playing musical instruments is a good way to show you're friendly.

- Much harder to play solo. Turn the ship wheel, raise the sails, lower the anchor- Oh, you've hit rocks, better patch up the hull and bail the water otherwise that small leak will sink you!

Me, I simply enjoy doing the trade routes for the merchant guild. You load up supplies, sail to another island and drop off supplies.

Most people hate chasing chickens.. but for me, looking for animals brings me the hours of mindless entertainment (except snakes... they suck).

77,71684488,english,"Do I recommend this game? Do I NOT recommend this game? That's a tricky question to answer. I LOVE this game. I love the experiences I've had with it. I love how much fun and how epic quests can be when you have other people to play with. I love that you can join with random people and dive headfirst into the game without knowing what to expect from your ventures.

I didn't initially like that this was an online game and that you would be sharing the seas with other REAL people (and namely how that's the ONLY mode of gameplay available), but I suppose I've gotten accustomed to it, and even started to appreciate it. The experiences you'll have can vary dramatically. On one server you might get attacked by a big ship while you, with your measly little sloop, are just going about your business trying to have a good time. On another you might get annihilated by the Kraken with at least 10k gold's worth of loot on board, only to lose every bit of it. Then there's a chance you'll run into a nice group of folks willing to ally with you and share their riches, OR you might get paired with someone who turns out to be a great and fun person. There's a lot of chance that goes into each session that you play, and depending on the outcome, you can either really enjoy yourself or find yourself rage quitting over something potentially minor. 

Now, with all of that said, here's what I DON'T love about the game, and strongly encourage the developers to consider changing. 

- There's absolutely no point to anything. Sure, that new sail might look pretty and all, or the capstan might look just darling with its cosmetic changes, but after a few dozen quests to make the gold required to purchase them, what does it REALLY offer you other than aesthetic appeal? And what about the swords, guns etc.? You can make them look awfully cool, but again, it offers you nothing except for AESTHETIC APPEAL. That's how all of the purchases go. You buy it because it looks nice, but then that's it, it does nothing else for you. It can seem worth it at first, but some of these quests are difficult, and you run the risk of getting sunk at any given time. The stress and struggle of each quest is fun, no doubt, but it does not equal the rewards you get out of it. 

- The online segment. Seriously, there are some real bone heads in this game who will sink you JUST because they can, even if you have no loot on board for them to steal. I was playing one time doing a map quest and I remember walking around the island wondering what the everlasting fuck had happened to my sloop. Then I saw the big big ship, the biggest one, where my boat was and they were hauling what little bit of loot I had back onto their ship. Sounds fine, right? Because that's how the game is supposed to go, right? Not when you've got bone heads like that screaming ""F A G G O T S"" into the mic because they're bigger and stronger than you and there's nothing you can do about it. This severely needs to change. On another occasion, a single sloop took down about three of my allies, including a big ship (can't remember the names of the ships) by silently hopping on board, setting everything on fire and repeatedly sword killing everyone on board. I SWEAR this guy was overpowered because all he had to do was hit me once with the sword and I was back on the ferry of the damned. Probably modded. Again, this SEVERELY needs to change. I suggest servers split into ship size. For example, if I decide to sail with the sloop, I want whatever server the game puts me in to be a SLOOP ONLY server. Same goes for the other two ships. At least in this case, players would have an equal chance to fight off enemies instead of, say, being a sloop and being attacked by a crew of FOUR people against only me, or only my friend and I. That simply isn't balanced gameplay. 

- I can only stack five wood at a time? Really? Not to mention, you can only stack five food items, ten cannonballs and five of the ones in the jars. It's a massive pain to go back and forth 20+ times to get enough wood to keep your ship from sinking should you be unlucky enough to go face to tentacle with the kraken. I would really like to be able to purchase upgrades. Maybe my gun holds more bullets before I need to refill? Maybe I can purchase an extra ""slot"" or set of slots in my inventory so I can carry more of something at one time. Say from 5 food, I can add one, make it six, or I can add another one, make it seven. I would like something to look forward to, a REASON to be going on these quests looking for treasure. 


Anyway, overall I love this game. I would recommend it for the upside but I encourage the devs to add a few changes to the game to make it better and more appealing for long-term play. Price is a tad greedy for its content in my opinion, but not much of a loss at full price.

2 years laters, it released on steam. I checked the steam store page out of curiostiy and watch the whole 18min of the presentation video that shows all that changed since.
Now that it had content and the gameplay looked even better, I decided to try it out.

That was such a good decision! 
This game is hard, but in the right way. 
The gameplay is so rewarding.
The multiplayer moments are extremely memorable.
The quests (Tale tale in mind here) are so satisfying.
The fact that there are no ""power upgrade"" is a very good thing for this game. Its about skills.

86,71680664,english,"So i've been told by a few friends that i would like this game, so being bored, i finaly got it.

And hating the game, i also very quicky refunded it.

This is the worst piece of shit i've ever seen ever. 

List of issues are as follows:
Couldn't add my friend through the xbox live thingy that i apparantly had to use. Took us about 30 mins to get the thing to even be able to open ingame.
The window where you log into the xbox thingy had a PERMANENT part of a steam window covering it, so i couldn't see how to log in.
Got into the game (finaly) and got a quest to go to a nearby Island. The island looked like it was made out of playdough. It's worth mentioning, nothing else looked weird (as far as i knew at the time)
Sending a pic to my friend i was with, he realises that he was naked to me, shouldn't be becouse he had apparantly tons of fancy gear on him that wouldn't render.
Jumping onto the island, hoping that it would render when i was on it. I fell through the island, saw a black void for a few moments, started jerking up and down (not a sexjoke), before insta dying.
Stuck on a loading screen for 10 minutes after dying before i alt f4 the game and restart it. 
Game never launches since. Stuck on infinite black screen every time.

1/10, the water looked pretty.",1593462496,1593462496,False,4,1,0.520416796207427979,7,True,False,False,76561198003467242,335,37,58,0,58,1593461096
87,71680037,english,"I do play this game with my friends. However when ships follow us and just shout 'die faggots' it kinda makes me not want to play it. It's got really cool PVE and the tall tales are amazing. 
I don't mind the PVP at all aside from the toxicity. I wish the video was more truthful. The PVP in the game isn't just in the area. Soloing is less likely possible because of bigger ships. The only thing that carries over are your gold and deblones. The tutorial isn't very useful at all really. 
The lore is amazing, the visuals are gorgeous. PVP can be fun. You know unless you have very toxic players but I mean having a good fight is amazingly fun. I don't mind the GG part and good sportsmanship. 
Steam did ruin this game a little with the amount of aggresive players. I want to fish. I don't have treasure on my ship. I've had players just take out my ship for no reason. At first I didn't mind and retaliated and got better at driving and menuvoring because of it, however as time went on it was almost every game to the point where it wasn't fun to solo at all. Having a second person made it easier yes. 
After a bit I realized it isn't about skill but numbers. Which isn't how I play at all. Doing tall tales is almost impossible as a solo mostly because of the travel time it takes to do them. Yes you make out with a bandit but the likely hood of someone just blowing you up are too high. 
Anyway, if you have friends you should be fine BUT if you solo be careful out there. With steam being in the xplay it brought a lot of people who verbally will abuse you. Just switch servers. I know you lose everything you had but don't give them the satisfactory of anything. Hope they don't kill this game.

91,71305949,english,"I heard this game was pretty boring during its initial release. So i decided to wait a couple years before trying it out. So far after 8hrs its been worth it. Theres some interesting lore and the sailing is fun. However the combat is lackluster and all we have fought are skeletons and the kraken. We still have not yet had an encounter with other players. Also the only thing you can spend your loot on is cosmetics. Whether its on your ship, character, weapons or pets its not that great. Of course its always about the journey not the destination. And the journey is great.

Edit: Right after I wrote this review my shipmate and I finally found our first player. They fired first which sent me out of my ship and into the water. I swam over to their ship and boarded it. I completely caught them by surprise and killed both of our soon to be booty snatchers with precision sword attacks. I ran downstairs where I found a treasure chest and then jumped back to my boat. By then both of them have responded. Then we preceded to be chased for 20 freaking minutes. We finally made it to a port and sold their booty. Since this encounter I have had a complete blast playing this game. However I do wish there was a character leveling or ranking system. There are factions you level up but you only unlock new cosmetics from them. The cosmetics are cool and all, but I wan't to work towards a new weapon not a different colored weapon. I also wish your ship and all your equipment didn't reset after you logoff. This means if you don't have 4 hrs to spend on this game in a single session, you're not going to progress that much.

I couldn't get a single shot in, or else risk having my ship sink. It looked like I was done for.

Then, suddenly, another player was sailing by and offered to help! I was saved! Except once he took out all of the skeletons, he then set his sights on me and began to unload more cannonballs into the hull of my ship. I tried to outrun him but realized it would be impossible; I was out of wood and could no longer repair my ship, and i was rapidly taking on water. 

I jumped into the ocean, somehow unnoticed, and swam up to their rapidly approaching ship. I climbed up their ladder and realized I had the element of surprise so I quickly killed the captain, and then his only crewmate who was manning the cannons. 

I won. My ship would sink but I won. I then saw all the treasure they had stashed on their ship. It was an impressive haul that surely must've taken hours to collect. So I made their ship go as fast as it could and, before they could respawn, I systematically proceeded to throw all of their treasure directly into the fucking ocean.

79,71622547,english,"I am enjoying this game. It's kind of hard to find a team initially and you might have to restart a few times since there's no actual way of browsing available teams. But when you find some randoms who actually want to play the game properly, it's a very fun experience. 

There are no stats or levelling or XP system to bog the gameplay down, there's only treasure which you use to buy cosmetics. When you complete a mission, you'll rank up in your reputation to whichever faction gave you the mission, allowing you to access harder and more lucrative contracts. 

It sounds very basic but to be honest a levelling RPG system would be unnecessary in a game like this. The PVP is a lot of fun and the ship battles are long and hard-fought, when you win you get to steal all the loot from the other guys' ship. 

 If you like sandbox survival games you'll probably like this one. It's less like ARK and more like Rust. The feeling of paranoia and the need to be vigilant and cautious is a huge source of fun. If you don't like games where you're under potential threat everywhere and there's no safe areas from PVP, you probably won't like this. It's surprisingly brutal and you can spend ages collecting treasure only to have it taken by a bigger group with a bigger boat. 

It makes me want to play it more, and I don't think I'll get bored of it any time soon, so that is a pretty solid recommendation from me.",1593401576,1593401576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198001854882,793,90,1533,0,1383,1593450389

92,71619481,english,"In my opinion, this is the best pirate/sailing game out there, with the prettiest water graphics by a wide margin. It's also one of the best open-world, sandbox-y multiplayer games I've played: all the PvP, tension, and social interaction of survival games, but with none of the long-term commitment and risk that comes with base building.

There are three big disclaimers, which may either scare you away or draw you in:

1. No gear upgrades, no vertical progression: everything you unlock will be cosmetic. If you want to grind for functional loot, this isn't the game for you. If you want to personalize your outfit, gear, and ship, it's got you covered ten times over.

2. No offline mode, and going solo is pretty lonely. Playing alone puts you at a huge disadvantage, at least until you really know what you're doing... And even then, it's always more fun with a crew. If you don't have friends to play with and want to set sail with strangers, you should probably use the official Discord server instead of the in-game matchmaking.

3. Expect to spend a lot of time just sailing around. The trip will be gorgeous, and there's always stuff to do (trimming the sails, fishing, cooking, etc), but it will get boring fast unless you really enjoy the ambience of being on the water (or have friends to chat with).

Ветер имеет значение, ход корабля относительно движения волн имеет значение. Тебя может кидать на волнах как щепку, ты можешь попасть в шторм. Смена дня и ночи, смена погоды. Все в динамике. Сам океан и вода тоже окрашивается в цвета в зависимости от времени суток и погоды.  И при этом все в фановом пиратском оформлении как One Piece.

Поединки на арене - фан в чистом виде. Особенно с рандомами.
С одним чуваком мы подожгли свой же корабль и играли на барабанах, стоя на палубе, пока тот тонул. С другим нарезали круги возле противников и потопили всех, заняв первое место и не взяв ни одного сундука :)

That are up for a challenge.
That doesn't mind grinding. 
That likes the main story of the game.
That love pirates and treasure.
That wanna fight and shoot, other pirate ships down and take all of their treasure!

The downside to fighting people is of course to lose to them. You will lose all of the treasure you got. You will be able to get back on them, but wouldn't say that happens often, but it can happen!
Of course, this is all up for you to decide at the end of the day.

49,70359353,english,"I have 2 major problems I can't get over to give this game a good review. One is the complete lack of progression, which has been argued both ways, and the other is the community, which again has been argued several times over. I understand the reason for no progression, level even playing field and all of that. Does progression in this game really mean getting an advantage over the other in a major significant way? Why can't we get progression towards less sway of our sniper scopes, an upgrade to inventory space, even something as small as the speed you carry a chest. There's nothing that gives a player seeking purpose to play other than ruin other people's experiences. Open Crew is without a doubt the worst option to play this game. This community is the pinnacle of subhuman specimens. When I join open crew, I'm greeted by either 1, people who do not speak my language, in a server with 150 ping. 2, quiet griefers who throw fire/explosive bombs on deck and leave. 3, pre teens. 4, The people who actually know what theyre doing. This is a problem because when I've been a part of them, they sailed over to a sloop with 2 guys in starter gear begging to be left alone because they were trying to learn. I guarantee I watched and took part in helping 2 people no longer play this game again. So the PvP is forced, making people who don't want to take part in it the easy targets, and told to get over it because that's what the game is supposed to be about. The story in this game is probably one of the most dragged out, repetitive, and absolute boring story lines I've ever tried to do. Beating every tall tale in the game rewards only partial the rewards, because in order to fully complete the mission, it must be completed 5 or more times in order to be 100%. This idea was only created by the 1 man who actually thought this never ending fetch quest was decent, and that's because he made the thing. What's the reward for finally putting in all of that time and effort into beating the campaign? 10,000 gold. Bear in mind, a PvP infested area known as Fort of the Damned, has a reward that can net you well over 250,000. Another giant slap in the face to those who are trying to find the PvE, as if the lack of progression, lack of solid storyline, and lack of content in general wasn't enough. There's 4 factions. Get them to level 50 and huzzah you did it, go sink players until you're bored of it. Then we're told: we're actually lucky! We didn't see what this game was like 2 years ago, it was so much more shallow! If I played 2 years ago, I would've played well under half the time I played now, and I would've been led to the same conclusion. Who's really lucky then?

but ...
Let's talk about those things which make the game sucks
DEVs are not listening to their community at all or they just hear the voice of the players who grief or those one who making fun on people, campers, toxic, racist players, spawn killers, players who curse in the mic and scream .. I said that because the moderator of the their Steam forum keep banning and silence any voice demands for PVE servers  .
2 years ago players were asking for PVE game mode, but up to this hour DEVs not listening to these group of players .. 
You know why !!? 
DEVs fear to make this toxic community get angry, 
Some people say that PVE will affect negatively to game, I don't know how if PVE will be and optional !! so PVP players will keep playing PVP and those players who like to play this game to relax themselves will play PVE gamemode, 
They pretend that the game will broken LoL , all games have multi-options but this game is not allowed to have another option to make some players enjoy it .
They will say it's a ""pirate game"" and I""ll say it's not a ""pirate simulator"" game tho .. or you can named it ""sea of griefers, sea of campers, sea of racist"" instead, choice your title you want ..
""Splitting the playerbase"" isn't true , cuz the game is already has 2 game modes ..
PVE (or PVE servers with PVP zones) will really help the game to keep it's playerbase high and high..
When players have 2 different mode (PVP, PVE) with 2 different profile in each gamemode so players will try hard to increase their progresses and gain more gold in each gamemode ..
That mean: more players will enjoy the game with his ownway , more hours to playing and players won't left the game that easily, game recommended, more money the DEVs earn, more free updates ...
In general, DEVs should give everyone a choice and keeps everyone happy ..
Last thing I want to say : Just as there are people who want to play PVP, there are also people who want to play PVE mode, So what's the problem here !! why some people keep refusing this fact !!
Suppose that those who wish to play PVE mod are few as some guys said and there are more than 100k players are playing now and less than 2k will be playing PVE mode , so what is bothering you ??
Keep playing PVP mode and don't impose on people what kind of game mode they have to play ..
And no game has ever died by have both PVP or PVE servers ..

PS: don't say ""go and play another game"" , you toxic player :* 
Hey DEVs save your game before you see the fact that there are only a 1k are playing the game on Steam ..

The sea where you decide whether you want to serve the order of souls and hunt skeleton captains, or perhaps you want to work for the Gold Hoarders company, and get a bit of extra coin for every item you sell!

- My experience for this game to date:

I've been playing with randoms and it of course has its ups and downs, from getting people with no mics or just plain people but the most important part, is that I haven't met anyone annoying or planned to grief his own crew and that's a plus. (In a 2 man crew, because if you're 3+ you can vote to put them in the brig)

The game itself is kinda simple and easy to learn, and gets super interesting when you want to learn proper naval combat.

Doing voyages is fun for the most part and very rewarding the more you do, they aren't hard at all and they don't take too much time either. As for tall tales they can get SUPER interesting and the puzzles become tough, like really tough, but its -as the name says- way of telling a quest like a tall (and it being tall lol) can keep you busy for a whole lot, and still reward you quite nicely.

- Bugs/Glitches/Issues:

Haven't noticed any lag or lag spikes or disconnects or crashes, very minor bugs that don't really affect anything.

* I was very flattered by the recent Haunted Shores update, it isn't the biggest update, but it is a foundation for the upcoming tales we are about to experience.

This could be my first truly flawless game, and I love it VERY much.

Thank you, Rare.

99,71559135,english,"The game itselft is awesome, BUT it has no Steam support whatsoever apart from being sold on Steam. Why do we have to mess with a garbage platform like xbox live when we bought the game on Steam? A co-op game on Steam should use the Steam interface for match making instead of forcing you to create accounts on rubbish platforms that you would otherwise never use for anything. Xbox live is complete trash, their servers are constantly down, your account gets locked all the time for no reason, and they charge you 10$ for changing your profile name because apparently xbox developers cannot distinguish between an internal player ID and a public player name.

It's sad to see great games like this waste their potential on trashy platforms like xbox live. Thank god this game was released on Steam. Hopefully they will implement Steam support once they eventually realize that xbox cannot compete with Steam in any form, and that 90% of their player base will be on Steam. Get it right: Steam players do not care about playing with console players (who cannot compete anyways), we care about playing with our Steam friends.

If they add Steam support I'm changing this to a positive review. As for now though I cannot recommend a game that releases on Steam but forces me to use a dysfunctional and predatory service run by a company like microsoft.

27,71548239,english,"DON'T BUY IT IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON PLAYING IT SOLO

 Now that I've addressed the obvious part out, I should say that I recommend this game fully (even tho I play solo too cause even the friends I have that bought the game won't even play it). The graphics aren't realistic per say but the cartoonish style combined with the spectacular sunsets and the general vibrance of the game makes it a good time on your eyes. If your pc is lagging for some reason then it might be because of either rendering distance or some particle effects options. Sound design (including the ambience and shanties) is on par with the graphics, in which they make me almost miss the AC: Black Flag times.
 There are some bugs here and there including the flying ships (which didn't happen to me luckily (yet)), and some sound bugs in which a certain sound gets stuck like underwater bass(?) but they easily go away once you do that sound specific action again.

 Now to speak of the community, I have stumbled upon a few people that avoided conflict and even one that I befriended for the remainder of a game session although don't expect this behavior from all you come across. A lot of the time people want to taste the freedom an open world PVP game gives them and attack you at no reason at hand, however that is the part of the game (hell, it is the game). Playing with your friends or a crew makes this PVP time a lot less frustrating cause you might come out victorious but as I said at the beginning, if you're playing solo, don't expect a good outcome. I have managed to get away from a few ships but that's the extent of good luck. Sinking your ship even though you just got into the game and haven't even got out of the port, backstabbing you after playing friendly, pursuing you to the ends of  the world just to get one chest from your ship (which is the most common thing you're gonna stumble upon), and finally the sloop's which are recommended for two players but a lot of the times only one player boards them and you trust this information so much that an actual two players come out from it to whoop your ass (happened to me right before writing this actually).

 Overall, a nice sailing/pirating game to, you know, being a pirate.

Anyhow i have a About 30 Hours into the game and I have to say it's a-lot of fun so far.

Or Take Chickens to a vendor.     there's alot of different activities to do.   

I will say though this game is ALOT more fun with friends.    Not only to help you gather treasure and defeat enemies but this game has a pretty big open PvP scene and people WILL come by and sink you and take your stuff just because they can.     If you get easily upset i would steer clear.   

But i would also encourage to continue as losing some treasure really is not as bad as mostly the gold and doubloons in the game you get really is just there to help you buy cosmetic items.

I love sailing around with my friends doing both PvE and PvP stuff, if it is going around digging up treasure, killing skeletons or those god for saken transport voyages.

93,71511086,english,"There is one reason why this game sucks and only one. One major flaw to rule them all and devs refuse to fix it even if the fix itself is actually VERY easy to implement.

Athena voyages (end game) take way too long. Especially if you are solloing on sloop. When you sign up for Athena, you better have anywhere from 3-5 hours of free time. And I mean free time. Because if you go afk for more than 10 minutes, you will get kicked and all your progress is lost. So better visit the WC before you start the session.

Take my current example. It took me 4 hours to get to the point where I was on my ship with the Legendary chest, burning one you can sell for over 8k gold and plent of reputation. At one point I was attacked by Kraken and pirate ship alongside an island that went boom (volcano), I survived all of that and more, only to get a server disconnection when I was nearing the port to sell the Legendary Chest. Meaning 4 hours of progress fully lost.

I have spoken about this one MAJOR flaw on forums more than once. The fix itself is easy. Just implement mini Athena voyages for half the reward that will take half the time.

If you want a crew, plenty of communities make it easy to meet other players who will show you the ropes and get you up to speed. If you prefer playing solo, it's difficult for sure (especially at first), but it's absolutely doable, rewarding, and if you stick with it, it'll make you a monster when playing with crews.

However once you start picking up valuable items you are going to want a crew, for protection more than anything else.

Pro Tip: DO THE MAIDEN VOYAGE introduction level. Sea of Thieves doesn't hold your hand apart from this, so get everything out of the tutorial level you can. Mess around with your ship, anchor, sails, cannons, locate your inventory boxes and get used to steering and the map. No spoliers but I'd STRONGLY ADVISE fully exploring the island on the tutorial level, it can give you a big boost going into the main game. 

I recommend this game, however given it's price, I would ensure you are comfortable playing with others (either friends or strangers) because you are only likely to get 5-10 hours of single player enjoyment from this before needing others to help.

Working for different factions 
Making alliances with other crews 
Making it to pirate legend
Sneaking in other crews' ships
Stealing loot
Completing tall tales and unlocking a new region
Decent lore
Good updates so far
Cool world events
Krakens and skeleton ships spawning on you when you have a lot of loot on board.

64,70245809,english,"I played this game a ton using the Xbox Game Pass that came with my AMD CPU and fell in love with it. I got to Pirate Legend in those 3 months. It's a great game for people that love to grind out levels and earn cosmetic rewards.

It's not for people who love non-stop action and need other types of rewards, other than cosmetics.

I suggest signing up with a month of Xbox Game Pass to test it out before buying it, because this game isn't for everyone. I was planning on buying it from the start after getting that free 3 months of game pass. I waited until it was out on Steam though. I would personally put it in my top 10 favorite games of all time. It's a VERY unique and great game that still gets updated every month and there isn't really any pay to win DLC, since it's all cosmetics.

There are some bad things about this game though. The worst thing about this game are the servers and the method that Rare uses to find servers for players. I feel like the game doesn't place you on servers close to you, because i always have 60+ ping and going by the Azure latency test (They use Microsoft's Azure servers). That would mean the game keeps putting me on Central US servers, because the ping test shows 20-30ping on US East Azure Servers via the latency test tool for Azure. The game should be putting me on US East servers.

There are also server merges in the game when one server has a low population, so it merges the players from a dead server into a more populated server. The problem with this is if you aren't near all your loot when this happens. You lose it all. So if you dig up a ton of loot and hide it on an island, because you have to take a Mermaid back to your ship to help fight another player ship and then the server merges, that means all the loot that you left on the island will despawn. So you have to leave at least one player on an island at all times if you don't take all the loot. Shouldn't really be an issue for newer players, but this is a problem for more end game players.

There are also a bunch of bugs and exploits still many years later that haven't been fixed like sound bugs when coming out of the water etc and

75,70689762,english,"40 Hour Edit: The game kind of got boring at this point. Pve is limited, kill skeleton, kill boss, carry the loot to the ship, sell the loot at the next outpost. Still a good game but doesn't make me want to play it anymore. Another deal breaker for me was the lack of pvp in adventure mode in some of my sessions. While I would get to fight 4-5 different ships in a 3 hour gaming session, I would see no other players in my session the next day, which is kind of boring. If they increased the server capacity to 32-36 (right now is 24), I reckon it would be more of an enjoyable experience. It is kinda a lot of too repetitive- pveish at this point for my liking but recommended regardless, haven't had this much excitement in a game since a year or two.

Actual Review:

this is an amazing game, well worth its price.

-You will get to play as a pirate playing different instruments. there are 3-4 different instruments and the music syncs when all your crew play different ones! You will get to choose between 4 different weapons. Your sword (compulsory) or a pistol, shotgun or a sniper rifle. 
-You will discover new islands, new biomes. You will get killed by skeleton pirates (they have different variations and they could be quite harsh and spooky). You will have pleasant and horrible surprises through your journey between the islands, monsters and fineass loot per se. 
-You will have intense moments over loot, your heart will race through epic moments. You will learn how to fight.
-You will have sea sickness after you turn off the computer. 
-The splash sound as you jump into the water is extremely realistic, you will feel wet and see the bubbles like you jumped from a rock in real life.


-You will be insulted a lot as you could hear other crew's mic chats when you dont have much distance between you and them.

Some side notes:
-Graphics are fortnite-ish and cartoony. 
-Customisation of the characters is alright, you can have pets which are interactive and they will dance to the music you make! 
-You absolutely need a mic and this is not a casual game where you could enter and play for 30 minutes and disconnect (unless you are playing solo). Travelling between locations usually take around 10-15 minutes.
-Game is running solid 60 fps+ on i7- 4790k- gtx 1080 @1080p",1591990889,1593247707,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198091087153,77,7,2321,0,964,1593895949

I am already on steam!)

- Ok, then the ""Invite friend"" on the lobby was disabled no matter what we do, it turned out that it does not work on PC at all and we need to use Xbox APP (what!). I had the app installed and was able see the overlay (though took me a while to figure out how to add my friend to the friends list), but my friend does not have the app installed, so he tried to install it from the xbox live site ( you know what? there is a beta available on the site, that's all, no stable or alternative version or whatever, only ""download beta app"") ok, he did download the app and tried to install it, but the installation failed silently (sick!)

- finally, despite my friend was unable to install the Xbox App and has no overlay, he managed to see me in in-game the invitation list when he created the lobby and invite me, and I did receive the invitation, but you know what?! you guess? when I click on accept icon - NOTHING HAPPENED, literally, nothing.

91,71407920,english,"Bugs:

 There are still bugs reported over two years ago, while some of these bugs include audio issues which is mild annoyance there are things that break gameplay. As an example you cannot jump or move the mouse only vertically after you get off your ship. Solution for many of these seems to be dying and respawning to fix them, however in the middle of a sea battle this is something you cannot afford.

Players: 

 There are players who after joining your crew, start to firebomb your ship, throwing treasures you collected off board, dropping anchor, raising sails or diverting course by grabbing the wheel and not letting go. You can’t kick them or look for another group without sacrificing what you collected as supplies, treasure and emissary level. Only option is to send this person to the brig but if you and this person are the only ones in the group due there is no majority you can't vote for brig.

Voice Chat, Text Chat, Player Names:

 Racism and xenophobia seems to be everywhere.

 Ever forced to listen to a racist song because of your crew members character's skin color or their accent ? 
Solution: Mute the voice. 

 Tired of reading the same thing in text form ? 
Solution: Mute the text. 

 Oh player name is the same thing ?
Solution:  Hide player names. 

	 Somehow instead taking action you play three monkeys by seeing no evil, hearing no evil and speaking no evil. Inorder to report a player you have to jump through hoops, now that is the quality i would expect from small indie companies such as MICROSOFT and RARE, don’t believe me ? Have a look.  https://support.seaofthieves.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000779227-How-to-report-a-player

Gameplay: 

	Sea Battles: As the name suggests thieves are in the sea rather than their ships. Sea battles are fought by dashing through the water either by climbing into a cannon and firing yourself or power attacking with your sword in order to climb the ladder of the opposing ship. These magical ladders are nor removable so they provide a constant weak point, if you are boarded you will be spawn camped and only option reminded while waiting for respawn is to sink your ship and restart in a new location.

	Cycle: You search for treasure, you sell the treasure and repeat 

Conclusion:

	I fell for the eidos or the essence of the concept. Reality sadly far from it. I would not recommend it.

0,70359157,english,"Well, I was about to say that this game is totally undeserving the hype and is a bad game, but, it has these ""burps of greatness"" which changes everything. 

Let me explain, it is really atmospheric and open to imagination rather than grind. 

First night i was playing SoT, we were four friends and two were actual seamen. It was understandably epic to act like pirate crew while using all the lingo of actual sailors, trying to get into battle. However, it was the second night i played the game which actually hooked me.

Me and two others had this mid-tier ship and i decided that we should be pirate hunters instead of pirates. Since everybody is complaining about PVP in forums and wanting PVE, i thought ""hey, i guess we can make friends"" and it would be great to experience the other side for a change.

We've traveled around for a while with random quests and found this riddle message in a bottle, eventually leading to this avian themed island with bird like statues. It took us so long to get the riddle right, one of our crew members passed out from drinking in real life, so we put his character in brig (holding cell in our ship). After we solved the riddle as the remaining crew members, we've decided to get the goodies to an island with merchants and on our way we had an encounter which went friendly after announcing ourselves as such. We were now sure that we can sail friendly and only engage if necessary or to hunt more notorious pirates. After all, notorious ones are easier to identify, heavily modified ships are more likely to be owned by experienced players, which in turn more likely to be hostile on spot due to being more confident with the game.

Couple of minutes later we left the port again, we were chasing around another ship to ask whether they saw any pirates (hoping they would say; ""Yes, us!"" , so we could start a fight and end the night in high note with all the shenanigans) and found one lone ship anchored near a field of debris. Much to our disappointment, this group turned out to be friendly as well and pointed us further north for pirates. We, in disbelief and sure they were lying, sailed north anyways to maintain character but also keeping an eye out for this one ship on our back. Then suddenly, loud noise of cannonshots! Two ships, one manned by undead came out of nowhere and guns started blazing. The last thing i saw before leaving the ship with a keg of cannon-powder was Kraken's arms raising up. I lit the barrel, threw the keg at this huge tentacle and swam as fast as i can to get away, shouting ""help"" towards the crew we just had a chat. 

My ship went down, but,i survived the ordeal with heavy injuries, yet the undead ship followed me to battle with these guys as well. I immediately jumped to this unknown ship's guns, shouting ""friendly! friendly!"" and started bombarding while good captain tried to rout away from both ships and a storm. I must add at this point that we were not sharing a common language. Either i landed enough shots on the other ships or captain was good with his trim but we got away. Sound of sea and the wind went back to normal, checking the ship i saw only the captain was alive, the other crew member i don't know what happened. 

After a minute of silently emoting respect, I saw something shining on the sea, a bit behind us, closer to the battle zone. You see, i had to check it. Shouting one last farewell, I jumped off the ship, ofcourse i was trusting the friendly mermaids for a ride back home. Among some barrels floating, i found this peculiar blue stone, most likely from another ship sunk by the undead crew or the second ship which attacked us at the start of the fight. I wanted to take the stone back home with me but the damned mermaid refused to take me back with the stone in my hand. So, I decided to make my way to the nearest island, swimming angrily to the stupid mermaids. 

Everything was well until i saw a fin on the surface of the water, got attacked by the shark almost immediately after i saw it. Raising my pistol, i spent my last shot on the predator and immediately started slicing it with my new sabre. To my suprise, it didn't take too long for this shark to be mortally wounded and somehow i survived yet again. I made my way to this rock formation which i initially thought was an island and climbed a bit to use my spyglass, there were no sign of life for miles. The damned mermaid below me, i was checking for other ships to get a ride, hopefully not giving up on this blue stone (Sapphire of the Mermaid or something). It was one really long day for Papenbard the Privateer.

That is where i left off, an amazing adventure for me. What is even better, when i get in the game next time, it will start in a tavern with a mysterious stranger commenting something like ""Aha, another new face. That was quite the celebration when you arrived... I am not surprised you don't remember it. ""

It is atmospheric.

It's so refreshing to have a game where you can simply log in and start playing.
No leveling required, no daily quest, no grinding for 10 hours to unlock the meta item or whatever..

The game has different quest types. Most of them are, in a way, go pick up this and bring it back BUT the way you get that item is different for every quest type. Besides that, you have world events which you could call raids, and of course PvP is always around the palm tree.

[b]About the Game[/b]
[list]
[*]The GAMEPLAY is designed to be a cooperative experience. If you want to play alone you can and you will be able to get some things done, you might even sink some unaware ships, but you won't be able to get the full experience.

[*]The CORE of the GAME it's the open world sandbox element. It doesn't matter how many times you do the same quest, every time will be different because other players and the world itself will have different things to throw at you. Literally.

[*]The ENDEGAME: do pirating, get gold, get pimped.

[*]Explosive Kegs: They are a thing

The art style of the game is great, Rare have done an amazing job over the past years.

With every game there are always bugs that are introduced in updates.. but the developers seem to keep an eye on these and inform the community of the most important ones which are being tracked and worked on, with usually a fix put into place quickly depending on the severity or at a minimum within the next update.

Yes, I recommend the game, but. It is clearly meant for teamplay and not solo play. 
The game proves it is very much PVP, which for a mostly casual gamer like myself is a bit off putting. Unless as mentioned earlier, you are part of a crew, in which case it feels amazing. Having friends man the cannons, trimming and adjusting the sails for optimal speeds, while another is at the helm. This is where the game shines.
Playing by myself I haven't found a single other player who doesn't feel the need to go out of their way to attack, harass or otherwise mess with me. Meanwhile, I am merely trying to do my own thing. Sail my sloop, collect some loot, grind some reputation. Which all too often made me frustrated enough to just opt out for the game for the rest of the night.
The game is gorgeous though. It being summer here now and hot....the water just makes me want to dive in and go for a swim, the amount of customisation for ones character and ship is a nice touch and really feels like you are your own (wo)man. 
Overall though, I do not regret having purchased the game. Have had an amazing multiplayer with friends experience, and a lesser solo experience.

But because of the ongoing global pandemic, the job opportunities just doesn't come yet. Hence I really miss to be out there sailing away on the vast empty seas.

Thanks to the Sea of Thieves, I could finally relive the moments on the virtual world.
Of the sea breeze as I angled my sail away. Of the hard hitting waves from the rain pouring storms. The massive blue horizon as the eye could feast. The tankards we raised with friends as we dance to shanties.....

But now, I will miss this gem. As I would be sailing again for real this time, for how long I would never know. Thank you for this awesome and wonderful experience..

PVP is challenging as we aren't very good yet but hopefully we'll be the ones destroying galleons with ease eventually. Got frame drops on the shroudbreaker Tall Tale near the end, but my PC isn't that high-tier anyway. 

My only real complaint would be there's no sense of direction when starting out (except the very basic tutorial). Its kinda like the elite dangerous of the caribbean, make your own paths and stuff. Id recommend watching a few beginner guide videos and having the Sea Of Thieves Wiki on hand when you're not yet experienced in the game, it helps a lot.

TL;DR: Beautiful, satisfying, and very enjoyable with friends, but is hard to know where to go at the start.

All in all, this gets a 9/10 for gameplay, 5/10 for the user friendliness of the entire ordeal of installing and dealing with the friend system. Overall its 8/10. So if you have the money, get it.

93,71353824,english,"This is a fantastic game with a large vast sea of content. The game is a mix of GTA 5 online, Rust and doing pirate stuff. It has satisfying both PVE and PVP gameplay.  Game can be played up to with 4 friends  (recommend), but this can be exceeded with alliances. The game is also popular according to steam charts but the player base is much bigger as steam does not include all the players on xbox and who bought the game through the microsoft store. Dont let the price tag scare you too much as u will get your moneys worth and u dont need to spend anymore afterwards as most cosmetics are purchasable through the currency you earn. Micro-transactions are for the little extra such as pets, emotes and certain skin bundles.

-loads of content and progression
-in game events which lead to fat loot and possible PVP fights
-very fun ship combat, and land combat against AI and especially players
-Ship AI arent complete bots and are rewarding to defeat. They can spawn when you have lots of treasure on your ship leading to some intense sea dog fights
-No pay to win
-large amounts of customisation through unlockable skins
-constant game support through updates
-large open map to sail the seas
-boss fights with monster creatures
-the game provides a large range of game play opportunities
-great water physics with a fun graphics style

Sailing around and exploring the world is very rewarding. Sometimes just spending an hour sailing with no destination in mind is the exact kind of chill you need.

Single Player  Forget it.  They make the game miserable for single players

They should change the name to Sea of Chinese Hacks.

I am changing my review to  recommend this game.

48,71330527,english,"Game's really good, even at a $40 price point. I've followed it since well before it launched and while I'm a bit miffed at Microsoft's vice grip over releasing this game on Steam and still requiring this to go through the XBL service, the game itself is solid and Rare outdid themselves and any other company as far as ocean and boating mechanics go. 

The gameplay feels fluid and has a decent skill ceiling for sure. Getting a really talented and aware crew of friends together is extremely rewarding, and allows you to tackle anything the game can throw at you, sometimes simultaneously. 

What might throw people off is the pace of the game, and the gameplay loop itself. You are spending a lot of time (some might say downtime) sailing between locations. The islands themselves don't generally offer too much for you to do on them unless there is a Tall Tale (quest) or event at them. For the most part, you're engaging in general piracy and a lot of the fun comes from what you want to get out of it. For the play style my friends and I have which is a hyper-aggressive band of pirates that want to maximize the money we make, it is extremely fun and the most fun we have is when met with a similar crew that challenges us. For the more casual or friendly players, though, I could see how this would detract from their fun but you have to consider that you are playing a PvPvE open-world game about pirates, so...

Anyway, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it. You can sample it on the Xbox Store with their game pass for $1 for a month if I'm not mistaken. Plenty of time to see if it's your thing. For me personally, who loves open-ended sea content and was depressingly disappointed with sea content from games like Black Desert and Atlas, this is the one that scratches that itch for me. 

Do I wish there was more to it? Sure. But Rare does a great job at adding new content and keeping things fresh. I have some faith it will get even better in time as it has been since the game launched, but it's already more than good enough for me.",1593105514,1593105602,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079492657,148,11,614,0,165,1598771020

51,71329864,english,"Sea of Thieves is a very fun game. Forget everything you heard about it at launch, they have added so much content since then. Yes, it is yet another game that launched basically incomplete, but I'm glad they've have stuck with it and made all the content updates completely free. The price tag for this 2 year old game is quite high, especially when it didn't launch very great. But with all of the free content updates, it is worth the price.

If you're planning on playing this game solo, don't buy it. This game is amazing with friends, the fun you have is great, but alone you have to grind, and sometimes you'll get destroyed by a Galleon and all of your 3 hour grind is gone. 

There is quite a big gameplay loop. Go collect treasure, take it back to an outpost and sell it, repeat. But there are a lot of random events that make this loop not so boring. You'll have to fight off a Kraken from your loot, or blow up a Megalodon. Maybe you'll get jumped by a skeleton ship, or attacked by a group of players hungry for your loot. 

This brings me to the PvP in this game, it is simply amazing. It is by far my favourite part of the game. You can work out your own strategy for attacking player ships, and if you have a good group of friends to play with you, your ship should work like a well oiled machine. One man steering, 2 people to fix repairs and bail water while also manning the cannon, and one or 2 people to board the enemy ship and try to slow them down. The combat is completely skill based, as everyone has the same weapons. Only having a max of 5 bullets per gun is a great way to keep you on your feet in combat. 

Thank you for reading my essay for those who did. Overall this is a great game and I would recommend if you can get past the price and get a good group of friends to play.",1593104344,1593104344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198842837561,60,2,5433,0,3456,1596913070

Sea of Thieves is a gorgeous game with plenty of freedom; you can form a band with your friends all day long, sail the seas and hunt for treasures or monsters, do some story-based tall tales, invade a fort full of skeletons, or simply engage in PvP with other pirates. 

Sure, there may seem to be a lack of progression (since all the things you can buy are either quests for golds or cosmetics), but I think the game is not designed with a 'get-stronger-via-items' progression system in mind. It's a game meant to be played with friends or other people and have a fun couple of hours. The cosmetics are merely for a sense of achievement or connection with your character, but that's enough for me. 

With that system, people will not have to fear being owned by players who have better weapons or armor, and can instead focus on what matters: honing one's experience in sailing the seas and have fun.",1593054447,1593054447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198131863242,44,19,2841,0,1833,1599451135

It is designed for co-operative play, so if you don't have friends to play the game with or aren't interested in befriending randoms to join a crew, I would not suggest buying it.  The premise seems fun, but...  while there is a tutorial ""maiden voyage"" that teaches you the most basic of controls, you are pretty much thrown to the sharks beyond that.  The controls (mainly, the use of the radial to select different items/equipment) is a bit awkward and the graphics are so-so. From my experience, the SoT player community is not very welcoming to new players.  When you start a new adventure, you begin at a tavern on a random island within the game world.  Three times in a row, my ship was destroyed/sunk/under attack before I even got to it without even really knowing what was happening.  I got shouted and jeered at over the microphone by some kid yelling ""GG!  GG!"" before I was in the game for 3 minutes.  Maybe I just had bad luck and I'm soured at the experience, but as a mostly lone wolf player, my experience starting out in this game was disappointing.  Sadly, while I was tabbed trying to read up on some guides/tutorials to get a better handle of the game, I went over the 2 hour played mark and am unable to get a refund...

Ok I'm just going to blab some quick notes for you all.

If you can't handle the possibility of getting sunk and losing your treasure that you worked to get for an hour, this might not be the game for you. Because it does happen, and will happen to you at some point. But that's a part of the game and going in you should respect other players playing choices. Especially in game as malleable as Sea Of Thieves.

Getting sunk sucks but it's a part of the learning process and should help you understand what you did wrong, and what to do right the next time.

The devs are active and there are monthly updates, so you don't have to e-beg on the forums and discussion posts for updates :)

96,71260100,english,"Despite what many Youtube reviews may say, this game is actually fun. It's quite literally an open world sandbox true and true. There is no progression system to make yourself better, no pay to win items, no lootboxes, no battle pass, nothing. Every player is on the on the same playing field. Obviously some players will be better than others because of skill, friends, or even their ship (the bigger the ship, the more players and coordination you'll need to effectively win battles. An experience sloop captain can easily take on a galleon if they're geared up enough and know what they're doing). The only way to make yourself better is to actually play the game and scavenge for cannon balls, wood to repair the ship, food to heal, and treasure to sell for gold (which can only be used to buy quests, flags, and customization). 

The tutorial alone was enough to make me smile like an idiot and keep saying ""Oh that's so cool"" because this is the pirate game I wish I had when I was a child but never existed. From shanties, to adjusting the sails length and angle, this is just such an amazing pirate game to pick up but can take a while to master. There is some bad with the game like low frame rate when a lot of ships are in close proximity to each other, the aspect of nothing to do once you get your pirate and ship looking the way you want, the often emptiness of the seas, and the quests are just so bad that the side quests in a Bethesda game are more varied than this. It usually involves killing skeletons, digging up treasures, sailing to one point of the map to give someone something then sailing to another; they're just so tedious and repetitive that it often kills the mood when there's nothing to fight. In terms of fighting stuff, not a whole lot of variation. There's skeletons, skeleton ships, sharks, mermaid statues, a megalodon and a kraken. 

Overall, it's a very very fun game in short bursts and if you can get friends to play it with you, all the better as good times are always to be had when you're playing with people you can crack jokes with or coordinate with. 7/10, fun game but again, only in short bursts.

It was a bit hard to get into but was very well made and fun, Harpoons were added during the time I played and felt like they were a tad too strong when other ships were used to bully me. I stopped playing when I got frustrated with the game balance.

I started playing again a few weeks prior to Steam's release and fully into the launch, it feels and runs better on Steam in my experience. It's not a massive leap, but a one worth investing. The gameplay is the same still but a lot has changed since I played, there's lots of content to earn and always something to do.

The game has a toxicity problem like most online games, but there's a lot more friendly people than you'd expect for an open world PvP game. The biggest problems I face are constant server merges which can be very frustrating and often very poorly timed, leaping on you without warning and potentially ruining whatever it is you are doing. They need to give an advance warning so this shit doesn't sneak up on people. There's time limited events a lot with a ton of cosmetics you'll never earn again too, the most of which you won't have if you didn't play prior to Steam anyways.",1592974743,1592974743,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197979433295,185,31,10481,443,3571,1601417978

4,71256742,english,"i've been playing this game before it came out to steam and 
this is my honest opinion about this game

this game is FUN especially with friend or crew, the community is great
the map is huge and sailing from a point to another feels great
even though you go to far away distances there're many things you can find along the way and 
it feels great i wont bored you out. but..

The open crew is absolute garbage
my personal experience consists of crew with teammate who refuses to do anything
just standing there like a statue not even bother about the sail, an afk farmer, playing music for freaking 80 minutes of gameplay, or just an absolute newbie to the game.... well the last doesnt sound too bad right? yea until they dont know how to f....... repair and just sunk their own ship instead...

sometimes you get a great crew but most of the times you get this kind of people.
Just use closed crew or play with your friend.
and if you dont know already 
you can join the Discord server find a great teammate and helping others 
AFAIK there're 2 servers one Official SoT and the other Sea Of Thieves Community server
try your luck there

Rare please add a way to report player for abusing the voice chat, or for griefing.
there's one time when i was sailing with a sloop, a player joined and started to burn my ship he grab all the stuff that he can grab and just disconnect, the damage was not that bad but why... 

and most of people that i find online whether newbie or novice dont know that you can make an alliance with other ship
and just sunk it whenever thay can. well im not judging anyone for that but in my opinionn it just a waste of time and resources but well its your choice to make. 

that's all from me.

10,71254749,english,"Note:  I've been playing this game for awhile prior to the Steam release.  

This is a PVP game through and through and that makes it difficult to review.  As a PVP game it's horrible.  In Adventure there is [b]no match making based on skill or team size[/b] and the match doesn't start at the same time for everyone so you'll be short on supplies while a crew that can be four man crew who've played this for years will decimate you before you can even leave the island you started at.  There is also a pure PVP mode called Arena but no PVE based modes.  

The PVE content itself is great.  There's Tall Tales (Story Missions), Skeleton Fleets, Treasure Hunts, Skeleton Forts, fighting giant sea creatures, merchant quests, Ghost Fleets, and more.  All of these can only be done on PVP Servers and very often PVPers will wait for you to do the content then kill you to take it.  They can server hop and teleport between islands to quickly locate anyone doing PVE content in addition to most being already marked by giant visual indicators in the sky.  It's a normal thing to have 4-man PVP crews individually server-hop looking for someone trying to accomplish PVE content and then gather once they find someone to ambush them afterwards.  The PVP is horrible.  There's no avoiding things like crews spawning new ships to teleport ships.  They simply can and will teleport to islands in front of you to cut you off if they can't catch up.  That's considered a good strategy in the game.  You will be spawn camped and you will be sunk for no reason.  I don't understand how they added a fishing faction to the game when it's all PVP.  If you fish you will be sunk.  They recently added checkpoints to the story missions every 10 minutes or so which makes them possible to complete as previously sinking at any point during them caused required items to be lost.  You will often hear of groups camping turn in locations and experienced it myself on the first story mission.  With the addition of checkpoints though you can finally change servers which makes them possible.  The fact progress needs to be saved every 10 minutes or that changing servers is sometimes required to complete the first story mission puts an emphasis on just how PVP oriented the game is with PVE content including the story missions being secondary.

Now when you get sunk in PVP you lose all progress made to leveling the factions in the game which is usually an hour or two plus any story related items you may have had like totems.  You also can lose your emissary progress which can be a few hours worth.  Sinking also means you lose all supplies gathered and resets you back to nothing.

Losing all progress will be infuriating for non-PVP focused players as new players only receive low level quests with small rewards.  It doesn't matter if you have no treasure or barely any, you will be sunk first and they'll see what floats to the top.  The only way to progress through the ranks and unlock any worthwhile voyages are by doing several of the lower level ones.  A lot of the content and cosmetics are locked behind your faction ranks like ghost fleets and a completely new faction with its own missions and rewards.

It just isn't a good gameplay feeling when you set sail with your friends and end up sinking and losing 1-2 hours worth of progress but that is what the game is designed for.  It favors PVP through and through.  This strongly pushes players to play in a full group of 4 on their larger more inconvenient vessels so you'll always need to play with 3 friends and the ship size can't adjust on the fly as people come or go so you'll have to restart if you want to keep a ship that's fully staffed for it's size.  Another agreed upon fact with the community is that the Open Crew (Group Finder) in game is the absolute worst.  You cannot kick and there are no bans for trolls joining to throw treasure overboard and AFKers in this game, they must remain in your crew until they choose to leave.  It is highly recommended by the community that you use discord groups to find a crew and those Discord groups widely will require you to have already become a pirate legend (Level 50 in three factions) to join most crews.  It's a completely backwards system that the community doesn't mind.  You can't level up solo due to PVP putting a one man crew against a four man crew, you can't use open crew because it's downright toxic with no penalty for trolling, and you can't use discords groups as 95% of the crews on there are only looking for people with years of experience.

Fortunately you can get a peek at what the PVE of the game would be like sometimes when you end up on a nearly empty server and can play without the PVP.  It's then a fantastic and beautiful game that I'd highly recommend.    If they ever add a PVE mode I'd highly recommend it all around.  For now I'd say avoid it unless you want to PVP against others who've been playing since 2016.

Sea of Thieves is an absolutely amazing and to see the developers pick this game up from the empty void that it was first released as warms my heart so much. So much love has been put into this game and the tightly knit community shows just how attached they are to this game. If I was to add anything else to this game? More enemy types besides skeletons. However, the ship battles and NPC battles range from super easy to RIDICULOUSLY difficult and somehow each battle is always fun. If you are on edge about purchasing this game, find at least 1-2 friends to join you for the amazing memories that you will create while playing this game.

I've been told the devs do a patch every month and I was here for the ghost ship event launch; If other patches are like this it gives you an extra hour of something to do and then once again lurches into repetitiveness.

Some of the riddles are clever and I like the way they rhyme all the time. The Tall Tales missions started off feeling like I was about to go on an amazing adventure but it quickly turned to complete apathy when some of the riddles lead you to islands on the opposite side of the map or to the same island several times in the same tale.

There is no real way to progress in this game because people camp the outposts and wait for you to come with your loot and then take it all. Wouldn't be an issue if you could mass dump your loot to vendors but you cant. You need to spend 10 to 15 minutes going back and forth from your ship to the vendor taking each piece of loot one at a time. Not to mention the crossplay with xbox has people geared to the teeth on their ships going against players who just bought this game. All in all the game is beautiful and runs well on the PC but I would hardly call this game a fun experience. Its player base is nothing but ****S who lie, cheat, steal and take advantage of newer players. This game looks fun to play but after your third time in, where every time you play the game you cant progress because people roll up in full squads and just keep stealing your stuff, you will realize that you probably wasted your money and will never play this game seriously because its just not possible to have fun or make real progression on this game.

Oh also there is no official crouch button, you have to enter a physical emote in order to maintain any position relative to crouching.

Sea of Thieves is a great game to play full of adventure. You start with the same stats and gear that you will have at the end of the game. There a few exceptions which can give you better rewards (look up emissary flags). In the game, you start by doing voyages for the three trading companies which each gives you different voyage types.

The Gold Hoarders give you treasure hunting voyages where you get a map or a riddle and you have to find the island, they give you a picture of it or the name. Then you sail there and follow the instructions to dig up some treasure.

The Order of Souls gives you bounty voyages were you go to a specific island where you will find an enemy. You kill them and collect their skull.

The Merchants Alliance which gives you delivery voyages. The first type of voyage is were you get cages to catch animals on the islands and then deliver them back yo the Merchants Alliance. The second type is where you get crates to deliver to one of the NPCs in the world.

Completing these voyages will earn you gold and reputation with that trading company when you bring what you found back to the trading companies. Every 5 levels of reputation you can pay gold to get a promotion. Get enough promotions and you can get better voyages from the trading companies. After your third promotion, you can get an emissary flag but it costs 20000 gold so don't go crazy with the clothes shopping early in the game.

I have only played 16 hours so there is content that I am not familiar with yet such as attacking forts, the story missions and fighting sea monsters. However, I am familiar with running from monsters. There is also likely content I do not know about as I have not been to the far right of the map and have only used the emissary flags for the trading companies and I know there are more.

Tips for New Players:

Play with Friends
While you can play this by yourself it is far more fun to play it with at least one other person.

Raise a Flag
Putting a flag up allows you to see which way the wind is blowing so you can angle your sail the right way to get more speed.

Turn Off the Lights
Turn off all your lights on top of the ship, if you don't you will be extremely easy to spot at night and might have some other player coming after you.

Play Music to Snakes
If you are trying to catch a snake play music to it so it will go into a trance and not spit poison at you, this does not last long.

Keep Your Eyes Out
There are more than just monsters and other players on the sea. There are also ship shipwrecks and floating treasure as well as NPC ships. All of which can have something worth taking.

Gems
There are statues of mermaids with gems in them if you find one break it and take the gem, but be careful they damage you if you stand next to them. These gems can also be found on the ground and can be the most valuable thing you will find at least in the early game.

Multiple Voyages
If you have just finished collecting all the stuff you need for a voyage you can start another one if you want. Just be careful because if another player sees you they may decide to sink you to get your hard-earned treasure.",1591851829,1592905861,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198040726618,115,31,3115,0,965,1599886119
78,71215210,english,"I like the game a lot. When the games find you got stuck on a rock it sends you back to the ship. Don't need to restart or find a unstuck button or command. I like the constant danger of other other players chasing you down and stealing your stuff makes for some great interactions/stories. Fun to play  with friends.

There are a few complaints/ideas such as: 

Finding random sessions is kinda hard, you have trolls and toxic people. or people who leave mid session because we aren't doing the quest they want to do. I was fortunate enough to find a really fun crew on my first time playing match make.

I love the thought of making money. I hate that there really isn't anything useful in the game to spend the money on. Yep cosmetics are fun and everyone's favorite part of games but I wont improve with them. I would even be alright if somehow player bases/homes could be bought with the money.

Bounty system against players who sink and kill A LOT. emissary is cool n' all but what about the people don't have a emissary flag on? you got those players that sink just to sink not even to loot. Just a fun idea.

A safe zone actually sounds nice, there isn't one in the whole game and i think it would be nice to have one in the whole entire map where everyone on the server might be able to gather at.",1592904793,1592904793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198095721357,107,5,2418,0,1901,1599202002

81,71214271,english,"If you're looking into this game, as I did before purchasing, you're going to see a lot about toxicity, griefing, spawn camping, etc. I don't have many friends that game, and none that play this game, so I was looking to see if it was possible to play solo. It took me thirty seconds to know that this was a PVP centered game built around teamwork, and that solo would be difficult. It's a PVP sandbox pirate game and people are going to pirate you. And yet, for some reason, there are thousands of people that bought the game and are upset that when they sail up and wave they get shot in the face and their loot gets pirated. It defies logic or reason to be upset about that.

As for the game itself, everyone is on equal ground whether you are a day one player or be playing for years. There is no character progression or special weapons or abilities. Everyone fights with the same gear and same abilities. The only difference is experience in game. Progression is in the form of cosmetics bought with gold you earn from loot you collect. The voyages (quests) are basic but enjoyable. The loot is mostly worth little gold, so losses to other players aren't game breaking. If you get sunk you spawn someplace else with a brand new ship, not much penalty at all. The game is beautiful and plays well. Sailing is engaging with many aspects of ship management.

If you want to sail around looking for buried treasure or killing pirate captain skeletons with a bounty on their head all while having the excitement of another player ship coming along and sinking you for your loot, buy the game. If only having the choice of running or fighting every time you see another player bothers you, or getting killed and having your loot stolen causes you to lose your mind and run to forums raging about how unjust the world is, you should probably save yourself the stress and move on to a PVE game. It's a PVP pirate game. Trust no one. No mercy.",1592902971,1592902971,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197965268390,121,3,17367,0,6011,1598752779

As I'am writing this review I only have 12 hrs. of gameplay but I have seen all this game has to offer ,the game gives you only 3 guns and ships that are not upgradable (bec. the game economy is just doing quests and events then sell the loot for gold and use gold in buying skins only )  this mechanic is the greatest threat to this game bec. after buying all cosmetics and  doing all loot quest players starts to hunt other players  which destroy the game for new comers and split the community between those who wants to see a pvpve vs pve which is kinda sad since this a pirate game (WTF those guys expected from a game called sea of thieves  ?)

My issue, and why I wont recommend it, is that you can have an enemy crew literally camp on your ship, shooting you every time you respawn, bailing water out of it so it wont sink, making it literally unplayable.

- You literally have to do everything yourself. Lift the anchor, set the sails, direct the sails to the best wind. Go down below deck, check your map to make sure you're going the right way, while leaving the wheel, so be fast when you check.
- Dont even think about a ship battle. That means leaving the wheel to load, fire and re load the cannons. Then quickly run back to the wheel to correct then repeat.
- The travel times for everything is sooo long and boring
I could only handle an hour of this game. It drove me half nuts. I play a game to relax and have fun. This felt like work with all the things I had to do just to move the ship.
Play Assassins Creed Black Flag. They had it perfect on how you should be able to sail.

28,71197368,english,"Saw this forever ago in beta and I thought the PVP looked interesting but I was afraid it would be a lot of downtime and very little action.  Gameplay videos do *not* do this game justice.  Highlight reels seem unrealistic and straight up 'lets-plays' creates a sense of feast-or-famine of the fun of the game.  Only watching the gameplay does not provide the sense of  immersion and tension.  A 10 minute video isn't interesting, but neither is reading a book in 10 minutes.  This is for longer sessions and the allure of new opportunities can draw you in for longer and longer sessions, much like an epic Civilization campaign. Arena mode exists for shorter gameplay and helps scratch the PVP itch without any other distractions.

There is so much to do at any given point.  Derailing from your original objective is half the fun as random encounters, shipwrecked loot, and various opportunities arise.  Between a pvp-only arena and a free-roam adventure mode which contains guild quests, tall tale story quests, random encounters, and pvp opportunities, this is a game with enough variety to keep you busy for hours on end.  

The gameplay itself feels very rewarding.  Managing sail length, angle, choosing when to drop anchor or harpoon landmasses for quick turns, knowing when to show your broadside for cannon attacks, aiming your cannons to hit different targets, boarding enemy ships with a variety of goals (kill crew to prevent repairs, drop the enemy anchor to enable easier cannon shots from your crew, set it on fire to distract them and discourage usage of blazing cannons, or just steal their loot sneakily) you get a rewarding sense of variety in 'doing the same thing' but with small but important adjustments.  Storms with lightning, rain filling your ship, your wheel spinning wildly like a drunken sailor, sea monsters, and skeleton AI ships raise the steaks of even the most simple of tasks.

After a good long session of gameplay. typically you can walk away with an epic story of how you snuck aboard and sunk a PVP-guild ship only to have them sneak and set ablaze your own ship, regain control, chase a different smaller ship, escape a megladon during your chase, and have random AI skeleton ships sink the both of you as a third human ship also enters the fray and attempts to capitalize on the opportunity of your distractions.  Even defeating a kraken for the first time is a rewarding feeling worthy of sharing with your friends.  New content was published as recently as this week, adding a ghost ship fleet encounter to the game.  The micro-transactions are totally optional, and likely help fund the new content and encounters added.  Nearly everything you grind for is cosmetic, making near end-game content feel approachable, rather than gated behind the necessity for 'better guns'.  There is the need for ranking up to acquire certain missions, but there is enough in the game to keep you busy and happy as you learn the mechanics and glow wide-eyed and excited as you experience everything for the first time.  Rushing to the end would feel like a mistake and cheapen the experience of fearing of a simple shark in open waters as you desperately swim back to your ship.",1592866042,1592866042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004627715,83,2,7836,0,2850,1599894527

48,71188939,english,"From what I've seen before I was counting on a nice exploration game to play with friends...

and on the days it works this game is amazing, having fun with your friends, solving riddles and looking for trasure is awesome. But most of the time what you'll actually experience is a team of shitty purist pvp players that chase you down for 2 and a half hours (not joking) and not let you experience anything else. Keep in mind that trying to dig up treasure or do anything else while someone is chasing you is a suicide wish. There are no safe zones in the game so you can be shot down even if you just respawned at a new outpost.

Sea battles are just tiring and boring, as taking down a ship requires like 200 cannon balls alone unless the other team is not fixing their ship. So combat boils down to who wastes all of their cannonballs first. And yes that can take up to 2-3 hours. Most of those crews aren't even going after your loot, they're there just to sink ships for absolutely no reason, even though there's an arena mode that's specifically design to battle other ships they choose default mode for their pvp bs. I guess it's easier to bother someone that would prefer to explore and they don't like fighting against other crews that actually want to fight.

Awful treasure hunting game. Only buy if you're looking forward to firing 200 shots at the same ship for 2 hours and not have them ever let go.",1592851694,1592851694,False,46,36,0.492756307125091553,5,True,False,False,76561198035407907,301,6,2311,0,1712,1593542757

Although the gameplay is kinda relaxing and fun with friends, when playing solo it becomes boring and repetitive.
Encountering cheaters in this game (which is not that often) is a huge turn-off
You see cheaters, try to find a report button, but there is none. You hope the anti-cheat to ban them, you go to google, try to find which Anti-cheat it uses and find NONE. there is no anti-cheat except windows 10 TruePlay feature(which as I assume is not yet implemented), All cheaters are searched almost manually by using logs, and most are banned for using speedhack or something as suspicious as that. So, If you are here for fun with friends, you're welcome, and it will be fun, until you encounter cheaters after 4 hours of straight grinding quests and they sink you and your loot almost immediatly.

This game can only be played with friends, there is no catering or extension for solo players. Like many others, I don't have a friend or a few friends to play this game with anytime I want, which means I roll solo quite often.

Whenever you play solo, the voyages you play spawn a skeleton crew that will destroy your ship, ruining any progress you made as well as resetting your emissary flag. The last four sessions that I tried to play solo, I got my emissary flag to Grade III (1.5x loot), and every single one of those four times, once I left the island, a skeleton crew spawned right next to me.

Unfortunately, skeleton crews are not limited like you and your crew. Though they spawn with an identical ship, they fire their cannons so fast you cannot bucket the water out and make repairs fast enough. This means that anytime you start to make progress, a skeleton crew spawns and sinks your ship.

I'm tired of wasting my time on this game, and it's ridiculous that you CANNOT play solo.

99,71162097,english,"I had heard of Sea of Thieves for a while now, but only now got it on Steam because a bunch of my friends had it and wanted to play it together. At first glance, it looked like Ship Sailing Simulator; grab a bunch of people, steer a boat from island to island, ???, profit. However, this was not the case. 

Sea of Thieves is, at its core, a PIRATE simulator. That means that whatever you do, it can and will likely be stolen from you by cackling players one ship over, potentially for no other reason besides they wanted something easy to hunt. 

This, of course, frustrated me immensely. How dare they steal my hard earned loot? How dare they just come over and ruin my day for no good reason? And I almost said I hated the game. I almost put it in the pile of ""I guess I'll play this sometimes"" games. But then I started to realize the most important thing, which I cannot emphasize enough:

This is PIRATE SIMULATOR. 

Once you wrap your head around that fact, the game becomes immediately ten times better. You stop fearing your loot will be stolen and instead prepare for it. You stop running from other crews, instead loading the cannons and preparing for combat if they dare fire first. You start to learn when to fire and when to hold, allowing the default sloop with a panicked captain sail by while sending the Reaper that chased you for five islands straight right to the bottom of the sea.  

If you're interested in this game, I suggest making sure you know how to lose with grace, as you will lose quite a bit. Remember, this is PvPvE, meaning that both the environment AND other players will be able to attack and kill you. If you're only here for the PvE, I still suggest brushing up on your PvP skills, since you can't turn that off. And remember. This is Pirate Simulator, not Ship Sailing Simulator. Plundering loot from others is a valid strategy, and naval combat is an essential part of the game. 

TL:DR, Good game for sailing with friends, just remember that other players exist and your loot would look good on their ship.",1592806101,1592806101,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084583670,168,3,11099,0,5696,1600405681

Sea enemies are sharks, very large ""fish"" creatures ( as big as a small boat) and Krakens, Kraken, Kraki?... Gigantic ass monster. There are enemy skeleton ships that will surface from out of the water and start attacking you. Very ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" like.

So far it does not look like there are any RPG aspects like leveling up and skill points. Actually there aren't even weapon upgrades that I can tell. Only cosmetic weapon skins. This game is by no means boring but it would be much more fun with an RPG element or two. You can, however, level up the quests that you can purchase from quest vendors that reward much more loot as you progress.

The PvP has not been an issue. Most people I have met were very helpful although you come across the occasional KoS player(s). Even if players don't attack its exciting knowing there are no rules when you spot another ship.

Never before has cooperation in the world of shipping been so affordable, encouraging to play with other s and did not arouse such a feeling of traveling into the unknown. Adventures with a group of friends effectively obscure the only and also the key minus of the game: after A few hours we learn all the available content.

All gameplay elements assume team work. Any object held in your hand can serve both us and your companion - it is something beautiful. We can show the pocket compass to the person standing in front of us, just like the treasure map, and we can raise the olive lamp at any time to illuminate a larger area of ​​the cave explored with the group. These are just a handful of examples showing how in detail the use of various items has been developed - which, in total, are not too many.

During the game, various suggestions come to mind regularly. For example, we would like to collect decorations during island exploration and decorate the cabin with them. It would be nice if the mysterious paintings in the caves were associated with something, and during the fight we could use additional types of bullets - even karters and chains. Virtually every aspect of Sea of ​​Thieves is asking for expansion. Developing the potential of this game can result in something really wonderful.

Sea of ​​Thieves is a great and unique game for fans of collaboration.

It's great fun when you play with others but I would not recommend getting this game if you plan on playing solo unless it is on sale. There is no difficulty scaling in the game so you can easily come across the random events where skeleton galleons can spawn right next to you at any time. Less than 25 hours in the game and I've had these events occur 4 times. 

Also quests rewards are random. I did a quest where I had to go to a small island and kill 4 skeletons who couldn't die at night, then 4 skeletons who were immune to melee, then a boss that couldnt die at night along with 4 skeletons who couldn't die at night. Annnnd then I had to do all that again but they couldn't die during the day. Annnndd then I only earned 900 coins and it took me 30 minutes to do. Bare in mind bosses usually drop a skull worth 1000 coins and a map to a chest.

I would enjoy this game more if there was actually something to do in it because all you do is collect coins to buy cosmetics and if you want do some raids or kill the kraken to get more cosmetics.

In Sea of Trolls, the veteran players have become disenchanted with pursuing the in-game content since it is repetitive and lackluster.  However, preying on each other and newer players never becomes boring. In their defense, yes, this is intended to be a large part of this PVP-only game.  Newer players who have not played through the content and wish to pursue the quests that the programmers have developed find that they cannot since they are constantly being raided by the other players.

I have played about 8 hrs, 1 hour of this was solving a riddle and finding buried treasure on an island for a quest.  Before I was done, a larger ship of players landed next to mine and stole my ship and all the treasure with it.  This was not the first time I was attacked.  The first time was after I first joined the game and finished the tutorial.  Someone saw our ship and immediately brought a gunpowder barrel onto our ship to blow it up and sink it...it worked.  Thankfully we had not just returned from an hour or two of questing with a full ship to unload to have someone blow it up before we could unload it.

36,71100654,english,"If the time played carried over from my Microsoft account the same way achievements did, you'd see at least 500 more hours logged on this game than you do right now.  This game is an absolutely incredible experience: a story with a different retelling each time you play it.  A significant part of the reason I bought it on Steam is because I admire what Rare's created with this and want to continue supporting them from the platform I love.  It's followed a similar progression to No Man's Sky: a very rough start with very little content, with a dedicated, faithful development team that has tended to the title like a garden.  They spent the last 2+ years growing existing mechanics and regularly adding content.  It has since evolved into something almost unrecognizable from its original state, and I mean that as praise, wholeheartedly.

Whereas other FPS' maintain a consistent fast-paced environment, SoT's pacing shifts between slow and fast.  What starts out as a low-speed chase against the wind for a treasure-laden galleon can turn into a high-stakes hand-to-hand battle with swords, guns and cannonfire, all in a matter of seconds.  Tight, cohesive teamwork is a must, and playing solo is one of the hardest things to do.  That doesn't mean you're forced to eat-or-be-eaten in endless PVP; you can dig up some worms and go fishing, or embark on one of a handful of many different kinds of PVE quests.

Whereas other open world games are focused on constantly building up and fortifying in a persistent environment, SoT instead levels the proverbial playing field.  All ships are more or less the same, your only advantages against other crews are how many supplies you brought to that fight and how much skill you and your team have amongst you.  A skilled duo in a sloop can easily overpower a galleon crew twice their size.

On a less-important note: the water is rendered beautifully and marveling at it NEVER gets old.

ALL GUSHING ASIDE
- There is a STEEP learning curve, and as far as playerbase goes you will usually run into newbies or skilled players with not much in-between.
- You WILL run into dicks in this game.  It's called Sea of Thieves, after all.
- This game also has a habit of bringing out some of the more unpleasant parts of your own personality, for the same reason as above.

49,71097531,english,"I've really tried to give this game a fair go. It takes quite some time to figure out some of the mechanics, how -to sail your ship and so on- before you can really get your teeth into the content so I think probably the first 10 hours are simply finding your feet, but it's a good learning process which is simple to learn but hard to master, the Holy Grail.

Once you get the hang of things though, it could be magnificent game. There are messages in bottles, treasure maps, fights with Skeleton Pirate ships, clever merchant Cargo Runs with some really interesting mechanics to make sure you take care. Delivering silk that's been in the sea will reduce the reward for example. There's lots of random islands to simply stop at and rummage through. The sea looks magnificent and the physics of the ships and the changing weather is absolutely beautiful, crystal blue waters with brilliant sunlight gradually overcloud and transform into storm swept seas with huge rolling waves and darkling clouds. Very good stuff.

The crew mechanics are good, and it is definitely a multiplayer game, although you can sail the smallest ship solo and progress quite quickly.

So, considering this is all quite good - why the negative review?

the game in its current state is a Toxic Players Paradise. By making it PvEvP it sets up griefers perfectly to systematically demolish your session. Here's my experience of the PvPvE environment so far;

Complete a raid on a Skeleton Fortress Island, having spent 20 mins sailing there and 30 mins surviving the waves of enemies only for someone to rock up in their ship, sink your stationary ship for no reason, kill you with cannon fire while you're on the beach and then take all the loot you've earned. CHECK

Get followed by a ship while we fight a Skeleton Galleon, waiting for us to defeat it before killing us and taking the Galleon loot? CHECK

Get fire bombed in dock over and over and over again until we have to restart in another server? CHECK

People attempting to form an alliance only to blow the snot out of you for kicks? CHECK

So, the ONE thing that would make me give a glowing review to this game would be a PvE only server. I suspect it'd be full of players who want to cruise around, fighting skeleton ships, killing the Kraken, following clues to buried treasure, and simply cruising the high seas as they're rendered SO WELL. Sailing about really is a fantastic thing to do in this game and when no one comes and gives you a good fisting the game is great.

If you like having serious anger issues and blood pressure problems because the game is designed to reward the worst, most vile, toxic and nasty tactics and don't mind wasting time for someone else to get the reward, spend your money. I mean it, you'll be bloody livid when it happens to you - and it will. I have yet to experience in nearly 40 hours of gameplay a positive experience with another crew.

IF you prefer to have at least some restrictions on the people who get the reward from completing an event or raid (so you can at least be rewarded for you time if nothing else), keep your cash until PvE only servers come along  -or more importantly- go and spend it on something else.",1592690702,1592690702,False,7,4,0.489759594202041626,0,True,False,False,76561197982590161,126,4,3218,0,2336,1599217352

53,71096709,english,"The reviews on this game are pretty spot on. I bought this on a whim and a risk because... I love pirates. I wasn't at all sure if I'd like it or enjoy it, but honestly it's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played, and one of the best MMo's I've played. Not to mention the game itself, from the graphics to the ambiance, is absolutely gorgeous.
You'll be signing into a world as a new pirate. But that doesn't set you apart from anyone else. The only difference between you and another is experience as a player and a variety of pirate-y cosmetics which aren't at all hard to get once you get started. There is a leveling system in the game, but that doesn't make you any more or less 'stronger' than another player. It's there to show your progress within the game.
While the main progression of the game is PVE based, PVP can and *WILL* happen. But if you don't like PVP,  I wouldn't worry much. It's simple to feel like the players in this game are just a part of the game itself, as PVE. Just smarter. Because you're playing as a pirate, it's only fitting there will be other pirates out there doing what you're doing. It does add a level of caution to your time in the game, but it's a natural danger that befits being a pirate, and it makes everything you achieve feel like a huge accomplishment which is absolutely satisfying. 
Sometimes people get upset and have mean things to say but it's possible to turn off your communication if you want to avoid toxic butthurt pirates shouting rude things your way. And sometimes you'll have pirates who want to form an alliance or help you out, or need help themselves. 
In the end, this game is a game about getting together with a few friends, working together, and coming out of it with a good story at the end of the day. It's a survival open world cooperative experience that will never leave you without anything to do. With your friends, you'll be talking about your adventures together, having a bunch of laughs, victories, and failures. You'll be solving riddles together, finding treasure, fighting pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters. You can play instruments to pass the time on long voyages, drink some grogg, or fish up a hearty meal for you and your best mates!

It would have been such a great opportunity for roleplaying, getting captured by other pirates, sail with them for a while, etc.. but no. Our experience was that is it simply stupid PvP and you can not enjoy your time on the seas. This is tiresome, there should be some restriction to PvP, at least around the outposts to not have you ship bombarded and sunk while you are off on land selling a chest. Where is the equivalent to the british navy or at least some guards in town?

Furthermore, the only reason for collecting gold (beside having fun with freinds pretending that you are pirates) is that you can buy cosmetics - this is a flaw, there should not be some overpowered equipment but at least a little better sword, a little faster loading pistol or at least improvements to the ship itself.

If you're too shy on the other hand, it might take you a little longer to learn how to do everything efficiently while being solo on a sloop but the learning process will still be there and you will eventually be able to sail to your heart's content. Just watch out for any shallow waters... Totally haven't hit shallow water too many a time myself.

- People who have been playing this for years wont have an advantage over new characters
- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic
- Graphic are wonderful
- Ship combat is intuitive

Cons: 
- Playing solo gives you a distinct disadvantage
- Loading screens are horribly long
- Sails block helms view heavily
- Brig

Sea of Thieves is an MMO you can play solo, but you shouldn't and you will be at a distinct disadvantage if you do. Best to play with a friend or to chose the random party option where the game fills up the crew for you. This obviously has some risks for the jerks out there who will abuse the weird brig function, but most players I’ve encountered are friendly and it seems like it has a good community.

There are not real character levels in the game, so a newbie has the same advantages as someone who has been playing since launch. Ships can go on quests for gold and standing in the game factions. Becoming higher in the faction opens up new quests and gear. All gear, whether with real money or the in game currency, is purely cosmetic. 

Ship combat is the meat of this game. The bigger the ship, the more cannons and speed you will have, but the harder it is to maneuver and the bigger target you are. There are two modes of games: Adventure and Arena. Arena pits a bunch of ships against each other in competition for who can earn the most points.

Then we get a ritual skull, and boy o boy does the story take some wild turns.

We proceed to do some research into what the ritual skull does, and this leads us on a wild chase to gather the items needed for the ritual (don't want to spoil the mystery for those of you who haven't done it). This even involves having to hunt down another player and ASK them to kill us for once.
They were sus, but like it worked out.

Finally we get to the place where you do the ritual, and waves upon waves of enemies spawn. Partway through the initial waves, I spy a brigantine on the horizon that I try to keep an eye on. I go back to fighting, and I then check on that brigantine like a minute later.

They are right on top of our boat.

I freak out and go running to our boat to try to defend it while my friends fight the waves of enemies, when lo and behold the brigantine starts yelling ""Friendly!"" at us! We quickly form an alliance and proceed to fight as a team of 6 for what felt like an eternity against this boss, and we eventually win. We decide to split the loot down the middle, and then we spied sloops on the horizon waiting to plunder our ships once we set sail with the goods. Thus starts another adventure of our two boats coordinating via shouting and light signals as we maneuver around other players and NPCs attempting to take us down on our way to an outpost. We manage to sail our happy little random alliance to an outpost and made off with 60k in loot. This whole encounter even spawned a discord server so we can invite those players to future outings! 

10/10 would pirate again


Original Review: For anyone who says that this is impossible to play solo... I beg to differ. Likewise, it might show only a few hours on Steam, but I have played this a lot more on the Microsoft store. While it is extremely fun to play with your friends as a group, soloing is it's own unique and fun experience. You can easily take on full groups of players in your sloop if you know what you are doing, and it's very easy to avoid players if you don't want to deal with PvP. I recommend looking up guides and watching streamers if you aren't getting the hang of it. Overall, this has been one of the most fun games that I have had the pleasure of playing! :)",1592498848,1592637776,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198008640133,231,12,3465,0,325,1594526596

17,71015680,english,"INTRODUCTION

The idea behind Sea of Thieves is simple. Get a ship, sail the seas, collect treasures along the way, sell them to make money, rinse, repeat. On paper, it sounds a bit too simple to be of any meaningful fun for the veteran gamer. Do not be fooled by this façade though. What makes the game so special though is that the player has complete agency over how to accomplish their goals. Will you be honorable and find treasures through exploration and teamwork with your crew and others? Or will you sit back and let other crews do the work for you before relieving them of their hard-fought booty through brute force?

GAMEPLAY BASICS

In Sea of Thieves you take command of one of three ship types. The Sloop, Brigantine, or Galleon. Each ship is designed for a certain number of crew members (2,3, and 4 respectively) and each have their own specific strengths and weaknesses to consider. For example, while the Galleon has by far the superior firepower of the three ship types, it suffers from reduced maneuverability, significantly reduced speed against the wind, and requires a hefty crew to properly operate. Whereas the Sloop requires half the crew and can turn on a dime (comparatively) while easily outrunning the other two ships against the wind. It will however lose in a standard broadside battle against the larger ships. The brigantine sits somewhere in the middle of the other two.
Using one of these vessels you and your crew (or you alone) will set sail on the high seas as you follow maps that lead to buried treasure, kill the undead skeletons of crews long forgotten for their valuable skulls, sink ships (both player and NPC) for the treasure store on board, along with a whole slew of other things that I will not spoil here.


CREW NUMBERS

If you payed attention to the crew numbers mentioned for each ship in the above section, you may notice that never did I mention a ship requiring a single crewmember. That is because, as you may have surmised at this point, the game is not explicitly designed to be played alone. Before continuing, allow me to quell any fears and say that the game is most certainly playable solo; however, the experience when doing so is far from ideal. If you decide to purchase Sea of Thieves, you should ask yourself whether you have at least one other person who will want to play regularly with you. If not, do not fret! There are many things you can accomplish on your own. Just keep in mind that some tasks will be a much tougher challenge. I should also mention the game has a community wonderfully welcoming of newcomers and, being as such, you should head over to the official Discord server and ask to join other people’s crews. 
With that out of the way, let us suppose you DO have a friend who will play regularly with you but you are worried you’ll be missing out by not getting to sail on one of the larger ships. Once again, do not worry. You do not need to sail on a brigantine or a galleon to have a great experience. Some of the best, most memorable experiences I personally have had in this game were with only one other friend on a sloop.


PROGRESSION

Probably the biggest thing that sets Sea of Thieves apart from most games is that the game utilizes a “horizontal” progression system. This means that you end up as strong as you start off. As in, you will never grow “stronger”. There is no traditional leveling system. There are no weapon upgrades.  Your ship never increases in defensive or offensive capability. The only “upgrades” you get are purely cosmetic in nature and only serve to distinguish yourself among other players.
To be perfectly honest, I was incredibly skeptical before purchasing the game because of this. I pondered, “How can a game hold my attention if there isn’t any way to track progress or improve? What am I accomplishing?”; however, I took the dive and what I found was a much more interesting and complex model of a progression system hidden within. Due to the lack of the conventional systems of leveling or gear upgrades, player progression takes place entirely organically. This means that while your character may not improve in any way, what does improve are your personal skills and game knowledge. For example, when you start the game there is an exceedingly good chance you will get slaughtered in your first few ship-to-ship PVP/PVE encounters. You can expect to miss almost every (if not every) cannonball you fire that is not at point-blank range. However, as time goes on and you practice, you will become much more accomplished in your abilities. So much so that before long you will have few qualms about that fully manned, decked out galleon approaching your two-man sloop rapidly from behind.


PVP & PLAYER INTERACTION

PVP and player interaction is, without a doubt, where the game shines most luminously. Every experience with another player-controlled vessel is different but intense. Perhaps you are minding your own business collecting treasure when another ship comes a little to close for comfort leading to a standoff or prolonged altercation. Perhaps, you know another ship is laden with treasure that is just ripe for the taking if you can manage to sink them. Or maybe combat is not your cup of tea at all and you would rather just sneak aboard a moored enemy vessel and load up a rowboat full of treasure before skulking away, leaving the enemy crew completely dumbfounded when they return to their vessel to find all of their trophies missing.
Some experiences are friendly, some hostile. Some are epic, some are mundane. This uncertainty is something that most other games never have you experience as in most multiplayer games the only options are that the other player in front of you is either a friend or foe rather than both at the same time.


CONCLUSION

Sea of Thieves is a wonderful game and I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who like adventure, the sea, and interacting with others. The gameplay loop is unconventional in many ways; yet, this does not make it uninteresting. It keeps you guessing and before long you will have a book of epic seafaring tales to tell others. 
Before purchasing though, I recommend trying to convince at least one other friend to take the dive with you or at the very least you should join the SOT Discord community.

Anyways, the lack of progression in this game is somewhat of its downfall but it’s also one of the reason I love it so much. You are urged on to improve your own skills rather then relying on your equipment meaning that if you have good planning and a fast mind you can get out of bad situations relatively quickly. It also means that you will not be destroyed by the pro players when you first enter the game. It is still very playable without friends if you are lonely like me. Most people are pretty friendly but i suggest you settling down with a few  crew mates rather then jumping around from crew to crew since that will be exhausting to comprehend each play style.

38,71010915,english,"Game is pretty good. 
Definitely a Sand Box experience that can feel a little bit empty at times. 
I would still rate this game in an overall positive manner.
A major pro is that it's easy to just kind of fire up and see where the wind (literally) takes you.
What you have at the beginning is what you'll have at the end as far as mechanics go.
There are literally 4 weapons in the game, 5 if you count cannons.
All upgrades that you can ever purchase are strictly aesthetic.
Lots of fun random things to do.

A major con I have is that there is quite a lot focus on the real money shop
You cant earn the pets, which are pretty neat, unless you have ancient coins (Which are more or less only available through real money unless you manage to kill some ancient skeletons.)
I'd be more accepting of the real money shop if the game's price point was a bit lower than 40 bucks.
I find the real money shop to be easier to accept than other games because Rare does seem to do updates on a monthly basis and the game seems to be a consistent work in progress. 

OVERALL: I would recommend this game, it is a lot of fun and looks quite nice!

PS - Be sure to bring a friend along for your adventure, this game is not very enjoyable as a solo experience.

60,70547672,english,"Holy shiiiiiiiiieeeettt this game is nice.

I was skeptical at first.

I bought the game.

I joined, did the tutorial, found all the secrets from tutorial (there are plenty!!!).

First outpost I spawn, I take quests, search for loot, my boat gets raided, even if its empty.

I stay at the outpost for 30-40 minutes, My boat gets raided 3-4 times in the process.

After 40 minutes, I go to the boat, and inside, there are chests, treasures, and some random dude talking.

Apparently somebody saw I was getting owned and decided to ""protect"" me for my first gameplay. They gave me treasures, helped me do quests and all for the price of an Uber (get them to a location). They were AWESOME, FUNNY and HELPFUL as hell. Best pirate experience with them.

After I dropped them off there, I did several quests, I ran from other players as they were chasing me, I managed to DEFEAT another ship in a 1v2 situation, stole their loot, ran away, sold it, it was epic.

All this in 4 freaking hours!

Even if the quests are some kind of repetitive, the PvP element is awesome!.

I don't regret any money spent on it, too bad I don't have any friends playing this masterpiece.

Positive review, as I haven't had bugs or unpleasant gameplay. 


PS: Great optimization also, 2080S + 4790K, 1440p, Mythical graphics (max), 100 fps. Amazing!


Part 2 (10 hr gameplay): 

So I played again, 2nd gameplay, I finished first 3 Tales and it was a ""good"" gameplay.

This time I haven't seen a single friendly person. I've been attacked and raided about 6-7 times, sometimes by solo, sometimes by gang of 3-4. But I adapted quickly.

At first I went to cash in my voyages and treasures ( i had 3 chests with 9 skulls, 3 chests with 9 gold items, a crying chest and 2 regular treasure chests, all from farming/voyage). I went to an outpost, I did a 360 to make sure there's nobody there, then docked the sloop. When I went with the first chest of 3 skulls, there was a dude hiding in a bush next to the Bones tent, he jumped out, gave me a heart attack, then took a shot at me. He missed the shot, I dropped the chest and I went full ape on him, killing him. Then I ran to drop all my treasures, cause since he didn't have a boat, meant his team mates are circling around. On that run I felt like mom's spaghetti, palms were much sweatyyy... 

Amazingly, I managed to cash in ALL my treasures, and THEN, the bad guys were aready at my ship. I saw them trying to ram it in the rocks. I throw 2-3 blast bombs and they drop in water, then I shoot them down with the pistol. Managed to get back in my ship, repair it , and went full speed into their big ship, while they were respawning. I didn't stay to repair mine, I just shot their ship down, then ran away.

Then I got killed and ship sank about 4 times, twice from crew of 4 , once from a duo on a sloop, they put a barrel on my ship and sank it down, while I was doing a quest ... and once from the freaking kraken, right AFTER I FINISHED A TALE...  Lost a lot of treasures including the Tale treasure, but....

While trying not to ragequit, I saw a crew of 4 again, probably same guys, they were fighting a skeleton ship. I got close and managed to spot 2 of the 4 guys, confirming it was the crew that gangbanged me (i think ^_^ ) . I went to them, flanked them and placed them between me and the skull ship. Shot them 3-4 times, then with a singing/dancing cannonball and a fire cannonball, and their ship started to sink and burn. I saw them jumping in the water. I went there to see if they ""need"" help and just finished the job, shooting them in the water. Then I took ALL their treasures, which compensated a lot over my loss, and went to a safe outpost.

That feeling was the best. Yes, I lost some battles, but also won a few. First gameplay, 4 hours, 2nd gameplay, 10 hours straight. The PVP element is priceless in this game, otherwise it would've become boring. 

And I just found out about sunken ships, mermaids skeleton lords and kraken :)) 

New challenges ahead !!!

Edit 3: 18-June-2020

I think I had enough of this game. While there are 3-4 random people/ships that are friendly, most of the players I've encountered in the last days are simply apes. 

I see medium ship with 3 people, I run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasure, sail away, they chase me for 10 minutes, until I stopped to see what they want. They simply killed me on sight.

I see sloop with 2 people chasing me, my ship is empty, I tell them ship is empty, and that I'm going on a Tale, they simply sank my ship.

Finally, I have +10 skulls, 9 gems, 10 treasure chests. I see galeon with 4 people, I avoid it, I run to outpost and manage to sell everything.
Then I go on a tale, they simply start chasing me. I tell them I am solo, ship is empty, they start firing at me. I do a handbrake 180'Turn, run against the wind, somehow they catch me sideways (AGAINST THE WIND, they say sloop is fastest against wind). They hit me with hook, take me away from my ship, in the middle of the ocean. I respawn, they are in my ship, burning it down.
All 4 of them were like ""SORRY MAN, WE THOUGHT YOU HAD LOOT, SORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIP, SORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES"".
4v1, 2 of them were LEGENDS, I am a fucking bamby learning the game, two of them have +500 hours in game.

This is fucking pathetic. Instead of going to fight the 3-crew ship, they chose to chase a 1-crew Sloop with no fucking loot.

In the last 2 days I haven't seen a single friendly dude. Everybody tried to shoot/sink my ship.

At some point, I get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers... for ganging up a fking solo.

I tend to Change my review to No, since there's no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3-4 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty ship.

PS: Even with apes chasing me on the sea, in solo mode, I managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apes.",1591725879,1592525780,True,673,122,0.94566798210144043,45,True,False,False,76561198021328396,273,54,1292,0,209,1594320107

I have played somewhere around 2000-2500 hours previous to the steam launch, and for the most part I have enjoyed every hour.  Its by far the best co-op PVE and PVP game I have ever played. (And I have played a ton of games). The artwork is unique and fun, the ""story"" (Tall Tales) are exiting, and its overall an extremely fun game to play with friends. I really like how every time you encounter another pirate on the sea nobody is at a disadvantage, because everyone has the same level of health, ammo, etc. Very good mechanic in my opinion.

77,70997437,english,"Great game. The adventures are so in depth and the graphics are beautiful. I got it the day it came out on steam and I had so much fun with it. Personally, I love the game, but beware, this game is not a primary story mode game.  If you are used to games with a guided story mode as the main objective, this game might not be for you. While there is a story mode and other missions, it is not the main goal of the game. The games real purpose is to have fun exploring the map and go on adventures to increase your reputation with different factions. The story mode adventures, or Tall Tales, can be found across the map and are voted on by crew members to start. the main mission, Shores of Gold, is very fun. While I am only on chapter two of it, it is exciting and hard to stop playing. The reason I say that the Tall Tales are not the main part of the game is because in my opinion, I enjoy exploring and trading and the Tall Tales seem to be only a small fraction of what there is to the game. Like I said, this is my opinion, and someone else might disagree which is fine, as there is so much to do in the game. Additionally, instead of exploring the sea of thieves, you may also play arena, in which five teams fight it out over 15 minutes to collect treasure and silver by defeating other pirates. Arena is a great mode for players who love to be in the action and fight it out against real players. I have only one other complaint which is so minor that some players might even enjoy the realism of it. The game is online, and the max crew size is 4, so you can be able to play in groups larger than 4 by hoping to get in the same game and making an alliance. When allied, you can communicate with the other crew that you are partnered with, but only at close range. If you get to far away or face the other direction of the other crew mate speaking, they become quiet and at certain ranges, you can't hear them and they can't hear you. (The communication takes place through in-game chat). If this is the case and you do need two different crews, the easiest fix would just to settle with Facetime of a group call. All in all, the game is fantastic and I would recommend it to anybody that is considering to get it.

Don't let my hours fool you, I have atleast 40+ more before I bought this on steam. Sea of Thieves started out a pretty barebones game. Bounties were all you did to grind to level 50 in each faction, and it was and still is a pretty boring grind. Athena's Bounties ended up being the same thing, and while the cosmetics were good looking, the grind felt unrewarding and tedious. Eventually, story missions were added in the form of tall tales. This brought the game back to life essentially, and told a compelling story while sailing through the amazing looking world. They've also added in things they promised from the beginning of the game, like fishing and pets. More tall tales are promised for the future, and my friends and I will await them patiently.

It does rely on you to make your own adventures half the time, but with a proper crew and some smart decision making, it'll be a blast. 
With the most recent updates, several dangers were added to the open sea, making going from point A to point B much less boring, and more of a 'avoid certain death' simulator.

Decent optimization, game looks great even on the lowest settings
Skill curve to sailing, very involved process rather than just ""steer""
Nice art style and lore
Megalodons/Krakens are scaled in difficult to your crew and ship

Cons:
Poor tutorial that only shows the absolute basics
Solo play is extremely taxing
No option to not get involved in PvP
Zero difficulty scaling vs Skeleton ships, easy to get destroyed by a single ship
Inconsistent combat. Its hard to know how much damage weapons do without reading the wiki, or how consistent they are
Very grindy gameplay with no real objective outside of buying cosmetics and mini-quests

20,70981049,english,"It's fantastic, I strongly recommend it.

The vast majority of people I have played with (largely randoms through open crew but also the SoT discord) are extremely friendly and fun to play with. I've had so many great and memorable adventures with total strangers that I'm honestly in awe.

The gameplay is great! I've seen some reviews complain about the lack of content however I would disagree; the mechanisms in the game facilitate many opportunities for complex personal journeys which span beyond simply finding treasure and selling it. The best part of the game is in fact the journey you go on and the hurdles you face to meet your goal.

It's these ""hurdles"" that you face on your journey which provide such memorable experiences. They come in the form of environmental hazards and other players, and both forms are fantastic. The PvP in particular has an extremely high skill ceiling and provides the core experience of the game. Yes, it can be extremely annoying to lose hours of work to more experienced pirates, and I've been there. But as you grow experienced you learn to defend yourself and win flights, and being on the winning side reaping the rewards of a hard fought battle feels so rewarding because you have the conscience of what is like being in the losing side, of knowing that you may have just stolen loot that took hours for the enemy to gather. That may be the best part of the game.

37,70975464,english,"What can I say other than that this game blew my expectations out of the water. Get it? Good. Sea of Thieves is by FAR the most fun I've had playing a video game since my early days of Halo 3, World of Warcraft, COD4 and other classics. This game takes multiplayer to another level by seamlessly combining both story and procedurally based quests with high intensity, high stakes PvE and PvP battles, often both happening at once. Many other multiplayer games try to make online play feel like it's a living breathing world inhabited by the players, but no other games in my opinion even comes close to the feeling that you get in SoT. Combat in all areas feels great, with a high skill cap and relatively straightforward mechanics, players are highly incentivized to get good. Every single time I've died, had my ship sank, or lost all my loot has been my fault, the other player was better, no questions asked. You can pull off some sick shit in this game if you're a skilled player, and the game encourages you to do it. With completely overpowered gunpowder barrels and even stronger stronghold gunpowder barrels, a single player acting alone can take down an entire galleon of 4 other players on it if they're experienced enough. With a deep understanding of the mechanics, a well thought through plan, and bit of pirate luck any player can become a terror of the seas.

Let's talk bugs. There aren't many! It seems that the development team is actively looking to stomp anything that would cause immersion break and they're damn good at it. There are the occasional issues that slip through the beta tests and into the live server. In the most recent patch there seems to have been an issue introduced that when a ship collides with a landmass, and then gets pushed off of the landmass, the ship still things it's in contact with something. This causes the ship to moan and creak like it's rubbing up against rocks and sounds quite horrible but causes no damage to the ship. I also think it slows you down until the effect wears off but that is not confirmed. However even this issue is not that big of a deal, it was surprising the first couple times and then I got used to it and learned to stop running into things...unless I'm trying to run into something in which case it's a tactical pirate maneuver.

The artistic direction in this game is phenomenal, hands down. I cannot even begin to describe how absolutely stunning some of the views in Sea of Thieves are. Sailing across a pristine ocean that glows with the most beautiful blue while the sun sets and the sky is and explosion of orange surrounded by a transition to a perfect blue sky and fluffy white clouds is just another day in SoT. The atmosphere of this game is a magnificent combination of hyper stylized graphics and incredible sound design which makes for an almost unbelievable at times gaming experience you won't soon forget. I'm so in love with the art in this game I've spent almost $50 on aesthetics alone, and I've only been playing it for 28 hours.

But that brings me on to my last point, the price point. If you saw $50 and felt the trauma of old ArcheAge coming to haunt you, fear not, this game only has cosmetic options for sale on the cash shop. Not only that, most items will cost you around $5. The more high end items will set you back about $40 but that is money well spent in my opinion. As a general rule of thumb, I do not spend more money on games than the price of the game itself. I am not someone who buys cosmetics or toys because it is just not worth it to me. This game is completely different and you better believe I bought an entire ship overhaul with the collectors edition items, and I did it happily. These developers have 100% earned my money and I will gladly continue to support this game financially as long as I'm enjoying it.

Sea of Thieves is a 10/10 for me and I highly recommend you try it.",1592478913,1592478913,True,40,4,0.680402576923370361,1,True,False,False,76561198013112244,218,4,4555,0,1711,1597191981

43,70973232,english,"Sea of Thieves at first sight u would think its a beautiful game amazing graphics and a open massive world to explore. I am a sea of thieves Veteran player I joined since cursed sails ( The second content update to the game ) I met a lot of people from around the world and discovered the ""PvP Community"" and with that I noticed that the game I thought is a perfect pirate game is false. One of the most known issues in the game is the hit registration ( you hit an enemy with a ranged weapon and he doesn't get damage) and then the back track issue ( you miss someone but it will deal damage ). Now Sea of thieves is about the freedom every play style is welcome at least that's what the developers wanted however it is the opposite the hit reg issue is an issue since the game was released and was never fixed. The Developers tried to fix it however failed multiple times and just ignored the problem since the amount of people who do the pvp in the game is small and for the xbox players there was no problem. Now there is a sort of hidden fight against the play style called double gunning ( players equip 2 guns instead of sword ) and the casual part of the game that tries to avoid pvp and do their pve wants it removed because they think its too op and don't take the time to get better. Problem is that the developers are listening to them and ignoring the players who like the double gun play style so they nerf it and buff the sword to force players use the sword. With developers like this that don't listen to their good players but instead to the players who don't even try to get better and even promoting a server alliance that is an exploit of the server system the game goes to a bad state. I love the game however the changes that developers add to the game that are completely unnecessary ruin the experience of the game.

50,70970987,english,"Although not without problems, I love this game. So the problems, lets get them out of the way first:

[list]
[*] The game is tied to xbox live/microsoft live/bullshit garbage game service of microsoft that doesn't work right.
[*] The most serious issue about the above, is that to join a friends on-going session; or invite a friend to an on-going session, rather than starting your adventure over to invite them, you and your friend need to do a little song and dance of installing some xbox game service app which can only be found on the microsoft store (good luck if you're not on windows 10!) just to be able to invite each other to an ongoing adventure. There's no support for steam invites outside of the main game lobby before you start playing.
[*] Everytime you start a new adventure, no items from your last one will be carried over, this means that if you spent a lot of time collecting cannonballs, food and wood to stock up, and didn't end up using all of it, then when you start your next adventure despite having had spares the last time, you will now have to gather all that again (this is by far my biggest issue with the game, because you start with extremely low resources, and if you want to fix that you can expect to spend at least a good hour of your time looting barrels on various islands to stock up on mundane items that are necessary for basic gameplay)
[*] The only real advancement in the game is unlocking cosmetics; Sure there are faction levels and ways to increase your income and whatnot but where all that income will ultimately go is cosmetics (because that is the absolute only place you can use any in-game cash at all, what I wouldn't give to be able to spend a few gold to buy a proper stock of cannonballs at the start of the game, geez, but no, there is absolutely no way to spend your money on anything practical).
[*] This is at minimum a 2 player game, don't buy this game unless you have at least one friend who will be willing to actively play it with you!
[*] The server join/change message, and the way it locks your controls, is cancer. Especially when you're trying to steer your ship away from a cliff.
[/list]

As for the good...
[list]
[*] Whether you like strategy, tactics, gunfights, swordfights, cannonfights, the game has it all!
[*] This is a game made to be enjoyed, it's a multiplayer sandbox, where any other player may or may not try to rob and kill you. The gameplay itself outside of pvp, for the most part is grindy (but you get to choose between a lot of options of what to grind, so ultimately it doesn't have to be grindy; after all, one of those options is grinding other players! :D ) ultimately the point of the experience here, is quite clearly to find your own fun in the life of a pirate, grinding gold and unlocking cosmetics is just a little extra to keep your hands from being idle.
[*] The developers have paid a lot of attention to detail, they've added various seemingly pointless but actually enjoyable functions, such as:  Shanties playable by 4 different instruments which do sync into a band when players play at the same time, Cooking, Fishing, Complex (yet not the most realistic) aiming mechanics, Wind direction + need to angle your sails, different ship classes, for different size crews, endless stream of dynamic quests (game always hands you out quests in a consistent stream so you never run out of stuff to do), you can shoot yourself from a cannon, get drunk, and there are also special rare cannonballs that can do weird things like make the entire enemy crew drunk, or lower their anchor.
[*] The combat is awesome, although the swordfighting leaves a lot to be desired and gunfighting suffers from extremely slow reload speeds, ship combat is amazing! Besides all the factors that need to be taken into account when maneuvering a ship which is quite tough on it's own, shooting the cannons is no walk in the park either, boarding is a constant threat/temptation, and while all that stuff is going on you still have to remember to plug the holes in your ship so you don't end up being the one that sinks! That while also shoveling out the water that flooded in through said holes... As you can imagine, there's A LOT of stuff going on in combat even if you're just on a small 2 man sloop, as such, every victory is just that much sweeter, since you truly had to work for it. Teamwork is mandatory, you can't shoot cannons, steer, adjust sails and repair your ship all at the same time as one person.
[*] Everybody starts off the same, with the same scarce resources, the same choice of weapons, the same choice of ships, you will rarely be in a position where you are outmatched by another player unless you allowed it to happen, for example by not stocking up on enough resources for a prolonged battle, failing to be mentally prepared for the fact that other players can always try to kill you, forgetting to look around for other ships regularly, lack of skill in ship maneuvering and ship combat, underestimating the firepower of a galleon, etc. On the flip side however, this also means that when you encounter other players, if they made these kinds of mistakes, you can turn it into your advantage and raid them if that's your thing.
[/list]

If you're on the fence about whether you should buy this game or not I suggest you watch some gameplay videos or guides on youtube; but to summarize.

This is a multiplayer game best played with friends, ship combat rocks, any player can attack any other player outside their own crew; there is no safe zone concept in this game, it's a sandbox with lots of grinding, don't get too hooked on the grinding because the main fun of the game lies elsewhere (you literally go on adventures with your friends, what's not to like? If you focus on grinding, you're gonna get robbed and then you're gonna ragequit!), customize your character, don't worry about microtransactions (they're there but honestly I don't see the point, I rarely see a player who uses them, they're purely cosmetic too like everything else of course), Microsoft sucks.",1592469879,1592470420,True,1,0,0.510489523410797119,0,True,False,False,76561197988519939,467,49,3760,0,2549,1593190034

- If you are a new player you can be temporarily banned from the game by the developers just to make room on the server for other players. Even if you are the cutest player ever and haven't done anything bad at all. Just because the developers can.
- If you were lucky enough to have a chance to play before getting banned for nothing, your earnings, money and tropheys can simply vanish from you and your ship in case you have to re-log into the game - and all hours of progress and efforts will be just lost.
- The game is not as fun as it looks in general, in addition to the massive disadvantages i've described above.

62,70969051,english,"Look, I love this game. It's good. It's frustrating. It can even be boring at times. You'll hate pretty much every random you meet now that the game has resurged in popularity. But, if you can find a good group to play with, the game is great; you'll relish calm moments when you set your wheel straight and just party until you hit your destination, and it'll feel great when you finally start winning at least half the ship battles you get in because you guys all figured out your teamwork and how to run your ship efficiently. In my experience, the game is best played on a brigantine with 2 friends, as IMO the galleon is WAY too slow and is a pain in the ass to maneuver without dropping anchor to drift, and the sloop just isn't as fun as you have 1 less friend. HOWEVER, solo slooping in my experience is also pretty damn fun, as long as it's not ALL you do. 

But what if you don't have anyone to play with? Well, then you can either look at the discord LFG or add the first friendly person you meet. Both have worked out good for me when my friends aren't around to play.

63,70968788,english,"Capn Warlock here of the SS Dinglehopper. I’m not normally a fan of pirate themed things, I hate pirates in fact, but something about the colorful graphics and decent reviews and the intriguing sound of an open guilt free PVP experience made me decide to give it a shot. 

My very first long session of game play was worth the price of admission. 

I did a few missions and got a good feel for the game and actually had a good time solo despite some people saying solo was kind of too hard and that it was easy to die solo. Still, there was something immersive and fun about setting sail and dealing with the rigging and stuff. The constant watching over my shoulder for scallywags on the horizon added just the right touch of tension to make the otherwise simplistic PVE content more exciting. 

I was dropping off a cargo load at this tiny little trading station when I spotted a sail and some lights in the distance. AHA! PLAYERS will they be friendly? Or villainous? I know, I will be villainous first!

So I turned in my mission and got my gold, Nothing left to lose now but my pride!

So I unfurled the Black flag and my sails, and hoisted my anchor and set me sails to catch the wind. I loaded some regular cannon balls into my pitiful pair of cannons, wishing I had 2 more and a partner to operate them. 

I sailed straight at them angling for a close pass, as a solo player I couldn’t steer and shoot so I let the ships wheel give me a slight turn to make me less easy to predict. Hoping I would get a nice broadside pass and catch them off guard then sail on by them to get a bearing for a second shot. 
To my horror, as I missed my first shot due to being a newb, the player ship took an aggressive approach and came right out me. 
I quickly reloaded my cannon and fired point blank right into the prow of the ship as it crashed into my starboard side. 
My ship made horrible crunching and gurgling sounds as it began taking on water. I reloaded and fired again, but then saw my HP go down, I was boarded, and someone was slicing me up! 
I turned around and lowered my pistol at them, but they already had a blunderbuss out. 
Somehow, they must have just grazed me because I was kicked off the ship with a mighty bang and had but a sliver of life left. I watched in desperation as my ship and their ship were locked in a death grip and my ship was riding low in the water with fire all over and players ransacking my meager supplies. 

I found a merman and was taken back to my ship, I managed to gut one of the cads before the other killed me in one hit. 

By the time I respawned, my ship was sunk and I lost utterly. 

But I didn’t feel bad at all, it was 2 versus one, and I never fired on anyone in anger in this game and I did ok. I’m sure their ship was in need of real repairs, and one of their crew would remember the sting of my sword on their back. 

I decided to go back to the PVE content to get more practice, and about 20 minutes later came across the same ship docked in a nearby harbor with the same flag. 

I sailed in when they must have been dropping off loot, so this wouldn’t be a robbery it would just be revenge. 

I fire 3 shots, and saw their ship took all three at or below the waterline. But then heard a crash and crunch sound followed by the familiar bubbling sound. I Struck a rock and my ship took a hole!

I ran below and plugged the hole and bailed out a few scoops and returned to the deck to see if I could fire again. 

But now I saw one of the ruffians in the water heading my way!

They activated their push to talk and shouted in a funny accent “Death to American dogs!” and I hit my own push to talk and shouted “Tally ho you scallywag!” and gave him a proper welcome with my blunderbuss, killing him in one shot. I turned my attention to their ship; it was going down!  And no sign of their partner!

I fired a final parting shot with and watched as their ship listed over and sank to the bottom. I got my revenge! 

The next few hours were more or less just as exhilarating, with undead pirate ship battles where I actually sunk one solo, a kraken encounter that killed me in an amusing way, and a fun encounter with a megaladon shark where I harpooned it and rode around with it for a while till it swam off with 4 cannon balls in its belly. And several intense and fun PVP exchanges where I even sunk another player fair and square… that battle was epic, lasting easily 10 minutes as we broke off and reengaged several times and even had a thunderstorm land on top of us making us lose sight of one another for a while. The final shot that sent him down and left him stranded in the water made me smile a wicked smile. 

And tonight, I found a 3 man ship and decided to harass them with hit and run attacks and make their night more interesting. I ended up accidentally losing my ship when it got stuck on the docks near the seadogs. Thinking I lost the 3 man ship forever I scuttled and was about to jump into a mermaids arms to respawn, and that was when my enemies in a 3 man ship rolled up to collect loot probably thinking I died or had sailed away. I snuck around to the top of the base and used a sniper rifle to kill 2 of the crew and blow up a gunpowder keg they left on the very front of the ship for some reason. 

They tucked their tail and ran leaving some of the loot they were picking up behind, I guess they didn’t know I was just a single player with a sniper and no real way to harass them if they just stayed on their ship and scooped up the loot, even if it meant I picked them off one by one they would have gotten away. 

Or they may have hunted me down and finished me off. I heard them sailing away laughing and shouting about not knowing where it was coming from and to “hurry hurry hurry and put the fire out” followed by “but how? How do you put out fires” then “I uh. I dunno actually!” was the last thing I heard as they sailed off, with the fire burning far into the distance, finally being put out after quite a while. I had no ship and this island didn’t have a way to turn in my loot, so I dove into the water and found a mermaid and lost my ill gotten booty… But it was worth it hahaha. 

I know, I have been acting like a jerk to people just trying to play the game, but honestly, it’s harmless and expected, I fully expect my turn to come around when some jerk in a Sloop swoops in a takes my loot. 

Bottom line, if this game is this much fun playing solo without a real purpose, if I can ever get a crew to join me, I can see many hours being “sunk” into this game. 

True it lacks almost any real sense of meaningful progression and is based on just cosmetic upgrades. But I haven’t even tried the story missions yet, and so far, I love everything about this game. And I hear the story missions are actually fairly good content and totally repeatable. So, I can’t wait to try them. 

Till next time, beware the Dread Pirate Warlock aboard the SS Dinglehopper!  I am coming to grief and harass you and take your stuff!  Come and get me if you can!

There are monthly events to earn some premium things from what i've seen. That said there are some hefty drawbacks.
-The game is made for groups. Playing solo is suffering or 'hard mode'.
-Get used to having things stolen from you. It's called sea of thieves for a reason.
-Buggy at times.
-Microtransactions in a full priced game.(Character animations, costumes, ship customizations, ALL pets.) Mostly cosmetic, but the advantage of some emotes that allow you to hide in plain sight can't be ignored. 'Tucking' is what it's called. And while possible with a free emote, a premium emote does it better, allowing you to hide in a box on the floor.
-Motion sickness warning. There is alot of bobbing on the seas. Those with sensitivity to motion sickness might have a problem with sailing. Which takes up the majority of your game.

In the end the voice acting is fantastic and what the game offers is fine for my tastes. If you're a fan of 'make your own fun' kind of games with some missions mixed in, thanks to the tall-tales, I would recommended this game.

To be short - f**ing grinding and absolutely disbalanced process, when if you are a new to the game all you will do is runing around the deck and dying again, again and again, basically just bacuase there is always a bunch of other players with experience much higher than yours on the server.

Hour of preparations, running around islands and collecting cannon balls, wood planks (which you only allowed to carry 5 and you need them like at least 100 to get into fight, but you must find them first), food and all of this to f**ing die in first 15 minutes to the first little boat that decided to fight you. And I've tried to play solo, in pair, in squad of three and four people. Absolutelly unusable Galeon. You can be easely sinked having crew of 4 and big Galeon with 8 cannons by the little boat when there is only 2 enemies on other side. Because they have over 600 hours of experience. Great match making there!

It's like playing R6 Siege, but you're level 5 and everyone else is ~200. Not even a bit close to an interesting time spending. I've newer thought that I will say that, but this game is even more pain to start playing, than Siege. Bravo. That's a success.

And WHY there is no harpoons on the back of the ship??? Why I always forced to drop an ancor, remove sails, turn the ship and only after that I'll be able to harpoon something. It's so annoying!

After first week of suffering, you finds yourself in a place where just noting much to do, but seek for chests, all of which costs litterally nothing, hunt for sceletons and... dying. Because in any other activite you will be killed in first 15 minutes. You're dying all the time and losing all your progress. And forced to collect cannon balls, planks and foor again and again and again.

I robbed a fort couple of times, I've tried to fight aginst sceleton fleet, I've delivered a bunch of ripers chests. That's it. All activities marked, now I can delete this game, because everything else is nothing but suffer.

Plus sound bugs, when I have my headphones connected, but I hear other players from loudspeakers on my PC AND my monitor. Don't even able to imagine how it is possible.

Pros -
- Beautiful unique art style
- The sea water graphics/physics are outstanding!
- Random encounters / battles, both PvP and PvE

Cons -
- Larger ships feel clunky and slow
- Larger crews cannot use smaller ships. I mean not allowing the sloop is fine, but we should be allowed to use the mid tier galleon
- Devs need to add a bit more variety to game. All you encounter on islands are skeletons
- Sometimes the game feels too slow

69,70943774,english,"Sea of Thieves is one of the most polished games I have experienced in recent memory. Its environment, immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play, explore and experience. The campaign stories (called ""Tall Tales"") are intriguing, inventive and curious to play-through.

When it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns, it feels a bit lackluster and basic. Battling enemies head-on lacks challenge and is relatively simple. That said, the boat battles against Skeleton Ships, Ghost Ships, Kraken, Megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique. The amount of ways to mess around with your opponent, blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time. Moments where you T-Bone an enemy ship, grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that I have yet to see matched in other games. To add, depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4, you will be provided larger ships from a single-said Sloop to a massive Galleon, all with their own benefits and short-comings, making battles incredibly challenging.

Another key part of the game is the progression in the game. For some players, the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing. However, if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards, this may be the game for you. In Sea of Thieves, what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks, access to better weaponry/ships or other in the game. The quests, currencies and rewards are all related to cosmetics to improve the look and feel of yourself and your ship.

To end, if GTA is the open-world grindfest to unlocking cooler cars, upgrades and real estate then Sea of Thieves is its counterpart where everything is already unlocked and you simply sail for the great times and moments with your shipmates.",1592414406,1592414406,True,267,16,0.914233207702636719,3,True,False,False,76561197997348592,182,33,7583,0,2359,1600800713

33,70935930,english,"As of the time of writing this review, i have player 30 hours of sea of thieves. Since it's release i've wanted to buy it, but for some reason i held off. Maybe because i didn't have any friends who wanted to pay that much money for a video game, back when everyone was just playing PUBG and CSGO. One of my friends told me that we should get the game and try it out. Just our luck - the game was about to be released the next day on steam. I should also mention that another thing that held me off was the ""lack of progression"". I liked the fact that it was all skill, but i didn't like the fact that there wasn't anything to put that skill into. After launching the game and playing through the maiden voyage, i was hooked, but still a bit concerned. ""Surely they just put all the best things in the tutorial..."" 

Boy was i wrong, after playing with my friend, i realized, that every voyage with your friends is a new adventure full of laughter, jokes and even a few hardships when we lost our loot to other pirates... but that is the reason this game is fun - the teamwork you put in while sailing your ship, digging up loot and solving riddles, fighting skeletons, bosses and other players is where the fun lies.

But it doesn't end there! Remember when i said that i was afraid of the ""no progression"" feature? NO PROGRESSION MY A**! Each emissary has it's own levels and little rewards that you get and they get progressively more difficult, there are also secret emissaries and Tell Tales which are story line quests. 

The customization options are limited for characters, but it's not difficult to make your character look like a pirate legend no matter how ugly it is, thanks to the massive array of clothes, hooks, peg legs, haircuts, beards and even cute pets!

Now i also have to give a big thanks to RARE for fallowing the footsteps of Hello Games, the makers of NO MAN'S SKY. They manage to make this game amazing with constant free updates that come out monthly and let me tell you - they are not lacking whatsoever. Heck, even the in-game shop that uses micro-transaction currency... wait... THE CURRENCY ISN'T EVEN A MICRO-TRANSACTION, YOU CAN GET THE CURRENCY JUST BY PLAYING THE GAME! ""Oh but it has to be like 10 ancient coins per ancient skeleton and everything in the shop costs about 3000 ancient coins... right"" Nope, the drops range from 150-200 to 500-800 coins. The main features of the in game store are pets and they cost about 450 ancient coins (350 if they are on sale) I felt BAD when i killed an ancient skeleton, because RARE seriously deserve the money. 

Welp... i usually never write reviews, nor do i make them this long. The reason why i'm doing this, is for the people to see that there is a game which might be more fun for you than CSGO or PUBG or RUST... it's right here... and it's worth every single penny. I want this game to have an Overwhelmingly positive rating, which is also why I'm writing this review. 
 
Take care everyone! See you on the Sea Of Thieves!

You can get gud or learn to avoid them, but even if one ruins your haul, you pretty much only lose what you didn't take time to cash in.

Other than that I find the gameplay an absolute blast. The characters look wonderful and interact with the world realistically, if a bit comically. There's no leveling up, the pirate who's been on a hundred voyages will have the same weapons and tools as one just starting out after their maiden voyage, and losing one's ship simply means they will respawn with a new one. Instead, one collects gold and standing with the several NPC factions to unlock cosmetics for one's toon, equipment and ship. Only thing that costs only real money are pets, monkeys, parrots and cats, but they are strictly for show, as are the other cosmetics.

94,70926166,english,"Pros: playing the game with random people one meets while playing the game is great. Having the choice to be friendly or not is great. Coordination with crew mates is something one needs to find in crew mates. Proximity voice chat is great, although direction of the player speaking is usually wrong. The mechanics in this game for doing whatever you want is great. The game is freely updated every month with new content and bug fixes. These updates aren't small, either. The bugs found and worked on are actually fixed, and the new content is really good on every update.

Cons: Xbox's player reporting system is broken. It is commonly abused by players, mostly by kids who seem to not be able to succeed in achieving their bullying quota on the seas for the day. I suggest not communicating at all with any player who isn't an adult in the game, or one might be subject to such a consumer controlled ban system. I also suggest purchasing/playing the Steam version of the game, since it has less connection to Microsoft/Xbox for such a reason, however it can still affect a player. The other con to this game is the hit registration for each of the four weapons that one can use, the worst of which seems to be the flintlock/pistol. Rare/The Sea of Thieves team indicate that such an issue is being fixed, which is always good, but the issue is consistent, although less of a problem every other monthly update, approximately. This game can be really frustrating. When (not if) another crew approaches a player and decides to attack/steal that player, only the skill of that player will determine whether the attacking crew will succeed. The hit boxes for the player's pirate avatar are the same as every other player in the server. The weapons, jump height, running speed, everything is exactly the same as every other player. The only difference is the cosmetics per pirate avatar and the skill of the player. This also means that there will be times that a new player will be overwhelmed by a more experienced player. I include this in the cons simply because there isn't any clear way to understand which players are day one players or have played the game for one day. This is also a pro, since anonymity can be beneficial in the relatively infinite number of scenarios that can arise in the game.

This is my review. I definitely recommend this game. It's one of my favorite, and I only play two of my three favorite games nowadays. I don't play any others. I consider that a strong compliment. It's really enjoyable for anyone.",1592387779,1592387779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199011803684,6,1,56629,7454,3355,1602042471

It's definitly a game to play with friends, but you can still play by yourself. Hear me out, this game is repetitive, but it doesn't feel like it (yet), because it's a game where you make your own adventures. Every session is unique. Unique encounters with other players, some are wholesome, other goes terrible. I'm currently 46 hours in, I haven't done everything yet, and not a single session felt just like the other ones.

Sea of thieves is also quite different from any other games. There aren't really a progression system in this game, someone with 500 hours more than you will only have more cosmetics and more experience as a pirate. You can level up the different guilds, but it doesn't change the gameplay much (slightly different quests).

Im sure there is somthing you are supposed to do, but the game wont tell you and exploring just shows you empty islands with some cool empty forts, with nothing to do.

I select a team match that involves what were supposed to be teams of 5 because i didnt want to slow down a 2 man team.    Low and behold, i get shoved into a two man team.  The other guy is not on voice coms, and doesnt help getting the ship moving.  After raising the anchor on a galleon all by myself, and setting the sales by myself, and getting to the wheel all by myself we get raped by 2 other galleons with full crews sinking us to the bottom of the sea.  the game has a bug that prevents you from swimming when on deck, even if the deck is under water so i had to run to the edge of my ship on the bottom of the ocean and jump off of it, before the game would let me swim to the surface and find an NPC to let me respawn the boat.  Boat respawned and... i was 100% alone on it.

Look, i like some games that are pure multiplayer pvp, and i like some games that are single player, i even like games that have a mix of both.

BUT

If a game has zero single player, and zero multiplayer... its not a game.  Its a waste of $30.",1592344089,1592344089,False,1,3,0.385964930057525635,1,True,False,False,76561197968675002,201,12,88,0,88,1592343678

77,70904855,english,"-Insert amazing story with plot twists, near heartbreak, and triumph-

8.5/10

-The water itself makes this game bare minimum a 5/10
-Traversing long distances CAN turn into a chore, but if you sit back and admire the water graphics, physics, keeping an eye out for other pirates, etc. it makes it interesting
-Quests aren't too bad on your first 10-20 hours, after that, it CAN get repetitive (unless random events kick in and make a simple trip into a 3 hour fight for your life)

-Customization is great (although more flair would be amazing)
-Primary enemy types (Skeletons) get boring. New enemy types per biome please?
-Sword gameplay is dumb. 'Nuff said.

-Ship mechanics are stellar (paired with waves crashing into the ship making it rock during intense fights is mind blowing)
-Arena mode is okay

Now everything mentioned above is already pretty darn good for a $40 game that'll eat up hours upon HOURS of your life (85% of it being in a good way)

Firstly, I feel that the 40$ price tag is fair. There's a lot to do in this game, it gets major event updates every month. I would recommend you buy it on sale or game pass to try it out. It's definitely worth trying in my opinion. The developer cares about the game and provides regular free updates. If you can play with friends, it's even better. I have been playing solo and I'm having blast. It takes an hour or two to get used to micromanaging as a solo player. It's absolutely playable as a solo player, I've had no problems playing on my own.

Rare honestly deserves the love they've gotten for this game. While it had a rocky start and it took them a while to bring all their vision to light, they promised continued support and development. They've been honest with us on every issue, not tried to sweep things that were genuinely game-breaking under the rug, and ran a few decisions past the players too.

In Conclusion, the game is excellent. Definitely worth buying if you have some money to spare. If you're on the fence about buying it, sign up for the Xbox Game Pass. This lets you get access to the entire library for a monthly fee, and has a two-week free trial. You can hop on board, cancel the subscription, get your two weeks in and make your decision then.",1591970185,1592319306,True,34,3,0.774747788906097412,1,True,False,False,76561198145256548,331,16,4304,0,1019,1594026679

This was a game I wanted to get when I first heard about it. Unfortunately, I didn't buy Sea of Thieves since the game did not release on Steam Initially but I am happy it's finally here now.

This game should serve as a reference of why publishers/devs should strongly consider releasing their games across all platforms (especially at launch) since there is clearly a plethora of gamers who enjoy great games here on Steam. Failing to do so clearly prevents a company from receiving the numerous benefits of having their game on Steam such as more sales and significant exposure due to its high player count.

One reason why I didn't get the game when it came out was because I want my games on Steam. I have a profile that is unique to me and is something I can call my own. Not every platform has that and on some you're just a username and a number. It's fun to show off your in-game accomplishments with friends through screenshots posted to your profile or discussing your favorite game with other steam users in the community hub.

45,70882556,english,"Pirates and adventures upon the open sea have long been things of interest to me, and so when I first learned about Sea of Thieves I was excited and eager to play it. Unfortunately for me the game was an X-Box exclusive, and I had long been a PlayStation gamer. Though it pained me to admit it, I thought I might never get a chance to try out that awesome sounding pirate MMO.

When I discovered that Sea of Thieves was also becoming available on Steam, I was overjoyed and purchased it immediately upon release - and I am immensely happy that I did. The game has proven thus far to be immensely satisfying, adopting an open world styling that truly allows you to be the kind of pirate you wish to be. Want to explore every island you come across? Do it. Want to take on quests and earn gold? You can. Want to hunt for buried treasure? There's plenty to find!

Of course, this freedom does result in players being able to raid and combat one another on the open sea, sinking their ships and stealing their plunder. This is less frustrating than I thought it would be, and fights between ships and players can be truly entertaining - though if you are not sailing with a crew, the battles will rarely swing in your favour. That said, luck and cunning can allow even an outnumbered pirate to overcome their foes.

If I had to gripe, I'd choose the following two things to complain about: firstly, as nifty as the Infinite Pirate Generator is, I do wish that players could simply design their own pirate to play rather than having to cycle through randomised options; secondly, and as an addendum to the previous paragraph, it can get frustrating when brand new players are hunted and killed the moment they beat the tutorial, scarcely having a moment to find their feet. I understand this is not always the case and is entirely player-dependent, but it was something that made my own introduction to the Game far longer than it needed to be.

Visually, the game is beautiful, and possesses it's own style that makes it instantly recognisable and appealing. Some might not like it, but I enjoyed it immensely. It certainly meshed well with the humour and music - the latter of which is also fantastic. I've become a big fan of this game's soundtrack since picking it up; it enhances the game very well!

If you like pirates, give this a go; if you don't, I'd still recommend it, though admittedly it probably won't appeal to you anywhere near as much.",1592312302,1592312302,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198029782088,42,8,1384,0,1290,1595692968

Sea of Thieves it`s an amazing game, you can have hours and hours of fun with a friend and you'll never realize how much time have you spent in the game. I've been playing Sea of Thieves for over a year now, first in the Microsoft store and now, here on Steam [spoiler](Finally!)[/spoiler] 

It took me a while to understand the game, or at least to see from a perspective that didn`t make me quit haha  You know, in the beginning, Sea of Thieves was really hard to enjoy, because it`s super repetitive and a year ago it didn`t have a lot of content, so it was really hard to spend time sailing the seas since you only had a couple of things to do. Now... there is a lot of content, that you can spend a lot of time on, or if you want to rush things, you can finish all the content in two or three weeks, but don`t do that! [spoiler](or go for it, idc)[/spoiler]

But to me, what makes me understand the game was when I finished all the Tall Tales. [spoiler](Tall Tales are basically the ""Main Story"" of the game)[/spoiler] When you finish you get to watch a cutscene which a very important person in the game is talking and he'll say something that got stuck with me for a long time, ""It`s not about the gold, It's about the Glory!"". And that's the most beautiful way to describe the game. Yeah, you`re in the PVP world, where everybody can [spoiler](and will)[/spoiler] kill each other (most of the time for no reason) but Sea of Thieves it's not about grinding gold or getting rich.

In the Game you have a system of commendations, there are basically achievements that you can complete and by completing them you may unlock titles or cosmetics in the game and for me, that's the main objective of the game, collecting commendations, titles, and very exclusive stuff that really shows that you spend way to much time in this game, for example, I just spent two weeks fishing so I can have a fishing rod that glows in the dark... did I spend waaay to much time just for that? Hell yeah, I did. Was it worth it? Yes. (maybe not, I've mixed feelings about it).

But in the end, you might have a completely different vision of the game, maybe for you, this is all bullshit and meaningless and I might understand why, but If you don't have the game yet, please considered buying it, because it's really worth it, and I'm sure you and your friends will have great moments playing it :) And don't worry about the content because the game gets updated every month just keep an eye on their social media,mostly Youtube)

Otherwise it is a tiresome grind of going back and forth in open crews to find the right crew to play with. Not to mention it takes a little while to join a game. 

If you're looking to solo the game, I wish you the best of luck (because luck is apparently everything when you solo). Wanna do a tall tale (the closest thing to a campaign?) better hope no other players come along to ruin 3 to 4 hours of progress (I wish I was exaggerating it). Some tall tales take even longer to complete. It took me alone roughly 2 days to finish the first chapter since I either ran into strong NPCs or players who were just out to ruin the fun. 

If you're looking for content, there is some out there, just not a whole lot. There is no sort of progression in the game (level up, going up in rank etc.) except for flashy cosmetics. 

As for the quests, it is the same repetitive ""go from point A to point B"" type of quests with different factions so it ""feels"" different.

I really really want to love this game. It is beautiful, sailing feels very nice and there is a world to explore. I just wished there was more than just basic bare bone quests, flashy cosmetics and ""having fun with friends"" as an incentive to reel you back in for more. 
As soon as your friends are busy or can't play when you want, it can become quite boring real fast.

71,70874125,english,"Premised that also if this is a Multiplayer \ SharedWorld game , i play this game as a Singleplayer game by avoid other players because i try to play it for explore places and in a relax way *
This said i like ALL about this videogame , for me all is perfect and i can't ask more than this...

BUT there is 1 thing that i don't like (and that make me very mad and sad too) , 
in Elite Dangerous (that is very similar to this game as for gameplay) is possible to SAVE the storage of the resources before to logout.
But in SEA OF THIEVES the fact that is NOT POSSIBLE to SAVE the Resources that you store in your ship before to logout\exit the game ,
this for who like me play the game as a single player and with calm is very disturbing and annoyng.
i stated this more time in the official sea of thieves forum but devs don't care because as they explain me many times this is a sharedworld\multiplayer games so is not possible do this because is a game about multiplayer and with shared world so if they do same i ask will be ""unbalanced"" for fighting in multiplayer etc.
BUT i'm very sad and mad this,for i would be + happy to enjoy this game if is possible to save the resources before to exist\logout


* btw my skill is very strong in this game i had no problems to do it , when\if 1 time of 1000 i don't have way to avoid other players i always win in fight so... i'm not worry that too as you can see some videos in my youtube channel...
So let's say that i'm a Good and Solitary pirate (lol) but if someone disturb me i have no problems to give them some cannonballs lol.

i Give a Positive Review BTW because i'm for the idea that i must to judge this game for what him give good,and not for the only 1  thing that i not like , considered that the game give to me another 999999 things that i like,and so i can accept to not like 1.

i must add also that i have 2 personal satifaction about this game (that make me also cry,and i'm not kidding)
When this game was not so much famous long time ago,i give the idea to the devs to add Snakes in the islands by post my idea in the official forum and make examples with another world worms or farcry snakes etc. , after around 1 years the devs add my idea to the game the same can be said about the Harpoon (but about this last i'm not sure they do it because of my idea...because is a very common thing)

So also if i'm not a developer and also if i'm not an ""obessed"" fan of this game i must say i have a personal feel about it , every time i play it i feel same if have 2 things about me inside it for my ideas be implemented and this is something i will never forget until i die.

This game,togheder with astroneer,elite dangerous,no man's sky is one of my preferite games

Would be awesome,for me,if one day will be possible to play this game offline without internet and also in single player mode,so that the people that is not lucky enough to have an internet connection or enough speed,can enjoy it too.

it's sad to think that developers create a world so wonderful like this,but maybe some people will die without never see it only because this is a game that require internet and they may not have it,i wish\hope for an offline version too.",1592296764,1592297288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970752312,1431,64,1055,0,1038,1592299658

19,70859211,english,"I love this game overall. The positives outweigh the negatives by a lot for me. This game is better in a group but can be played solo but you must be vigilant. 

Positives:
I love the graphics and the water is probably the best ever put in a video game. The combat isn't fantastic PVM or PVP but it is fun and engaging. I love the sailing mechanic in this game. It feels so immersive and just hits the sweet spot. I like the quests and riddles which are fun to figure out without a guide. I like the PVE a lot as well. Doing fort raids, Kraken, Megalodons and ship battles are so much fun to me and rewarding. Even the main story is fun and engaging, making me want to learn more about the lore. I love trying to level up the factions as well.

Negatives:
You shooting other ships doesn't really matter, unfortunately. People will just repair their ships constantly and try to shoot themselves at your ship to take you out, which is fine. However, the main PVP strat is to sneak on the ship with TNT and blow it up, which will kill the whole crew and put many holes in the ship. This always feels dirty and like you've been cheated. It sucks this is the main strat in the game. A lot of the people you run into are toxic as well but not all. Most will just avoid you though.
There are some bugs here and there. Getting stuck in geometry or dying for no known reason. Some of the Skeleton captains have gotten stuck underground, forcing us to abandon the quest or raid.",1592263539,1592263539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198050153343,71,6,5008,0,3787,1592898163

Fighting Skeleton Ships, raiding forts, defeating Megalodons and Karken are most entertaining things you can do in this game with your buddies.
You share the same world or map with 5/6 other teams. They might be your friends or foes so be ready for any action. But most of the time you can go without meeting anyone in the world.
But lastly there is not much more to the game you just got to grind your level for the emissaries and just go for the skins that's all this game has to offer or so called reward. Oh yes, and the tall tales the most boring part of the game.

57,70793227,english,"Sea of Thieves has a nice concept of a MMO pirate game.
However there are a lot of cons, which make this game boring, repetitive and unsatisfying to play.
First of all the bugs, there are a few of them, that i've encountered in my playthroughs and already reported all of them for the Sea of Thieves Support.
Like Megaladoon was never attacking my ship, when i played online with a friend.
It always appeared, did nothing, but swimming around the ship for a couple of minutes and moving away from it.
Sometimes a ship's compass stopped working for my friend, forcing him to use a pocket one to navigate.
One time the game crashed and before i closed it i saw an outpost not loading at all.
No buildings, no npcs, just some bad looking textures, of not loaded buldings etc.
Aside from bugs, game doesn't have any real goal to play and farm gold for.
You can only buy cosmetics to look cool or make your ship to look cool, that's it.
Once you've got your fav outfit and a ship's look you're done with a game.
It would be better to have some goal, like raids, buying islands to build farms, storagerooms etc.
To produce resources, storage loot etc.
PvP should be optional imo.
Like everyone will have a special flag to set in order to go into pvp mode.
And to prevent ppl from abusing raising and lowering a flag add a cooldown after you raised a flag, that in the next 5 minutes you're not allowed to lower it.
And everyone else, who doesn't have that flag raised will not be affected by pvp players shots etc.
And a final thing is to add iron sights or a crosshair for firearms and making a swordfight more faster and satisfying, instead of slowly swinging a cutglass.
Game's concept is fine and i want it to become better, with more stuff for players to do and farm the gold for.
However in it's current state, i'd rather wait for more updates and improvements before buying it or coming back into it.
There are many other games in 2020 to play meanwhile you're waiting for more updates for this game.",1592163522,1592243266,False,15,4,0.471732765436172485,0,True,False,False,76561198030950437,357,10,2702,1,1945,1601720451
58,70837050,english,"TL:DR
no content, fortnite on prozac.
Long Read:
We bought this together with my Wife as a nice chill after work co-op.
First look -
the best looking waves, weather, sky i seen in long time.
co-op mechanics is quite fun and keeps you interested (for first 3 hours) .

After first two hours:
-there is no real tutorial, you spend ages alt+tab to search for information on the most basics of the game.
-there is no progression, there is nothing to grind for,  only thing that you can keep between session are cosmetics.
-due to fact that there only 3 types of quest (fetch,kill, complicated  fetch) other adult players get bored straight away.
-because there is no progression, and nothing to do, people are creating their own entertainment: hunt other players.
  but because combat mechanic is super simplistic it usually ends up using tricks (hide somewhere on the ship,glitching through wall) or simple 4 against one.
Let me give you an example: You sail together with your friend, you are enjoying the views and the suddenly BAM your dead , second later your friend. Both shoot in the back by bored player who hid in your ship and sneak on you while you were busy tending to ship.
Well you could say: But this is PvP game get used to it , get gut. 
Mate I was wall bouncing with saw-off shotgun in first Gears, together with my Wife we got through original gears trilogy on ""insane"" difficulty level.
No... There is no skill in using graphic glitch to make yourself almost invisible to moment later ""one shot"" player from the back.
Even more frustrating is fact, that they gain nothing out of it, no exp ,no K/D ratio nothing.
Game is a waste of time, it has a potential to be a ""chilled hangout place"" for work tired adults, pop the beer , get few mates together, do something that does not require to much front lobe activity and reflexes of redbull infused teenager.
But there is nothing there, seriously nothing. 
 
We both tried to refund but sadly it was pass 2h limit.

This game also knows exactly how to make a mood with the lighting and music, also big props to the music and sound design it is sublime.

77,70745979,english,"I like the graphics, aesthetics and atmosphere, and there are some fun ship and team based mechanics, but ultimately there seems to be a very limited appeal. Waiting in a lobby for a match takes way too much time and sadly like many other games with potential, the experience is often ruined by the community. In my few arena experiences, 2 out of 3 were negative experiences due to the needless toxicity of other players. also 2 out of 3 games results in people quitting at the start or one team taking over other teams ships and spawn camping.

And despite the amount of quality that is in the game, truly immersive moments, there is just not enough depth to it to feel like 40$ is worth it. I would only buy this game if its on sale and you have friends to fill your crew. Otherwise you're going to have a mediocre or bad time. now and then you may actually have a fun match, but those seem too few and far between. 

I might play the game a bit more just to give the community another chance, but judging by how they are reacting to my review? point and case. don't waste your time, this game is full of gen-z clowns.

+graphics / atmosphere / art style
+music
+ship / team mechanics

-overly basic weapons and movement. sniper can be fired under water, swords take too many hits to kill, there is noblock or nuance to melee. the charged leap attack feels more risky than it is worth
-price is high considering how hungry they are for you to spend extra money on their shoppe
-takes up a lot of HD space
-takes a long time to get into and play a simple match, chances are low that its truly fun
-people are often toxic
-only lasting appeal outside of frequently playing with friends is earning cosmetics. so if you don't care for ""dressing up your dolly"" like me, there is nothing to gain from sinking many hours into this game",1592088629,1592237592,False,5,3,0.449036777019500732,0,True,False,False,76561197960414831,213,21,998,0,430,1594237546

There is a huge variety of activities to do, both PvE and PvP. And since there's no sort of gear progression or power levels, you can participate in (almost) all the game has to offer right from the start (unlike most MMO's where you have to grind through to the end-game in order to get the the good stuff). In addition, since there's no gear or levels, everyone is on an equal playing field when it comes to PvP, regardless of whether you're brand new or if you've sunk 3000 hours into the game. Speaking of PvP, you earn treasure from completing activities, but you don't earn any gold until you sell the treasure at a port. This means if a player comes along and steals your treasure, they can turn it in and you get nothing. This WILL happen... A LOT, and it can make for some really salty moments, but it's honestly just part of the fun. There's no bigger rush than when you get attacked by another crew when you're close to port and have a huge haul waiting to be turned in. Can't recommend this game enough.

This is the best pirate game that I've played, and so far I am enjoying my experience.

The PVP is frustrating, unbalanced, and nearly impossible to avoid. 
However there is so much i love about this game. 
I am constantly torn, there SHOULD be a way to avoid it, whether it be a private server or PVE only server, but the game still is good. PVP ship battles out in open sea are a lot of fun and tactical but the actual face to face combat is pretty much garbage, you get 1shot by the Blunderbuss and then they can sit on your ship They can 1 shot you again and you don't even have time to equip a weapon. Honestly just talking about it is annoying because i was just trying to do the story quests, they are well written and i wanted to enjoy them but i got attacked (i had no treasure) 3 times, left server tried again was attacked again (still no treasure) and they just knew where the story quest was so they hung around there attacking me so i couldn't do the quest. 
Basically the story doesn't matter if you cant actually enjoy it, and the devs seem to have no interest in catering to a more casual fan basis, when i first started playing this i actually got TWELVE of my friends to get it, we grouped up played and there were a lot of good times but they ALL rage quit because they wanted to have fun and just got harassed constantly. 

That being said, i have actually made a few friends in server, when you get the chance to get revenge on jerks who were just bullying you it is fantastic. The style is beautiful, and what lore you can actually get to (ALMOST NONE OF IT) seems to be thematic and fun. I would buy the game all over again if it meant i could have a private server to enjoy the game with friends and enjoy the well designed social aspects of this game. It has potential to be much more inclusive but as it stands should basically be called Sea of dickheads.

- Tons of fun with friends with a heavy focus on cooperation
- Unique art style
- Tons of character & ship customization
- Very few bugs
- Fantastic sailing mechanics

Cons:
- Very repetitive
- No character progression (other than visual)
- Solo play can feel daunting and not worth it
- PVP and PVE (Mainly non-ship combat) feels boring and slow because of locked/slow animations and lack of weapon diversity (stats wise). Nor is hit multipliers a thing, so headshots etc, don't do extra damage, not even in PVE.

Content suggestions:
- Customizable player owned islands (With production features for food and special cannon balls)
- A perk system or special weapon variations (To make PVP/PVE less mundane/repetitive)
- Larger town settlements/islands (A central place where players can meet and socialize)

Overall SoT is a great game, but can't personally recommend it because of the cons listed above.

[h1] Person B [/h1]Pirate game retard, you bought it and it's PvPvE. It's ""Sea of Thieves"" not ""Sea of Friends"". If they added a PvE mode the game would die. Besides, there's only like 6 ships on a server so it's rare for you to be attacked. You're just mad, lol.

Tall tales serve as a narrative you can follow, and you have Voyages that will give you objectives and treasures to hunt, but outside of that it's open ocean. Gorgeous, expansive, constantly active open ocean. 

the PvE content is really fun, even if the on foot combat is a little simple. Fighting skeletons can get to be tiresome on occasion, but the appeal and fun of exploring, searching islands and caves, digging up treasure, and palling around with other pirates honestly never gets old!

and that last statement is kind of the crux, here. ""other pirates."" You could very well play solo, and it is fun and relaxing to just sail on your own, fishing and exploring, ""vibing"" as the kids say, but the majority of the fun you'll have in SoT surrounds your crew. A full 4 isn't always a requirement, you'll get on fine with 3 and a Brig. I'd honestly suggest that 9 times out of 10, just because a Galleon is really a lot to juggle, and it's easier to convince two of your buds to buy this game as opposed to three.

the biggest downsides to the game as of right now are two things: the player base, and its occasional bugs.  

the player base - Immediately hostile. All the time. Get ready to get into ship battles, gun fights, and brawls every time you encounter another group of players. You can plea, and bargain, and explain you have nothing of value on your ship because you just left spawn, it doesn't matter. Other players will kill you on sight, every time, all the time, no matter what. So, just keep your cannons loaded, and be prepared to shoot down anyone and everyone. 

bugs - my mic does not work in game, at all. I can't seem to find a solution to this anywhere, and I've altered a thousand settings both in windows, through the Xbox Game App, in game, etc - still doesn't work. No idea how to fix it, but thankfully text chat can be seen by all players, which makes desperately asking people to stop shooting at me a little easier. The more detrimental bug is the fact that the compass next to the ships wheel just stops working occasionally. It'll get stuck on north and never move, which requires you to use your pocket compass, taking your hands off the wheel every  couple of seconds just to make sure you're going on the right course. A minor thing that I hope they patch out soon.



my closing thoughts is this, though - It's a fun open world game where you get to be a pirate, wear basically nothing, and get into drunken swordfights while hunting for treasure! It's a wonderful time, I loved it in the Technical Alpha, I loved it in the Closed Beta, and I love it here, on Steam!

PROS :
+ tons of quests to do including tall tales quests.
+ Different factions you can level up by doing their quests.
+ No player has an advantage over the other because every item you can earn in the game is cosmetic. The only advantage to be gained is your own skill with the game and learning its systems.
+ Skull forts are really fun and have lots of loot
+ Game is Fun with PVP  as well . There are only 6 other ships per server so you can avoid other players most of the time if you want to.
+ Game can be played solo but playing with randoms has been really fun in my experience. 
+ I've made alot of new friends playing this game who are a blast to play this game with. 
+Devs really care about their game and are constantly adding new things.

Cons :
- Ships compass has a glitch where it always points north which is really irratating .
- Sometimes it can be very time consuming but its overall a great experience. Not a game you can just play for a few minutes because you have to do your quest and then cash it in.
- Sometimes you get people that just like to ruin your fun on your crew but it hasn't happened very often.


Overall the game is a very amazing experience and if you like Pirates , and sailing the high seas , and taking treasure from others ( aka the name sea of thieves ) then this game is for you !

14,70723789,english,"I haven't played for very long, but I've been having a decent time.

Pros:
- The game does a great job of fulfilling many of the fantasies of being a pirate, including digging for treasure, drinking grog, dancing to music, fighting other pirates and looting their remains, being attacked by the Kraken, following maps, and many other creative and clever design decisions.
- The game overall is gorgeous. The pirates are rather ugly, but mostly in a quirky, piratey way.

Cons:
- Microsoft forces you to create an XBOX account, and your playing with friends forces you to interact with them using that, rather than inviting friends via Steam. Linking the accounts together didn't allow my existing friends to be discovered, and we had to manually add each other on the XBOX accounts instead. It was a poor player experience.

- The camera FoV is capped out at 90 (and is set to 75 or so by default). If you're like my girlfriend and me and you're more sensitive to motion sickness, this might be unplayable when combined with the bobbing of ships and disorientation swimming around shipwrecks. Apparently to preserve ""fairness"" between console and PC users, this setting is unlikely to be fixed officially ever, which is a big shame.

- The game uses your microphone by default, broadcasting whatever you say to other players in your vicinity. It never warns you of this, which feels kind of privacy-invading.

- Not exactly a con, but something you just need to acknowledge, but the game is solidly PvP. From what I've seen, there are no safe areas, no ""protection"". You can get murdered or robbed at any time. It's not very punishing (you don't lose much upon death, and stealing your stuff back is possible when you re-spawn), but if this gives you anxiety, then the game's probably not for you.

- The microtransactions feel a bit like the game's double-dipping, but it's just for cosmetics, and I guess players are used to companies doing this nowadays, even if it leaves a bit of a bad taste.

As you can see, all of my gripes are more to do with meta-decisions, and many people would disagree with me over whether those are problems. The developers who did the game's design and visuals did a really great job. If the cons don't turn you off, I think you'll have a great time.",1592056337,1592056337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197994429450,614,3,2471,0,406,1593548974

The game basics are poorly explained through a tiny tutorial, then the player is thrown into a world without any indication of what to do next.
Quests give poor information about what's expected, but it always boils down to sailing for hours between islands to find some poultry or treasure and bringing it back to another island.

Meeting other players in-game always concludes with the rookie being killed and his treasure taken away, completely losing the latest 2 to 4 invested hours.

There are weird disappearing items bugs, really annoying when you get back with your ship with every treasure chest you found, only to realize there are no more chests on your ship.
There was also a time when the ship started flying away, so steep that my character slid to the water with every chest on board. The mermeaid got the character back to the ship, which was back on the water, but the treasure chests were once more gone.

Overall its a fun game to play with your friends and sometimes randoms if you get lucky, its mechanics are easy to get into and not to hard to master, the missions are rather simple but get harder as you go along even more so with the pvp aspects of the game.

Why?
Because it's fun and has a simple combat system with lots of skins that you will be grinding for just to look cool among your friends and other players and it's so much fun with a lot of people, but If
you don't have many friends the PVE still so much fun you will get beaten up by other bigger crews sometimes but that's not a big problem because fighting back and planning to get away from this mess contain a huge part of the enjoyment this game provide beside finding treasures and solving puzzles and riddles.

81,70702097,english,"Holy ****, where do i begin. This game is truly fantastic and beautiful, I have played the game for hundreds of hours and I still play it a lot! I must admit this game is for certain players, this game is much about grinding for reputation and commendations, but of course you can also just troll around on a ship with your friends and terrorize everyone. 


What can you do in the game?
There is so much content in this game, you can do everything from doing a relaxing tale tall to hunt the freaking kraken. You can do skeleton forts, skeleton fleets, kill megalodon or die to a megalodon if thats what you like. You can go hunting other people, or just simply relax to this beautiful game, and there is much more! There is 2 kinds of gamemodes in the game. Adventure where you can do everything you want, and then there is Arena. Arena is also a fantastic gamemode, much less relaxing, because you might need to tryhard fo the win! Simply just ships against eachother and 1 chest on the map, you go for! Personally I would say the forts, fleets and Arena is my favorite. Tall Tales is also a huge part of the game, there also takes many hours to complete, I have not played it so much, since the other things have interested me more.

Is the map big, how about the graphics? 
This game is unbelievable beautiful, when you sail around the ocean just a watch on the beautiful waves will make you buy this game, and you will not regret it. The game is huge, like really huge. There is many small and big islands and of course a huge ocean. There is forts, outpost, islands made for tall tales, islands made for stuff and so on. 

Ships:
In Sea of Thieves there is 3 different ships, the Sloop, Brigantine and the huge Galleon. The sloop is made for 1-2 people, a really nice boat, its the smallest, quickest to turn and pretty fast. The Brigantine is made for 3 people, its a bit bigger, a bit faster and slower to turn. The Galleon is made for 4 people, its the biggest, fastest and hardest to turn of course. 

Weapons:
There is 4 different weapons in Sea of Thieves, 3 of them is guns: flintlock pistol (50% damage per shot), eye of reach sniper (70% damage per shot) and the blunderbuss shotgun (10% per pellet), and then there is the effective cutlass who is good to basically everything.  (20% damage per slashing, 60% per lunge)

Are you able to improve your ship and weapons?
Nope, which was one of the reasons why I didnt buy this game earlier, I have always liked the idea of being able to improve your stuff. My friends advised me to buy the game, they also played the game much at the time, and i really dont regret buying it. Instead of improving you are able to cosmetic your stuff, which is a fantastic feature I think. You can cosmetic your own cloth, weapons, ship parts and even get titles by doing stuff in the game as commendations or just simply buying skins.

Reputation & Commendations:
The reputation and commendations are a huge part of the game, this is the part there makes you grind the game a lot! When doing reputation and commendations you can earn titles, clothing and weapon skins.

 Thanks for reading my review, and sorry for the grammar errors! :)

1,70675195,english,"Okay so this is a pure love-hate game. I'm playing it but it's hitting me so damn hard. Let's start with positive things:

1) The sea is beautiful. Nuff said.
2) Really nice pirate setting - envoronments, skins, music.
3) A lot of space for customization.

Negative things:

1) Very unforgiving to new players, the tutorial covers things that are easy and says nothing about really important ascpects of the game.
2) You can't save even if you are playing solo. If you are disconnected or need to close and return in a bit you lose everything - loot, quests, uncompleted stuff.
3) Very time consuming. Everything is manual - even handling chests takes a lot of time. And you are able to  lose everything even in the ""village"". So kinda often it's difficult even to have bio-afk, not to mention larger breaks.
4) This is NOT a game for a single player. You are gonna be easy prey for larger ships and more experienced players. There are no mechanics to balance that. I've warned you.
5) A lot of in-game mechanics don't spare you. For example, you get an Ashen chest. But you can't handle it to anyone, can't store it, and you need Ashen key. Not an easy thing for a new player. NPC skeleton ship sinks you? Bye bye everything.
6) No in-game encyclopedia. Kinda difficult to joggle controlling ship, watching map and doing everything else at the same time. Some may say it's great but for a new player it's just tough. 
7) It's impossible to play it in a casual way.
8) This is even worse that I thought. I was trying to kill a pirate captain for an hour. I don't know how much HP those stupid developes put into those NPC but still. After an hour of shooting him and mob waves with sniper rifle he finally died. You know what happened next? 2 more captains spawned with more adds. And by this time some sloop with 2 players arrived. No loot, no fun. The game is broken.

12,70692719,english,"Sea of Thieves is an amazing online pirate game. You don't exactly need friends to play. If you want to have a crew with more than one person, you can choose an open crew where you are put in a crew with random people. The open crew feature can put you in crews with toxic people and other stupid sailors, but you can go to the Sea of Thieves discord server and multiple other official SoT chat groups and ask people to join your crew. Or, of course, you can invite your friends if they have the game.

You can do lots of things in this game. Go on voyages for trading companies, do story quests, just explore and grab whatever booty that you find, look for other sailors and take their loot, and many other things. Most of the other players you meet will be toxic kids (or just sad adults with brain damage) who will attack you on sight even when you don't have any loot at all. As you play, you'll get better, though. Arena is a good way to practice combat.

In Sea of Thieves, you don't buy better weapons or armor or anything like that. Right at the start of the game, you get all the weapons. Instead, you can buy (a bit overpriced) skins and outfits with in-game money. Some are overpriced because, well, a dirty, plain jacket costs thousands of gold coins and it costs around half of 100,000 coins to have someone PAINT your SHIP, but you'll earn the money eventually.

32,70288598,english,"The game is a lot of fun, HOWEVER i want to point out some issues that you may find REALLY annoying. First off the BIGGEST PROBLEM is if you're playing with friends you wont be able to join/invite your friends through Steam instead you'll need to use your Microsoft account which by the way, you have to have in order the play the game and for whatever reason at least from my observation i cant add friends within the game you need to use the Xbox companion application or Windows game bar to add your friends, only then you can invite people, also as a side note joining/inviting friends with-in a server is also tedious for whatever reason sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but that might just be me. To me this seem's to be a HUGE missed opportunity to implement steams easy to use join/invite system.

( EDIT, As of very recently ive suddenly been getting 70 ping it seems more servers have been opened for the SEA region! Hurah!) Secondly, if you are playing in regions other than the US, EU and i think Australia you will have high ping i personally live in Asia and i've gotten between 150-200 ping, HOWEVER i have not felt this impact my experience of the game as shots seem to land and hits seem to register and overall seems fine, however i can see this being an issue for people fighting others with high ping. So keep this in mind when purchasing! hopefully we will see servers in other regions in the future but i highly doubt it.

So if you can look past these issues i would recommend this game only for people who want to play with a group of up to 4 friends including themselves, though you can play solo i can see it getting boring quick, the charm of the game is looking for treasures and doing story quests/puzzles together. Many will say ""Whats the point? everything you can buy with gold in the game is only cosmetic there's no progression"". I personally dont see why all games need to have some sort of progression if the game is fun and enjoyable to play with friends surely that's enough, there is lots of content to do within the game and hours of laughter.",1591283305,1591988017,True,8,0,0.59583592414855957,0,True,False,False,76561198051788596,146,8,4838,0,926,1599322498

The coop experience to this game is unique and something that I haven't seen in any other place. This is a game that has to be played with friends, as it enhances every bit of it. 

Graphically and artistically, I love it. Unless you're into fully realistic graphics, I'd say you won't have any complaints. Performance wise, too, this is great. Game runs fine and it has a plethora of options to tune.

In terms of gameplay, as I said, it is unique. Be aware, though, that the loop is somewhat grindy so make sure you'll enjoy the limited amount of activities you can do before you buy. In my case, for instance, I don't mind repeating the same things over and over because the great variety of locations makes it worth the hassle. 

Now, the bad in my opinion boils down to the rewards. I don't think there's much incentive to get rich because all the rewards are cosmetic. A good decision from the devs not to include any level-dependent advantage that would hinder the newer players experience BUT a bit boring nonetheless. This is why I say that this is meant to be played with friends to have a good time and not that much about the rewards.

Overall, a great game. Just watch a couple of gameplays and hype your buddies before you get it.

44,70373665,english,"my opinion of this game has varied in the past few days and i think ive finally come to a solid conclusion

the game is great. but id does need a lot of work, as well as a few additions i think would be pretty neat.

work wise:

-i feel like the character creation or rather lack there of should be implemented. theres a reason people joke about hitting random on character creators. in this case its 999.99 times outta 1000 you're gonna get a pirate that looks like they have a crippling case of down syndrome/elephantiasis. it kinda sucks having to spend hours re rolling again and again just to find someone that looks half decent. theres plenty of arguments of ""oh jack sparrow or people will wanna look like their favorite streamers"" okay who cares? thats what they wanna do so let em do it. if people wanna make their characters look goofy or elderly cool. give them that option. but have people who wanna make pirates that look like them or just look good in general have the option to do so as well instead of having them re roll for hours only to finally get in game only to realize they look horrid because they missed a small detail or two and need to spend more money to buy another re roll potion.

-next i feel the PVPVE system could use a lot of work itself. theres a reason why people never do Fort of the Damned and why people want pve servers so bad. because the way this game works is like a food chain, PVE players do all the work where PVP players go out and sink them to gain all the reward for little risk or work involved. most argument is that pve players wouldnt have much risk on pve servers however thats really not true. if anything they have the most risk of all with the time they put in going to waste, the effort into solving the riddles, the rewards on their ship being lost if they screw up once, the land based AI, and the sea based AI with players to worry about topped up all on top of it. I would go into further detail about it but i already did in a post I made here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1172620/discussions/0/2448217258988085793/ regarding it. long story short, i feel the game should stay pvpve but they need to add more features that make it so its not so much of a pvp players constantly preying on pve players. they need to balance the scales a bit which would keep both parties happy if they are never going to add pve servers.

thats really all the complaints i have about this game. now just additional features id like to see

-legendary AI ship battles.
have there be legendary skull ships out there that are extremely powerful but are also extremely reward heavy. like a raid boss but on the open seas.

-add dog pets
we got cats, parrots, and monkeys. now all we need is our pet pup pirates to have the true salty dog experience

-let us name our ships
they got name plaques on the gallion already. they seem kinda weird when they're just left empty. let us name our ships to truely make them our own. (another thing with the character customization argument. let us make them our own)

-add ship interior cosmetics to buy
once more, let us make our ships our own. we got a lot of exterior cosmetic options. now all we need is interior. let us buy big fancy beds or luxurious rugs to really give our ships that personal touch.

thats pretty much it. I love the game. i truly do. theres so much to like about it. the exploring, the puzzle solving, the atmosphere, the feeling of adventure while sailing this grand ship you call yours. its not perfect. but theres still plenty to love about it. even if a good amount of people (including me) arent that big on the pvp aspect, we can still appreciate everything else. though like i said, the game does need work. hopefully rare can start on that said work as soon as this whole real life pandemic clears up.",1591429022,1591980447,True,0,0,0,7,True,False,False,76561198079760253,121,55,39665,609,5817,1602014991

This game can be challenging to play alone, but with others, it's not only smoother sailing... but it can be comedy gold. There is nothing funnier than a friend accidentally falling off the boat, or harpooning in a crew mate by surprise. 

But really, what sucks me in is that there is ALWAYS something to do. Whether you just want to sail around with no base objective, if you want to work on emissary voyages, or fort challenges... I have spent time simply going from shipwreck to shipwreck, swimming in the water around islands only to find chests and other interesting finds. It never gets old. And lemme just tell you, 20+ chests and you'll be SWEATING tryna get to the nearest outpost. It's a good kind of thrill.

My only couple gripes generally revolve around connectivity. Sometimes the game won't let me connect smoothly with people playing on console. It will allow you to add them as a friend, but when you go to invite them to your crew, the option remains grayed out. This problem seems to come and go and doesn't ever last for very long thankfully. 

Also, fishing. Seriously, why the fuck is it this hard to catch a tiny fish? And god forbid a rock is nearby and the fish swims towards it.

90,70665258,english,"Honestly the game is fun with friends, solo it can be one of the worst and most toxic experiences you can have in a game. Let me explain what I mean.

Picture this scenario, you're solo in a swoop, minding your own business, grinding on the Crescent Isle when you see a Brigantine roll up with 3 people. This is followed by a few simple steps: Get killed 3v1 because there is no chance you win that, wait for a respawn, spawn camped 3 v 1 and die almost instantly, wait for another respawn, and appear on a different island with an hour or two's worth of work down the drain because you didn't stop to turn in your loot after every drop. What's even worse is getting killed again by the same people immediately afterwards, spawn camped, ship sunk a second time, knowing full well you had little to no time to acquaint anything of value, is about the worst experience I have had in a PvP game. In a moment of frustration in a sinking ship I pulled out my cone and asked over voice chat ""Why did you kill me, you know I have nothing"". Followed by the voice of one of the three, ""Because it's Sea Of Thieves...""

This game is so close to being great, its a shame they let toxic people ruin the experience for me, among other solo players. I have had too many times where I thought to myself, ""wow I wish I didn't have to run from this Galleon/Brigantine right now"". Especially with doing story missions like tall tales. In my eyes tall tales are supposed to take this epic open world and actually craft this amazing story to follow of it's past, present, and future. In some aspects they actually do that and it's amazing to see some of the work done, especially with the Ashen Lord. But for a solo player it ends up being 'thank god there is a checkpoint system or i'd refund this game'. I say that because your at the will of the players around you if you actually get to do any of the quest. To give an example I had started a tall tale and as I was returning to my ship a Brigantine comes by and shoots a crew member onto my ship and tries to take some loot I had on board. I win the 1v1 but then I think to myself ""crap well now I got to leave so I don't get clapped by this bigger crew with a bigger boat."" so I leave where I have to be for the quest, while doing so seeing that they are an emissary on the map. I wait out of sight behind a nearby island and hope they leave me alone so I can do the tale. One hour later, then they finally leave and I can continue playing the game.

I love the atmosphere, The tall tales are fantastic, and playing with friends is something to behold. But I can firmly say without a shadow of a doubt playing this game solo is not worth your time. Maybe if they add more content, maybe if they add a mode where solo players can choose to have PvP off and they have a specific flag up so other players know not to waste their time. I think it would be amazing to roleplay as a trading pirate, chests for skulls, skulls for chests. But you can't do that unless you have a random person willing to not just destroy everything on sight as if its there duty to ruin all fun you could have. 

To wrap this review up, yes, I do realize you could read this and say 'get good' or whatever and if you feel that way so be it. I'm writing this to all the people who want to play this game majority solo so they fully understand what they are getting into. If a solo mega chad reads this and says 'get good', kudos, I bet you will enjoy the game and the challenges of being outnumber and outgunned 99% of all PvP interactions. However, to all my fun loving gamers who are in it for exploring a vast open world filled with loot and skeletons galore. Heed my warning, no matter how many Megalodons bite your ship, or Krakens wrap your ship up tight. Undead Pirate ships filling your swoop with more holes then thought possible. The thing that will cause you the most pain and ruin your experience will be another pirate who is just in it to ruin your day.",1591950297,1591950297,False,18,7,0.528825342655181885,4,True,False,False,76561198171025139,257,2,2323,320,1723,1601264445

We were perplexed and did not want to split the treasures so we took a bomb onto the unsuspecting fellows ships and blew it to smitherines.

I spent the entirety of my play time +a couple hours outside of the game just trying to get the game to stay connected to a server for more than 5 minutes, but never could. 2-5 minutes after connecting to a server I would get booted back to the menu with an error message. This happened every. single. time. Once or twice is a fluke, be I tried at least 10 times and got the same result every single time no matter what fixes I tried to do on my end.
Error message claims there was an interruption in my internet connection every single time, but I was in a discord call with the same friend I bought it for the whole time and we had no issues on that end.
After attempting and failing multiple times to resolve this issue I took to the discussions and looked online to ways to fix this only to find a very handy list of the game's error codes that doesn't list ways to fix them copy pasted to several sites.
So I reached out to Rare's tech support...
I never heard back.
Like I said, I wanted to play this game, but the game won't let me and support hasn't helped at all, so I'm forced to refund it so as to not have wasted my money on something I can't even play.

48,70399796,english,"I started this game thinking I was going to be exploring with friends with the occasional ship battles with other players. Edit: this is what the game sells itself as in the store page.

What I got: same loot over and over, there are like 20 items total, so it's never a surprise. The quests can be interesting, but all of it gets ruined by the main issue I've encountered - there is absolutely no reason to do anything. Nothing to aim for. There is no end game, no weapon upgrades, no armor upgrades, no ship upgrades, nothing. You can work towards having a cooler outfit or ship, but that's just not enough for me.

Edit: I understand there is other loot later on, but who wants to get that far while getting the same 20 items over and over for days?

Also if you play with one or two friends, expect to get harassed over and over by 4 people crews. This game could use a PvE option or a crew max limit for new players so that battles are always fair for those that are not familiar with how to take advantage of their type of ship yet (and this is where an MMR system would come in handy, but there isn't one).

The arena can be decent, but that's not what I bought this game for.

87,70640181,english,"The game is a gorgeous and innovative take on pirate games, and could have been a great deal of fun if not for a few key problems that completely ruin the entire game. Those problems are listed below, in no particular order:

- NO viable solo-player content. There are so many things to do around the ship at all times, each demanding their own separate ""interact"" mode, which together makes even steering your ship to an island something of a challenge. Actual naval combat is outright impossible alone, as you must simultaniously steer the ship and constantly adjust your heading, reload and man your own cannons, and repair holes being blown in your ship because you actually can't keep up with either of the other two. Unless you have a crew of 2-3 other people to play with, you can barely play the game at all and are functionally a sitting duck when you do. And those have to be people you personally know, as there is no matchmaking with randoms in the game that I've discovered.

-Toxic and inescapable PvP. The entire world is a PvP battleground with no safe havens whatsoever. Which can be fine, since it's a pirate game and some amount of fighting other crews for their loot is to be expected, but in this case only enables toxic spawn-campers and griefers to go out of their way murdering anyone and everyone they come across for the laughs. The community openly bullies you at every opportunity, which is every encounter, and there's no way to actually improve your skills at doing anything because of it.

- Server migration. Servers open and close constantly as players log on and off, and whenever the population of a given server drops below some hidden threshold it gets merged with a more populated server. In-game, this locks your controls and prevents you from moving or interacting with any part of your ship. Which in turn means it's incredibly easy to run yourself aground and lose your ship and the majority of loot you may have gotten. That's even if you don't get amazingly unlucky and spawn inside someone else, which simply deletes one of the overlapped ships and everything on them.

If none of the above bother you, somehow, then it's a great game that I highly recommend.

12,70631146,english,"I am enjoying my time with Sea of Thieves and am glad it finally came to Steam.

It really is an open-world pirate adventure, laden with quests, treasure maps, evil treasure guardians and a lengthy super quest (the Tall Tale) which gives a great experience too.

I read a lot of reviews of people complaining about being grieved. I had my fair share, but most sessions you really don't see anyone else. Although players amount is 50k on most times, the servers I play on are very scarely populated and you can play for hours and see no sails on the horizon (excepty for Skeleton Ships). 

Just earlier today some grievers thought it was fun to destroy my docked ship at an outpost while I was on land. When returning, my ship was burning and they made short work of me. So when you die you go to a ghost ship until you respawn with a new ship, usually several islands away. While I had unfinished business with a quest giver on that island, I set sail and sailed back to it. When approaching, I saw my grievers just loading their ship with gunpowder. Yep, one cannon shot on their ship and the whole ship exploded with a giant kaboom! They were unfortunate enough to be still on the ship and perished. The ship sank, I got their loot (9k worth) and revenge was sweet. This is just one experience you get when you play this game. 

Another time my ship was sunk by a galleon. I managed to respawn on my burning ship as it hadn't sunk yet. A quick jump in the water and I swam to the grieving ship. I tagged along for a while on the ladder, and made my move on deck. I was able to take two with me before I was killed by the 2 others, but this was also a great experience. Especially seeing them on the ghost ship with me. 

These sort of things really feel epic!

There are also friendly players ofcourse, but in my 4 encounters only one was a friendly one. Still, this doesn't mean that much as   I explained earlier, you can have sessions where you don't meet any other human players for hours.

There are a lot of quests to get, from a few different factions and completing them will net you reputation and allows you to get more advanced quests. But loot which you find (or steal) without quests active can be handed in by the specific faction trader for reputation and gold. 

There are some NPC enemies on the map too. Skeleton Ships, The Kraken and the Megalodon, not to mention fortresses which can shoot their cannons towards you too.  Furthermore, sailing in a storm is risky but can be a good way to lose any enemy ships.

With the curerncy you can buy new cosmetics for your character, ship and equipment. As ingame money is only used for cosmetics, this game is not pay to win or anything. You can spend real money too, but again, only for cosmetics.

A big mention must go to the graphics. The sea is out-of-this-world-beautiful. Really a joy to look at. Furthermore the weather effects, like storms, sunsets and sundowns are awesome too. The character and settlement aesthetic are Lucasarts-esque, a bit like Monkey Island 3, which will not suit everyone, but again, when you are at sea, there is so much awesomeness critics of the cartoony character models will forget all about it.

I recommend this game tremendously. PVP must be your thing, but with the amount of encounters I had in my 19ish hours of play, this really feels more like and PVE game, with sporadic PVP thrown into it. So it caters for both types of players.

There is a certain tension when you load loot on your boat, and really have to look out to the horizon for enemy sails. When you spot some, and your boat is loaded, more tension is gained as you race towards the closest outpost to sell your loot, especially if it is a bigger ship than yours. This tension is way less with no PVP so I think it is a great addition to the game as it really isn't overpowering like those famous shooters.

A friend, or more will help with surviving though, as a loner to stay on course, adjusting your sails, fix hull damage and shoot cannons can get frantic at times. Still when you manage to survive, the feeling is awesomesauce!",1591886022,1591886200,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198006647933,421,29,6330,0,1140,1597711219

After a few hours of hauling treasures with my friends it appears that there is some bug that prevents two of us(out of a party of 4) from using our hard earned gold to purchase items. After googling a bit it seems that this bug or glitch or whatever you want to call it has been in the game since 2018. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

The only point of getting money in the game is to buy more skins for your existing gear. There are no upgrades, nothing to unlock, no new features, no better ships or better weapons. Once you finish the tutorial you have every gear you'll get in the whole game.

The m/kb controls are bad. It's the typical early 2000s half-assed PC port type of game.

In game audio is terrible. Zero filter for noise and the audio quality itself is early 90s tier.

PVP is laughably bad. One single death animation. Players respawn(back in to the fight unless you totally sink their ship) after 10 seconds or so after death.

The only redeeming thing is that this game is fun when you have 3 other fun friends to play with. For a time. It gets boring fast as you discover the shallow mechanics behind the game.

This might be a worthwhile game if you're a parent and you want to play some video game with your 8 year olds and 9 year olds.

A bit barren of a start has been bolstered by content update after content update to make it a game worth playing. I started on launch day then got bored quickly, then came back for the Forsaken Shores update. Have been playing on and off fairly regularly since.

First off, obviously, the game looks and sounds beautiful, they mastered exactly the feel they were going for.
And they gameplay loop itself, while won't be everyone's cup of tea I find super enjoyable. Every time you boot up you're faced with a choice, ""What flavor of yarr do I desire today?""
Digging up chests, smashing some skulls, dueling in pvp, fishing for loot, story quests, or even just going out solely for the purpose of ruining someone else's day. All are valid on the Sea of Thieves.
A full crew off friends, getting up to as much or as little trouble as you'd like, all making new stories to share with your other buddies, thanks to the truly unpredictable nature of the game is where it really shines.

But something I myself like to do? Is load into a solo sloop, put the wind at my back and see where I go. What I'll find, what i'll do. It could be anything.

Sea of Thieves offers from calm to calamity and everything in between, and I'm excited to see where they continue to go.

69,70615610,english,"Holy shit.

Okay, so I wasn't entirely sure whether or not my friends and I would have fun with this game, but we all had the money for it, and a friend who gave it a positive outlook, and had experience. We bought the game, started playing and learning the ropes, and set goals for ourselves on what we need to do.

We took out many a ship over the time. Blew holes into ships. Plundered loot from monsters and players. Dug up mountains of treasures from islands across the sea of thieves. These events and quests we go on (for the sake of fortune, fashion, and glory) are fun escapades with a good feeling of satisfaction after we were done with them.

Today, we went on a voyage like we normally would, deciding to fly a flag that would multiply our rewards from fighting a fort of skeletons. Along the way, we saw a sloop, the smallest of the three ships. We knew that would be easy pickings if they contested us, so we loaded our galleons's cannons, the largest ship of the bunch, and just as we were about to fire we were told to parlay. The two people flew an alliance flag, and offered to help with our journey. 

We all fought together for ages, eventually beating the fort, and fending off a pesky crew of two that attempted to take us down. We fended them off, and escaped with our rewards. As alliances should, we split the rewards and headed back. We truly felt like we were pirates allying to take out a bigger, skeletal threat.

Afterwards, we were chased by the same ship that planned on taking us out. Bit of karma hit them, they got targeted by a Kraken the moment they went to chase us. We also sent a crew member to blow up their ship with a black powder keg. Revenge was sweet.

This experience left us all very happy, and feeling a sense of pride. Eventually we did need to depart from our allies, in which we did so after playing a shanty, all six of us.

This game is truly great in the state it is in now. I'm not sure if its too viable for solo players, but if you8 can get a small group together, and learn the game, I'm certain you'll have a blast. Hopefully not on your ship though.

7,70607941,english,"Disclaimer for a Great Game: The single biggest problem with Sea of Thieves is the cost of skins on their premium market, the price of a set of skins for your ship cost around 75% of the price of the game at full retail value, (aprox 30 quid for a full set of cosmetics for your ship) Its ridiculous. That's not to say there are free skins in game you can work towards getting, there are, however for a premium priced game there is ZERO justification for it. Having said that...

Sea of Thieves game play loop is super casual, its immensely satisfying. Just sailing around doing nothing and when you are searching for treasure the balance or threat and puzzles really works great to keep your interest. The interesting part is the PvP, its threatening but avoidable. A ships heading your way, fine, you can see it for miles off. You can bug out try to sail to the nearest port and sell your loot and no loss. Stay and fight, maybe steal their loot. Lure them to an island sneak aboard and maybe steal their loot. sneak on their ship in an ocean battle and chuck their loot overboard. Its great. 

The best part is losing your current loot has little consequence as anything you're handed in at an outpost is safely banked so if you die, fair play, hunt down your killer and make them regret it the next time they try. 

There's new story missions, lost of cosmetics, the game is beautiful. Totally worth the price.

17,70604898,english,"This game is great and I definitely recommend it, but I'm going to use this opportunity to gripe about the parts that I don't like in the hopes that they get changed.

There are only a few that I can think of but the worst is winning a fight with a ship/group only to have them chase you across the whole map over and over again because they're salty about being smashed the first time. Your supplies will run low over the course of being harassed while they get a fresh new ship with a bunch of cannonballs etc. Eventually you're going to sink unless they give up.

The only PvE enemy type on land is skeletons which is somewhat boring. I'd like to fight skellies on horses or bears or something, just more than the 4 flavours we have now.

During skelly brawls, keg skellies will pop out the ground right under your feet as you're swinging your sword and they'll nuke you without giving you the chance to react. Most of the time it's just disappointing, but when you're pressed for time because you're grinding forts it's a joke.

Sometimes there will be situations where you're fighting another ship and both ships run out of supplies, so both crews are venting water and no one can end the fight because there are no cannonballs left yet crew will carry on spawning with full HP to fight. In this scenario neither crew can break free from the stalemate and win the fight. Something needs to change because it's stupid.

We have different types of cannonballs including chainshot but I want a shotgun ball to crush skellies and players, like the cannister tank rounds in battlefield 3.

Everyone who gives this game a negative review probably sucks at PvP and gets rolled because they're trash. My group is pretty decent so we have tons of fun pulling up on people and splitting them in half. Git gud or go home.

Something that isn't too annoying but annoying enough is the way you still have to have an xbox live account to play on steam. I hate having to screw around with multiple launchers and the like. Admittedly this game is more or less fine once you link you accounts but it doesn't let you join a game in progress through the steam friends system - someone has to invite you, which makes no sense to me. 

One last thing - the nightshine parrot ship set is awesome, but my group hate the wheel due to  the fact that the centre spoke is too similar to the others. You can't tell where the centre of the wheel is as easily as you can on the others, especially at night.

[b]• First, [/b]adventuring by myself. Piloting the sloop is actually pretty simple, so you can do everything you need to take on the PvE quests. Plus, it's surprisingly calming. It's just you, the crashing of the waves, the cries of the seagulls, and the clink of coins. I get lost in the game for hours.

[b]• Second,[/b] adventuring with a crew of my friends. The galleon certainly requires a full crew of four, but it's still manageable. With the four of us, we're more confident engaging in fights, taking longer quests, and generally dicking around. The game isn't any less fun, but it trades serenity for chaos.

My only main complaint is that the maximum crew size is currently four, which is frustrating when I have five friends with the game. There's a system where you can team up with other ships, but that's mainly for finding randoms. There's no way to reliably get two crews of your friends into the same server, which sucks. They need to either make a bigger boat, or add support for fleets.

82,70590724,english,"I genuinely wanted to like this game and maybe in time this review will be irrelevant because of changes they make but in it's current state I can't say I do. To be frank I think the design of this game is really bad. A lot of people have mentioned the lack of progression and other factors wrong with this title but rather than that I would like to talk about what happens in sea of thieves if you make the mistake of playing without at least 4 competent players. 

Sea of Thieves rather then be what maybe a lot of people hoped this game would be which is a pirate game where you raid AI ships and compete for loot with other ships like some games have done in the past. You are likely the person getting raided unless you have a crew of 4 which all have a really strong skills towards the game. What baffles me more about all this is that the developers seem to be completely unsure of what to do with this dynamic. 


Getting all resources that you can sell in this game fall into one gameplay loop. First set sail for an island. Then do something on said island that nets you treasure. After that's done return to the port for your reward and repeat. That is the main gameplay loop in it's entirety with one factor omitted. At any point in these steps you can be raided or raid others for loot until the exact moment when the loot is sold to someone. The problem with this is that there is so much risk and time involved in getting these materials that it makes dying in sea of thieves and getting raided a real point of contention if not handled well in the design and this is where I think the game really falls apart. This game relies on player generated raiding and ship to ship fighting to be fun. That means yes big ships that are traveling the islands but also small ships that don't have the firepower and less people that will likely be more trading focused. However what the game does is down right malicious in it's design here. Light ships are actually slower than bigger ships in every case except when facing the wind. Take that in for a moment. That means that small radius of maybe 30 degrees is where your one gun on each side sloop has an advantage and the rest of that 330 degrees is all gravy for the much larger 3 gun on each side galleon stocked with 4 people chasing you. Oh and if you like that sailing against the wind means you have no control over your direction long term for your ship. So if you happen to run into some AI enemies randomly then your just f***ed. This could all be remedied by one simple change. Make the sloop faster, but the devs have had two years to work on this and never considered ""hey maybe the smaller ship with less people and less fire power shouldn't be at a disadvantage on the open sea?"". This one example kind of defines the entire experience of sea of thieves, it's a 4 player game with an option to play with less people at a penalty. 

If you are alright with that and you have four players to play with who are pretty good at games then ya go for it but if you have one or two friends and just want a fun chill experience riding the waves then play something else. Sea of thieves has a unbalanced hard mode and you just need to reduce your crew to play it.",1591807392,1591807392,False,5,2,0.439470112323760986,0,True,False,False,76561197988884448,213,2,288,0,288,1591721928

89,70589473,english,"At time of writing this - I'm 16.2 hours into the game. It's late, I should have gone to sleep hours ago and I played the last five hours straight. I am doing this early because I am so sure that by the time you read this - my gameplay hours will be much much more. This game has me absolutely hooked!

I see a lot of comments and concerns on whether you can play this game solo and fears it may be too hard or not competitive without a crew of online friends. This was a concern of mine coming in which was making me toss up whether to purchase or not. Stoked I made the right choice because every minute I've played so far has been Solo and I'm loving it. I'm able to go at my own pace and do what I want, when I want. I'm not worried about doing quests/voyages for my teammates and staying on longer so they can finish whatever. The people I have interacted with so far have been mostly very friendly so I'm sure I would have no problem finding a party online to team up but at the moment I'm happy! You do NOT need a crew to enjoy and do well in this game!

I think the coolest thing about this game is that each time you start the game. Whether you've put in 1 hour or 10,000 hours - you are starting over with the same kit as everyone else. The only difference is the custom skins to show off but they are purely cosmetic. It's crazy to me that when I log in now, even though I am still very new, that I am in the same position I was, same gear, same boat, same everything but now that I have that experience and have learnt the ropes, it's a whole new game.
When you log on for the first time, the stuff you start with is the same stuff the guy with 20,000 hours starts with. It is about your skill and experience but more than anything, how YOU want to play the game.

The game doesn't hold your hand and tell you that you have to go here or you MUST do X quest. You are completely free to explore and do whatever you want, so much more than the standard Open World games. It can be a bit daunting at first but you come to appreciate it so much. 

This game is a MASTERPIECE.
Visuals are fantastic and unique, the soundtrack is wonderful and fun. The story and pacing are unlike anything I've played.
10/10

Whereas the graphics and overall Atmosphere in the game are gorgeous to look at, controlling the ships feels quite immersive, the game loop itself is absolutely barebones, exploration is absolutely unrewarding since there are only about 20 different items to find, there are no levels, ugrades for gear, ships or whatsoever. All you can achieve in this game is gold (mostly through finding one of the..maybe 10 treasure items) which you can invest in cosmetics, that´s it. Yes, all you can play this game for is  cosmetics. 


Then there is PVP. In case you dont have a premade crew of 4-5 people so you can take advantage of sailing with the biggest ship, I would`nt even try engaging in any ship battle. With a small crew and ship, you will get sunk within a few seconds in naval battles, infiltrated by teleporting hackers (randomly appearing on your ship out of nowhere, not taking any damage) or pounded in land battles.

Even if you are new to the game or not a fan of PvP you can team up with the enemy pirates and make an alliance so everyone gets gold together. The journey to becoming a Pirate Legend is going to be filled with new challenges and lots of fun finding treasures and interacting with everyone in the seas.

Matchmaking with others works great. I've met people from all over the world and every adventure has been a unique experience and adventure. I just wish more people played with a microphone as this makes the adventure so much better. 

The variation of quests and things you can do in this game is perfect. I love finding rare items and chests on an island, like a message in a bottle that leads to a quest, etc. The sense of exploration is perfectly executed. I love trying to track down the treasure with maps, and the riddle quests are equally fun to try to figure out. Of course, the sense of danger is always there as there are always going to be some toxic idiots in games like this, but from my 30 hours experience it's rare. I've met more helpful and friendly people than those trying to pawn you. AND if someone were to attack and sink your ship. all you loose is the treasure you haven't turned in yet. So it's not the end of the world! It honestly wouldn't be fun if there were no sense of danger in this game. It really makes this game awesome! So you can't loose your ship or anything you have unlocked. The islands are also all so unique and after 30 hours i still haven't gotten the ""I've been here before feeling"" or i've done that exact quest before. It has not felt grindy in other words. They have thought this out very well. 

This is a MUST buy game if you like open world, especially survival games, adventures, pirate games, exploration or just want to try something completely unique and original.

Sea of Thieves is a breath of fresh air.... ummm i mean sea air... OH and be warned.. you might get a little sea sick at first, especially if you are sailing through a storm. The game can be that realistic!  Oh did i mention the ship battles are epic and SO much fun! 

Now off to my next epic adventure!

P.S. CAN YOU PLAY SOLO?? Yes you can play this game solo, and sometimes I like to just grab a Slooth (the smallest ship) and just cruise around and see what I can do by myself. But there are definitely HUGE pluses to join with others. You can earn money faster this way, as you all share the loot 100%. And of course there is safety in numbers. It's also ALOT of fun to work together sailing a ship, you get one guy on the helm, another on the sails, and another watching the horizon for any loot or threats. If you don't have any friends that play like me don't worry.. There is a MATCHMAKING system in place so you can easily join up with others and have a crew.

I've been waiting for this game to come out on steam ever since I first saw it. Since I'm exclusively a PC gamer, I couldn't play it before hand, but I was still really excited for the first really good looking nautical game I've seen in a long while. Boy oh boy was I in for the hoax of the year.

Well, the game took one look at those and said, ""Nah, let's just give you no noise at all."" I had to switch over to some old plug in earbuds to hear anything. So, strike one.

And then there's the game itself. I'm playing solo, which I know probably makes it even more difficult, but there's no tutorial. There's not even a hint of a tutorial. Hell, I couldn't figure out how to get out of a dialogue loop with one character, where I kept desperately keyboard smashing to try to get out of it. So, I fumbled my way through a few shops, because I had no idea what else I was supposed to do, then got to my ship, and proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes trying to steer and lower and raise the sails only to realize that there was an anchor I didn't know about because, oh yeah, the game never told me it even existed. I finally made my way to an island, crashed, got stuck, couldn't turn around or back up, and gave up with this disaster of a game. 

I'm going to be looking into getting a refund, just for how much of an utter scam this is. I don't know if it's the PC version that's a load of garbage, or if that's just the game itself, but it's a waste of time. If a game isn't immediately obvious how to play, developers should always include an optional tutorial.

Anyways. Please, please don't make the same mistake I did by buying this terrible game. I know it looks pretty, but the actual quality of the experience of playing it is one of the worst I've ever experienced.",1591754904,1591754904,False,4,10,0.186297133564949036,0,True,False,False,76561198248730574,48,6,39,0,39,1591754340

I have well over 150 hours total played and I love this game. It's definitely more fun with friends. There are a couple bugs within the game;

1. The Steam version locks the compass on the ship to North. It doesn't move.
2. If you have an RTX GPU, you'll occasionally see the grid lines from the map on the water itself. Rare is aware.

Overall, this game is amazing. It's a sandbox game with friends where you make the adventure. Want to just sail around and fish? Go ahead. Do you want to seek treasure for 10 hours? Go ahead. You want to hunt down other ships and steal all their chest and valuables? Go ahead.

Rare continues to unload free updates every couple months and is very good about feedback from players. 

During PvP, most people that I have encountered are all friendly and we all have a good laugh.

It is worth the money and I bought it twice. 

BUT, if you buy it from the Microsoft Store right now it's only $20.

19,70452717,english,"Played this game solo for 8 hours now and having a blast so far! The sailing and sea mechanics are an absolute joy - it's easy to learn, but difficult to master. Love the treasure seeking, shipwreck diving, fighting, etc. Ran into other players a couple of times. Once someone sailed my ship away from the harbor where I was docked, but as I had no treasure onboard, no big deal. I just respawned somewhere else. Most of my treasure hunting I have been left alone. Or at least by other players, as there are skeleton ships and huge sharks for example. 

I am sure some of the late content is going to be difficult solo, but so far, so good. Immensely enjoyable and extremely polished. And there is no character progression, just vanity items you can buy with the gold you can find by selling treasure. This is awesome!

Edit 10-6-2020:
Example of some the great emergent gameplay and Pirates of the Carribean like scenes:

- Being a cowardly pirate, the first encounter I won against another player, was when I picked on a ship anchored in front of an island.
- I peppered the ship with my cannons and fire bombs. It's owner came running from the beach, cursing. But alas, his ship had already sunk.
- As I was sailing away I saw chests and riches glistening in the water. The former captain desperately gathering his treasures from the wreckage into a rowing boat.
- I turn my ship around and I start firing on the rowing boat. I get a hit in and the enemy gets knocked into the water. I quickly anchor my ship and see him swimming towards me. He boards my ship, we exchange a few shots and he gets knocked into the water again. I jump in after him and kill him with my saber.
- Now, taking a look at his rowing boat, I see it's filled with plunder. This is when I get really excited. Greedy and also afraid other pirates will show up, I start a mad dash to bring all the chests on my ship. There is just too much plunder, so halfway there I decide to dock the rowing boat to my ship. I set sail to the nearest harbor, to sell my newly acquired riches.
- Halfway towards the relative safety of the harbor, the sea below me darkens and a Kraken appears. Starting to panic, as this is my first encounter with the beast, I quickly lower my rowboat and jump aboard. Just in time to see my ship being torn apart, sinking and taking a good part of my new found stash into the waves. Had I not taken the rowboat with me, my life would have ended right there.
- The rowboat still has at least half the loot, so I start to frantically row away. However, one of the tenctacles of the Kraken grabs me and somehow I grab one of the treasure chests as I get lifed from the boat. I can't slash at the tentacle with the chest in my hands, so I have to drop a chest full of treasures into the sea. A real noteworthy moment, as I didn't want to let go of my precious gold, but my life was more dear to me in the end.
- I get the tentacle to drop me, I quickly swim to my rowboat, glistening treasures floating around me everywhere. Ignoring the chests, I jump in my boat and I manage to row away. 
- Once in the harbor it takes me a couple of minutes to unload all the chests and sell the contents, many gems, goblets and other trinkets, so great was this stash. Once finished the beach near the boat is littered with open, discarded chests. 
- Amazing gameplay for me, though the captain I robbed will likely think differently...",1591553506,1591744335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002581627,227,58,3734,0,536,1600591461

I've had a blast playing it so far but despite the large amount of content already in the game I feel its lacking somewhat in areas. I know the game is constantly being developed and having new expansions but these are my thoughts on what I think would be great to see as additions, like;

A gambling system like poker, blackjack, or a pirates of the caribbean classic liars dice

A event or ""boss"" that would force players to have to work together to fulfill it not like the fort of the damned but another ship based boss featuring a Man o War or something of the like that is incredibly difficult

More customization of the ship, I love that you have premade models the sloop, brig, and galleon. but I feel like they should be more customizable so each ship is unique and gives more of a personal feel to them this would be incorporated by simply making the captains cabin or other aspects of the ship open for customization such as barrel, lantern, chests and other items that can be kept.

I also love the attention to detail this game has but another addition that would definitely be difficult to do but I think everyone would love to have is an ocean expansion that similar to sunken ships is available with scuba diving gear or something of the like which would unlock the exploration of the ocean floor.

Also as I have written previously I like the three ship system but I feel like in order to counter certain aspects of ships as well as more versatility we should keep the system but add a subsystem that give three different variants of each ship, one for offense, one for defense, and one for speed and storage capacity. Of course the details would have to be tested and tried but I feel like it would change the game for the better.

47,70553165,english,"This is a great game, I was very excited when it came out for Steam because I didn't want to deal with Xbox's shitty Microsoft app. That being said, I've noticed there have been some bugs in the Steam version that I didn't experience in the xbox app but it also literally just came to Steam 6 days ago so I imagine some of the bugs will be worked out.  

Bug 1
The issue I'm specifically experiencing is that the ship compass is stuck to North.  Regular compass in my inventory still works so it's more of a mild frustration than a colossal deal breaker. This reddit post seems to indicate that this is primarily an issue for AMD processors, as Intel processors don't seem to experience this issue (I of course have AMD)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/gwj9ih/searching_the_seas_compass_stuck_on_north/

Bug 2
This was an issue that also existed in the xbox app, sometimes the game won't send invitations, or let me invite people. In the xbox app I could join a session in progress, but I don't seem to have that option in Steam. (For the record, I'm aware you can join games in steam, I'm able to join games for any other game on steam except for SoT).  

That being said, I would say I've had a lot more fun in this game than not. I've just started playing recently, but a lot of my friends confirm that there have been a lot of great changes since the game first came out. 

Really my biggest issue with this game is that I find myself in situations where either all of my friends want to play with me (i.e. two crews of 3 looking for a 4th) or no one wants to, or is able to play (really wouldn't recommend playing solo in this game).  I haven't checked out the Sea of Thieves discord server myself, but I hear it's pretty popping, and a reliable way to find more people to play with than the game's matchmaking system. 

Game would be a lot cooler if you could load two ships in, or if they just increased the player cap to 5 or 6 on Galleon (largest ship).   Anyway, I like this game, but it might not be for everyone.",1591733738,1591733738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198093586889,87,4,3440,0,541,1595725414
48,70434823,english,"This is easily one of the most immersive, satisfying and terrifying games I have ever played, and I have loved every single moment of it.

Sea of Thieves is a always online PVP Pirate Simulator, and is brutal for new players because of this, seriously this game only tells you the bare bone basics, as for the rest, you need to figure out yourself, and since it's online, running into hostile players is common.

[b] Pros [/b]

The game looks amazing, I love the water and lighting.

It runs on older PCs quite well, while I'm not sure how good mine specs is, it doesn't run most modern games well like Doom without cutting into the graphics big time, however I've had very few performance issues with this game and when I did, just turning the graphics down slightly fixed it.

The physics of the ship bouncing in the water adds some awesome challenge when it comes to sailing and ship combat.

The sound effects for the weapons and enemies are amazing.

Everything you do is satisfying, from shooting, digging up treasure, sailing, setting up the mast, lowering/raising the anchor, everything I do brings a big smile to my face.

Has Rare's classic sense of humour, including their writing for characters, and stuff you can do, like launching yourself out of cannons.

Also has multiple references to Rare's classic games (please add them to steam, I love Rare so much)

Indepth customisation, from your pirate, to your ship, equipment and pet, seriously there's a lot of stuff to make your pirate the way you want!

You can play music, and when other players join, the instruments sync up to make some Sea Shanty Fun for everyone!

[b] Neutral [/b]

Since it's always online, regardless of who you are, you're gonna run into other players, they will either ignore you, maybe try to be friends, or worse attack you, it's hard to tell what's going on since the best way is via a flag which is ontop of the crow's nest, but even then it might be a trap.
Single players are gonna be hit hard the most with this, since having an actual crew gives you a huge advantage in fights.

The game tells you next to nothing about the game, I like it since it encourages experimentation to see what works in this game, but at the same time, I couldn't do quests for my first 3 hours, as I had 0 clue on how to activate them (but the way you do it is kinda cool, go to the Captain's Quarters, and you can start a vote on what quest to do.)

It has crossplay, meaning you'll run into Xbox and Microsoft Store players who have had a lot more playtime then you, I've seen them help other players like myself, raid other players like myself, and having their mic always on with every single thing in the background going on while talking to you... which happened to me... seriously Xbox players stop it, I don't want to ask you to say what you said over and over again, just because you have a hoover and washing machine turned on next to you.

When you die in single player, or when your ship sinks with your crew, or if you disconnect, you lose all items not tied to your account (Account stuff being Cosmetics, currency, pets etc, while the stuff you lose is like Wood, Treasure, Cannonballs, Food etc, so you'll start fresh everytime you login, I like this, but at the sametime I do wish you can store more cannonballs and food so you can go do a mission straight away, but I can imagine people hoarding them and unleashing hell on other players can be a major issue.

[b] Cons [/b]

While the game does say it needs Windows 10 to be played, many games have this too, and can be played by older OS, but this game NEEDS Windows 10, I had to upgrade from 8.1 to 10 to play this game (Worth it imo) but it needs to be more clear since Steam has many types of OS's running it.

I've seen some bugs relating to ships, I had one where mine got dragged underwater for no reason and it respawned at the outpost I was at not too long before, I've also seen others bounce away from docks too, but these are rare.

I had a few crashes relating to my video driver, I lowered the graphics a bit, still crashed, finally manged to update them, and so far no crashes and I hope it stays like that, losing all your items because of 1 crash is very unfair.

The game doesn't have traditional progression, the tools you start of with, are the same ones you keep till the end game, the only real progression are cosmetics you buy via gold, but there's enough items to keep you happy for a very long time.

49,70552490,english,"Definitely the best pirate game out there. This game is super fun and satisfying to play. Just sailing the sea feels incredible. There are plenty of voyages to complete and islands to explore. Also, multiple people sail in the same sea, so you will run into other player ships, and you'll have to decide to attack, make peace, or flee.  There are also fortresses to attack for major rewards. Though, there is a huge high risk high reward factor for this game. Even if you just got a major score, don't get comfy until you've sold all of it. While sailing you can get attacked by sea monsters or other players, or someone might loot your ship while you're selling everything. This is what makes the game so thrilling. My only big problem with the game is that I can't recommend it to people who have no people to play with. You can sail with randos, but it's rare to get a solid crew. If you got at least 2 people to play with, I think it's worth the $40. If no, I'd hold off for a sale.

76,70543488,english,"So, I’ve wanted another good pirate game since Sid Miers pirates back in the early 2000s. This game is definitly what I have been waiting for. It’s fun. I actually feel like a real pirate. The ships handle like I imagine a real ship would. You have to manipulate the sails, rigging, anchor, guns, wheel, crows nest, etc. It really feels like I’m on a ship.  I recommend this game obvisouly, but there are a few disclaimers and suggestions I’d like to mention to potential readers and hopefully the developers.

Disclaimers: There isn’t much actual progression. Aside from earning domestics. You’re still EXACTLY the same on hour 1000 as you are on hour 1. Literally. No exaggeration.
Also playing solo is much more limited in enjoyment. Having a crew of 3+ is where the game gets god teir.

Suggestions to developers: 
1) Add more ships one I could think of would be an up to 6 person ship called “Ship of the line” (I’m shameless taking ideas from Sid miers pirates here. But the other ships you have are in that game as well)
2) Add more permanace to the ships. What I mean by this is loot should be able to be carried between sessions at least. I know that this would raise the possible abuse of players logging out when they are gona lose a ship battle. Easy fix. The players have to have the ship anchored at port and not in combat to be able to log out safely,  This would make it feel like I’m at least working towards something instead of my ship resetting every time i log off. Also I saw someone raise the valid concern on whose ship out of the crew would get the loot? Again easy. Make a new type of que as captain so that you can associate all the loot with them. Players could still have the option to join ships in open parties or captain them in open parties. But I see this benefit primarily to me and other closed party players.
3) More guns and maybe fun upgrades. Again it kinda sucks that I haven’t gained anything with my playtime. I’m still the same aside from a cooler sail and flag. Maybe add different types of cannons and guns that can be upgraded to. For example on cannons we could have 8 pounders base, but maybe were allowed to upgrade to 16, 32 pounders or a howitzer mortar. 
4) The world feels a bit empty. Perhaps have some more AI pirates around, or better yet. Have AI merchant ships you can  engage with to board or sink to take some loot.
5) The grappling hook sucks. It doesn’t make it easier to dock and it sure doesn’t make it easy to board. Make the grappling hook stuck on the object it hits until the crew reals it back in or it is wackes off with a sword. Idk many be 5-10 hits or something. I’d like to have boarding fights too. Also make it actually reel yourself closer to what you’ve hooked. Enemy or dock,
6) Were getting into smaller suggestions now, but maybe have like paintings and loot that can be hung on walls (or sold) if you make customization of inside ships more doable. Also maybe make the barrels and tables and stuff inside the ship moveable. I know some things are where they are for balance, but some free range on my ships would make it feel more mine.

Thanks for your time and thanks for a great game.

[list] ✅ Pros:
 [*] Beautiful artistical graphics, for a cartoony game released in 2018, its one of the most beautiful graphics I've stumbled onto so far.
 [*]Has A LOT of customisation options ranging from clothing, pets, weapons all the way onto ship decoration.
 [*]Quite a bit of content with ever so increasing arsenal coming with every update from Microsoft.

TL/DR: Stay FAR AWAY if LeEtmINMaxpLAYErkILLeR style is not for you!

Unfortunately this game still lacks the most basic explanations, tutorial, quality of live functions and multiplayer balancing.
Game: ""Get sunk too frequently? You can wobble yer snoffle!"" Me: ""Yes, I am! How?"" Game: NIL
Want to learn at least the basic functions by yerself? Haha, nope! Everyone and everything kills you (PvP and PvE) if yer alone. There is no ship that's good to handle alone.
Once you reached the first few levels with a faction the tasks clearly and only are optimized for multi player with no option to get back and do some more carebear ones.
Hell and bad weather, I got constantly sunk by environment and NPCs trying to deliver some of the most basic cooked fish to the hunters call!
See something shiny blinking on the shore of a smol beach on a very smol island? Do never ever go there! Chances are there's a skellie captain ganking you and one time I reached the shiny, it blinked red and the world detonated! Explanation what that was? Zilch.
Get ready to Alt-Tab to your browser constantly to look up the most basic mechanics of this game. And even without that it takes a looong time to get to even the slightest sliver of progress with a 90% chance that you get killed or your ship sunk before you can turn it in.
Ah yis, and of course noone wants to play with beginners anymore :D if your lucky ppl are letting you follow and help a bit but be ready to never be able to experience the game as an enjoyable progression.
Did I mention that the devs didn't get around to character growth of any kind? No chance to better your char by grinding and taking on the hard missions after you outgrew the non existent multiplayer balancing.
Seems like the devs ran out of cash and just decided ""Heck this, we're declaring it 'pure multiplayer' and see what happens."" Newsflash, the casual and relaxed player demographic is far bigger and has far more disposable income!
Remember kids: If you don't have a good foundation it doesn't help to build more and more on top. Who'da've guessed!

Devs, there's an easy fix.
Let me set the map parameters from the main menu and scale the rewards and progression accordingly.
Crew size: 1/2/3/4
Multicrew: Yes/No
PvP possible: Yes/No
Environment hostility: 1-10 (or similar)
Bonus point for adding a boot that is optimized for one player.
But then again, you have given up already, haven't you? I mean, trying to sell cosmetics too leetminmaxpvpers? Come on...

I declare this game unplayable and unlearnable in this state.
As a newbie you are currently just fodder to keep the bored vet players entertained.

Upon turning in our loot my compatriot was struck by lightning but lived to tell the tale, we proceeded to find a safer harbor where we could get ripping drunk on fine ale. 

Here's the thing, none of that was scripted. It all just happened organically. The devs here have created a game that is just plain fun and have given players a lot of options for how to find their own flavor of fun. Even just sailing a ship around is enjoyable because you have to mess with the sail, pay attention to the wind, navigate, and steer the ship.

I found myself crewing a galleon with some friends of dubious skill.  We were bumbling our way around the islands, digging up long-lost treasure chests.  Having sold our booty for a tidy sum, we spotted a player brigantine in the distance.  Deciding to raise the Jolly Roger, we set a course to catch them.

Suddenly, on the port side, a skeletal ship rose from Davey Jones' locker and began to attack us.  Our prey had meanwhile fallen victim to the kraken!  We fought valiantly, and one of us boarded our skeletal foes, but I was blown clear off the deck by a rogue cannonball.  By the time I was able to swim back, our ship had succumbed to her wounds and sank.  With me and two of my shipmates in the rowboat, we did all we could do; we rowed into the kraken attack!

Between the tentacles we sailed and climbed aboard that brigantine.  We manned their cannons and patched their hull, one by one of us being picked off.  We sliced a tentacle that had wrapped itself around the ship clean off, and when the dust settled and the kraken slain, only I stood of my original group, along with the new crew. 

Taking a short rest, we were beset upon by more skeletal ships!  Running low on ammunition, a brave soul boarded the enemy vessel with a barrel of gunpowder.  Determined to find some firebombs to set their ship alight, I jumped between our ships and was blown clear of the melee, out to sea.  I was never going to catch either vessel, so I floated alone and contemplated my fate until I was rescued by a fair mermaid.

Having finished up some more treasure hunting, we decided to call it a night.  One of us left the ship early, leaving three of us to crew the galleon.  We made our way to the nearest outpost, and managed to skillfully sink some NPCs along the way.  While cleaning up the last bit of loot, I hear a voice in the water... ""I don't think they see me yet.""  ""Is this a good idea?  You saw what they did to that other ship.""

Our first uninvited guest was greeted with my blunderbuss to his face.  His friend in their tiny sloop pushed off from the outpost and headed our way.  What followed was a 90 minute knife fight.  Outmaneuvered and outgunned because we were low on cannonballs, I rammed the galleon into the outpost and dropped anchor.

Screaming for my crewmates to grab out loot and sell it, my wife and I held our attackers at bay and took turns boarding each other's ships.  We were all killed many times.  Finally, all the loot secured, the raging fires were too much and our galleon sunk to the bottom.  From the water, I pulled out my bullhorn and shouted ""joke's on you, we already sold all the loot!""

What I heard back was ""that's ok, we were bored anyway"" in 12 year old squeaker.  All I wanted to do was sell my loot and go to bed, dammit, and now it's after midnight.

This has to be quite possibly one of the most underrated games out there. It never got the love it deserved on release and I feel like if it would have come to steam on release it would be so much more popular than it is. A lot of the negativity aimed at this game boils down to two things:

1) No real progression
People often complain about how there is no true progression. The progression in this game is purely cosmetic and for the sense of accomplishment for the things you achieve like attaining ""Pirate Legend"" status. I feel like the game is fun enough to look past the fact you can't upgrade your ship or weapons; farming for a really cool skin for  your boat or weapon and putting it on is the way I see the ""upgrade"" side of things.

2) PvP
People claim the Arena game-mode is trash to which I have to agree; the mode basically pits numerous ships in a closed off area of the map to fight it out for 15 minutes and whoever has the most score at the end wins. It sounds fun but in the majority of the games there are AFK ships and leavers which means it's only a couple of ships actually playing the game which is not what was intended. The PvP in Adventure mode (which is the games main mode) can suck [at times] for both PvP & PvE players. There are a few reasons for this; one of them is that the map is so big and the server has limited ship slots that sometimes the PvP players have a really hard time finding anybody and when they do, they usually flee forever until the PvP'er eventually gives up. PvE players complain about playing in a sloop (1-2 player ship) on their own and getting ganked and sunk by a team of 4 in a galleon (1-4 player ship). People seem to forget that this is a PIRATE game and pirates STOLE from other ships. I see noobs crying for there to be PvE only servers but this defeats the entire purpose; PvP players need PvE players to exist so they have people to rob from and get their enjoyment out of the game. The game would absolutely stink if you didn't have to worry about a gang of pirates rocking up and stealing your hard earned loot.

Graphics are a bit arcade/cartoony but still incredible. The graphics of the water stuns everybody who looks at them and I would argue they are the best in any game I've played.

16,70251145,english,"Before we get on with the review and my thoughts on this game, I should inform the reader (you) that there are some things that you need to know before setting sail for your pirate adventure on the Sea of Thieves;

First and foremost, I've owned the Microsoft Store version of this game for about a year or so with a frustrating curse, in which I could not actually play the game on my computer due to the Microsoft Store parameters being so fidgety (go figure), but I have logged some hours on the Xbox and only a couple when miraculously it would run for an hour or two on my computer... only like 2 times. I've had previous experience with this game and it's quirks, and now that it's on Steam all seems to be well and enjoyable at last.

Second, both Adventure & Arena game modes are open PVP only, meaning you can chose to engage other player crews if you want to, but that being said you will DEFINITELY encounter griefers who are out for more than just gold and doubloons... their after your utmost sour of salt.

Third and lastly, You can take treasure from other players with the repercussions of them defending their haul, however there are lots of treasure chests and other booty to be found lying around on islands or floating wreckage out at sea... be careful who you chose to attack.

Now, onto the review portion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Rare announced Sea of Thieves back in 2015-2016 (can't exactly remember when) I had a VERY high hype vs. standard margin, So many Pirate oriented games have been attempted with varying amounts of success and notoriety; everything from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag to Blackwake have seen some success and have made good on the promise of a pirating experience, so I had my hopes up in this being the next big Pirate video game since even the days of The Secret of Monkey Island... it didn't disappoint. Sea Of Thieves is a wonderfully crafted and stylized open-world pirating adventure experience that puts you in the sea water drenched boots of your very own pirate character, with no backstory or big arcing plot, to freely sail the seas and search for treasure on your own, or with a crew of up to 4 people! (officially, you can still get with more players and form even bigger raiding parties with party chat on Discord or whatever)

The setting and backdrop for this adventure is set in a hand made ocean called, you guessed it, The Sea of thieves. All the islands you come across are handcrafted and unique from one another, no two islands will ever be the same in the map layout. But beware on your journeys, for there be sea monsters lying in wait for a ship to sail past for a nice snack; The Kraken & Megalodon make appearances from time to time and can deal a might blow to even the most best laid plans of any pirate captain. You can take control of one of three unique ships; The Sloop, The Brig, and the Galleon, depending on your multiplayer preferences and the size of your crew.

The aesthetic and Graphic presentation of this game are B-E-A-Utiful, The most eye catching aspect is the water effects and how surreal-yet-realistic they made the water with those shaders. The semi-cartoon look and feel of the game give it a unique character all of it's own, with gorgeous shades of color from the greens of the palm leaves to the tans and browns of the sands to the deep blues of the sky & sea. All aesthetic parts of this game bring together a mosaic of eye candy and glorious immersion into a hand-crafted world. Dynamic weather also plays a role in the aesthetic and sailing mechanics of Sea Of Thieves, with ravenous thunderstorms swallowing up your ship and flooding below deck as well as sending you off course and disabling your ship's compass. And let's not forget Franklin's worst enemy besides tyranny... LIGHTNING, hitting the main mast will set the ship a blaze!

Combat is a pretty standard thing when it comes to the game's player conflict, a sword and a small assortment of firearms are available to use but only so satisfying every once in a while. Swordplay is a simple 3 swing n' slash combo that can be blocked up until the final blow that breaks the block of the defending party, holding down the attack button (the left mouse button) will charge an attack for about 2.5 seconds and lunge forwards towards wherever the player is aiming, this can come in handy for dashing into water and escaping a losing fight or braking someone's defense in a sword fight. Guns, such as the Flintlock pistol, come with a woeful 5 shot capacity that must be refilled via the ammo box located on your ship or scattered on  islands, make every shot count! the other firearms are the Blunderbuss, a pirates favorite scattergun, and the Eye Of Reach, a pirate crafted musket rifle with a cracked scope for farther targets. All of these weapons have their disadvantages and unique perks that allow them to be used in certain situations, the pistol is probably the best to keep on hand when exploring alone or while scouting ahead of your crew.

The ship controls are designed to be as realistic as possible, while still allowing an arcade-like ease of use to better the sailing experience. To start off, lower the main sail, turn the helm (the steering wheel on a ship) to the direction you want to head in, and finally weigh the anchor (pull it up). Once you've started off, head back to your wheel and get to open waters. Now once your clear of hitting anything and feel the coast is clear of other pirates, head below deck and read over the map to see where you are and what you want to do. The game uses with basics of learning realistic skills, such as map reading, compass orientation, sail adjustment for maximum efficiency and predictive maneuvering and steering.

When it comes to the gameplay between players, that's where things can really heat up. Most players in Sea of Thieves tend to stick to themselves and avoid unwanted attention... there are, however, those that wish to plunder the hard working privateers that seek treasure solely from maps and riddles (it is a pirating game, after all). You can chose however you like to engage or flee fro other players, be social or be destructive... there's no limitations to how you handle the interactions. As for a more competitive gameplay atmosphere, the Arena is where you should look; A frenzied dash to gather treasure from different locations before the other teams/crews can amass a fortune greater than yours.

Of all the features mentioned so far, there is one feature that I, as well as many others, are really happy to see missing in this particular experience... No Pay-2-Win micro-transactions to be found! The only micro-transactions that are available are strictly cosmetics for your pirate, your equipment and your ship, that's it. everyone starts off with the same equipment and with a ship without any difference in level, experience, weapon variation or difference in damage tables. 

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

there are some small nit-picks I would like to add just for the sake of a fair review and not a gushing piece about how much I think this game is awesome;

-The servers on steam are brand new and slightly laggy (though it might also be my internet being faulty for the past week or so).

-The respawn system for the entire game takes about 2 seconds too long.

-The Blunderbuss (mentioned earlier) has woeful range and doesn't do as much damage as you would expect unless you've softened your target first.

-Swordplay is too simplified and gets boring or even frustrating if you are not looking DIRECTLY at the target.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above all, I would recommend this game a thousand times over just for the world and open-ended experience Rare have crafted for players.

Awesome game! I own it on every platform it has been released for, but steam integration just feels right, so the purchase made sense! 

Ship-on-Ship battles are incredibly satisfying but even more satisfying is sneaking aboard another vessel and setting off a TNT barrel! 

The game is very sanboxy in terms of the environment but pretty linear when it comes to missions - that said, with friends it can be a very fun and long game where you take on everything from skeletons to pirates, the Kraken and more!

but 3 days in i got the biggest software joyride of my life
It all started with the error code lavenderbeard i curse the day i set eyes on him, he was the worst person i ever met. he killed me and my friend at a dock while yelling ""I'm gonna clap those cheeks"". And clap our cheeks he did, well mine anyway. You see he stole my .pak file, the man corrupted and gave it back to me. I knew something was up the moment he showed his ugly mug. Alas i called upon the proper authorities, IT people they call themselves. But it was all for nought, they gave me a riddle about port forwarding and UpNps and Nat types. i was able to deduce what the meaning was however i was unable to fix this issue. My .pak file has been fixed however as i have tossed it overboard as the junk it was and happened upon a new one. Alas the dreaded Lavenderbeard still plagues me to this day. I hope neither i nor you run into him or his galleon ever again. 

My tale continues: Lavenderbeard has been struck down, i had disguised myself as one of his crew members and hit him over the head with a soggy fish. I can finally sail upon the Sea of Thieves and claim my treasures.

Thank you for listening to this old fools tale of woe. For i am nought to sale the Sea of Thieves again until this Lavenderbeard is gone.

Will you try to take theme out before they notice you?

This game is definitely amazing for what it is and is a bunch of fun to play with friends or other people but every game is so it staying alive based off that alone doesn't give it much to stand on. Servers are very limited with numbers of ship so pvp is pretty rare and you often end up fighting the same ship over and over. Bounties (quests) start to feel like more of a chore than a fun experience and the rate at which you earn gold verse how much the in game cosmetics cost is super unbalanced.

PRO :
1. It's the most immersive Pirates game, yet (feels like being capt. Jack Sparrow instead of Luffy One Piece)
2. The Sea are amazing
3. Kraken, Megalodon, Ghost Ship
4. All purchasables are cosmetics only.

However, The game is not to fun solo you get bored pretty often doing the same quests over and over again. Although they prevent a pay-to-win it also doesn't allow for anything to look up towards, you could grind all you want but there are no upgrades, no weapon boost, nothing to even buy expect for skins for weapons and your ship.

Pretty cool experience for a solo player, but this game SHINES with a few buddies. Just to clear up, there is no PvE or Singleplayer gamemode. There's always the risk of your ship being raided, but that is the risk&rewards that keeps you going (kinda like Tarkov).
Besides, if you keep crying about being raided and there being no PvE mode, your gained currency can literally only be spent on cosmetics, so you're not even losing that much when you get raided.
Yes it's frustrating, but that's why you get some buddies and learn to defend yourself or scare others away.

91,70502263,english,"I recommend this game but there are a few things to note.

First to note is the gameplay loop. It seems weird to say that this game has a Dark Souls mechanic as the main loop but hear me out. You set out for treasure or bounties and the like, once you've the treasure or killed the bounty you have to make your way to an outpost to cash them in. You do not get anything if you don't make it back and cash them in. So if your ship sinks, all the treasure and bounty skulls are left there where it sank. Now to be fair, the gold you get is only for cosmetics to your outift and ship and since there is no way to get more powerful via XP (or any means really so everyone is on an even playing field), the only other thing you don't get is Reputation with faction you were going to sell to. Rep basically just gives you better paying jobs to do. So all in all, losing a haul can be sad or frustrating, especially when taken by another player, it's nothing that can't be gotten back pretty easily.

Second of all is Seasickness. I don't mean in the game either. Every time I play I get a headache so I can only play for a few hours at a time. i attribute this to two things, the first being the FOV. The max FOV is 90 while I normally play First Person games around 100-110 so 90 is a big step back. i've looking for a way to increase it but to no luck since it being an online game you dont want to mess around in the files. The second reason I think would be the up and down movement of the ship. In most games you mainly move horizontally and while vertical movement is there, it is normally under your control. You might think that maybe this is caused by me being new to games or something but I can say that's not the case, one look at my profile should how much I put into games that such a thing isn't the case. 

Other reviews have done a good job of covering issues and positives but i didnt see anything about these two. If this gameplay loop seems interesting I would totallly give it a try. With constant updates and plenty to do, this is a very fine game. 

I hope to see you on the Seas, matey.",1591642997,1591642997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022093050,437,5,505,8,497,1601193564

[h1]Simple but Pleasing[/h1]
Not enough game developers get that making a game does not have to centralize around extreme realism. A game does not need to be physically demanding to look nice. SOT is a prime example and not enough developers get that these days. It's all about blowing people's gpu up these days or forcing people to buy a 1-thousand dollar gpu (Red Dead 2 anyone?).

[h1]Striking Resemblance[/h1]
The first game that popped into my mind was [b]Elite Dangerous[/b], concerning Sea of Thieves. The two games are on a tangent of sorts. Elite is a space simulation game with more 'hardcore' mechanics. Everything takes an extended amount of time, the map is gargantuan (which is not necessarily a good thing), and options for full flight control, which can become difficult to manage without a hotas.

Elite is a simulation game. It has a lot of space. Too much space at times, but space nonetheless in a very raw form. You have your ship, you're in the 'main server' with everyone else, and  you're free to do whatever. Pirate, combat, mine, explore, hostile pvp'ing (ganking, griefing, etc. done beyond reason), or whatever else you may want to do. Free universe and players are free to do as they please in a very unrestricted format.

[h1]Simulation Differences[/h1]
If you are familiar with [b]Elite Dangerous[/b], it is very much not ideal to get 'blown up' by other players. Other factors such as upgrades (engineering as its called) that can offset encounters very much so; however, due to the map size, it is trivial, at best, to avoid people. Learn the hotspots, avoid them, or prepare for it.

Sea of Thieves takes a more friendly approach. They know what they're getting into. A PvPvE with almost 0 restrictions. How to make this fun despite that? Strangely, quite simple:

[list]
    [*]Everything is unlocked for everyone
    [*]No 'upgrades'
    [*]Virtually 0 penalty for dying, losing ship, etc.
    [*]Fresh, equal start whenever logging in
[/list]
This enables players to quickly get in the game and mitigate the encounters with overly hostile players.

[h1]Simulation Variety[/h1]
[b]Sea of Thieves[/b], on its foundation, is not an outright simulation game, but due to its own nature, it turned out to be one for specific areas. It primarily simulates the art of sailing and use of individual tasks. This, in turn, compliments a player's immersion as if they're the lone pirate, sailing their own ship by themselves. Its calm, liberating, and quite fun. 

As with [b]Elite[/b], vocations have a striking resemblance. Pirating, npc combat, exploring, cargo runs, looting. 

Keep in mind, as per simulation, these things will take time, especially the sailing and navigating. Setting aside 1-2 hours may be necessary.

[h1]Pleasant Surprise[/h1]
I did not go into [b]Sea of Thieves[/b] expecting it to be an unintentional simulation game. Certainly, there are quite a few 'arcade mechanics', if you will, attached to it. Solo, despite being a game encouraging coop, is remarkably fun, and if encumbrance sails your way, the game makes it more than easy to get away from it with a fresh spawn. 

[b]Who knew Sea of Thieves was a part Simulation game. That aspect is certainly not advertised well enough as it makes for an incredibly immersive experience.[/b]",1591545836,1591632746,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,76561198217201316,186,135,4463,0,1002,1599262744

+ graphics are nice
+ controls system is working
- story quests are awful and boring: some puzzles are well done, others are a pain in the a**, what you do is that you sail over half of the map which takes you 15-30 minutes, then you solve a riddle or dig out a chest or kill skeletons only to sail again to the other end of the map
- the sailing itself is extremely boring, there is just nothing to do. you occasionally get attacked by sharks or ghost pirate boats, but they dont pose any threat, you shoot the share 2-3 times when it gets close than it disappears, you fire 10 rounds at the ghost ship which stays aligned to your side, so you can just constantly fire and it sinks. there is also a kraken which isn't strong either.
-you will fight a lot of skeletons which is also very boring as you basically have 2 attacks with your cutglass and you spam them.
-there is no customization or unlocks or progression regarding for your weapons/ship regarding playstile. you only choose one boat (small medium large) and 2 out of 4 weapons. no different boats as more flexible boats or stronger boats or cannons placed differently, bigger and smaller sails, nothing you can customize
-the goal of the game is to grind fetch-quests (depending on the faction: deliver goods from this to another island, kill skelettons, find treasure) which is very repetitive and boring.
-only thing you can buy is cosmetics (some of the best you can buy for EUR 25), some are very overpriced. some ship cosmetics and black market cosmetics are extremely expensive, e.g. hull color for 220k, if one simple loot you and in is from 200-3500. but who wants cosmetics to look good in a game that is so boring that you don't really want to play?
- only thing that is kind of fun is the pvp, but it also lacks of motivation as the combat system is very simple, respawn times are so low and you cant do things like steal ships or something like that

80,70460796,english,"I love this game and it makes me a little upset to see some people complaining about the PvP system.
Here is my take on it after around 350 hours of gametime.

Read the title of this game carefully before you buy it.
It is called ""Sea of Thieves"".
It is NOT called ""Sea of Friends"".
Nor is it called ""Sea of Privacy"".
[b]Thieves.[/b]

It is a game where PvP is always enabled with no way of turning it off or playing on a private server.

Have I been killed by other players? Yes, many times.
Has loot been stolen from me after I spent hours collecting it? Yes.
Have people tricked me into going into an alliance with them and then backstabbing me later? Yes.
Are some people super aggressive and will attack anyone they see on sight? Absolutely.
Have I met awesome people who has given me memorable experiences? Many.
Would the game die if there were PvE servers? Without a doubt.


The game needs a balance of PvE and PvP players, or else it would not work.
The PvE players need to have a threat out there on the waters that keeps them alert and makes them do more than swing their swords at skeletons all day.

And the PvP players need PvE players because there is no point in fighting a ship and sinking them if there is no loot reward at the end.

There are many things you can do to avoid PvP.
If you are on the smallest boat and the enemy is in one of the larger boats, sail against the wind with your sails facing forward, that way it is impossible for them to catch up. It's called ""Dummy sails"" and it's very useful to know about.
Always keep an eye out for boats that could be coming your way.
Never park with your anchor down. That way you can just drop sails and leave as soon as you see trouble coming.
Park smart. You can use a lot of islands as cover if you park correctly.
Just to name a few.

If you don't give up after defeat, but keep on trying, eventually you will be able to outmaneuver and fight off the attackers. Maybe at that point you even get a taste of the forbidden fruit and decide to go attack some ships yourself?

If you are absolutely hellbent on only doing PvE content and do not want to engage in any kind of PvP, then the sea of [b]thieves[/b] is not the place for you.

21,70476874,english,"The game is sooo fun and wonderful and it has a lot going for it. that said. its only sooo fun and wonderful if youre a sweaty tryhard or have at least 4 people on your crew cause you cant go 15 minutes without a bigger ship with a larger crew boarding you and spam killing you without taking your one chest then sinking your boat. the community is toxic and all the big names advocate for PvP only play even though the game has a lot of PvE content that is IMHO way more fun that the PvP aspects, and according to a lot of the internet a lot of others feel the same. i was gonna put another $40 into the game just to get premium stuff when i was having fun, but rare lost essentially another full purchase of the game from me because they refuse to fix one of the baseline issues that a lot of players have with the game. have fun sweaty PvP babies, but im only gonna play when i have at least another player online, that being probably a couple times a week now at most.

Edit: I have no idea why people say PvE servers will kill the game... like, if so many people are going to go to PvE servers to grind, then clearly people like the PvE aspect more. If Rare then decides to update the PvE as opposed to the PvP to sate the PvE audience, then clearly the PvE audience is making more money. PvE servers can only help to grow the game, especially since people like me would come flocking back to the game quickly. I would love to love this game, but I decided long ago that I don't have the time or will to get good at video games when there are so many other things that are more worthwhile to get good at in life. I put over 1000 hours in Minecraft almost 7 years ago, id be willing to put in more than that if I just got the opportunity to have fun on the high seas without worrying about griefers. Plus, the game is only loosely based off of pirates. Pirates didn't even loot other pirates as they had a strict code, so anyone who defends the ""Thieves"" part of the game by talking about pirates, that's not a valid point. There's even a ""pirate code"" listed in the game that almost every PvP player straight up ignores. This game is not worth the $40 you have to pay for it if you are buying it to sail and have fun. Either you run around looking to sink others, or you wait for someone to find you to fend them off.

You never level up, increase stats, get better gear or anything traditionally associated with making progress in a game. At the same time, on Day 1 you will be just as powerful as any player who has hundreds of hours invested in the game.  In-game currency is earned to buy items which modify appearance but not performance.  

It is essentially open-world pvp/coop.  In my first gaming session I was educated by other players to put up an alliance flag to group up.  Joined them on their galleon ship for some questing action, engaged a skeleton ship and when  it was over got knifed several times in the back.  It's a pirates life...  I've been ganked a time or two since but you know what?  Who cares?  I gain experience and lose nothing of value.  

Graphics are a little cartoony but doesn't detract from the game.  The ocean looks great and you really get a sense of the ship riding the waves.  Weather is not something to be ignore either, I guarantee you will be paying attention to moving storm clouds on the horizon after you've been battered by a storm.

88,70467602,english,"Sea of Thieves is at it's core, a fantastic game. Going out and sailing the seas, finding treasure, killing skeletons, Solving puzzles and getting rich! there is no greater feeling than after a few hours of grinding, getting that massive turn in. But this game is not about the turn in, you will lose treasure, you will get killed by other players, over, and over. But one day, you'll sink that ship chasing you. and wipe out their crew, that will feel amazing! You'll get caught by a bunch of different, and amazing battles, and you'll lose at first, but with time, you'll stop losing and start winning. This game is about the journey. The adventure. The story you make along the way.

You will grind your way to pirate legend, and it'll be fun. But it wont be without heart ache. I still remember the first time I lost my 4 hour loot haul to another ship, I wanted to uninstall. But I didn't. And I'm glad I didnt, because honestly, I've never had more fun in a game before than in this. 

Doing a skelly fort with friends, only to be ganked by another ship, fend them off, and then watch them get caught by the Kraken coming back after us, amazing! I wouldn't have cared if we lost the loot, it was just a fun time! After a while, the gold becomes meaningless and it's just about what craziness you can get up to while sailing. 

TL;DR - This game is amazing, the start is hard, you will die and lose everything a lot. But stick it out, get better. And remember, it's about the journey, not the destination with this game. Every time you sail, create your own Pirate tall tale!

95,70466696,english,"First off this game is called ""Sea of Thieves"" not ""Sea of Friends"" or even ""Sea of Half-Decent People."" This is full on Mad-Max, everyman-for-himself piracy. There is no such thing as a friendly face here, everyone you meet will either try to kill you or be nice and try to rob you. I'm beginning to take on a policy of shoot first, ask questions later. Seeing another ship's sails in the port you're sailing your hard earned loot to means a full on dash to the map room to route around and away from any other player I meet. I snuff the ship lights at night and sweep my cargo hold for hop-ons (A real thing that happens is that an another will hide in your cargo hold, wait til you dock at an outpost, then kill you and cash in your treasure while you sit on the Ferry waiting to respawn on what usually is the burning remains of your ship at dock.) This game has made me full on paranoid of other people. Basically expect the basic human decency you'd see at a Walmart parking lot in Florida. This all sounds bad, sure. That someone can just come along and fuck up the good time you're having can feel shitty. Been there. But there is some sort of weird magic in this game, watching the sunlight filter through a wave giving it a greenish glisten is just incredible. Watching the sunrise over a white sand beach, it's like a beautiful day in paradise. And for the most part, you can avoid most other people and focus on exploring and hunting bounty skulls or buried treasure. I'm told that this game is better with people but I've always held the belief that nothing is better with more people, so  if Rare ever had an offline mode I'd be pleased but oddly enough one of the fun things about the human factor is actually getting to outclever someone else. Keeping an explosive barrel in your hold to scuttle your ship and intruders and make sure if you can't get your treasure no one will? Been there, done that. Using the anchor to drift your ship into a perfect spot at dock? Got the T-shirt. Snuffing your ship lights and picking out other players ships from miles away at night by identifying their ship lights? Oh yeah baby. Blinding another player by hucking a bucket of your vomit at them? Got the liver damage. One nice thing that makes the forced PVP tolerable is that treasure can only acquire you cosmetic items. A day 1 player with the default gear is just as effective as a well-seasoned Pirate Legend. So if you lose your treasure, it's no huge loss, and if you play solo you shouldn't be stockpiling loot anyway. A few hours work can net you some pirate gear that will make you look much more respectable / piraty. I'm recommending this game because Rare made effort later on to catering to weirdos like me who prefer to play alone. And if you do choose to play, you can ahoy me all day and I'll greet you with a blunderbuss. Remember; never trust a pirate.

Try not to let negative reviews talking about forced PvP sway you away from this near-masterpiece, while the PvP can be frustrating, it is some of the most dynamic and exciting PvP I've come across in a long time. Blow them to bits with cannons, repel boarders, shoot yourself out of a cannon and board them, drop their anchor, steal their rowboat full of loot and slink away into the night.

Yes, the PvP is unavoidable at times, but if you're paying attention to the horizon and keep situational awareness, you can certainly diminish your player interactions or avoid it completely. Yes, large crews prey on solo players, yes, you WILL lose your loot after gathering it, yes, you will have a total blast if you learn from the times you lost and turn that into victories.

I spent around 10 hours on a solo ship and the rest with friends/public crews. Here's how it boils down -
Solo - Incredibly atmospheric, high tension and excitement.
Public - Mixed bag, generally pretty good but can be awful as well.
Friends - Where this game shines, sailing a galleon efficiently is a nightmare, with 3 friends it's a breeze.

All in all, it's utterly beautiful, dynamic and fun.

That's one of the reasons I bought it a second time here on Steam, along with having it next to my other games. Now, let's get to some pros and cons of the game.

[u]Pros[/u][list]

[*]A large and colorful world with incredibly beautiful and stylized graphics.

[*]Due to one of the big focuses of the game being player interaction you will always leave a playsession with a new story to tell. This is one of my favorite aspects as it makes sure there's always replayabiliy, even though you've done every possible task in the game.

[*]There's a large amount of different activities to do. Be it a voyage to find some long forgotten treasure or a battle aginst a fleet of half-rotten ships manned by skeletons there's always something to do.

[*]Emergent gameplay. This goes hand-in-hand with the point about player interaction. Even though most activities in the game are repetetive they blend together so well to make sure the game never feels stale. You might find yourself in a situation where you just completed a Skeleton Fort but see a enemy ship on the horizon. Better get that loot onboard quickly and then prepare for a fight!

[*]For you who likes following a story the game has that too! Sea of Thieves' story-centered missions are called Tall Tales and sets you out on quests where you'll have to solve puzzles and follow clues to progress. If you really want to delve into the lore there's the books ""Athena's Fortune"" and ""Tales from the Sea of Thieves"" to explain the backstory of a few of the characters and locations. I really recommend buying them if you're into that kind of stuff!

[*]There's also factions which you can build a reputation with by delivering different types of loot, unlocking cosmetics and also higher value voyages as you go up the ranks. In my own opinion you should never focus on this completely. It serves as a reason to sail to different islands and as a cause for conflict or friendship between different crews. To quote the great Pirate Lord, ""It's not about the gold... It's about the glory!""
[/list]

As with any game, there will always be a few aspects that are not as good

[u]Cons[/u][list]

[*]Let's start with the most obvious one, the community. There's a substantial amount of players that you will run into that are very toxic. With toxicity I mean pirates who throw mean-spirited insults at you that may in some cases even be racist/homophobic/you name it. Then there's also players who join your crew for the sole purpose to troll. The best way to handle situations like these is to mute the abusive players(there's an option under ""Other Crews"") or to just avoid playing in open crews. I'd also recommend joining a community to find good players to sail with([url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/fleetofthievesgrizzly]shameless plug[/url]).

[*]Combat. While PvP and PvE is for the most part very solid there is some issues. A very well known one is the game's hit registration, which can sometimes very noticably make your shots not count. For some the weapon system might also not be deep enough, but for me it's good and pretty enjoyable. I enjoy PvP most of the time.

[*]The game requires a certain mindset to really enjoy. You might've noticed how I didn't put much of my focus on the game's progression system, and there's a very good reason for that. Many people buy this game with an intention that in most cases doesn't fit. I'm talking about players who are just in it for ranking up, making more gold and not really like engaging in PvP, fearing they might lose all that progress that lies in their hull.  [u][b]If you are this kind of person I don't think I can recommend this game to you in good conscience.[/b][/u] This has lead to much discussion and arguments which you can easily see after taking a quick look at the discussions page. The PvP aspect isn't the only thing that will get in your way. Grinding this game with no focus on anything else strips away all the parts that make it so unique and fun, leaving only a repetetive and mindless loop of gathering treasure and selling treasure for gold that you'll use on some cosmetic you think look cool or funny before going out to gather more treasure.[/list]

42,70457779,english,"This game is a broken heart waiting to happen.

Microsoft services/xbox services are built into this game even though you are playing the steam version. This causes minor issues and annoyances.

The game has zero progression, what you start with is what you have the whole game.

There's no customization of the ship layout whats so ever. I played with the Sloop supposedly the fastest ship. The reason this is important is LETS SAY. You are chasing another sloop... the fastest ship in the game. Oh ok Looks like we are gaining on em! (30minutes go by you have gone from one end of the map to the other) The sloop doesn't have a forward cannon, and since i can't customize the loadout or angle of fire on cannons or upgrade any of my cannons/harpoons to account for this. Combat goes from this pretty exciting moment to the enemy running and you chasing for 30mins, till either you make a mistake and they get away or they make a mistake and you gain on them, this sucks because the combat last 5mins or less.

Problem is this will never get fixed or added into the game because after reading the forums the devs have made it clear they have no intention to giving other players advantages, which is stupid. Which is also a pitfall for developers, as what creates really exciting moments is kicking someones butt or outsmarting someone that has better stuff than you and taking their stuff. And gives players a feel that their ship is unique. Basically adds more depth and strategy. as currently there's little to none.

The games controls suck on keyboard and mouse (No idea for controller) needs work, which will never happen since the games been out for 2 year and everything thats been added in the last 2 years was stuff you would expect in release. The game is secretly an early access game with slow development.

And this sucks because the game is beautiful has a lot of roleplay/immersion = fun moments which is missing in a lot of games today. Just the core gameplay loop is trash. I don't want to spend 20 hours farming random stuff with lackluster game controls and riddles/puzzles on islands to earn 40k gold just to buy a gold ship piece with no gameplay dynamic to it.
This is a huge pet peeve for me.

The game should be 10$ so you can actually convince a full party of friends to purchase it and have a full crew, as this game should not be played with less than 4 people. You can get some fun out of it, but no where near the amount you can with 4 people.

but for me there is not much more to this game.

finding loot just gets really repetitive after a short while, and there is not much more to it.

enemies are all the same and gunplay is really klunky.

if you like pirates and unlocking new skins this game is for you.
if you just want to sail the open seas and track enemy ships you could have alot of fun.

if you want a nice progression system and hate the fact that all you can buy in game are skins, this game is not for you.

i recommend you try it just for the epic ship battles.

I'm not sure how many hours on the microsoft store I've put into the game, but it must be over 300. From that time to the present, Rare has been extremely open and honest about the development of the game over time.

While when the game first released there was some poor feedback about lack of content, the developers have really added a lot of content over the least two years with the anticipation of more. All updates to Sea of Thieves are free and the only microtransactions are purely cosmetic.


As far as gameplay goes the game can be enjoyed solo on a ship but is best played with two or more friends. There is a lot to do between the story-rich tall tales, the skull forts, leveling with the trading companies, bilge rat adventures, and good old fashioned pvp with players.

I cannot count the amount of times ive been rocketed off of surfaces hundreds of feet from my ship, ive had megladons and krackens spawn no loot, ive had invisible holes in my ship, lost items from inventory without logging out or dying, sometimes it can take up to 20 minutes just to log into the game because of the server finder ""Searching the seas.""

16,70444685,english,"I've played this game since beta and release state and here is what i can say about Sea of Thieves.
Probably the most stisfying and immersive experience that you can get, however the game lacks on some content and mechanics seems a bit odd. The biggest advantage here is visual design. Although it looks like a game for minor audience but in reality it's not- game mechanics that are suited for more experienced players that are up for a challenge either it's pve or pvp persist withing everything that this game provides to a player. BUT! The biggest issues are still: 
-Repetative and long grind for pirate legend (3 vendors must be at reputation level 50); 
-Outposts are not safe zones that should be considered as mini hub island where you can sell your loot or browse vendors inventory without getting killed in process and loose everything you've spent your time on (i do understand that it is the main game feature, when you are out on your voyage in search for loot you put yourself on a high risk, but as you progress pvp players are getting annoying and really hard to get rid of and pirate legends seems unobtainable at this point for at least solo players which this game does not tolerate and reward for being brave and bold so to say);
-Occasional event-obstacles like skeleton ships are probably the most unfair due to the fact if you are a solo player you will have to do your best to sunk them, repair your ship and shoot back all at the same time, even though it is somewhat easier to encounter them as duo team they are still had to be sunk in order to get rid of them which is kind of different story against megalodon which does nothing if you don't shoot it and just mind your buisness and karaken which you can escape from relatively easy. 

Other then that: the gameplay, the story, overall quality and the amount of content (primarily- cosmetics) to pursue is just great.

18,70444574,english,"Bought this game from Day 1 of release and have I would guess over 1,000 hours of total play time, mostly on Xbox. I recently got back into PC gaming and back into this game from a hiatus and had to get it on PC. Very happy I did and glad to see this game come to Steam to further expand the player base. 

When the game first released, I won't lie, it was fun but far from the finished product it should have been. Very little to do besides an extremely mindless grind of the exact same voyages over and over and over again. My friend and I made it to Pirate Legends only to find an even larger grind ahead of us and that is when we both quit playing.

About a year an a half later I decided to try the game out again after some big streamers I follow had got back into it due to an update, and I am really glad I did. The game in its current state is great and what I think the game SHOULD have been like at release. IMO the game was released too early with little to no content. Addition of the Reapers Bones, Tall Tales, additional Athena loot types and runs, throwables, the Emissary system, new food types including cooked foods that give over healing, tiered leaks in your hull, etc etc etc are all amazing additions to the game and had they been there on launch, I believe this game would have been even bigger than it already is today(10 million unique players to date).

Long and short of it, $40 for this game is a steal. 1,000 hours for $40 is a hell of a deal in my mind. And if you can catch this on sale its even better. Is this game for everyone? Hell no. Especially if you aren't the type of person who enjoys PvP. This isn't a strictly PvP based game, but you can rest assured that if you don't keep a keen eye on the horizon, another crew will gladly attempt to rob you of your hard earned treasure to claim as their own. This is a pirate game after all, and you must understand that and go into it knowing the environment you are going to be playing in.

Though, for those that are solo players: be prepared for frustration and anger.
As a new player I've had nothing but bad experiences meeting other players. Though they're far and few in between, I'm constantly being shot to pieces.

The dynamic events will jump on you at the worst possible times. Surviving a Kraken straight out of a respawn is not possible.

I don't have IRL friends to play with; and I think that's 90% of the experience in this game. I don't know how I feel about playing with strangers - but we'll see. I might try signing up for a crew soon enough - don't know yet.

I've been shot in outposts/safezones, had my boat sat on fire and you name it - it's not a solo friendly game. Know that when you buy it. If you HATE PvP... well, take a guess.

I've only played 28hrs as of this review and it's been solo.
I hope you get to enjoy the game if you buy it!


Edit on 07/06/2020
To clarify on Whiterabbit's comment:
- I'm not saying people shouldn't shoot each other, but that I used the first hours of me playing this game *trying* to learn the mechanics and it was overwhelming. I've been attacked straight after spawning in on new ship, while docking for my first voyage, while in town. The pirate code is just that: A CODE! not a rule. And I think PvE minded players need to be aware of that. There's no safe place; you can be shot, killed, and sunk anywhere at any time - even as a new player who just opened the game. I've also tried turning my back on my ship to turn in my treasure for like 20seconds, I came back and a Galleon had docked and sat my sloop on fire; they apologized and repaired my sloop and when I was out on voyage again, I noticed they had ripped my sloop for every possible resources. 

As an anchored sloop trying to do a voyage, meeting a PvP ready Galleon was by no means fun and they shot me only for the sake of shooting me. This type of encounters can be grueling and very demoralizing. New players need to be aware of this because it makes or breaks the game for some of them.

Not everyone is okay playing with other people due to anxieties and playing solo is their only option - this game will not be for them. I'm simply trying to make a certain group of gamers aware that there's no Single Player version of this game and you won't be left alone out there on the seas.

Solo and Single-Player is two very different things.

If I'm going to play with other people, I'll play with someone I know in real life.
The game does encourage team-work and I love that - even the alliance system is cool.

And I know I'm making it sound like the game is such a bad thing, but I just have to highlight certain events that'll make some people really bumped out about having spent 40EUR.

Personally I love the game to bits. There's things and details that annoy the living out of me, but I understand why it's done as it is. The treasure system is fantastic, I LOVE the riddles and bounties, I love the different factions and that some items can be turned in to any of them for extra experience. The Sailing mechanics are very enjoyable once you get it down - and sailing a sloop alone is almost therapeutic.

While the game is very linear and grindy, it's a joy.",1591464456,1591529130,True,214,11,0.913164913654327393,22,True,False,False,76561198157705232,71,4,4434,0,1686,1591896557

72,70426938,english,"This is a game best played with friends.

The mechanics are very simple, which makes it well balanced. The only factor is individual player skill in so far as clicking at the right time is a skill.

Ship mechanics take a bit of getting use to, lowering your sails, angling them correctly and then steering which reacts pretty much how I guess a ship would steer (slow like a walrus).
There's riddles if you're into that, and every treasure you chase has a map that points you to an island that takes a few minutes to find on the world map ( which is only available in your hull/captain's cabin on the ship).

Is there a point to it? Not really.
Is it fun if there's no point? Yes if you're playing with friends and yes if you enjoy a very repetitive grind.
Downsides? Griefers/trolls/general asshole players who have nothing better to do than just ruining other people's fun, but this is the internet so expect a lot of that.

I know a lot of new players had gripes about having to deal with powerful, experienced ships that were just out to rob gold, but the hint is in the name. If you're going to play Sea of Thieves you have to expect that there is a chance a bigger, more powerful ship is going to come along and rob you blind.

I actually find this to be a really excellent element of the game because you have to think like a lowly solo pirate. Even in my short time playing I have managed to rack up thousands of gold with a minimum amount going to human pirates who have attacked me. I personally find it quite satisfying when I am attacked and beaten, knowing that they wasted their time because I have no loot on board. And the few times when you do lose loot you don't lose a whole lot.

It's such a beautifully immersive game, and I have already had a great time playing with total strangers from across the world when I fancy mucking in and helping out others. A cracking game for all I reckon, but you definitely need to overcome the initial obstacle of not taking it too serious, not being offended if you are sunk and just know you can always get back to a new ship and continue on.

It would be better if you have a group of 2-4 to have a better experience.  But you can still get things done solo but there are pirates hunting for treasure on ships, so be ready.  Don't take big risks.

12,70420334,english,"This game is for anyone who loves to play as a pirate. The game lets you experience the pirate life to a great detail which is unique and amazing. There is absolutely no pay to win elements and the microtransactions are only for visual enhancements. This game is like minecraft but on a ship with other players. The water texture is breathtaking but the remaining is tf2 style but not bad. The tutorial is short and doesnt help you understand the game fully. There are two modes in this game- adventure and arena. arena is where you duel against other pirate crew. arena games are quite short and thrilling. Adventure is where you and your crew set sails to explore the large map, find loots and kill things. Adventure mode can get quite boring at times as it is almost never ending. The game dev need to improve the games UI as it looks like as its made in the 90s. They also need to work on making a penalty system for those who leave games suddenly. The game should introduce a one man boat exploring mode because sometimes your teammates will suddenly leave and it puts you in a disadvantage especially in adventure mode. This experienced players in this game are quite welcoming to new players to this game as they help you learn and make mistakes instead of flaming and raging which is nice like most multiplayer games today. I was lost when i played adventure mode for the first time as i had no idea what are skulls for, how to get quests, how to use a gun, how to use a sword effectively in taking down a skeleton and how to shoot a canon. The tutorial only gives you a small glimpse of all those things and does not give you the time to take down a ship, try killing a kraken or how to kill a Walking skeleton!

36,70416633,english,"The game is great. The players are sad man-children with inferiority complexes they try to assuage by making life miserable for others. You think defeat is you getting killed, your ship sunk, and your loot stolen? Nah, that'd actually be fun. PvP here is a bunch of heavy breathing guys camping your respawn for an hour because they apparently have nothing better to do. And then there's the voice chat they will liberally make use of to verify that they are as useless in real life as they are in the game.

Despite all this I still recommend it. But you have to be keenly aware of what you're getting yourself into. Turn off all voice coms, and treat everyone that you do not personally know as if they were NPCs designed and programmed with the sole purpose of ruining your experience. The game then becomes a quite interesting effort of learning and exploring, while killing, dodging, and subverting the drooling morons that inhabit the world.

If you expect emergent gameplay and tense meetings on the high seas, you will be disappointed. That is not what this game is, despite what it is marketed as. Everyone you meet will attack you on sight no matter the situation. If you're on your ship they will sit around without sinking it and kill you every time you try to respawn. If you're in an outpost they will camp you until you log out. If there is anything, anything at all, they can do to make your time in game unpleasant, they *will* do it. And they will keep doing it. 

Is that a good situation, that creates a healthy long term playerbase? Nah. But it is what it is, so get used to it and play accordingly. Or don't buy the game. Which is a very good choice as well.

39,70414491,english,"I have to agree, with some of the negative comments so far. 

The game is visually appealing, the game mechanics are fairly easy to grasp, it fits. Sailing is the fun part of this game. The PvE content is enjoyable but that's where it ends for me. The new player experience only lasts for the time you start the game and enter the PvP world. 

The enforced PvP is after minutes of exiting the intro is a kick in the X. As a new solo player, once you've completed the intro, you're left to your own devices and at the mercy of others as you figure out what to do and where to go. In both times I started the game, I was pretty much ganged up on by other players as soon as I left port. You fight back and then it becomes a cycle of harassment until you scuttle your ship and start anew somewhere to reorient and  continue with whatever you were doing, which could place you randomly somewhere else far away from where you initially started. First time impression, the enforced PvP sucks. There is no lead up, no time to prepare; I can understand if you have a boat full of loot, pirates be pirates, that I can get behind, and that can be the thrilling part as you race back to sell your loot. But if the other players are complete trolls picking on new players as they start to play the game, then they'll simply ruin the experience. Game needs PvE only servers or a time-limited ""protection"" indicator for new players to get a handle on the game, other games similar to this do it with success, not sure why it has to be PvP all the time. People will just take the fun out of it if you're solo playing and trying to enjoy the story aspects like Tall Tales or simply looking for the buried treasure, it's definitely a game where numbers are required, solo players be damned.

Even if you play with others, it's not a fun experience unless you know them. I started an Adventure with a small sloop with one other random crew, who simply did not communicate. It was only when I decided to take the ship after 15 minutes of silence from the other player and sail away did they finally started talking by swearing at me for leaving them behind. At this point, is this game worth paying full price for if the effort to reach the fun part is going through hours of bad experiences. I assume if you've already done the intro then the adventure aspect should be to just start playing. The other player simply ignored me by without saying a word in text chat or voice. What's the point of the Adventure with random players if they go about their game as if you didn't exist. Yes, I imagine this could be a fun game if you have friends to play with that are on the same page, so far, not a fun solo or multiplayer random experience.

The other thing that kind of surprised me is that fact that once you leave the game, you don't start back at the same point you left. I had quit the game to come back 10 mins later to find all the progress and loot I collected on the ship is gone. Which is disappointing because the game forces you to stay online to keep progressing. If you don't have time to sell your loot, you leave, it's all gone when you come back. At least that what it looks like to me, not sure if that's by design. If it is, that sucks.

Overall, if you want a solo pirate game, this isn't for you. If you want to simply spend a few hours playing with random people, maybe if they're communicative to make it enjoyable. The best way that I can see to really enjoy this game, is play it with friends you know and then sail the seas with people watching your back. It's better than seeing the ferryman over and over and over again.

EDIT: I'll admit that I may not have given this game enough of a chance, especially since I was able to get a refund after 3 hours of playing it. It's not a quick-play type of game, it requires time that I wasn't willing to invest in and quite frankly the first impressions of being repeatedly dying after just starting didn't help. Other comments stated you will be frustrated and angry if you're playing this game solo. That's no lie.

After reading the official forums and seeing the same experiences by others is kind of disheartening. I really wanted to like this game, although, I'll admit that I did not jump on Discord, Reddit, etc to try and find other like-minded people to play with. But that is also a problem, I shouldn't have to find like-minded people to play with ""outside"" the game. 

I may decide to re-purchase this game again at a later date. Hopefully changes can be made to make the new player experience better.",1591489124,1591492794,False,124,47,0.52795875072479248,0,True,False,False,76561197991602961,1391,9,199,0,199,1591480873

I should note, death has about as much weight as it does in a first person shooter.  There's no grinding to remake what you lost.  Death is a minor, and interesting inconvenience.

It is fun, so I'll give it another try, but I'm seriously considering black flag instead.

Ok, I would almost change my answer to yes.  My kid and I started using Eve Online strategies, and things worked out better.

I'm keeping the original ""don't recomend.""   The game is fun, and has plenty of positive press, so I don't believe my one criticism will matter. 
 But I really feel that the game could use a small area for short missions with minimal risk.

Once you understand how to work the boat, use maps, and navigate, just remember to always plan how to get in to an island without getting caught, and after you have your treasure, have a plan to get out again.

82,70375195,english,"A great example of modern sandbox games, where devs give you a bucket, a scoop and suggest to entertain yourself. You put a bucket on your head, while keep poking your friends with a scoop, all of you start eating sand and dig all the dog sh.it out.
But after 5 hours of fooling around you realize: there completely is nothing else to do. By 10h gameplay mark your scoops are broken, whole desert is eaten and all the buckets are full of dog poops.
And you also have to divide this gametime by 2 or even 3 times if you are alone, there literally is nothing for you to achieve except purchasing sh.itty pirate and ship cosmetics.
No leveling system, no weapons or armor sets, no upgrades for your ship, nothing. You just swim from point A to point B, dig some sh.it out of sand, or sometimes beat it out of some mobs and other players and bring it back to outpost to get some useless coins.
The difference is only between selling different type of trash to a different faction's merchant, which raises the level of your reputation in this faction, which gives you... Nothing. Access to more useless cosmetics, less trash quests with just slightly more rewarding trash piles.
I think, there are literally 5 types of AI enemies in this game, which are Kraken, Megalodon, normal sharks, skellies and cobras. That's it, that's all there is. First 2 are completely random sea encounters(I mean, go towards stormy clouds and you're fine) and are complete pain in the ass if you have less than 3 members of your crew, other 3 types are island enemies and skellies have some varieties, some bosses among them, but they all feel the same and are completely boring and have same shape. 
Oh, and there is some sh.it in-between them, which is mermaid statues, they are even more boring than everything else mentioned before.
The Islands you encounter are beautiful, empty and useless. Any decent enemy encounter never spawns untill you find yourself a quest somewhere. Like, completely never. You can run into some pathetically looking skelly-ghosty-themed fort and expect to have some good fight and loot? Nope, go fu.сk yourself, it's empty as your wallet during the lockdown, and nothing is going to happen untill you complete a sequence of boring trash quests and looting. There simply is no life in this game, it looks like an alpha to me. After all this time passed since it had been released at MS store, it looks like nobody but a couple of surface designers were working on it.

PS. Oh and I forgot to say that I've wasted at least 2 hours of this playtime on trying to add my friends in fu.cking xbox account and connect to servers which were dead. Have fun.

TL;DR
Do not buy it, if you have less than 3 more friends to constantly play with you, but if you do, buy something else nonetheless, because there are tons of games which are much more funny to play in a party of 4+ people.

-Grab a quest from one of the factions ( find treasure, capture/trade animals, fight skeletons)
-Sail to the island identified in the quest.
-Get/capture/kill the chest/animals
-Return and get gold and reputation with the faction for cosmetics and grind.

There's more depth/emergent stuff as you progress, but that's the jist. Oh, and other players are able to wreck/steal your ship while you're doing this. Or you can wreck people on quests.

When you launch the game, it allows you to connect your Xbox app account to your Steam account. However, it does not in any way link your friends lists together. You can only form groups for playing the game with your xbox friends list.

What this means is, not only do you have to connect your accounts, but you also have to either pull up the windows gamebar overlay (I disabled mine a long time ago), or launch the xbox app from the windows 10 store, find out your username, and add each other through that app. Then and only then will you be able to invite your friends.

This has zero Steam implementation outside of being sold on the Steam store. You can't invite steam friends, you can't join on steam friends, they can't join you, and there is no in-game functionality that is even aware of what your steam friends list is or who is on it. It doesn't matter if everyone playing bought the game through Steam. That's what is absurd to me.

Many people on the forums complain about griefing. I guess we are lucky as we've only had one run in with players that spawn camped us, which is easily solved by either idling in the respawn realm, or just scuttling the ship. Overall it's a pvp game first so we weren't bothered by it at all. 

The quests can get repetitive, but there are enough for you to change things up if you're tired of doing one thing. 
We typically would do one of each, turn in, rinse and repeat.

There are also random events that can spice things up, such as fighting the Kraken or a shark, as well as skeleton ships, shipwrecks, messages in a bottle which lead to valuable quests. 

The only thing to purchase with the in game currency are cosmetics, there is no way to improve your gear or storage space. Seems this was a deal breaker for many. To me this is perfect as starting late in the game we are on the same playing field as everyone else.

83,70392195,english,"I have played this game since it was first released on the Microsoft store and am so glad it had made it to the steam client. I have spent hours in this game doing things simply fishing to playing a Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones adventure. But I am gonna go into a few things about why this game is worth your buy:

Pros:
- This game has hours and hours of content. From playing the story driven ""Tall Tales"" that have you discover some of the lore of the game to hunting the commendations that unlock special cosmetics, there is never nothing to do.
- This is a sandbox adventure game. I think it has been rare that I log in with friends and don't have a great story to tell from us playing. So many crazy stories happen that range from cartoon comical to absolutely epic.
- Ship combat feels really good. When you learn how to properly aim the cannons, use the special cannon balls, and more, the ship to ship battle are incredibly fun. And as you master the sailing aspect with the combat you truly feel like epic pirates.
- The Tall Tales are a lot of fun and have very successfully captured the essence of a ""high seas adventure""
- The in game events have been a blast each and every time the have expanded the content of the game.
- You are always on a level playing field. There is no progression in the game that puts you at an advantage over other players. All rewards are cosmetic so just starting off you have access to all the same things as someone like me with hundreds of hours in the game (other than experience of course).

Cons: Unfortunately, no gaming experience is perfect, and you will want to be aware of a few things that may or may not make you leave this game alone.

- As mentioned before, all rewards are cosmetic. This has led some people to be dissatisfied as their aren't many ""progress"" levels to achieve. You have reputation levels and reaching ""Pirate Legend"", but this doesn't provide you with anything other than more cosmetics. Those who crave better loot for their effort might find this a tad disappointing. 
- As a sandbox, there is not a lot of direction. While it's true you get to adventure in whatever way you want, their is no really good way to know what to do in the game without some kind of help. You wouldn't understand how the companies worked or that Tall Tales are even a thing without stumbling on them accidentally. The ""tutorial"" tall tale is fantastic, but doesn't show these aspects of the game off.
- Ship combat has a learning curve. You will have to learn how each ammo type behaves and master sailing your ship AND fighting at the same time. Fighting against experienced players can be frustrating as they know a few tricks that a new player can't really deal with until they either learn the hard way or get some help.
- Leveling is a grind, although this pain has been greatly relieved with all the ways to get reputation levels now. ""BACK IN MY DAY!!!..."" is a real thing for some of old players as we had to truly grind some frustrating fetch quests to reach the high levels. Now it can still be annoying, but its more varied. This grind can still put some people off so be aware of it. Best to just enjoy the process and have adventures!

This game is by far my favorite in a long while and I will continue to enjoy it. I recommend looking up the content creators on YouTube as they have tone of guides, tips, trick, and other stuff that will help you get into the game! I hope to see you out on the Sea of Thieves!",1591455552,1591455552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198029074316,163,19,4219,160,224,1601434166

86,70390723,english," A very enjoyable pirate game, solo or with friends. Beautiful landscapes, effects, music and the W A T E R, oh mah gawd. Combat is fluid and and fun, pulling off the easy to learn and hard to master mechanics just feels very rewarding to the player. Same goes for the sailing, extremely fluid and rewarding once you get the hang of it and a skilled player can easily solo a sloop.  The price alone is worth it, perfect for a mp only game with little to no story, but endless hours of enjoyable game-play and quests. Oh and the quests can get pretty damn good, especially the Tall Tales which is where you will find the ""story"" aspect of the game.

 Most of the negative reviews are from the same type of people that get upset that they died by a player in any other survival game. Spamming refunds the second they die and demanding pve servers. There are plenty of things you can do to avoid players and its as simple as talking to another ship and allying up if you need a hand, plenty of people in game will help you out. From my experience this is one of the most forgiving player bases in a ""survival"" type of game that ive played. Countless times ive had players come to my aid in combat just because we wave the same flag. But of course with any pvp game you do occasionally get those ""toxic"" players but that just comes with the nature of these kinds of game, just makes it feel even better when you outplay their ass ;)

 If you do buy this game and you should at least give it a shot with a friend or two, just give it time. There are plenty of new players just like you trying to learn the game, you will die..a lot but you will get better and make friends along the way while you try. Your experience with SoT changes every time you play, this is why there should never be a split between player bases with pve and pvpve servers. You will get a casual and relaxing play-through surrounded by traders some days and others you will experience the true nature of the game..pirates. 

 Try the game out and if its not for you then its just not for you. Personally I think everyone who gives it a chance with friends will enjoy their time with SoT. Hell I even bought it twice, once when it came out on the ms store and here on steam. There is also cross-play so if you have some friends on Xbox, have them hop on too. By chance if you dont have a friend to play with you can look for other crews that have an empty spot on their ship in the main menu when you go to join a game.

49,70372306,english,"Ok here is my schpeel, this game is great, it looks great, it feels great, it sounds great. I truly do like this game. BUT, some things need to be fixed. First and foremost, loading times. Loading into an actual server has taken me 5+ min each time, which you know, whatever, but that's not the end. It is truly infuriating when I am in a solo sloop and I get two goons in another sloop that jump me while I am anchored at an island. They miss 3 shots by the time I finally get to my boat, they don't have a mast any more there are 17 holes in their ship, its on fire blah blah. I finally die to one of the nerds that respawned. and then I am met with a 2 min loading screen, a 2 min (or so it felt like) respawn time, another 2 min loading screen. Which gave them oodles of time to sink my ship. Keep in mind my ship had not been hit prior to me dying. Since I spawned in my ship as it was sinking I am hit with once again a 1 min loading screen and then I die to a shark. Poggers. Next problem, frame drops and optimization issues. This might be my pc it might not, idk, I have a pretty good pc, definitely good enough to run this game. Last issue, some times hit registering is spotty with cannons, the before mentioned goons had been challenged by me once I got my ship back again. I lay into their stern side of the ship and hit both of them head on with a cannon ball. They don't die, they then didn't have their ship sink and turned around popped one shot that hit my mast and I instantly die, cool. I respawn, run back on deck and I get thrown into the atmosphere with a shot that hit the side of my ship. At that point I gave up and let them have their way with me. I have seen all of these problems I mentioned before this specific moment, but, it just all collected itself into one instance.

Some positives now that I am less salty, you really FEEL like a pirate, almost all encounters you get are surprising and you get a genuine rush out of it. Landscapes, water, sky, colors, everything graphically about this game is fucking gorgeous. The amount of little things in this game that makes it worth playing with friends is beautiful. Would highly recommend getting some friends to play with. The mechanics to sail your ship is JUST chaotic enough that it keeps you on your toes and keeps gameplay fresh, I always find myself messing something up just once and getting a good laugh out of it when we tokyo drift onto an island shore. Combat and gunplay are all satisfying. And oh yeah, the sounds for everything in this game are top notch, especially all of the instruments.

TLDR: This game is fantastic, I love it so far and I plan to play it for many more hours. All of the good things about the game are really good and keep the game alive. Glaring issues that stick out to me: Long loading times, optimization issues (might be me might not), cannon hit reg issues. They don't happen a whole lot but when they do it really makes the game frustrating to play.

50,70372184,english,"well this game is really good looking and the concept is really cool but there isn't really that much content in it unless you want to farm 24/7 for a skin that just looks cool. i would like to be able to build my own ship, name my ship and have more throwables or other cool items to use. this would make the game more interesting because then people would have had their own ship that they have costumized themselves. but then it would also be important to keep it balanced so that new players can still sink everyone if they are smart enough.



Here are some thing i wish wasn't in the game:

1. play with friends or else you lose (unless your enemies suck). i would like to be able to take down a gallion while beeing solo. it's impossible if that gallion has 4 really good people on board.

2. you can't board a ship without getting one shot in the face with a shotgun or getting killed by a sword that is 2 meters away from you. (again uless your enemies suck or you have teamate(s)) i would like to be able to board a ship no matter if i get shot once. if i get shot then sure i lose half my hp but one hit is just crazy to me.

3. no matter if you have bad or good connection you will sometimes have over 300 ping so you have to leave and join another server to fix it. then you would either need to abandon all your loot or leave arena wich gives you a 30 min cooldown. upgrade your servers so we don't have to wait 30 mins for a cooldown we don't deserve or playing in a laggy match that claims that someone won when in reality maybe those who won would have lost if it wasn't for the ping.



Would I recommend this game?

no. not for the original price, unless you really like grinding skins. i don't think its worth the money unless they have a sale or make it cheaper. i would recommend buying it at a price close to $20, not $39.

I had a friend join me for the very start, who had previously played the game, and even with his help this game is BORING!!

Everything from combat to inventory management is a dumpster fire and once again BORING! Noting in this game feels fun or unique. The starter experience is a follows, 1) open game to tutorial level, no other choice, 2) exit out of tutorial and select ship size, without knowing anything, 3) invite friend, who tells you there are no NPC's and your ship (and game play for that matter) can't function without several other real people and then 4) sail toward whatever island and on a map with zero direction, do the mindless combat, 5) sail back home to rinse and repeat.

It could be a pirate ship full of skeletons, each and every single one having the intentions of bring you down. It could be a Megalodon with it showing hunger in its eyes, circling you along the way.

I fumbled my way through the first 4 hours of the game (which the game does a terrible job explaining what you actually need to do...) and found a few magic skulls and finally started getting the hang out of finding treasure.  Found my first chest and so I had my two skulls and my chest in my ship.  Was trying to find another chest when I see some player making off with one of my skulls.  I tried to sail away but he just blasted my ship to pieces before I could even get away... after he sunk me I lost all of my progress that I just made effectively wasting that 4 hours of game play.

Fortunes have been made and lost in this bustling expanse and tales spread of the daring privateers who roamed the maritime landscape with open abundance. As romanticized tall tales rose across the lands, those who adventured did not become legends overnight since we needed a way to understand myth from meaning.

As a new pirate I would fight armies of skeletons eerily in the night, cannon myself valiantly onto oncoming Sloops in hopes of treasure and glory, my crew and I would heroically take on the unforgiving Kraken in the depths of open waters and soon come to learn that the sea is unforgiving and is filled to the brim with Thieves.

Sword play now consists of spamming left click, and sometimes blocking. Oh yeah, blocking doesn't work half the time anyway. On top of the poor sword game play, hit registration is worse on this game than any shooter on the market that I can think of. It seems like 1/3 of my shots don't register on enemies, even though the game gives me a hitmarker, telling me my shot connected. Not to mention there are plenty of times where I'll shoot an enemy and not get a hitmarker, but still kill them. Lastly, this game is loaded with bugs that the developers go months without patching, if they even decide to patch them at all.

I'm sure Rare is working to resolve the issues but since the game currently will not launch at all for me and I have no recourse to fix the issue after hours of troubleshooting, I can not suggest buying this game yet.

Story of what went down:

I bought the game and installed it. Steam did it's usual ""first time install"" song and dance when I launched it, only the Microsoft Visual C++ install failed, it couldn't find the old version of Visual C++. I closed out the error window and then the game launched anyways. I played the tutorial and called it a a day. The second day I tried to launch it and same thing Visual C++ wouldn't install. Spent an hour troubleshooting that and resolved that issue, I no longer get a C++ install error when I try to launch. Instead it just doesn't launch at all. No ""it launches for a second, I see the title screen and it crashes"" type deal, just a click play, steam says I'm playing, 5 seconds later it says I'm not. No processes being run, nothing. I spent HOURS researching and troubleshooting, I verified files, I reinstalled everything including Cisual C++, all the articles from Sea of Thieves and Rare are written about the windows version, the ONE article I found that acknowledges steam version not launching says that anti-virus software sometimes flags it as bad. So I add an exception to my anti-virus (Avast). Still nothing. I entirely disable anti-virus and my firewall, still nothing. Rare seems to be at the very least aware of the issue, but after hours of troubleshooting and I still can't play, I just want my $40 back.",1591385529,1591385529,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998285162,419,5,73,0,73,1591383439

Bought the game, played 2 hours by myself, did the tutorial and then was thrown into the world. In that time, I was exploring the starting area, running around getting my bearings. The graphics are a beaut that's for sure. Started to get really, really excited about everything and what I was going to potentially uncover, and explore in this game. As im exploring different parts of this island, I noticed another ship, with a real life person coming into dock as well. I thought, ""Very cool.""

Little did I know, that would be the reason im leaving this negative and hopefully informing review. 

Suddenly, my starter ship comes under cannon fire, by the same ship that I saw moments ago coming into port. (Mind you, I LEGIT just learned how to man the sails, man the cannons, fix the ship, sail the damn ship, etc.) He yells out some sort of command to let me know, ""Take all of there loot"" or whatever it said, and then proceeds to run down the dock as I fire my dainty little Flintlock thinking this will do him justice. Little did I know, this dude looks like the Devil himself. He had a hook, and peg leg with a demon hat and eye patch. Proceed onward to the shit PVP battle, he pulls out his overly large upgraded Blunderbuss, and hits me 1 time to take away 75% of my health, and then hits me again with the last and final shot that sends my ass to Davey Jones Locker.

At that moment I realized that I just wasted 2 fucking hours of my life I'll never get back, and proceeded to rage quit just to end up here. Telling my sad, little tale for all of those who would like a good chuckle. Har Har, this game is complete garbage and will continue to do so, until the PVP shit is dealt with and balanced properly, or just implement PVE fucking servers for those of us who like to play games, without complete Douche bags ruining all the fun. 

With that being said, if you enjoy rage quitting, cursing like a Pirate, having all your shit plundered after hours of hard work and dedication in a moments notice, then please by all means BUY THIS GAME. If you enjoy an open world, free roam, single or co op experience with friends who detest PVP as much and my friends and I do, DO NOT FUCKING WASTE YOUR GOD DAMN TIME ON THIS ONE. Please, Just avoid it at all costs like I should have done. 

If they decide to make this a private game where 4 friends can play together at the same time, PVE style sailing and fighting NPCS of all shapes and sizes, plundering islands fresh with booty, and gold da bloons to boot, then yeah, I'll give this one another go.

82,70347176,english,"Starting off with the positives, a lot of fun and great game play (with a catch). The game is an adventure game which consists of a vast world with lots of things to do and explore, its probably one of a kind and it's only rival would be Atlas. 
There's PVP and PVE elements, however as new players we mostly came across the PVE elements which were both fun and terrifying. ""If you see the kraken you will die"" will happen a lot. 

These are the stuff that has currently happened to us as of 8 hours - Sea sailing adventures, looking out for enemies, 'Why do I hear boss music?', kraken arrives, PANIC, killed by the kraken, set sail again, 'WHY DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC PART 2', ghost ship spawns on us, PANIC, killed by the ghost ship, set sail again, searching for islands on the map, digging up treasure chests, underwater diving, solving puzzles (lack of common sense was visible in us a lot), playing songs with your band, cooking food in the ship, forgetting to take it out, cause mass fire, PANIC. 10/10 will do again.

Now then, the weirdest thing about this game would be the horizontal progression system. There's literally no progression it feels like the server has been wiped every time you log on. Now is this bad or good? 
I will take it as neutral as I enjoy the 0 risk of losing my hard work and grinded stuff for hours (which happens a lot in Atlas) and also I'm sometimes disapointed that it's the same thing over and over again and my ship and character never gets better. The game saves only your micro transactions which are purely cosmetic and never affect gameplay in anyway.
You will pick a new ship as you start the game and depending on the amount of friends you have, you can handle a bigger ship. Ship handling is also a great aspect of this game loved the part where one controls the sails, and one handles the anchor and wheel makes you feel like an actual pirate! There's sea monsters and other ships to battle as the PVE elements and random events happening throughout the world at certain times.

As for the mini progression you have some factions where you do different quests for them like find a treasure, kill a skeleton etc. Overall repetitive but fun with friends. You gain reputation with these factions
and unlock different items. (Again 100% cosmetic)

Graphics - The graphics are purely cartoony, and the art style is lush and beautifully detailed. Small forests are full of colours and very dense, water physics are amazing and realistic, getting shallow at wave peaks and 
the sea will roughen or soften based on weather and other conditions. The day night cycle is greatly detailed as well at night times you see aurora's and sunsets cause beautiful shadows across the sea. Animations are quite well done too with emotes and all of this just adds to the games great graphics. The game's opening scene and tutorial will awe you for sure!

Combat - One thing I didn't like much was the melee combat, (yet to experience ship combat) it was just simple sword fight with skeletons and gets repetitive. Guns work in the same basic way too and due to no progression, damage is the same there are some varieties of guns but nothing major.

Story - I'm guessing one of the main reasons for all the backlash was the lack of a proper story in the game at launch. Now the developers have added 'Tall Tales' 9 chapters of what seems to be like a great story.
We just finished the 1st chapter and it took us around 3 hours. This was probably the peak of the game finding clues in underwater wrecks, reading notes to solve puzzles and finding artifacts. Hope the rest
of the chapters are as long and filling. One more thing about the story is they are adding an entirely new arc which will contain another set of tales and currently 2 chapters have been dropped in.
I remember the game having a lot of backlash at launch, however the developers have shown quite a commitment. By just having a look at the patch notes I can see that every month since launch
new content has been dropped in and there's 5 major expansions as well. All for free of course. 

Sound - The music aspect in game is generally good, a great sea side sound track and eerie music at times when you find secret items and explore caves. You can also make you own music along with your crew as you have free music instruments. Never thought it would be so much fun!

Optimization - The game is extremely well optimized. One of the reasons I stopped playing Atlas was the server issues and frame rate disasters. This on the other hand I've never seen a server, never seen packet loss it feels as if I'm playing a offline game with friends! Frame rates are very high hitting 120-144 on my i5 9600k and RTX 2070.

Now for the catch - Loads of fun is in this game is possible only if you have at least one friend to play with. It might get quite boring if played alone and too difficult too. I wouldn't recommend if I had to solo this game. 
Is this worth it for the asking $40? Sure! I would recommend if you have at least one friend to play with. Maybe you can force a friend to play by gifting them a copy if the game is at a region price  :D",1591383726,1591383900,True,2,2,0.545454561710357666,2,True,False,False,76561198090463836,243,33,2888,0,500,1595603111

Having the choice between digging up treasures based off of clues, aiming to kill undead pirate captains, and more really gives you a good sense of choice.

1. You are forced to make and use an Xbox account with this game. I know being forced into outside programs when playing on steam really sucks, however it does allow you to crossplay with Xbox users.
2. This game is significantly more enjoyable with friends on your crew. If you don’t have others to play with and don’t want to meet new people or play with strangers, I don’t recommend this. Playing single player loses so much of what makes the game enjoyable.
-----
I’ve played this game quite a bunch before it came to Steam. When it first released, it was pretty notorious for being lackluster (similar to No Man’s Sky), but the devs have been super consistent about great monthly updates to the game that keep it feeling very fresh, and today the features it boasts are definitely worth the pricetag.

The way the game makes other players feel more terrifying than any monster or enemy you encounter is unlike anything I’ve played. I know some people get turned off by how demoralizing it can feel after a long quest to get raided by pirates and lose everything, but I feel like that honestly adds so much to what makes this game unique. It’s such a wild intensity that makes the game really stand out.

They just added a new feature this last patch which allows saving checkpoints on Tall Tales (the “story mode” quests), which is a wonderful quality of life change that’ll help people feel less worried or bogged down with long quests. So much of the tedium and repetition that used to be in the game has been reduced greatly with so much more variety in quests & events. The fighting and movement in the game feels so great, with the swordplay rock-paper-scissors of blocking, swiping, and lunging being really compelling in the heat of the moment. Learning to master the angles on cannon shots, fireball throws, mastering movement techniques, and learning ship control leads to a very gratifying feeling of growth as you switch from being intimidated by foes to being the intimidator.

Even though there are several little bugs that pop up every now and then, they usually don't hamper the experience, but even so the devs are very quick to respond.

19,70338259,english,"If this was early 2017 and you asked me if I would recommend SoT I would immediately say no. Why? Because it wasn't a complete game. You barely had anything to do. The merchants voyages were stale and could easily be a huge waste of time. PVP was basically a waste of time if you found another ship w/o any treasure. And when you did find a ship with treaure because it took so long to get, almost every time you would end up in a stale mate or trying some unintuitive sneaking around to sell your few treasure pieces. Then 'end game' was none existent. You just got another faction to farm. Don't get me started on the in game items and how you spend your gold/dablooms....

Now, today. If you asked me the same thing? I would answer definitely yes. Now the game feels complete. There are several exciting world PVE events, 1 or two not so exciting, tons of treasure to find. Money is not such a grind anymore with the amount of stuff you can do. Tons of cosmetics for all currencies. Emotes, pets, and so forth. Just today I spent almost 12 hours doing voyages to PVP'ing to world events and everything felt exciting. There were really good moments to pick from, some clipped, and lots of stories to tell. Now it feels like a pirate game. Now it feels like worth while to spend idling and sailing because now there is a worth while reward.

The 1 major downside is the servers during off hours. If you tend to play when there is very few people in the server, voyages will feel easy with very little risk. If you want a good mix of everything you're best bet is to play during peak hours when there are more people populating servers. Again, during the 12 ish hours, we server merged 3 or 4 times because finding people, sinking them, and taking their treasure made all of them quit the server.

Lots of people don't recommend it if you don't have any friends to play with, but solo slooping gives you a challenge and a feel of independence, and when you find the treasure it's honestly such a great feeling because you probably weren't just sitting on the ship while you had someone else go dig it up.

This trash has the graphics of a game from like 50 years ago, I mean even Doom classic is more detailed, it has the game play and mechanics of a web-based game, it has the networking system that's even worse than the ones that very initial multiplayer games used to have, and yet has the price tag of a AAA fresh release and marketing of GOD's Game itself!
Played the game for almost 3 hours, got disconnected dozens of times, started getting teleported on my ship and on the land and anywhere else I went after just like playing SOLO for 40 mins or something, and all this happened after all the hype that I had when I first heard this game is going to be available on steam.

Есть отдельный ПвП режим - арена, где можно вдоволь постреляться. ПвПэшиться нужно уметь и в обычной игре, т.к. желающих напасть на вас хватает.

So is the game fun? yes, yes it is, BUT it can go from fun to ragequit pretty fast when you encounter other players who sink you ship and kill you over and over by spawn camping you just to see the world burn. So I am part of that minority that wants a PvE server, yay.

Pros:
-Sailing is super chill, one of the most relaxing activities I've done in a game.
-Nothing is P2W, everyone has the same equipment.
-Variety of activities to do, if you get bored with one, you can switch to another.

Cons:
-PvP feels too focused on who can jump on the other person's ship faster and drop the other's anchor. I wish PvP was more based on Ship vs Ship.
-You really can't have a short session on this game. You have to usually invest at least an hour in order to complete even a simple task.

[u][h1][b]About This Game:[/b][/h1][/u]
[b]In this first-person style game, you play as a pirate who accepts and completes voyages on a vast open-world map mostly on the Sea and few numbers of small to medium islands. Player takes voyages from different Trading Companies in-game and earn Reputation, XP and rewards along the way[/b]


[u][h1][b]About The Story:[/b][/h1][/u]
Unlike other games, this game tells stories via Quests which is called Tall Tales. Tale Books are given to player by various NPC's who direct players to different adventures through out the world of Sea of Thieves which uncovers various secrets or stories in the game.


[u][h1][b]About Multiplayer:[/b][/h1][/u]
Though you can play the game Solo but this game is all about multiplayer. When you start the game you get a ship the size of your choice and put on a server where many players like you are in your server as well. Players can be hostiles (And yeah there's grieving involved) to you or they can help you if they want but everyone is pirate so don't expect friendship in the Sea of Thieves.

This game is best played Co-Op which supports up to 4 players and it's very difficult to play Solo as you'll need to constantly control your ship in a various way possible and of-course among other things.

Me: *throws up*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Been following SoT for a lot of time, but never made my mind about it. Took advantage of the steam release to give it a try. I like it, a lot.
I used to be skeptic about a lot of stuff, mainly gameplay mechanics and PvP elements,  but not anymore.

Let's just say Sea of Thieves includes all the good old pirate clichés we learned to know and love when we were kids. Pegs, hooks, parrots, eye patches and such, it's all there. The overall scenario is a grotesque and cartoonized world where pirates can live free. Jump on your boat/ship, set sail alone or with your crew, complete missions and legendary quests to earn gold and buy cosmetics to show your wealth to others.

The good thing is that every player, from the bilge rat to the legendary thief is equal: no progression system at all, just cosmetics and gold. This is a very good thing. Every time you log in, you get a brand new ship that you can choose in three different sizes: sloop, brig, galleon. Each ship has a minimum of players to be used with, otherwise it might become ungovernable. To be more clear, a player can run a Sloop solo, but not a Galleon. The overall goal of the title is to create camaraderie among players, encouraging teamwork to operate a galleon or a brig in the proper way. 
Nothing will beat sailing to a destination and singing merry tunes all together or playing instruments while checking for the horizon for opportunities, monsters and even other ships.

The water physics are among the best I have ever seen. Beware the rough seas, don't sail upwind, check your bilge for eventual damage, leaks and floodings.
The Legends of the sea are present as well, a very good element to appreciate the pirate world as well.

Still at the beginning.

Personally, yes but wait for a sale if you're questioning yourself. I haven't played recently at all to know if they've added anything new, but this positive review is solely because I remember having a ton of fun when I played it in the past.

One of the biggest parts of this game that I absolutely LOVED, are the visuals. The islands are beautiful, the ships look amazing, but the biggest aspect... THE WATER. The ocean in this game is absolutely gorgeous, especially when the sun sets right over it. It just looks stunning.

Only issue I've witnessed on the Steam version, is that matchmaking doesn't seem to be working for some people, me included. I've seen many people already playing through this version, which is good for them, but just stating the fact that others including myself aren't able to join a game.

Your gamer-tag system regarding the Xbox live accounts and the methods of changing gamer-tags are anti-consumer and underdeveloped.

Sadly, Sea of Thieves still uses the old unique gamer-tag system. I was not givin the option to alter how the unique version of my gamer-tag would appear on my 1 free change. But instead you only offer the ability to change your unique tag on the change that costs $10 bucks after the first free one. And yet, the system is flawed because I have to buy 2 separate changes to get the unique name I wanted, because I have to change my non-unique tag to something else and then back to the original for it to work due the system not allowing you to alter your existing unique tag unless you also change your non-unique tag to something else. 

It's such a messy system, even an Xbox Live Support Agent told me that I would have to buy 2 separate username changes just to get the name I want under my circumstance and that there is no other option.

I don't want to use a crappy console based account system on Steam.

If there is one thing Microsoft loves to do to its consumer base, it is to force things into their products nobody wants to push some mass Xbox based agenda.

99,70300926,english,"Sea of Thieves is a game with a long history of ups and downs,
that have shaped what has now become one of my favorite games of all time.

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the 4 years before the closed beta started,
but to say that, what would eventually be released to the public at a full price, 
would shape the reputation of the game for years to come is an understatement.

Despite all efforts, Rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notion
from consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business 
not unlike the initial release of SoT. I'd say that mindset is more than justified.

I believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking 
in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game.

Over the past 2 years SoT has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love 
I've ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in.
Many would say that sort of description already fits games like No Man's Sky, 
but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes Sea of Thieves stand out.

Unlike NMS, progression in SoT isn't vertical, but horizontal. 
Meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play 
and will not differ from someone like me, who has played it for over 1000 hours 
on the M$ Store version. 

While this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game,
if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world, 
per session arcade experience, the genius behind this design starts making sense.

Every single update the game has received doesn't suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems.
If Rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game 
that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers, 
you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in. 

This is where that approach really shines.

New mechanics aren't just one and done features, every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself, meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic.

For example: 

The rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game, 
but it's not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos.

- Rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship 
and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings. 

- If an island holds many treasures, a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you're in a hurry, which you WILL be.

- If your ship sinks, your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts.

- Rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands. Effectively cutting supply gathering time in half.

This doesn't even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well.
For example, the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which, 
if you have it docked on your ship, allows for an entirely new grappling angle.

So yes, Sea of Thieves is a service game. 
As such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure.
Thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide, meaning climbing that structure 
to reach said features is non-existent.

This unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has NOT happened. It's still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content.

Yes, if you played Sea of Thieves on release 
and disliked the ""go from point A to point B, back to A then repeat"" experience,
that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air, while now being shorter than ever, will probably still bore you as much as before. 

However when that dead air is gone, you will experience many many more interesting and fun
scenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations.

The point of this review isn't to just list all the positives and negatives, 
after all you will find plenty of those already, but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who's never played it.

Sea of Thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique 
and fun coop experiences I've ever played, it reminds me of a time 
when Rare took a formula, injected as much of their own personality and charm as they could
and also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title 
that stands on its own merit... It just took as long as a Steam release to make that happen.",1591301164,1591302719,True,363,13,0.919897854328155518,6,True,False,False,76561198061790553,99,2,7332,0,168,1600044028

25,70298705,english,"Hi everyone! I've played this game for thousands of hours! I just bought it on steam because I wanted to do away with the Microsoft store. There's a huge HUGE learning curve, and so I'm 100% going to list the pro's and con's as some one who has IDK how many thousands of hours on the game. Any controversial topics I will explain down below.

Pros
- Hundreds of commendations to unlock and achievements. Your effort and time put into the game style your ship and your character.
- Tall Tales are extremely fun to play through. The main story of the game is fun and a whole adventure
- Skull forts, Skull fleets, Fotd, and reaper chests are fun PVE, PVP environments that appear on the map to bring pirates together.
- Absolutely no P2W mechanics.
- Everyone has a fair start
- Many different treasures, emissaries, and ways to earn gold. By far a fun grind for me.
- A huge learning curve that's extremely rewarding after you figure out the ropes and get good.
- Easy to play with friends or connect with randoms.
- A wonderfully helpful community, that understand at the end of the day it's just a GG!

Now, a lot of people don't like the grind, and I understand that. Though back in my Halo 3 days, you earned armor from achievements, and it feels the same playing this game. You got cosmetics you can purchase, and cosmetics you earn.

Cons
- In game currency called ancient coins. Pay real  money to get content I feel should be earned instead. The game is already 40 dollars! The ancient coins are too expensive for a game at this price imo. 
- Getting sunk means losing hours of progress. This can be disheartening to a lot of the playerbase, even though it's a part of the game
- It takes too long to sail from island to island and to get to specific locations. So many hours just sailing.
- Too little amount of ships in adventure. Reapers emissary is boring half the time!
- Fishing makes no sense, and I feel is a very unrewarding aspect of the game. No one is gonna fish for 450 gold when one FOTD gives 140k gold.
- Arena is very unrewarding. Matches don't last that long, and I feel should have a different rhythm. Half the players you get on open play are mindless twats! You have to do LFC in the discord to even have a chance.

Now, a lot of people have controversy around the reapers bones emissary. I get it, it sucks when you get sunk. Though, PVP has always been an aspect in a game where you're meant to steal from other players and islands. If you get sunk, get better, get stronger, learn new strategies and fight back. This isn't solely a PVE game so people need to stop complaining. Yes, a reapers V emissary can see all emissaries on the map. So, form an alliance and take them down. If you decide to play solo and a galleon is after you, go against the wind. Look up tips online. 

All in all, I love PVP, and I love how reapers adds much more action in the adventure setting. It's fun to be chased, fight, and sink them. 

So, in conclusion. The game has a unique PVP experience that I love! The game's arena is mediocre without a fun crew, but can be rewarding with a decent crew. The ship and player aesthetics are absolutely rewarding as you earn them. The adventure mode has about 5k hours worth of your time if you enjoy the game, and I think that alone says enough.

There are only to things I would change:
[u]1) Save Tall Tale quests:[/u]
     I really don't see the point on having to start the whole chain quests when I leave the game or when the game crashes. These quests works on some kind of achievement checkpoint, where it records all the quests you did but doesn't let you pick them up where you left it (If I'm wrong about this, please let me know).

[u]2) Non PVE only servers[/u]
     I get it, this is a pirate game and PVP is part of the experience. But I believe that at least half of the players came to this game looking for the adventure kind of experience, not the ""If don't attack, he might show mercy"" kind of game. At least, consider looking out for the people who likes only PVE content.

44,70277914,english,"Sea of thieves is a great game to play with a crew of other people and to make new friends. Enjoy it for what it is and you will get your moneys worth. Solo Slooping is possible but isn't anywhere near as enjoyable as playing with others unless you are a hardcore player able to fight off galleons and brigs. A game made for numbers.

Tall tales are fun especially with the new checkpoint system in case someone tries to grief you mid quest and is worth the time to play.

Hit reg can be a bit dodgy at the moment but hopefully will be resolved.
Sloop should be balanced a bit more in my opinion as when you are against the wind running from other ships compared to brigs when they catch the wind, the difference should be the same to give solo players a better chance. Looking forward to new updates.

Love the game still, played since launch on and off and pirate legend in the first month so have at least 1000 hours and have seen content being added along the way when the game was £49.99 for 100% less content so £34.99 isnt bad.

Most poor reviews I've seen have to do with a lack of friends, I agree to some extent. Initially I was playing with a random for just a few minutes as I waited for my buddy to finish the tutorial. The guy that joined my crew immediately tried killing me using fire bombs. Another guy joined us later and he tried blowing up our ship (he actually did). So, yes, there are a lot of trolls and random crews can be complete toxic. I can say this, even with just two people, we had a blast. Some of the downsides was we couldn't figure out a way to add friends unless going through the Xbox live friendlist (not a big deal, but annoying at the very least). You're limited to 4 person crews and we dont see a way to join on friends, at least not an obvious way. So for now, we just join the lobby at the same time and go in together hoping no one crashes.

67,70293102,english,"It's a good game, but there are a couple of issues.

1. No decent voice chat in game. Sure, the game tells you there is, but for many (myself included) it simply doesn't work. No matter what solutions one tires, and I've tried them all, it simply does not work. This is disappointing. Apparently, it has something to do with how Rare implemented things and many players who use a USB headset or microphone just can't use voice comms in game. This is a black mark against the game, but it isn't game breaking, as most players just type in chat anyway.

2. Adding friends or joining friends to play with together is an absolute ball ache. There is no way in game to add a friend. Doing so through Steam appears to be pointless also, as your friends list does not appear in game. Apparently, this is done via the X Box App. This is another black mark against the game for the Steam release, as these features should be integrated for use through Steam if it's going to be released on Steam.

Overall, the game itself is great, it's lots of fun. But is is hampered by these 2 issues which makes it fall just short of truly excellent. I wouldn't worry about lack of content either, as it appears that plenty of stuff has been added recently to keep people engaged, so I'm sure there will be more in future.

Playing solo and grouping with randoms has, so far, been a good experience. I have only been met with one bad group, and have found nice people to play with 90% of the time. I would say the community is generally positive and welcoming.

Another thing I would complain about is the need to pay money for pets. This is greedy for an already extremely rich company, and an already expensive enough game. Boo Microsoft, Boo!

Your not going to spend thousands of hours trying to build a ship to get sunk. And, you don't lose your gold or gear on death. Pretty awesome, I know. Which makes pvp more fun.

21,70287302,english,"I left the Microsoft Store version at about level 47 in Gold Hoarders, Merchant Alliance, and Order of Souls which translates to around ~400 hours (if not more) or so unlogged on that client. The gameplay in ""Sea of Thieves"" (2018) is fundamentally basic however the feints, mind games, and digital hooliganism creates a full range of emergent scenarios in how you go about being a pirate. There is a quest item you can abuse for example to make others think you're trashing your loot into the abyss to spite them when in fact you are losing nothing.

Real skulduggery. The aesthetics and visuals of the sea as it transitions from different biomes and weather are unparalleled and sometimes produce nostalgia of older Rare titles for me. Sound design also deserves a mention.

In sum, the Steam client appears to run a bit better than the Windows Store client and as more people convert I will not have to navigate the Xbox Companion App which hangs and misbehaves. 40 USD was worth the hours I placed into this title just to avoid the headaches of that program.

☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Short Review: The game itself is unique. The story is short, but it's not meant to be played for the story then uninstalled. It's an online Co-op/PvP with a story. You customize your character, hop on an introductory quest to teach you the basics, then you go on your journey. It can be played with or without friends, although better with friends as most games are. But for the solo gamers with no friends, which i take are the majority of us, the game is still absolute fun. Give it a go, nothing is like it on the market as of now.

64,70280373,english,"Just to be clear i am writing this review as someone who has played this game since launch through the Windows Store and not just for a few hours on Steam.

This game is amazing, easily the most fun and rewarding game i have ever played, yes it is very difficult to play Solo i will say that now and you probably won't be able to play solo consistently until you become experienced at the game mechanics but remembering a few simple basics like keeping an eye on the horizon as much as possible will go a very long way to helping you play solo.

There is a plethora of content to this game in terms of both PvE and PvP that will keep you entertained for hours on end, you can grind, you can play chill and you can fuck around. Story mode in the open world, awesome events like the Skeleton Forts and Fleets, you name it, the game has it all and has regular 4 weekly content updates keeping everything fresh aswell!

I have no problem admitting there are also flaws to this game, i don't want to sound biased because i love the game so much, yes there are problems with some bugs and the fact they update the game every 4 weeks means new problems present themselves alot aswell, but lets be honest, no game is perfect and to the Developers credit, along with the 4 weekly updates bringing quality of life fixes with the new content, they do also release hotfix patches on a regular basis to try and fix any bad bugs.

I will also add that you would need to have at least 2 hours playtime in any given session to make some progress in the game, any quest or fight in Adventure mode could take you over an hour depending on the circumstances so its not really a game you can hop on and play for an hour unless you were to do the PvP Arena mode in which matches are only 15 minutes long.",1591270295,1591270295,True,4,0,0.548387110233306885,0,True,False,False,76561198009077538,88,3,29423,857,130,1601482084

It won't go to waste though. I may be a bit hooked. It's so much fun. I'm just starting, so only soloing at this stage. It's the most fun I've had in a game since Black Flag. This is the first time in a long time that a game has held my interest for more than a half hour at a time.

The graphics styling is amazing. The ocean looks outstanding (and at times scary as hell). The atmosphere is great.
The sound and music are spot on. 

I look forward to seeing what Sea of Thieves has to throw my way.

It has some of the best (and fair) PVP mechanics in any game I've played, as well as a pretty good microtransaction strategy which involves cosmetics, and nothing else. Zero pay to win mechanics to speak of. 

At its core, the combat is simplistic, yet so very deep. You only get three weapons in total, each with various skins that you can earn through in-game missions and in-game gold. You can also (sometimes) buy time-limited stuff, but it's all purely cosmetic, so if you're the type of gamer that plays with your parents credit card, you can buy a bunch of parrots or eye of reach skins, but you can't buy skill. Sorry, bummer. Guess you gotta get good manually through trial and error. 

And there will be a lot of trial and error,  especially in regards to how you operate your ship. There's a natural learning curve, and you *will* find yourself being absolutely destroyed by the more veteran players, at least for a while. You might even end up losing to a couple of Xbox players that just so happen to know how to operate their ship better than you. PC gamers do not have any kind of discernible advantage when it comes to ship combat. Sure, you can aim your cannons a *little bit* more accurately, but in the end, it doesn't really matter all too much. A cannon ball hitting a ship in one spot will do just as much damage as a cannon ball hitting a ship a tiny bit to the right of where you were trying to aim. Plus, couple that all with the waves and weather system, and the fact that physics exist, you'll find that your cannons don't always go where you want them to anyway, at least at first. You will eventually learn the patterns, and how to properly adjust your aim for the various conditions Sea of Thieves can throw at you. Point is, there's no advantage as a PC player when it comes to core ship vs ship combat. And no, that's not a negative by any stretch. 

All in all, Sea of Thieves is absolutely, stunningly, beautiful, with the absolute best water effects in any game, ever. Couple the water and weather system with the gorgeous lighting system, and you've got yourself eye candy for days. Seriously, you can take a picture of practically any island at any time of the day, and it'll always somehow manage to be impressive. So, great graphics, great gameplay (with weekly updates and events), fantastic naval combat, a freaking arena mode (don't do this, please), and the best player vs player combat I've ever witnessed in any game. Sea of Thieves is something truly unique, and is the absolute best pirate game you can buy. I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best online games of all time, and I have over 5,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, so that's saying something. 

In short, buy this game. You will not regret it. Just remember, if you're a friendly pirate, you will be taken advantage of. Eventually. Just don't be salty, okay? There's enough salt in the sea already, don't need you adding to it. 


Oh, and beginners tip: if you're brand new to the game and want to test it out as a solo player, be sure to pick the Sloop, and create a Closed Crew. The Sloop is a small ship, and is great for solo players. Though, Sea of Thieves is definitely intended to be played with friends on one of the larger ships. A full 4-man Galleon with a proper crew of talented pirates will be darn near unstoppable on the seas, assuming there's enough teamwork to keep everything running smoothly. 

So yeah. Buy this game. I can't wait to destroy your ship and steal all of your loot... cause that's what pirates do! Arrrrggg!

This game has very good graphics, and the cartoon-ish feel makes it more enjoyable than having super realistic graphics. It is also a semi-solo friendly game, but having a couple crewmates is the best part of this game. Its quite simple to understand, and mechanics are good.

-The fishing mechanic is intuitive and is quite fun, yet a bit annoying.
-Ship control mechanics are a masterpiece, due to so many factors on the ship making maintenence and such quite annoying, but is one of the charms of this game.
-Custimization is one of the most solid part of this game. Its fun grinding money for a while, then FINALLY being able to buy the outfit you've been wanting for a while. This makes it much more satisfying to grind, because the payoff is so good.
-Now that the game is on Steam, its much more accesible to many many players, and that makes filling up arena lobbies much easier.. It will also make finding opponents randomly when exploring much more common, which then helps if you're itching for a fight.

All in all, this game is shockingly beautiful and mechanics are great. As far as I've seen, I can't see amy game breaking bugs as of my small 6 hours of playing.

This does explain fairly well the game and shows you it's mechanics. Be happy this is there. When it first came out, this game had no instruction. It was essentially DayZ you spawn and GL. But now the maiden voyage shows you every aspect of the game and gives you a little bit of free starting money if you find the key. This game is a PVP pirate game with PVE aspects to get loot. Players will compete in the world to sell your own loot and try and get others loot. All things bought in this game with currency is purely cosmetic. I have many hours on the MS Store and am Pirate Legend. So at least 300 hours. The game has bugs. Every game does. That's an aspect we will have to come to grasp as games get larger and more ambitious. But game breaking bugs need to be gone and rare tends to patch game breaking things fairly quickly. My only real complaint about this game is Skeleton ships are way too op rn on the sea. There have been at least 2 or 3 times I have recorded where they shoot 3 consecutive cursed cannonballs. Which is way too many. And the last thing is hit reg overall. Hit reg is pretty terrible but has been vastly improved from this last update a day or so ago. They improved player hit reg. Ship hit reg needs some work as well as hole placement logic. This game makes you always stay on guard to protect yourself, your ship, and your loot. This game has lots of fun things to do in servers from skull forts, fleets, voyages, tall tales, and mythical creatures of the deep. Be weary of the Kraken always...

If you are weary on getting the game still, don't get it on steam first.... Go to the MS store and try the game on xbox game pass where the first month is a dollar then you can decide if you like the game or not. Then fully purchase if you want to play it past the month. 


Best way to play

Galleon with 4 people
Sloop with 2 people
Brig with 3 people
Sloop with 2 people
Sloop with 1 person
NEVER 2 man or single man a brig.... Just Don't...
Soloing a galleon is not impossible but is very difficult. But never recommend it.

49,70263774,english,"I absolutely adore this game. It can be both relaxing and one of the biggest adrenaline rushes you'll experience in online PVP play.

Sail the seas in a personal adventure reminiscent of the 90's movie, ""The Goonies"". With cartoonish, yet strangely beautiful graphics.

The game's PVP is very balanced, absolutely nothing you do progression wise will make you ""better"" via PVP mechanics than someone just starting the game. Some will complain about this, I will not, I love it.

It should also be noted that you can NEVER opt out of PVP in this game, some just cant handle it.

But if you can... play with friends and experience a PVE (with PVP) storyline that takes you around the Sea of Thieves, or just attack other ships and pillage, fight PVE forts and fleets that give loot you must defend on your way to turn in.... or just chill and go fishing, there are many different things to do in this beautifully cartoony world.

The community itself is a complete wildcard, you'll find children, old men, teenagers, all with varying degrees of classic online toxicity. To some this is not a selling point, and to those with thin skin, it probably isnt. But for me, this is the perfect place to set out helping some n00bs with their loot haul.

Highly suggested if you've ever dreamed of being a pirate as a kid. And as a gamer from the 90's this is one of the only games that has ever rivaled ""Pirates! Gold!"" or ""Sid Myers Pirates"".",1591233726,1591245249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993764162,187,36,4107,0,206,1600546332

By this point most people like me have forgotten about Sea Of Thieves - wide as an ocean deep as a puddle.  
I figured that it would be worth a go and made the mistake of buying it at full price(thank god for steam refunds).

I get in and play the initial tutorial mission which takes close to an hour(this is a scam on the dev's part designed to string it out so that you don't experience the real game and get stuck with it and not able to refund).  From there I get to the initial beginner island.  I'm trying to figure out what to do next when I die suddenly.  Some griefing idiot came up behind me and stabbed me to death.  I spot their galleon pretty quickly and swim over and kill both of them without even getting killed myself.  So the take away there is that we have spawn camping griefers and the griefers that aren't even competent players.  After I call them out in chat for griefing they say 'it's a pirate game'.  What they should have said is - it's a toxic community.  I actually really appreciate the fact that they were there and gave me a wakeup call before it was too late to refund.  

After that experience the game's been refunded as I realised that it's not my cup of tea.  Objectively speaking the design is stupid in that you can have griefers hanging out to kill the new players right out of the gate.  
People who don't like being ganked or ganking others should stay away from this.  Also you need a group of friends to enjoy this with.  To anyone who says that it's fun with a group of friends - playing rock paper scissors, getting drunk and driving off a cliff are also fun activities with friends.  Almost anything is fun with friends which isn't saying much about the game.

In terms of the more technical aspects; the graphics look okay but are nothing to write home about, the music is about what you'd expect, and there's very little voice acting.  I didn't really play much of the actual game content but you can tell pretty quickly that it's a thin game without much point to it.  

If you're considering buying read the discussion boards first and watch some youtube vids/twitch streams to make sure it's a good fit for you.

Most importantly - what's up with the astro-turf reviews that have saturated this product?  This is a thin slice of mediocre PVP.  There's no way it should be getting a very positive review.  I suspect that either the dev or the gankers are out in force trying to pad the reviews with misleading reviews.",1591244383,1591244383,False,64,36,0.291876524686813354,20,True,False,False,76561198006627248,523,20,70,0,70,1591242447

68,70266352,english,"I have played this game since release on the Xbox game store, and to sum things up in one sentence: This game is incredible work by Rare, and is one of my favorite games of the last 5 years.

More detailed review to follow:

Graphics: The game looks stellar. Water and seascapes are rendered in incredibly pretty detail, even on lower graphic settings. The environments are varied and exciting to explore, and the ships and liveries for them are simply beautiful. The overall style of the game is more stylistic than realistic, but it accomplishes its visual look exceedingly well.

Sound: Take my advice -- turn on Windows Sonic for your best pair of headphones for this game. The game sounds incredible and is built to work around Windows Sonic. Gunshots, swords clanging off each other, footsteps on the beach, creaking boards on your ship... everything sounds just as you'd expect it too, and adds to the experience. The music is also very well done, without being overdone. Robin Beanland (composer for some other rare titles such as Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct) did the music work for this game, and I can't recommend it enough.

Gameplay: This is where it all shines, but also where the game may not be for everyone. First of all, this is a PvPvE game. PvP is an integral component to the game, and it is not possible to play alone on servers with no other players, as the entire game is designed around players encountering each other on the seas, and the best moments come from those interactions (whether they be cooperative or competitive).

I know some people will never enjoy games that have the element of PVP where risk is involved. If you are one of these people, this game is not for you most likely. However, I would recommend to keep reading, because this isn't yet another Ark, or Rust, or even a PUBG or similar. This is something entirely different.

The PVP aspect of this game revolves around the fact that you and your crew, can meet up on the seas with other players and their crews, and can choose what to do in those situations with no restrictions. Do you want to try to sink the other boat for sport, and take whatever salvage you can? You can do that. Do you want to try to avoid the encounter entirely and try to sneak around other players and avoid being seen/engaged? You can do that. Do you want to form alliances and cooperate with other players to take down the more challenging pve encounters, or simply pool your resources? You can do that. Do you want to pretend to be allies... only to eventually backstab them and take everything for yourself rather than share the load? You can do that too.

If it wasn't obvious, the point is that everything with other players entails a degree of risk, but also the potential for reward. It is very open-ended.

However, remember how I said this wasn't Rust or Ark? The risk to yourself in this game really is limited to whatever cargo or loot you are currently carrying onboard your ship... and your own pride. Should you lose, and have your boat sink to an opponent, worry not, for you aren't going to be set back in progress, or have to re-purchase your boat and all its components through weeks of grinding with unfun mechanics. A new boat full of supplies will automatically spawn for you, the only thing that you will lose is chests or other loot you currently had on board at that time. All in all, this is fairly minor, but it makes the pvp exciting enough to feel like it matters, and isn't just for sport.

Ok, so PVP exists, but what about PVE you say?

Well, there's quite a bit of it! There are 3 main trading companies (+ 1 somewhat hidden one that unlocks after a certain amount of progression) that you can run voyages for. These voyages can involve sailing to islands to fight hordes of skeletons, to collect their skulls as trophys, treasure maps that force you to use your navigation skills to find buried treasure, riddles that have you look for clues and puzzles around the various islands to lead you to treasure hidden there, or cargo hauling activities which involve picking up/securing certain types of cargo and delivering them on-time to pre-set destinations, requiring you to look after things like valuable silk, delicate rum bottles, or hungry animals on board your ship.

Along the way, your journey will evolve from these basic mechanics. You may stumble across skeleton captains with their own hidden stashes or orders, leading you to new riches you had not originally planned. You may get attacked by various sea monsters. You may encounter a cursed skeleton ship that will try to sink your boat... or even an entire fleet of them. Loot is also strewn abound the various islands, awarding exploration and encouraging you to explore the environments. Some loot may even give you new quests which you can follow to their conclusion for even greater rewards.

The loot itself can even be interesting. There are cursed items that will force you to play around their negative effects, and if you are able to do so, can be sold for very high prices.

In addition to this basic gameplay loop, there is a 20-30 hour story mode built into the game. These are called Tall Tales and will take you all across the Sea of Thieves hunting ancient secrets and magical relics, all culminating in an epic journey to a hidden land of gold and riches. 

I highly recommend this game. It is best played with friends, but even if you can only scrounge together one other person to play with, you can have a great time. Keep your wits about you and keep your head on a swivel, and enjoy the journey.",1591239903,1591239903,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False,76561197971798737,252,14,8302,277,416,1601194766

72,70265707,english,"Sea of Thieves is a fantastic sandbox game, and if you're looking for a fun pirate game to sink time into then you need not look any further! That said, there are a few things you need to know before you make the dive.

First, it'll take a bit of time before you get good at the game. As with most sandbox games, there's a bit of a learning curve, but nothing too brutal or time-consuming. Learning how to sail and fight comes naturally as you play, don't be afraid to seek out a challenge to put yourself to the test.

Second, this is a rather social game. I mean that in the sense that you'll have to deal with people sooner or later. It doesn't matter whether it's a random crew you've just joined, or someone sailing towards you looking for trouble or fleet mates. You will have to deal with people, for better or worse.

And third, adding onto the 2nd - This is, at its core, a PvP game. You aren't safe from other players. They can, and will, attack or disrupt your voyage across the seas. But likewise, so can you. 

If you can live with that, and accept that you won't be a god at the game within a week, this is a gem worth picking up, for sure! If you can't, then obviously, do not get this game. I had a bit talking about why PvE servers are a bad idea, but I think most people understand why so I won't bother with it.

The tutorial is easy going and lets you go at your own pace, giving you a island to explore, a ship and the basic information/equipment for you to start your own adventure, creating your own tricks to form a personal pirate experience right from the get go.

Setting sail from tutorial island and going through the mini gauntlet, teasing you on what lays ahead, it's time for you to set sail on the open sea of thieves with the game mode 'Adventure'. This is the main game mode where you will be in a big open world with PVE (Player vs Environment) elements and other players that allows PVP (Player vs Player), which can create some interesting, exciting engagements that change the pace of adventures.

Spawning on one of many 'hub' islands you are greeted with some buildings that offer different cosmetics for weapons, clothes and your ship which can be purchased with gold that you earn from doing 'voyages' which are basically 'quests' that are also on the 'hub' island. 

After picking from three choices of voyages on 'hub' island, which are split into treasure hunting, bounty hunting and doing merchant runs which all offer different challenges and rewards. 

At first you will feel a bit lost and overwhelmed but with time you will become adjusted to the style of play and will be raiding islands and looting treasure chests in plenty of time, or doing merchant runs or just simply fishing. 

Play the pirate life you've always wanted.

Sea of Thieves, two years later, is a great pirate sandbox. At launch the game was pretty light on content, especially for its $60 price tag. Now, given all the updates it's had and the reduced price, I can't recommend the game enough. The music is amazing, the art style is great, and the open-pvp sandbox world provides a lot of different ways to play. The story voyages (called Tall Tales) are also solid with well paired music and visuals. Seriously, the Tall Tale music is so good. Check out ""Who Shall Not Be Returning"" for a taste of what I'm talking about.

Do I recommend the game? Yes! Well, to anyone that can enjoy a sandbox without the need for progression that makes your character stronger, anyway. Everyone is on equal footing in the Sea of Thieves, aside from skill learned from playing.

11,70260673,english,"I've played Sea of Thieves for over 100 hours on the Microsoft Store, here is my review.

OVERVIEW:
This is by far one of the best Sandbox multiplayer games on the market. If you have ever wanted to live out your pirate life fantasy, this the absolute best way to go about it. With a beautiful cartoony art style and a playstyle fit for every type of sandbox gamer out there, you are sure to find something to love out there on the High Seas.

WHO MADE SEA OF THIEVES?
Sea of Thieves was made by Rare, yes that Rare. The same company that brought you Donkey Kong Country/64, Banjo-Kazooie, Battletoads, Viva Pinata, Conkers Bad Fur Day and many other classic games going back as far as the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Rare is currently owned by Microsoft.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS?
Sea of Thieves can be played solo or with a party of up to 4 players working together to control a single ship. There are 3 different ships available. Solo players and most duo-players will be using an up to 2-player Sloop. Crews of 3 can use the larger 3-player Brigintine ship. And crews of 4 will use the largest ship, the Galleon. However you can always pilot a larger ship than your crew can handle, it just means an increased amount of difficulty. A larger ship means there is more to do when sailing and battling as well as it takes more players to successfully maneuver your floating base of operations.

AS A NEW PLAYER WILL I BE CRUSHED BY PLAYERS WITH BETTER GEAR?
Absolutely not. When you first log into the game you have access to all of the tools and weapons that every single other player has. Everything that is unlocked in the game is purely cosmetic. The only factor that matters in fights with other players is skill.

WHAT KIND OF PLAYSTYLES ARE THERE?
The different playstyles are actually tied to the 5 main factions that you will be gaining Reputation with throughout the game. You'll accept quests from these factions at outposts that will send you off in different directions to collect or deliver various items for them all throughout the seas to get experience and level the faction. Leveling a faction unlocks different gear skins, clothing options and ship skins that allow you to customize your pirate to your liking. Here is a brief overview of every faction:

- The Gold Hoarders give you Treasure maps and riddles that send you off to find buried treasure for them, of which you get a nice cut of the coin once you turn it in to them. Good for the adventurous player that likes to Explore Islands.

- The Order of Souls tasks you with going to specific locations to battle AI skeletons and retrieve their skulls for rewards. Good for the player that likes to fight PvE (player versus environment) baddies.

- The Merchant Alliance tasks you with delivering cargo or animals to specific islands within a certain timeframe. Good for those that like to play the role of delivery boy (most players honestly don't though).

- The Hunter's Call is for players who enjoy Fishing and Cooking. Bring them the meat of what you have found and they will reward you with unique item sets as well as coin. (Always cook your meat before you sell it as it will be worth more gold/Rep)

- The Reaper's Bones is the faction for players who love to PvP. They accept any and all loot that you wanna give them. However there is only one turn-in location on the map, so fights are sure to ensue.

For all the above factions you can also choose to become an Emissary for them. Being an Emissary attaches the faction's flag to your ship which you can level up in your session to add an ever increasing multiplier to the goods that you turn in for that faction. However be warned... Reaper's Bones Emissary factions will be looking to sink your ship and collect your Emissary flag and turn it in to their hideout for great rewards (if there are any Reaper's Bones Emissaries on the map they will show up on all other player's maps).

There is also an Arena PvP Mode that takes place on a separate map with it's own faction to level called The Sea Dogs.

- The 7th and final faction is Athena's Fortune (see next section)

IS THERE AN ENDGAME?
Yes and no. Everything you unlock in the game is cosmetic, so you won't be hunting for ""better"" gear in a traditional endgame. However the end goal for most players is to reach the rank of Pirate Legend! There is a 7th faction called Athena's Fortune which is unlocked when you manage to level at least 3 of the other 6 factions to level 50. This unlocks a special hideout only Pirate Legends have access to that have unique cosmetics and voyages to unlock.

IS THERE A STORY MODE?
Yes and no. There are a number of story quests you can go on called Tall Tales. These are stories quests that you can go on to learn more about the world and expand the narrative of the colorful characters who inhabit it. They each take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to complete and can be repeated or paused at certain checkpoints so you can come back to them later. You'll meet interesting characters, solve riddles and battle bosses not seen in the main overworld.

IS THERE MORE TO IT THAN ALL THAT YOU LISTED?
Yes! The activities above are only some of the things that you can choose to do. There are Skeleton Fort Raids that you can take on to unlock an entire cave of treasures! There are Bosses you can run into just while sailing around like the a Ghost Pirate Ship, The Kraken or The Megladon! On top of that there are also monthly events you can take part in for unique time-limited rewards. You could also just look to the horizon and travel without accepting any quest, you will surely bump into something that you can do.

IS GAME DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE?
It is not! Every single month Rare introduces new events to the world which could be either something as small as adding kamikazi skeletons that can now pop out of the ground with lit gunpowder barrels in their hands, to whole new systems (like fishing), new factions, new bosses, new tall tales or more! The game is just over 2 years old now and is a completely different beast than what it was at launch. So much new stuff has been added that it would take me too long to list.

I SEE THAT THERE IS A CASH SHOP. CAN PLAYERS BUY POWER?
There is a cash shop called the Pirate Emporium, however everything in the cash shop is cosmetic only. You can buy; pets, gear skins, ship skins emotes and much much more. This shop is updated often with new products monthly and often has discount sales on certain items. For a $40 game I myself have no problem dropping a little money here every now and then to help support the continued development of the game. I have a black and white cat named ""Bandit"" and he is my overlord.

FINAL SCORE
I don't really like actually ""scoring"" games because I feel the score's number diminishes the details. All I have to say is that if you like sandbox games, there isn't any other game like this on the market today. It is a must buy if you love adventure games, multiplayer games or anything having to do with the ocean. I often judge my entertainment purchases based off the number of hours I spend playing the game. For $40 you are absolutely going to get at least 40 hours of entertainment out of this game. 

FINAL THOUGHTS
I must note that the game can be played solo however it is more fun to me when you play with people that you know on Discord. If you don't know of anyone to play with then I recommend trying the Sea of Thieves official discord, there are looking for group channels as well as free chat channels you can use to make some new pirate friends.

I also recommend looking up some beginner's videos as well as Tips and Trick videos on YouTube. There are many techniques to ship battling, sword fighting and more that the game doesn't fully explain.

If you are ever confused by something or don't know what something is used for or what something does then I recommend the Sea of Thieves Gamepedia page (just google it).",1591226655,1591226655,True,5,0,0.567095756530761719,1,True,False,False,76561198042257423,658,1,8422,0,25,1597465687

14,70260465,english,"After only 4 hours in this game I can say I am happy with my purchase. But one thing you need to know is this is designed to be played with others. You can play solo (as i have) and still have a good time. but be ready for when a group of 4 come steal your ship while you are on an island getting bounties and then lose all your gear.
Its very frustrating to have that happen but its a game about pirates so what can you expect? There are ways to find others to play with but the game thus far feels very cut throat so in that aspect I think the developers did a great job creating this wild thieving world where everyone is on edge and watching their back.
I advise you buy this if you love co op games and have friends to do so. otherwise you could be in for a world of hurt.

TL|DR - Very fun, beautiful graphics, Best looking water I have ever seen. Fun but simple fighting and the ship mechanics are a blast. Must play with others to avoid being picked on by larger groups.

- Yes your pirate carries over if you have played previously on the microsoft store
- Yes it is entirely crossplay between Steam/Microsoft Store/XboxOne
- Yes it is really fun

Alright, where do I even begin with this? The game has come such a long way from launch, there is so much to do now and combat between ships is very fleshed out and strategic seeing as you can Board the enemies, destroy masts , set fire on the ship to cause chaos detroy steering wheels and capstans to reduce mobility special cannonballs with unique effects the sky is the limit on how you plan your attack. After that the PVE aspect has also been fleshed out with Emissary flagging ( basically raising a flag for a faction of your choice to get more xp and cash with the risk of being shown to Reapers Bones players ( The PvP oriented faction that primarily gets XP from Stolen loot ) and tall tales which are small adventures with a story. Lastly and most importantly sailing is extremely satisfying in this game even if you arent really doing anything you have fun going from island to island ( At least I do ) and combined with the instruments that play pirate songs the atmosphere is wholesome to say the least.

Do keep in mind that this is Sea of THIEVES, when you see another ship or player always assume they are hostile, Betrayal is as common as the common cold and players will go out of their way to steal your precious booty. We are Pirates above all else after all

Buy it. Live it. Love it. Some of the most fun I've had in a video game. The random unexpected chaos is amazing! It truly is about the adventure and fun. No regrets and I honestly can see myself still playing 10+ years from now. I have now purchased the game through Microsoft and Steam.

It has everything you could want from an adventure game - intense battles with a surprising amount of strategic depth, chill moments to just take in the scenery or mess around with friends and a good sense of progression. Honestly a jewel of a game. 

You will read reviews op people crying about needing private servers / they hate the fighting part of the game - But ignore them, because what they don't realise is that the game would get boring VERY quick if there was no reason to be alert for potential hostile players. That's the fun of it, nothing more exciting than bringing a good loot haul back to sell or doing a successful pvp run.

Only cons of the game would be that sometimes hitreg is bad especially if there arent servers close to you. Devs keep on with monthly updates, so you'll get your moneys worth.

64,70254159,english,"(I've had this game since release on the Microsoft Store which I actually see as a blessing as a lot of people didn't play the original release since it was fairly buggy and WAY more repetitive. This game deserves every labor of love award I can think of as the team has put so much effort and time into making this game what its artists and designers dreamed of when they set out with the codename Athena.)

This review will be me sucking this games dick.

Sea of Thieves/Ineffective Pirates of The Caribbean/Sea of Electric Boogaloo/Pirate Simulator 2020 is 100% my absolute favorite game hands down game set match every single time.

Although my playtime here on steam is very low, my friends and I have easily breached the 100 hour barrier. I am not a pirate lord as we didn't really care.  What we really cared about was being a swashbuckling band of rag-tag pirates sailing the high seas for good laughs and explosions.

This game scratches the EXACT itch I always need a pirate game to scratch:

The melee combat can be a bit wonky, but its simplicity is as advanced as it needs to be. Click to slice, hold to stab. Repetitive, but the number of enemies and absolute chaos taking place in your usual game of Sea of Thieves keeps you locked into the mayhem.

The ship combat is very simple, but with different kinds of cannonballs and the tools available to you keep the combat spontaneous and ALWAYS keeps you on your toes. Mix in the absolute chaos as the ship you're fighting drops kegs or does a drive-by molotoving all while your friends are screaming through the chaos.

I have to talk about the art direction and the music in this game as I find it to be essentially the best part of SoT.  I'll be linking an hour long exploration of the concept art and the designers below. I'd highly recommend it to everyone as it is incredibly interesting. I will now attempt to sum it up:

Sea of Thieves is abundantly unique.  When making this game, they made the art along side the logistics of the game.  The amount of small detail is absolutely astounding.  There is actually a philosophy the designers came up with to properly convey the emotion of this game.  Everything looks used. Everything has little dinks in it. Everything looks like its been used and repaired, giving the entirety of the game a Macgyver repair esq feel to it. Even the floor boards, soaked and shining from the ocean spray, are oblong pieces. Showing that the items you're using, the ship you're on and the places you'll visit have existed and will continue to exist.
Then there's the water in this game. THE WATER. I've never seen a group nail what fantasy ocean should look so perfectly before Rare.  The different colors and reflections. The way the sky colors blend in with the ocean to make stunning sunsets.  The colors of the trees and flora and the characters endlessly strange but happily accepted charm.

And the MUSIC?! I have the OST on my spotify and constantly listen to it when doing just about anything. Music is incredibly important to me in a game like this. You will spend a lot of time listening to the lapping of the waves against your hull, and listening to the shores of the islands.  The background music is in its perfect place as a backdrop. But when you pick up that Hurdy Gurdy while relaxing on your voyage to the next island and you start playing Becalmed...my god it will change you.

The music in this game has no business being this good, and they keep making MORE.

I recommend this game to pretty much every person I can talk to. I've been shouting about this game coming out on steam since I saw the announcement. I've pressured money out of peoples pockets. I've bought this game TWICE. And I intend to make it a gift to friends for however long the servers remain.

Rare made this game into a cornerstone of my time as a gamer.

10/10, best game I've owned to date.

Sea of Thieves originally released in 2018 on March 20th, 3 days before my birthday. As soon as it launched, I played it exclusively for much longer than any other game I play even with the early lack of content. Since its launch, there has been SO much new content added. In 2019, for their Anniversary update they introduced 2 new Trading Companies and Tall Tales to the game which brought a whole new wave of things to do. Now once again, they've released another Trading Company which brings us to 7 in total. Don't let my hours on Steam fool you, I've probably got over two or three thousand hours from the Microsoft Store.

[b]This game is truly a masterpiece. If you didn't take the time to read the paragraph above, just understand this.

79,70251672,english,"I've played for many many hours on the Microsoft Store version of the game, and it is an incredible open-ended sandbox experience that continues to get more and more content added as time goes on. But I believe a warning is necessary:

This game is not easy, nor does it hold your hand. While you're playing, it is almost guaranteed that one other person in the world wants to take everything that is yours - even if all you have is your life - and they will do everything in their power to take it. Trust no one, and be ready to fight whoever you encounter, but keep in mind that there are also good souls on the seas, ready to team up and share the wealth. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself at the end of your voyage with a cutlass in your back. All this said, you can often find yourself having whole adventures at sea without encountering another crew, instead simply battling the weather and various monsters ready to claim the unsuspecting pirate.

I wholeheartedly recommend the game, and am excited to see more pirates out on the seas! My recommendation is to build a crew of close friends, go out on adventures, and see what roles people fall into best. I personally tend to do well at managing a crew in the midst of battle, so more often than not I find myself in the position of captain, but a navigator who manages voyages and plots out a course is also a very respectable role, and crews always need members ready to repair the ship and fire on enemies!

This game RULES. The open seas are beautiful, and the ship mechanics are intuitive and engaging. There are so many things to do, every player has a different expirience. And reaching that oh so sweet Pirate Legend status is extremely satisfying. 

I want to be fair and share cons -
1. The hit reg isnt perfect. (but not near as bad as people on reddit complain about)
2. There ARE bugs (But every game has bugs, and this game is very ambitious)
3. Players can be real salty. Just like the Sea Dogs they are. 
4. You WILL lose hours of progress, but learn from it, don't let it discourage you! 
5. The game doesn't do alot (outside of the maiden voyage) to teach you about your actual goal in the game.

But some  pros - 
1.Ship battles rock and are the best ive played in any game
2. the tall tales though tedious, can be a blast with friends
3. even just doing a FISHING voyage can be a fun way to relax, soak in the sea, and learn the world
4. The game isnt afraid to scare new players, its a mysterious world your dropped into, run towards fear!
5. shooting monkeys out of cannons

2,70247227,english,"Quick Note - I have sunk in at least 950 hours+ on Sea of Thieves before it's debut on steam, making it my most played game outside of the steam ecosystem.I started playing in August of 2019.

I'll do my best to rapidly make some points to inform you whether or not Sea of Thieves is for you, With a section describing the positives and another with what could use improving.

[b]The Good[/b]
[list]
    [*]There is a wide variety of content to do. Sea of Thieves earned a [b]WELL-DESERVED[/b] reputation for being very lackluster at launch, but with consistent content updates and patches Rare has done good on their promise to improve SoT from both a stability and content stance. More on the stability issues later. The actual amount of things to do has more than tripled since launch. This includes Megalodons, Skeleton ships/fleets, emissaries, Fort of the Damned, The entire devil's roar region, Tall tales(a series of campaign style missions), fishing, arena, and various additions to combat including cursed cannonballs, the ability to collapse masts, fire and firebombs, chainshots,  and there is more that I don't remember off the top of my head. This does not include the various monthly events that have happened in the past, which are no longer available. An example of one of these events was during the Smugglers Fortune update, in which a new, highly profitable voyage was available for a month BUT everybody had to go to the same island to dig up their treasure. This lead to a lot of PVP for the month, but events like these were one-off.
    [*]Sea of Thieves is an absolute looker, and the visuals are so pretty and enjoyable to look at. In my opinion Rare has absolutely nailed the look of the world and their visual design. I won't go too deep into it, as the SoT subreddit has more than enough posts of screenshots if you would like to see them.
    [*]Ship combat is really enjoyable, and fairly balanced. There is not many negatives I have to say about ship combat except for one [i]tiny[/i] pet peeve when it comes to raising a mast that has been broken. If a mast get fully damaged it will begin to fall, and you will need to raise it back up and repair it. You have to allow the mast to fall all the way before raising it again. If you catch it as it's falling using the sail ropes, and raise it back up, it will just fall again. A minor pet peeve. Other than that the different attributes of the different types of ships play well, and a good crew can really use their ship's strengths to full effect. 
    [*]SoT is the type of game that can fit most people. Are you the type of person that just wants to pass the time, chillin, playing with friends and talking without really worrying about much? Pop down a gold hoarder voyage or start fishing with the boys. Feeling like you want to hunt down and engage in combat with somebody for no particular reason? Pop the reapers mark and announce to everyone you are here to scrap. Do you enjoy climbing the ranks, gathering money, and unlocking things for your effort? Plenty of that for you too. Whatever the case, remember that this is a pirate game, and while some of the people you meet on the seas might be friendly, In my experience most are not, either out of self defense or aggression. So be sure to remember that.   
[/list]

[b]Progression[/b]
Before I cover some of my gripes, I feel that I should quickly discuss the double-edged progression in SoT. The good thing is that there is no difference from a beginner to a veteran except for skill. The pistol you have at the start does the same damage as the pistol the guy with literal gold skin just killed you with. There are no stats in SoT. The game was designed this way so that everybody has a fair playing ground. The bad news is that there is no progression for weapons or the player. The only progression you earn in this game is cosmetic, and that is it. I bring this up because I feel that there is so much potential for weapon or player progression, like warframe(just not as insane) or deep rock galactic(much more sane). I understand that this allows for a fair fight but I can still imagine what it would be like.

[b]The bad/What needs improving[/b]
[list]
  [*] I have one, and only one MAJOR gripe with Sea of Thieves and that is the hit detection with player guns/swords. This wont really be a problem for many of the PvE factors in Sea of thieves but this flaw can show just how bad it can be during PvP fights. It works well most of the time, but sometimes, you will get a hitmarker meaning the shot landed but NO damage will be dealt. I have seen videos of somebody getting shot, hitmarker and you could see it was an obvious hit 5 TIMES (It takes two with the pistol to kill a full HP player). The fact that I have to question if the game is bugging out or if the other person is hacking somewhat often can really show just how bad it can be sometimes and it should not be this way. This has been an issue for a long time and if it was an easy fix, they would have done it. This issue can make the Arena PvP only gamemode a complete joke sometimes. Swords are much more consistent so I use sword and flintlock all the time. This issue applies to every player gun, and the sword will sometimes have this issue too.
   [*]There have been a variety of bugs that have been out for a while, but it seems as Rare is finally managing to tackle some of these. I won't go into depth but most of these were minor, non-game breaking but annoying bugs such as your player cosmetics not being saved across play sessions. This one was fixed, and most of the other ones I know of as well but I figured I should mention it.
[/list]

TLDR: Game is fun and devs constantly add new things to it. I would recommend it. If this TLDR isnt enough information for you, you have a whole review right above it.

I would say it is an absolutely enjoyable product and worth a purchase.

Quick Edit: I forgot to mention that there ARE micro-transactions in this game but as I stated with progression earlier, It is all cosmetics unique to the pirate emporium (premium currency store). Should this ever change I will change my review accordingly. Should Rare allow an actual advantage to be bought I will change my stance on this game in a heartbeat. The only things of any real value in the emporium are the ability to change your characters face/body and pets. If you really want those, there are rare skeletons that spawn that you can kill for ancient coins. My friend recently got this game and is upset with how her character looks and would to like to reset it without paying. After one of these skeletons, she now has enough to buy the change appearance potion, and pets are obtainable with ether 1 lucky skeleton or two unlucky ones (the values of coin you get are randomized.) From what I have seen you can get anywhere from a dollar to 8 dollars worth of currency depending on your luck with a single skeleton. And for what it's worth, the ancient skeletons are not even the the rarest spawn in the game, but they are up there at number 3. You will eventually find a couple over a long period of time.",1591203468,1591205010,True,3,0,0.551070749759674072,0,True,False,False,76561198026903846,549,21,18150,2641,5,1601680970

This is a giant sandbox of fun and a clear work of passion.
Go for some smaller quests, some grand tales, randomly get attacked by giant mega sharks or sunken ships of pirates past or even other player ships. That´s right, there is always the risk of PvP and that makes this game thrilling. Go for another ship and try to grab their treasure? Flee from another ship to protect your own? Hide your stuff on an island and come back later for it? Get attacked by ghost ships while fighting other players and then a giant mega shark attacks the ghost ship and then you kill the shark, the ghost ship and the players and theres not enough time to loot it all because someone else is approaching? Everything is possible!

Now, the game can be called grindy if you are going to level up ranks in the different companies. But you know what?
This game offers no progression in power-level whatsoever, which I really enjoy. Everything you can earn or grind for is costmetic and therefor entirely optional. No player you encounter will be more powerful then you just because they look more fancy.

So far I've only done the small ""tutorial"" island and that alone was enough to tell me how much has actually changed and I'd say for the better.
People are always going to complain about there never being enough content but if you're starting this game fresh or new then there's going to be plenty to do be it exploring, treasure hunting, fighting (PvE), or (PvP) being a pirate and finding people to fight and steal their loot. As usual, a game like this is always better enjoyed with friends but you can sail around solo and have fun too.
At the end of the day, in my opinion, this game will give you more than 40 hours of playtime (1$ = 1 hour (seems fair)) and well worth getting into. The graphics and art style are stunning, the islands, oceans, and other scenery are vibrant and beautiful. The multiple factions give you plenty of things to do and work towards.

I first bought this game last year, after really enjoying it after playing on the game pass. This is truly a fantastic game, unlike any other.

You can't really compare this game to anything else already out there, you can choose to be more friendly, and mainly do PvE, getting your loot the hard way (which is what I usually end up doing...), or, you could wait for others to do the PvE for you, and then sink their ship and steal their loot.

Yes, this game can feel horrible at times, when you have a bunch of loot on board and you get sunk, frankly, it sucks. But, the fantastic experiences this game provides are well worth it. I thoroughly recommend doing the base tall tales, they are amazing. The last tall tale is quite out of the ordinary, and differs a lot from the others. The tall tale grind can get a bit cumbersome if you also try to 100% all of the commendations, but it is well worth it, don't give up, get to tall tale 9.

55,70238574,english,"I might add from the start that I bought this game through the Microsoft Store when the game was released so my total playtime is much higher.

How to start? Well this is a game with a bit of a troubled launch to say the least. While a functional game it was really barebones. A big world with nothing really in it besides the same 3 missions over and over again.
But how is the game now at it's Steam release?
Well it is in a much better state without a doubt. From skeleton ships that can show up and mess with you to a bigger map with more natural hazards. Add to this with 1 more faction added that you can earn reputation for to more weapons and items, quests and a new ship. So there is more to do with still with room to expand even further.

Graphics are still top-notch with it's stylized look in their characters giving it it's own rather unique look to the gorgeous scenery and water with great sounds to accompany it.

Sailing which will take up most of your playtime isn't hardcore or complex but it isn't totally shallow either. You need to keep a watch on the wind and raise and lower the sail(sails depending on ship) and angle them as well in order to get the most out of the wind. And yet the sailing is easily the most enjoyable aspect of the game with the ships behaving well with the water and waves rocking the boat in a realistic manner. Getting caught in a storm can be quite a challenge just trying to keep a steady course and preventing the ship from getting flooded. Beware if you got a weak stomach since sea sickness is a possiblity.

Combat is as basic as it gets but it works. Same with enemies where you are either fighting skeletons, snakes or other players. But there is some variation when it comes to the skeletons like with some golden skeletons being very hard to kill to shadow skeletons that can only be hurt when in the light.

Naturally the game isn't perfect(few are). Main being is that it might not be totally fun if you are a solo player. With 3 ships available, there is really only 1 ship for solo players since the other 2 ships are too big to be handled by 1 person. And it's always more fun to play with others. Thankfully there is a matchmaking service so anyone sailing with a open crew slot you can join in.

Expansions are released free of charge and the game has microtransactions but it's for cosmetics only and most cosmetics you can unlock by simply playing the game.

Overall I recommend this game.",1591190441,1591190441,True,6,0,0.53250044584274292,0,True,False,False,76561197968857043,622,7,190,0,32,1591448100

79,70234710,english,"Sea of Thieves is one of the best multiplayer coop experience you can currently get. It highly depends of your crew, you and up to your 3 friends can join to have your own adventure. The beauty of this game is that it does not have any progress in developing your character. At first it may seems pretty repetitive and boring. There is no way to make your ship stronger, or character do more damage. This makes every encounter on the seas challenging. The only progress that you can make is by knowing the core mechanics better, and use them to your advantage. By smart managing your ship and using all variety of different cannonballs it is deffinietly possible to sink a 4 person galleon while flying 2 person sloop. The only things that you can buy for money are clothes and different skins to your weapons and equipment, but you won’t gets any benefits by using endgame and rare varieties of this skins. You can look whatever you like fitting in many different sets of clothes not losing any stats. Game had a pretty rough start in 2018 by a lack of content but now Rare took a good care of their masterpiece by adding regularly new content and even new core mechanics such as fire. Rare is one of the most transparent and connected to community companies I’ve ever seen. They love their game and care about community. The updates are well thought and makes changes that make me go back every time the new update is released. However this is not game for everyone. Its mainly for people that have lots of free time to spare. Quick in-and-out voyages can become a long hours of traveling thru seas collenting more and more loot just to the point that other crew will decide to attack you and steal all the loot. Yes this game is PVP ONLY. That doesn’t necessarily means that everyday you would find someone so desperate to kill you, that he will chase you thru all map and eventually get you in confrontation. BUT loosing your hard earned progress just few minutes away from outpost in with u would cash in your loot is a part of game. I literally have a THIEV word in the title so by setting sail be sure that you will eventually lose many thousands cash by other players. It is in my opinion a great test whether you really like this game. If you would sail for like a 4/5 hours on duo sloop with your friend just to be downed by a galleon of reapers bones, and after a break to chill after this loss you would still want to play and maybe make up what your lost. It is definitely a game that I would recommend with all my heart. After 1.5 year, couple hundred hours, and millions in cash stolen from me I am still waiting with a smile on my face to buy this game second time, just to have an hour counter. I love the aesthetics, unique climate, developers and every part (except double gunning) of this masterpiece.
