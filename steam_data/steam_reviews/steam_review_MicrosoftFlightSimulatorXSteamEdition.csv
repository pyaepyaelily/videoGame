I`m a flight manager for 2 airlines, (l used to fly the original FSX in Windows 7) no issues. But since l upgraded to Windows 10, l had to switch to FSX Steam Edition so anytime l go to fly my flights, l have to re-create them over again, which is time consuming. The load the ""saved flight plan"" feature shows your FSX Steam  flash screen only, no flights.  The other issue which is minor, when l fly in multiplayer mode, we use the JoinFS program. For some reason, it can`t find my aircraft model to scan. But l`m able to fly and see everyone but they are  all in the default aircraft, Cessna 172.  Didn`t  have that issue in Windows 7.

43,76673079,english,"I do and don't recommend this game at the same time.

Why don't I recommend it?
1. FSX was released in 2006 which makes a very old game
2. The game is not nowhere near as realistic as for example X-Plane 11 or the new MFS2020
3. Now that MFS2020 has been released I would just go for that since it is so much better
4. Many things in FSX are simplified so everyone can play the game without much practise
5. The game is a buggy mess
6. Flight physics are not the best and do not give you a real feeling of flying
7. Bad stock aircraft selection
8. Way too many DLC's
9. Pretty much all stock aircraft are missing functions that should be there

Why would I recommend it?
1. The game is easy to learn
2. A lot of mods help the game be better
3. For a 2006 game, it still somehow manages to look good even on a low end computer
4. No need for a gaming computer for this game

So, I use FSE (Flight Sim Economy) and this gives me the game-play element. Although its all just gone nuts recently in Aug 2020 with the release of the new MS flight sim.

Especially on FSE and other flight sim BB's, people are complaining like mad about useless things that they shouldn't be complaining about, (because they don't really know how to fly or lack the patience to learn correct procedures), 

Re- most of these new flight-simmers (in my opinion), seem to be wannabe YouTuber's, who've just bought the new MS flight sim, and are expecting an arcade style game-play. You cannot just squeeze and go in FSX or the new MS FS.

The beauty is in the simulation, correct procedures and startup routines to start your plane and all that kind of stuff. Add FSE into the mix and you have to really think about where you are going and work out fuel use and costs, weight and journey time. But if you love strategy type sims and games, this will suit you, especially if you also like to fly planes in sims and games.",1600108986,1600108986,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069262805,80,31,74277,0,66932,1600607180,,

-BUGS AND CRASHES  
-- If you thinking buy this game, think one more time. Because FSX still has optimization problem. Think about that, You're playing FSX and you're middle of the flight. OPS! This BS game decided to crashing no reason.
-- Think one more time about shutdown your PC. Beacuse when you're shutdown your PC, you may not find it like you left your FSX.
-- Twice the hours i played the game i spent solving the bugs of the game.

- GAMEPLAY
-- FSX is an old game though still has a impressive GP experience. I'm kidding, if you haven't any PMDG, Aerosoft ect. this game is garbage.  You should add Airplane, Scenery, Texture ect.  
-- Whatever happens this game is father of the FS games. In 2020 i am still playing this game and i enjoy that. 
--Game mechanics is OK. It won't hurt you, but it doesn't make you feel great either.

-CONCLUSION
-- Making the game playable is very expensive. 
-- Get used to getting crash all the time.
-- If you spend money this game becomes a complete masterpiece. (A LOT OF MONEY!)

-HATALAR VE ÇÖKMELER
-- Bu oyunu satın almayı düşünüyorsanız bir kez daha düşünün. Çünkü FSX'in hala optimizasyon sorunları var. Şunu düşünün; FSX oynuyorsunuz ve yaptığınız uçuşun tam ortasındasınız. BAM! Bu saçma oyun hiç bir neden olmadan çökmeye karar veriyor. 
-- Bilgisayarınızı kapatmadan önce bir kez daha düşünün. Çünkü bilgisayarınızı kapattıktan sonra FSX'inizi bıraktığınız gibi bulamayabilirsiniz.
-- Oyunu oynadığımın iki katı kadarı oyunun hatalarını çözmeye harcadım. 

-OYNANIŞ
-- FSX eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen hala iyi bir oynanışa sahip. Şaka yapıyorum, eğer PMDG, Aerosoft vb. sahip değilseniz bu oyun çöp. Uçak, Yeryüzü Dekoru, Doku vb. şeyleri oyuna eklemek zorundasınız. 
-- Ne olursa olsun bu oyun uçuş simülasyonlarının babası. 2020 Yılında bile bu oyunu oynuyorum ve bundan zevk alıyorum. 
-- Oyun mekanikleri fena değil. Sizi üzmez ama sizi harika da hissettirmez.

-SONUÇ
-- Oyunu oynanabilir yapmak çok pahalı.
-- Oyunun sürekli çökmesine alışın.
-- Eğer çok para harcarsanız bu oyun tam bir başyapıt. (ÇOK PARA!)",1588415342,1598706922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198239877590,97,1,7854,0,7854,1588539940,,

1,73305968,english,"Late to the party with this review but more than 400 hours in, it's probably fair to say I like the game. I've played most iterations of Flight over the years. The only reason I still have this is the lack of updates (so eagerly waiting to see what happens soon).

I play on a modern laptop, which has adequate performance for most games including this one but I do not use a dedicated gaming machine. With that said, my graphics options are set fairly high with little impact on frame-rate etc.; more tech-minded people with have much more to say about this.

For me, the real enjoyment of MS Flight comes from 'flying' the smaller aircraft at low level taking in the scenery - I love spotting real-world buildings and features in the landscape and taking screen-shots of these. I have upgraded some things with dlc to improve terrain rendering or graphics and added quite a few payware and freeware aircraft (I prefer smaller amphibian aircraft and the more quirky looking real-world machines and not the larger aircraft or modern military aircraft).  I like creating VFR flight plans and 'flying' these using fairly realistic restrictions (e.g. taking in to account range and aircraft performance issues whilst steadfastly ignoring ATC instructions).

I'm not hugely into sims so I probably have little to add about realism. I recognise that some aircraft are harder to fly than others and I set the realism sliders towards the 'realistic' end of the spectrum for all which makes 'flying' a strange mix of relaxation and tension (especially on landing at smaller airfields). I treat MS Flight as the 'real world' version of No Mans Sky which I play to distraction). I also like real-world weather and the challenges that this brings (especially when flying VFR when in reality, you would never take the aircraft up).

I highly recommend this game if you like being a tourist with mild jeopardy(!) but you may want to wait until the new Flight is released (unless this version and DLC is available at a huge discount).

I'm not sure if I will upgrade to the new Flight - I feel that I would like to, but I like the fact that this version works so well on my laptop and would not want my enjoyment to be impacted by poor performance of my hardware.

***UPDATE - FLIGHT SIMULATOR 2020***

So, I bought the MSFS2020 from the MS Store (before they announced it was going to be on Steam).

It looked beautiful but I have read on Steam that it has been a nightmare to install. It is also a nightmare on the MS Store too.

I cannot get it to work and so far have tried installing/uninstalling 4 times! My laptop died and I had to reinstall Windows 10 essentially wiping evrything except my data including my MSF SE with all of the add-ons (and yes I think this was linked to MSFS 2020). I am gutted.

The issue for me seems to be downloading the 90*GB update - I am trying to obtain a refund but becasue the programme takes so long to install, this is unlikely to happen.

I recommend that you do not buy MSFS 2020 until they have fixed the bugs... As of now, I have uninstalled the game and wait in hope - £60 for the basic version is not cheap, and for it not to work for so many people is frankly apalling.

But, it's now 2020.

The flight model is good. The terrain modeling is horrid, by today's standards. To buy the areas that I would like to fly over, in addition to the US, I would need to spend as much as buying MS Flight Sim 2020.

The aircraft selection isn't bad, but as I've moved on, I prefer simpler aircraft. Buying the additional aircraft for this version is not recommended. Better iterations exist. The base Cessna 172 is well modeled, and is the only aircraft you will need, unless you live outside the US, or want to play the airline game. A simple stick is all you need to play.

Summing up, buy this only at a greatly discounted sale, as a basic flight trainer. It served well for many years, but it's time is over. The add-ons cost too much.

Pro's
- Runs perfectly (60+ FPS consistently in the air) on Ultra High settings
- Compatible with Xbox One controller, useful as I haven't got a joystick
- Easily customisable, already added several new soundpacks, airports and aircraft. Literally a drag and drop job for some freeware aircraft
- Multiplayer works again so flying with friends is possible again

Cons
- Real world weather no longer works without a 3rd party program
- FSPassengers X is no longer supported which added a fun change to the game. Just crashes and shuts off when starting FSX because it's now an ""unknown version"" due to the update.
- Can sometimes fail to maximise if minimised, meaning hard close is necessary to restart it",1597860280,1597860280,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198024959208,67,1,741,0,301,1598388121,,

I have been forced to return to my old PC, and wanting to play a flight simulator, I booted up X-Plane 11, and got 2 fps, so I scrapped that idea, and booted up FSX, and I have been truly enjoying playing this game, even if FS2020 is literally photo realistic, this game is still unbelievably fun to play, and runs smoothly on an 11 year old PC. The multiplayer runs smooth, the plane selection is wide, and there are quite a few airline liveries to choose from, compared to just about none in FS2020 (I believe, I've only seen my friends play the game as I can't even download it on this PC). I really REALLY enjoy this game despite its age, and still recommend the game now with FS2020 released! If your computer has the power to run FS2020, then get it. But if you're not sure, this game is still a good alternative, and although the graphics are nowhere near breathtaking or photo realistic, the graphics are upgradeable with the immense selection of freeware scenery (and payware), and you can get just about any plane you imagine with freeware, compared to FS2020 with just about... no freeware. I'm not bashing FS2020, it's an amazing game, but it is not without its flaws, and those flaws are many. This game may seem daunting due to its old age (14 years old!) but it still holds up nicely, and I enjoy playing it to this day.",1514839791,1597795944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198162085734,41,4,14450,0,14215,1597952817,,

21,74269214,english,"Until Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 comes out, this is the definitive Microsoft Flight Simulator game. The main thing you need to know if you are getting into this is that it is a simulation game that leans HARD into the Simulation part. What this means is that this game doesn't have any objectives or anything ""game-like"". It has a few missions, yes, but the real meat and potatoes is getting into a virtual plane, and taking flight, doing what YOU want. Want to fly a 747 from RJBB to KLAX? Can do it. 

It should be noted, however, that this game does have limitations. Without any payware scenery, the game's environments are quite bland. You may get some 3D buildings, but for the most part things are textured onto the terrain. The quality is circa 2006, which is expected considering the game originally came out in that year, but just be warned going in. This isn't a huge deal breaker when you are flying over an ocean, for example, but if you want to fly around your hometown and look for landmarks, you likely won't be able to. 

The other limitation is with the stock and freely available aircraft. While you will likely be able to find the plane you want somewhere, unless you are willing to do research and/or pay, there are going to be cut corners. For example, if you drop the full price for a PMDG 737 (around $75 at time of writing), then you get what is probably as close to accurate a simulation as one can get in this game. But if you find a free version, you will find that some control systems weren't implemented, and the overall flight model may be inaccurate to some comical degrees. 

The last real drawback is that the ATC in the game is...lacking. While IFR flights are very doable (and in fact, VFR is almost a greater challenge with the low visual fidelity), ATC does not always give sensible instructions. I've not had the problem some report of plowing into the side of a mountain, but I have noticed that when taxiing, the ATC can give you...silly directions sometimes. The big example I've seen is routing me through turns that are nigh impossible to pull off in the large airliner I'm piloting. 

But leaving all this aside, consider the following question:

Do you like the idea of trying to be a pilot?

If you answered no, then this is not for you.

If you answered yes, FSX is a great place to try it out. Just be careful, if you end up liking it, you'll fall down the simmer rabbit hole, and find yourself buying all of the kit to create a virtual cockpit. Soon we will find out if MSFS 2020 lives up to the hype, and if that is out of your price range at the moment, this is a decent compromise compared to X-Plane and Prepar3D.",1597369881,1597369881,True,1,0,0.51171875,0,True,False,False,76561197991278932,905,15,1171,0,924,1597531627,,

Let's talk about Boeing 747-400. It has the most basics controls you need, like flaps and throttle, aircraft lights and anti-ice system and many more. I just want to say it's not that so hard like in a real aircraft, where you need an hour of preparation before flight, don't worry. It takes 10 minutes for me to set everything for takeoff. And if you wonder how many hours it takes for me, before landing in extreme conditions for first time - 24 hours. It's hard, trust me, but not impossible.

Another thing: It's not impossible to play without a joystick. As I said you need time for practise. I play with a keyboard and I have 140 hours, as you can see.

It's not that so hard, you need time! Some people who are buying this game are like: ""Oh yeah, I bought a flight simulator. It will be easy to fly.""; And then in the game: ""OMG, this is so stupid game, I can't even takeoff."" Then uninstalls and write a negative review.
I don't know why they are buying a simulator and want things to happen fast and easy. As the beginning of the review - this is a SIMULATOR! There are so many games, where to get flying you need to push only one button, like GTA, you know.

UPDATE 28.09.2015: If DTG won't stop with these DLCs, the game itself will turn into the next DLC Simulator 2015 after the disappointment with TS 2016, but I still recommend it.",1427696577,1596547925,True,66,2,0.855762720108032227,9,True,False,False,76561198158483620,139,12,13165,0,12114,1596738639,,

I would start and international flight from NY with a 747 and time it to get back to the computer, before the plane was close enough to say, Johannesburg, so I could start approach and landing procedures.    
With FSX, I was delighted until they took away the weather support for it.  Also for reasons I didn't understand the performance had deteriorated.  Until I got the Steam version, which worked a lot better achieving frame rates of almost 100 fps, with some of my aircraft.   Like the rest of the world, I'm looking forward to the 2020 version.

It is more a flight simulator than a ""game"" in the popular sense. if your intent is to ""learn"" flight skills, FSX is a good starting point. If you are not much interested in flying skills, and want something more ""game-like"" that allows you to start having fun without having to know what you are doing, I would suggest one of the combat games that has airplanes.  If you are a careful picky purchaser, you may want to sign up in the FlightSim forum and see what FSX users are chatting about. Also, be aware this game is not new or recent and the support is sketchy to non-existent. Thus, you need to be prepared to use it as_is. (Don't expect anybody to fix a bug that you might trip over.) Having said that, there are very helpful people in the FlightSim forum who have seen it all, and very willing to help when you need it. 

Microsoft is threatening to release a new flight simulator any moment now. I tell you that in case you would rather wait for the new one. Personally, IMO, I would not wait for the new one. As with all version 1.0 products, it will be, well, just like a version 1.0 product.

It took me 8 TIMES to do the civil air patrol rescue mission (with saving the pilot), to complete the mission. But if you are a starter to flying, it has missions that help you learn how to fly.

71,72006708,english,"A classic, way better than 98/2000/2004/COF, but it shows it age as well. I remember flying around the world in various aircraft, but now i wouldn't spend much time in it. The graphics by todays standards isn't much to look at, default towns are autogen, which means no satellite maps, and of course no VR support. It did detect my X52 controller though, not bad.

FSX has SOME advantages over simulators like AFS2, it has air traffic, weather and ATC. But so do XPlane 11. Honestly if i didn't have a connection to FSX from earlier, i would have never bought it for sentimental reasons. Having tried it now again like a decade later, it isn't something you want to hang in your christmas tree.

Also some tutorials aren't really that good, and some keybindings does not appear to work, i jumped into the Hornet (which is now included) on a carrier, tried autostart but it didn't even flinch, I tried the manual startup procedure (battery, APU, engines etc) but the engines stalled constantly. And some buttons/knobs are not even clickable. DCS got the hornet startup procedure covered way better. Felt like i was playing an unfinished beta product and i would have been very dissatisfied if i ever had bought the expansion pack back in the day.

The default screen does not use widescreen, everything is in 4:3 resolution. Horrible, and everything is by default zoomed in so you probably have to zoom out before you do anything in FSX. The keybindings are an absolute horrow show in comparison to modern flightsims, you can't search and there is no logical order to how keys are listed, or arranged by relevancy under each plane. At least it defaults to Ultra settings on my games box, but given that it's a 14 year old product it's not surprising and offers little comfort.

If you have an emotional connection to FSX, maybe some expansion packs laying around, you may want to get this. For everyone else, get a modern flightsim (Like AFS2, XPlane11 or MSFS2020 which will be out in a few months).

Not much to say really, it holds up well after 14 years. The latest tech is STILL compared to FSX.

There are few differences/improvements in the Steam edition compared to the retail edition, which were added/changed by Dovetail:

Firstly the steam edition is the GOLD Edition Retail equivalent, so it includes the Acceleration Pack, and the SP2 updates, so you get ALL Detailed Cities, and ALL the extra aircraft.
Clouds are better.
Sky colour is more natural.
Directx10 mode offers more performance than before (up to 30%), however has issues of its own these days- flickering runways and taxi markings, easy to fix WITHOUT stevefx.
Multiplayer works a treat and is still very busy, there are also lots fo great discord servers.
SIMCONNECT included now.
UIAutomationCore now included (fixes a few bugs when switching from windowed to full screen etc).
And a few minor tweaks under the hood reducing memory leaks etc, it is STILL 32bit though so if you runs 100s of scenery mods you still may run of memory.

November 2019 update from Microsoft; now features a BETA edition, I personally have had no issues running this, but many have. It includes the return of Real World Weather, a few tweaks to aircraft here and there, and Microsoft use it to collect usage data for the dev team working on Flight Sim 2020 (no personal data is collected, Windows 10 already has that covered lol). Also on my rig I can now run 50-60fps in the BETA edition where as before it was around 45-55... no idea why as there is no mention of performance tweaks.

2006 I would give it 6/10, because very few people could actually run it maxed out, if any.
2014 (steam edition release) I would give it 8.5/10 as finally most people could run it maxed out.
These days I give it 10/10 because it is still massive fun to fly, most desktops will run it maxed out, still looks quite pretty especially if you have some nice HD aircraft and are flying through a storm or some other crazy weather.

I personally fly FSX pretty much default setup these days, I have several different weather packs like Zinertek, AFS Clouds, Zinertek Airports etc and Orbx Ground Textures and so fourth, but honestly after 14 years the default sim has held up so well I dont bother with them anymore, plus I often do fresh installs and try new setups so can not be bothered installing all that again.

Base Game Vs Game with DLC's

Base Game offers a decent variety of planes to try out. 747,737 and cessnas are alright, but the real fun is playing on full physics and dynamics so if you go to fast, UR DUNE FUR!

All airports available  even AREA 51 for all the weebos who lucked out on the storm Area 51 event.

No the missles don't work on the F/18 (Atleast i cant find the button) 

*Beep beep.* *.....MISSILE ARMED...*OH CRAP! I picked one hell of a day to quit drinking...* Independence Day Russell Case. He won't let ya down !

Graphics are not bad, Settings are best when maxed.(Just nice enough to call google maps) 

AI air traffic control is pretty spot on unless your not familiar with navigating then expect your 24 L landing to turn into a 7L or 8R prompting immediate  seatbelt signs and tray tables in their upright position. *Bring butter for the runway*

Base Game With Payware DLC's 
The game can have many pricey add ons that can actually wear down the experience of the game. Recommended to only buy specific packs. If its onsale then grab it sure. but having every single DLC requires a MASSIVE system or youll be waiting out your loading times like a real pilot at Heathrow. (Busy airport)

Most people will say its better to find the freeware planes or dlcs but its best to always research and ask the community if certain planes are JAH! or Nyeet.

Part of this review i will have a part bias opinion about the multiplayer aspect. If your flying a payware or freeware plane that other players dont have, then most chances you show up to them as a default aircraft in the game. Which makes playing with DLCS on multiplayer less enjoyable. 

This is where you get tempted into buying friends aircraft that wont ever just so they can see you in that aircraft xD (I bought 4 of my friends the C-17A GlobeMaster III) Personally my favorite Payware DLC. 128 Hours and counting (Don't ask me how many times i crashed, so many globies gone) 

the only freeware aircraft i would use is probably something you really really really want to fly. Never download freewares if your gonna never use it again, best to keep to Paywares. :) But i enjoy the AN-225 (Not multiplayer friendly) The only freeware aircraft i use.

Not even close! Actually, most other flightsim platforms rarely if ever go on sale. FSX-SE still works well and there is a ton of addon freeware and payware scenery and aircraft upgades available, which is not the case with other platforms. FSX-SE also, still works well on mid-range computer systems whereas XPlane and P3D demand the latest and best hardware you can afford. No doubt that as time marches on, other flightsim platforms will continue to gain more popularity, whereas, FSX-SE is heading in only one direction; down. Several payware developers such as Orbx (scenery) are slowly moving away from FSX and now concentrating on the other two. Good news is that in a few years, FSX-SE will be the way FS2004 (FS9) is presently; payware addons being dirt cheap. Regarding my comments about FSX-SE on mid-range, hardware; FSX-SE still is very 32-bit and very cpu dependent. You can have a $1000.00, cutting-edge video card but FSX won't care. It wants the fastest, clocked CPU you can find and extra cores won't add anything to the game. XPlane and P3D will make better use of your RAM and videocard resourses. The latest version of P3D is now 64-bit based so that is another game changer, although most available addons are still only 32-bit. Like everything else, that will change with time.

Bottom line; if you just want to start flight simming at lowest cost possible, FSX-SE is still valid option but if you have bit extra money to burn and know your hardware can handle it; look elsewhere. In long run, you'll be happier.",1593115210,1593115210,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198039275733,9,1,284520,5820,239925,1602036403,,

i bought this game for my dad back at the day. it seemed simple. just attach a flight control stick and fly. ofcourse its not that easy. this game has to be adjusted all over again, like the developers hardly put any mind in it. F1 to stop engine. F4 to set engine to full speed? and ofcourse, controls could not be checked during flight, so we had to go out of the free flight, go to options, search the option in the long list of unneccesary options simply to make the damn thing fly because lets be honest, there arnt enough keyboards on earth to set them for every option this game gives you. unneccesary. cluttering. 

seriously, you need to have grade 5 autism to like a game like this, because just simply flying aint gonna be one of the things this game provides. or you need to spend a large dose of money on an actual flight simulator cockpit. i just cant see how microsoft can try to sell this game without a clear warning it aint for the average gamer that simply wants to fly.",1592737620,1592737620,False,0,0,0.40443149209022522,0,True,False,False,76561198008245148,237,23,713,0,693,1592737857,,

Software behemoth Microsoft is back in the game again, and this time with vengeance. According to them, their new and upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is going to be built on latest technology, and graphics, scenery and flight model will be way more superior than anything we have today. Do a search for it on Youtube and check out some of the officially published videos and screenshots. I highly suggest you save your money for now and wait for MSFS 2020's official release instead of spending it on Prepar3d or XP11.]  

TL;DR: Avoid this at all cost. Buy [strike]Prepar3d[/strike] MSFS 2020 when it's released instead. This game has been pretty much abandoned and there's no sign of it getting any further improvements. Most probably the only reason this game still has a decent user-base is because some people who paid a lot of money for add-ons in the past don't want to move on to a better sim because they don't want to pay for a vastly improved and modern flight sim and its add-ons again. 

Long version: I've spent thousands of hours on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, 2004 and FSX. FS 2004 actually introduced me to the basic principles of powered flight. When Microsoft and Aces Game Studio were actively supporting it, things were looking great for both add-on developers and consumers. 

Unfortunately, back in 2009, due to some stupid decisions made by the then Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, ACES Studio was shut down, and around 1500 employees were sacked. (Read more about it [url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/01/23/microsofts-game-studios-take-a-beating-in-layoffs/]here[/url]. Thereafter FSX was totally abandoned until Dovetail Games bought the license from Microsoft and brought it to Steam. 

At that time we hoped that Dovetail would continue to improve the underlying code and bring it up to modern standards (i.e. fix the OOM bug, make it 64 bit, add compatibility for more than 4 gigs of RAM etc) but that never happened. So basically, they abandoned it too. The only reason they are still able to sell and make money out of it is because people who already paid a lot of money for the addons in the past still keep playing and paying, which in turn forces the add-on developers to keep making more broken, low-quality, third-class add-ons for this decade-old, broken, deadbeat platform.

Avoid at all cost. Buy [strike]Prepar3d[/strike] MSFS 2020 when it's released instead.",1557593248,1591856467,False,24,6,0.50377202033996582,0,True,False,False,76561198306602665,251,69,437,0,437,1544614617,,

However, the price of this game is very good considering the fact that not everyone has the ability to spend circa $50 on X-Plane 11. There is a fairly wide variety of default aircraft and there are a ton of free options for add-ons which you get less of with X-Plane 11 (although I will say that X-Plane 11 add-ons normally have a better quality). As for DLC, I wouldn't bother, there are better add-ons that you can get for free. I suppose the only DLC I'd really recommend would be the HD graphics DLC for $10-$15 (not sure how much it actually is in the US, here in the UK it's £10). One problem with this flight simulator is that for some people, the game may run at about 30 FPS even on really good PCs due to some older optimisation, you should still be fine as 30 FPS is pretty much all you need to play this game comfortably.

So in summary:

If you want a good flight simulator but are on a budget, this is 100% what I would recommend. Even if you do have the money for X-Plane 11, I would still recommend it aswell as X-Plane 11 because of the HUGE amount of fairly good free add-ons that are available on the internet.

I got really involved when I downloaded other applications such as teamspeak and Maldair (google it). It became quite interactive and starting to learn the ATC lingo. 

A really good game which will suck hours of gameplay out of you. 

Graphics wise, not great. But then you have to remember this game is 10-15 years old in it's original form so not bad when this is considered. 

I'm told the actual simulation is realistic and you can pretty much get what you want from it as a trainee pilot.

I downloaded this because it was $5 and saw that there are improvements. I also sent a gift to a few of my friends. since P3D isn't hobby grade, expensive, and a little bit more difficult to run smoothly. 

After about a half hour in the game I am excited about it. I'll be able to race F-18s against my friends again! I haven't installed any of my add-ons to this, and I probably won't. I am treating this as my ""game"" sim. 

It runs really smooth compared to what I remember from FSX. I am getting 30+ fps steady on a 4k monitor. 

This is a plug and play flight sim! With a decent joystick and adding trim, flap, and spoiler buttons, it really is something special.

**For Multiplayer**

You see its great to have everyone on board playing this game, a squeaker, a teen, an adult, a dog, whatever. But it would be great if everyone is not immature and flying a hot air balloon at mach 1 and striking an active tower. 

Maybe if you like to play casually, just play by yourself thats why there is a singleplayer mode, and if you want a little bit of professionalism theres VATSIM waiting for you and theres alot of server out there that is still active and has alot of players going in and out everyday (especially weekends). Respect the tower if there is one in the server and have a great flight. : )",1588778075,1588778075,True,66,12,0.836921155452728271,2,True,False,False,76561198876093738,43,16,10834,1620,3493,1602066559,,

Its the same with any purchased DLC's through Steam, most are faulty and lead to endless hours of searching for answers, some DLC's simply NEVER or work once & then never again or are simply unreliable.

4,68100687,english,"This simulator is certainly a trip down memory lane for me. Before I had FSX:SE or just FSX Gold Edition, I flew on Flight Simulator 2004 which was my first experience being at the controls of a virtual aircraft. Of course, I was only five or six years old and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, but it really helped ignite my passion for flying. Now, this simulator may be obsolete compared to others like X-Plane 11 and FS 2020 just around the corner, but I'll always come back to this one for old time's sake (and because of the communities on multiplayer).

Now onto the actual review. When first purchasing FSX, it may seem daunting what you need to learn, but there are communities on multiplayer that are willing to teach, flying lessons that can be located in the Learning Center, and of course the basic tutorials that are found under the Missions tab. Once you have a good idea of how to fly, you may realize how old the game is. The default navaids are out of date, airports haven't been updated, and the aircraft that may be considered more advanced (e.g. 737, 747, CRJ, etc.) are drastically simplified compared to the complex and far more realistic components they have in newer simulators. There can be fixes for this, which leads me to one of the more unappealing aspects of FSX. There is third party software, such as PMDG, which sells a close to real life 737, Orbx, which can update the scenery in FSX and improve certain airports, and many more. These can cost more than twice as much money the simulator itself is worth, which means that you could potentially be paying for more than what you could get in one entire simulator, like X-Plane 11, or even FS 2020 that will be coming this year. I myself have never spent extra money on FSX and have strictly used freeware software that are useful for flying purposes. One of them I highly recommend is Littlenavmap, which displays airports, taxiways, procedures, weather (In FSX and real life), can be used for flight planning, and many more! This is the top freeware product I recommend downloading, and that no flight simmer should be left without, unless practicing procedures that make using Littlenavmap cheating.

One last thing, there are many communities on FSX where players can do flights together, and can host events (Depending on the server). This is completely up to the player which community they join, but different servers have different rules and standards, so please keep that in mind while seeing which place you prefer to fly at. Also depending on the community is what type of communication system you use. Because FSX has terrible in-game communication, servers rely on software like Discord or Teamspeak for communication. Servers typically list which one they use in the description when you select a server, so choose wisely!

In short, FSX is great simulator, but it is not perfect. While considering purchasing FSX, keep in mind the graphics aren't up to modern standards, the default planes aren't 100% realistic, ATC communication in single player isn't great, and there are airports that aren't up to date. Despite this, FSX is a great way to get introduced to aviation and know what the basics are. But, this doesn't compare to flying in real life, and if you're interested, find a flying instructor in your area and take an intro flight (At least when the COVID-19 situation is over) to see what the real deal is, and possibly consider flying as a career.

I hope people still see the value of FSX. Happy flying!",1587966416,1587966416,True,30,2,0.77468407154083252,0,True,False,False,76561198133955318,29,10,125488,826,112485,1602039925,,

Or, FSX:SE for short.

A beautiful flight simulator with proper autogen, still played by thousands of aviation enthusiasts and their cheap joysticks and yokes. A massive and mostly kind community, with thousands of free and paid addons, this game has aged akin to fine wine. It gets more and more fun when you get some addons and repaints for your aircraft, and when you join the servers held by multiple people. To be honest, there are only few cons and lots of pros:

Cons:
- Dated graphics coming from 2006.
- Buggy and unstable, even on the highest of computers.
- Some notable terrain mesh and airport bugs.

Pros:
- Beautiful skylines coming from the early 2000s, can be updated.
- Most international and North American airports are detailed and are functional.
- Recent terrain mesh, less bugs than its older counterparts, FS2004.
- Supportive community filled with aviation enthusiasts.
- So many ADDONS, and it doesn't have to be aircraft! It could be ships, cars, and sometimes people and scenery. So much freeware and even more payware.
- Lots of fun missions with small rewards. (Not actual rewards, more like a collection of small pictures and wings)
- Helpful tutorial that eases you into flying straightaway.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition. A beautiful flight simulator that aged like fine wine, as many would state. Still very active, almost 24/7, and with a bright community of both real and trained pilots of all backgrounds. Respectful to all, a beautiful flower of a game.

There are a shit ton of mods available for this game but I wouldn't recommend buying through steam because I've heard that some of the mods may not function correctly(and they're expensive af) .Also there are a ton of free mods on the internet so  , yeah. 

[u] Important things to know before buying/playing the game; [/u]

-Even though the game was released in 2006 computers are still struggling to run this game smoothly. Be prepared for that. So unlike other games from that era you CANNOT run FSX on a baby carrot.

-It has multiplayer so you can crash planes with your friends. Noone gives a shit about ATC's in multiplayer so there's no need to learn any callouts or anything. You're free to fuck off from anywhere ,  any time you wish.

-Literally everything you see looks outdated. You'll have to accept that.

-Most of the mods will take up more space than the game itself because deatiled textures and attention to detail in the stock game is non-existent.

-It's a good simulator. But maybe try P3D.

-Who even reads a review about this game? It's FSX, how have you not heard of it?

 You'll see that it's worth the money. Have fun. Thanks for reading.

I recently decided to learn how to fly because I found my old flight stick in my garage, and I got the steam edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The things I like about this game is that, although the graphics are not too good (the game is from 2006 so this makes perfect sense), I still enjoy the gameplay you get out of it, whether learning the basics of flight in the missions, or playing online with friends. This game gave me a certain nostalgic feel which I haven't felt in a long time.

FSX is 32bit program so it uses a maximum of 4gb of RAM. Also FSX was developed during the time when single core CPU's were the go to, so if you check your CPU usage, you'll find that core 0 is at 100% and the other cores would range from 25-60% usage. Furthermore FSX is not GPU optimized, so no matter if you have an RTX 2080ti or intregrated Vega graphics, theres not much difference. Finally FSX is a simulator you have to invest on if you're advanced. Vanilla FSX is boring. If you want FSX to look good you really need to buy Orbx sceneries, PMDG, Aerosoft, Quality Wings aircraft if you want a flawless experience, which at the end costs around $400. But that's up to you. 
If you want a better version of FSX go and buy a license for Lockheed Martin's Prepar3d V4.0-5.0. It's an improved version of FSX with better lighting and PC optimization.

Can you really get much better than this?

I mean, the graphics are not the best. But what about chill, relaxed multiplayer?

Beginner-friendly multiplayer?

Advanced features and a huge variety of mods?

A gigantic part of the flight sim community, even though it is a very old game?

Flight Sim X, you have all of it.

There really is not much to say about the gameplay. Yes, it is a very advanced flight sim, and if you are willing to make the next step big manufacturers like Aerosoft have got you covered with airport and aircraft models.
The graphics? Not great, but with some mods, even free ones, you can step it up real good.
But what I love, is the multiplayer.

You know what? After 1 hour of flight alone, I get awfully bored. I don't have anyone to talk to, and I feel very lonely. 
That's where multiplayer comes in.

There is so many beginner-friendly ATC communities that provide services for free to some other users that want to fly around a bit. My favorite is fsATC, but you can pick your own. It is just so relaxed and so much fun at the same time. I hope they keep it in MSFS2020, because a VATSIM-only future isn't the best outlook for me.

Started playing it again in 2019 and can't put it down.  Many add-ons later, the simulation is so engaging and I'm learning what it's like to pilot the large jetliners.  Have an interest in flying?  You can't go wrong.  Sure there are newer attempts at flight simulators.  Some are quite good.  But, if you're looking for a lot of options right out of the gate, FSX is your choice.  Plus, prepare to transition to the next Microsoft Flight Simulator that will put all the others to shame.  Its coming this year!  But don't wait.

Made my training much easier with the various very realistic aircraft, weather and emergency scenario mods (such as alternator failure, CSU leak, detonation etc) which can be found on various websites to download. Although ATC and airports were not life like and had completely different taxi ways and parking bays, the runways and scenery around the airport held up fairly well and I still managed to navigate around the area in VFR conditions without using charts. It is possible to simulate IFR conditions, however it is fairly basic and lacks tools in the base game. The aerodynamics component of the game is fairly mediocre to real life conditions. It does indeed get the basics right, however it falls short for more complex manoeuvres. And again, all these negative points can easily be fixed with the thousands and thousands of mods found online.

1- After playing for 35 hours and logging 10 Ils flights I have found the FSX Steam Edition to

A- I cannot use the disc version on Steam
While playing on Steam the most frustrating thing i have encountered is the poor graphics.I
have nivda GTx 1036 card. more than meets the game requirements set by steam. I have 
changed the settings in the game to high and still have black boxes around my aircraft lights,
still have clouds that look like boxes and the list goes on.
B-The mouse control is very frustrating also! This is a problem when you try to to use the Icons
in the aircraft. YOU NEED TO USE BOTH HANDS TO CONTROL THE MOUSE.
So with problems like these I will not recommend this game

The DLC together are a bit on the pricey side unless you only want one kidney or one lung. But on the plus side, adding mods sort of adds what some of the DLCs failed to do(kind of like Bethesda and Skyrim). In all honesty, it's a good time passer and will allow you to fly planes that'll take a while of real world training to actually fly. Multiplayer is fine as long as you have good internet and can actually find a room that doesn't always require teamspeak.

79,62650147,english,"The last time I took time to sit down and play a MS FS was back in 1998, and at some point along the years I purchased a PC Phantom Logic 3, model JT250 which back then plugged into a dedicated 'Game Port'. These days I need a 'Game Port' to USB adaptor (which saved a few other controllers from being binned) and everything still works fine.

So, the locations you can fly from and land at are everywhere, and the games graphics have somewhat improved, not I think I'd expected more definition, but coastlines, road ways, and rivers are recognisable, so you can all but fly over where you live which is awesome.
The flight controls, fluidity of the joystick and mouse controls are very precise, and the aircraft dynamics feel how I would expect a aircraft to feel and respond.

I started on 'Beginner' flying the Microlight, then jumped in to a jet fighter, I mean after all, why not eh? Over the span of a few days I found it enjoyable enough that I went on to YT to view videos on how to set up the game up better, adjusting the zoom, seat height, leaning the basic keys and such. It's still not perfect, but it is getting there.

Today I went to 'Realistic' mode, with the jet fighter, I crashed once on take off, something to do with stressing the air-frame, yeah right, whatever happened to battle ready I wonder, lol... Anyway, lesson learnt, second flight was much better, I took off, flew around, saw another airport and landed. Well, that was easy, maybe it was a fluke? So I tried again, and again took off and landed fine.

Lets try a 747-400... Good result, I ain't saying the passengers will ever fly with me again, actually, I think I've put most of the passengers off flying for life, well, less the flying, more the landing, but I promise, we all walked away, some I'm sure were on their hands and knees kissing the tarmac, but meh, I'll take that as a sign that 'Kissing the runway' was something they had on a bucket list and can now cross off, right?.

Yes. That statement is a clear example of what you will get in FSX: Steam Edition.

The simulator is graphically lacking in today's age, however being that it was released in 2006 for Steam, I'm satisfied with the community  (there are servers that will enforce proper flight procedure and servers that let you go nuts. Overall, you have complete freedom to roam around.) For a simulator, I have had no problems with the game itself working with my stick and throttle that a few google searches couldn't fix. When entering the game, you go through the lovely experience of programming your flight system for countless hair pulling hours until you get it to work just right. As most simulators, many of the planes and helicopters are locked behind paid downloadable content, some ranging from $10 to $50+. I understand there is a licensing fee, but dear do I wish it was cheaper. You could spend $5,000+ USD on vehicles and updated maps and go crazy, but please save your money and just buy what you will use. Overall, if you enjoy flying, being an ATC, or are a real pilot, go ahead and get this game. For a simulator where you can do anything and not get your license revoked, this is great!",1579566529,1579566529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198154424407,83,24,9160,220,3529,1601354468,,

3,61174253,english,"I honestly cannot recommend FSX as a viable flight simulator any more, as it is simply too old. It was abandoned by Microsoft many years ago, and new developer, Dovetail also appears to have lost interest in it. The on-line live weather and news pages are dead. If it was £2.49 like most other games from 2006, it would be a reasonable option for those with low-spec computers. At £19.99 it's a mickey take. It's just not worth the money.

It is not compatible with Direct X 10, meaning that many features of current graphics cards are not available. It doesn't support multi-core processors properly and can't use more than 4GB of memory, no matter how much you have installed. It will run well enough using its default terrain, scenery and aircraft but it looks dreadful by modern standards. If you install third-party scenery and aircraft, especially ones with detailed virtual cockpits, FSX:SE will crash to desktop without warning, often at the end of a long flight.

If you are serious about flight simulation, you should purchase Prepar3D, which is what FSX became after Lockheed Martin took over the licence. Many of the third-party scenery packs and aircraft designed for FSX:SE are also compatible with P3D. P3D is also fully compatible with modern processors, graphics cards and Windows 10 64bit.

I used FSX:SE for about two months before I got utterly fed up with system crashes, lockups and poor performance. I now use P3D v4.5, which I can confirm is vastly better and completely stable. I have not used FSX:SE since installing P3D, and will probably uninstall it soon. It was a waste of money in my opinion, and if I had known about P3D I would have bought that instead right at the start.

Another popular alternative to P3D is X-Plane. Both are better than FSX:SE, which was great in its day, but should really be a free download now.

As a further point to note, do NOT purchase any of the addon aircraft or terrain through Steam if you ever intend to upgrade to P3D. You will have to buy them again as they are specific to the Steam version and can't be transferred over to P3D. Purchase addons direct from the developer or through a universal seller like Just Flight and you will be able to install the addon in FSX:SE or P3D, or both. I learned this the hard way and it was very expensive. The addons available from outside Steam are generally far better quality anyway.",1578005812,1578006659,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084677373,72,4,5716,0,5716,1576110696,,

Another big plus is that I was able to purchase and fly the Diamond DA-20, as this is the aircraft I own in real life. It is incredibly helpful to be able to get some SIM time on ""my"" airplane when the weather does not allow me to fly the real thing.

The downsides include the buildings and scenery, which is very bad by today's standards.  Flying over Las Vegas, the scenery makes it painfully obvious FSX uses a 1990's rendering engine.

FSX should also offer more airplanes by default.  More airliners, more war planes, more historically significant airplanes, more experimental planes, spy planes, etc.

IT LOOKS AND RESPONDED AT THE 100% LEVEL. Definitely a worthwhile investment on any simmer.
I have NOT  tried the  compatibility with any other steam products and I have not attempted to install any of the Saitek / Logitech devices.
So far it is THUMBS UP ON THE SOFTWARE, WITH THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION. PLEASE REMEMBER ALL I DO is  FLY AND DO SURGICAL PROCEDURES  in a operating room in the the NYC area. So please do not be harsh  on  .I love the fact that I was able to try the beta version . So I am in. I hope that  STEAM lives up to their standards in software, which what I hear they do. I am sure they will. I would love to see anyone's review of this version.

1. The game was already hard enough to set up because you have all of those sh**ty problems like the game dropping to 5fps whenever you have sound on and all of that other crap that I won't even mention here. Also the fact that you gotta spend a fucking week trying to figure out and solve all of this sh**ty problems.
2. I was on a 3 hour flight and everything went smooth. No problems at all. But then... When I come to check the flight plan 10 minuets before landing the damn (not even appropriate for the title game or simulation) thing crashes!
3. INFACT, THE GAME DOES THAT EVERYTIME YOU DO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE INTENSIVE THAN AGAR.IO! For example: I wanted to set up another view mid flight for my 2nd monitor, so I hover my cursor above the ""view"" catagory at the top, then ""outside"", AND THAN THE GAME FREEZES, CURSOR TURNS INTO A BLUE CIRCLE LOADING, BOOM! GAME JUST CRASHES! Sorry, not crashes, BUT F***ING DISAPPEARING RIGHT OFF MY GOD DAMN SCREEN WITH NO SIGN THAT IT WAS EVEN ON 3 SECONDS AGO! And why am I mad? Because it happens EVERY F***ING TIME THAT I GO TO THAT SH**TY MENU BAR AT THE LEFT TOP AND TRY TO OPEN/CHANGE/CHECK SOMETHING! It happend to me 7 out of 7 flights that I just sat there like an idiot not knowing this somewhat of an unappropriate called game is wasting my f***ing time for (depending on the flight) 3 to 6 hour a flight!
4. The game crashes when i'm doing other actions too (like it wasn't obvious enough) like I don't know... Maybe STARTING A F***ING FREE FLIGHT!!!
5. This game is incapable, overpriced, and you literally can not play it.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY FLY AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT DO NOT, AND I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
Only and I mean ONLY buy this game if you want to fly once, and than get a waste of $25 that crashes on you every 5 minuets and makes you angry to the point that not only you can't fly because the game is incapable of actually doing so, but your anger just makes want to punch you monitor!
On that friendly note, I wanted so much to actually play a simulator and be able to fly, but I just wasted my go damn money. Better of with Prepar3d on X-Plane...

EDIT:
Originally I was pretty mad when writing this review but then I realized that its original release date was October 2006 and that it's a miracle that this game even runs on Windows 10 and my PC.
2nd thing is that you also can't expect such a good performance when running a game from 2006. Not to say that it runs smooth and has good performance but it also holds up pretty nicely for a game that's from 2006.
Still not the best thing out there but also not the worst.
EDIT 2:
It has been a while and I finally got everything to work smooth but I would still consider other simulators. If you don't have the budget than this one might be a decent one if you're able to get it to work and function properly!
EDIT 3:

3) All the controls are very... Unusual and it's not the same buttons as a lot of games.
4) The game originally seems pretty out of date with pretty low graphic quality.
5) Related to #4, instead of giving better graphics as DLCs, they should actually put in big updates for the game, they could have done that for over 10 years now. (The game came out in 2006)

6,57017619,english,"Ahh, good ol' FSX. This program has been around a while, but it's still a valuable resource for pilots, both virtual and real.

By today's standards FSX has some dated graphics and an outdated flight model, but even those relatively minor attributes can be addressed with the huge assortment of mods available. Everything you could need, from better scenery to an almost unlimited amount of add on aircraft is out there for simming pleasure, and many of it is even free if you go looking for it. Sure, you can see here in the Steam DLC library there are thousands of dollars worth of payware, but honestly you don't need to pay for great add-ons for this application. 

Even without add ons, you get a lot out of the box. Thousands of airports to explore, a large selection of aircraft, ranging from gliders, to helicopters, to jumbo jets are waiting for users to master, and a full world of scenery to fly over and discover all wait those who want to dive into this sim. Granted, that scenery is rather grainy, not true to life and plain in 2019, but the sim tries! Even more than all of that, you get a full index of learning material and missions to get your feet wet. This is a application that can sap endless amounts of hours from your life easily, not that this is a complaint in this case.

The weather simulation is the biggest problem I have come across; it's not very accurate to the real thing and even getting augmenting programs like SkyActive only seem to help a little. It's something I hope the new sim from Microsoft coming out it 2020 rectifies somehow. 

Something users may find with playtime is crashes, sadly. They are common, and the more add ons you have the more likely they seem to occur.  Sometimes they will happen just as you get your aircraft into taxiing, other times at the end of the session you were about to end anyway. There are good days where there are no crashes at all, but one should be weary that crashes do happen. Sometimes.

The controls and customizing is great. I love it. There are a lot of sliders to manipulate and a lot of things to go over, but if you take the time to look at everything and tweak the systems, you can get the sim to do pretty much what you want it to within reason. By today's standards, the game doesn't need a super computer to run well either, and the performance is something you can manage with more in-sim sliders. You can make the sim as sensitive to control inputs as you like too, an important feature for those using joysticks, throttle quadrants, rudder pedals and the like.

Another big issue with the current state of FSX on Steam is the multiplayer. Playing this with other pilots is a great experience, even ones who don't know what they are doing can do some entertaining things that can garner a good laugh or two from those who do. However, in order to take advantage of this feature, you either have to join an existing game, or host one yourself and it's the hosting that makes one jump through some serious hoops to get working. It's rather daunting, especially for someone who isn't into techno babble. Luckily, there are a couple of very helpful tutorials on the subject in the forums.

All in all, I love this program. I've been using it for years and have had it installed in several cases on two different computers, and while it does have some faults, FSX is more of a boon then a letdown for serious simmers. I can whole heartily recommend this to anyone who loves aviation.",1573515705,1573515705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198340927835,19,1,21054,0,20085,1596168166,,

Also combine it all with the book of ""Microsoft FSX for Pilots: Real World Training"", which is a great combination to do at the same time while follow Don Machado's lessons etc.

I'm truly well impressed, I've sat in front of my screen and cheered, bloddy hell it works and works well like the boxed edition NEVER did.
Clear your PC of FSX boxed , don't worry about all your addons they will install with out any problems (promise) and spend £19.99 with Steam, you'll like me wonder why you never did before.
I have loads of UK2000 airports all installed without a problem, UTX & GEX installed again without a hitch.

Just remember FSX Steam has a different path than the boxed edition and your home and dry,

The virtual cockpit, allows the player to interact with buttons as a real plane will. The game is not dependant on hotkeys, esc. 

The game does not resolve also around expensive add-ons for a simple plane. You actually get plenty you can start with from Microsoft. (Cough x-plane you get like 5 planes) 

I have had this game for a long time now, and the multiplayer is still updating by the runners of the servers. I know plenty of servers that have discord, or teamspeak for ATC communication. 

Enjoy the game :)

52,55319233,english,"I played (for want of a better word) MS Flight Sim 2000 back in the day and was blown away with its attention to detail and graphics for the time. So getting into FSX more than a decade after its release feels quite nostalgic, as it looks about as old as FS 2000 looks in my head. 

On that note, yeah the graphics look aged and there are aspects of the sim that do show its age. But for all that it does still look decent and its still just as complex and involved as ever. There are of course tutorials to help you at least be able to take off and land, along with many missions to complete once you reach some level of competency. Though of course you can pretty much ignore the more advanced stuff and fly around til your hearts content after completing a couple of tutorials. So this sim should keep the more serious flight sim buffs happy, while also not being too overwhelming for casuals to jump in and have a go. 

Like a lot of people 'playing' FSX, I was motivated to get into it after watching Airforceproud95 on YouTube with his antics in the multiplayer part of the sim. You can even take the role of ATC if you wish, or (as most do) you can get up to all sorts of mischief or fly some missions with others that can be as simple or difficult as you want to. I had no trouble finding active hosts for the multiplayer, so there are definitely still people on FSX all these years later. Though some servers are pretty empty in all honesty... 

With all that said, this is still a sim that is over a decade old and there are certain aspects of it where this is very apparent. My PC should have no issues running a sim this old at very high FPS with everything maxed out (3700x with 1080ti, M.2 SSD and 16gb 3600mhz DDR4) but I have to reduce settings otherwise I get frame drops as low as the mid teens here and there even though it doesn't look amazing. When using MSI Afterburner it becomes clear that this sim wasn't designed to make use of multi core CPUs, as one of my CPU cores is at 100% while the other seven are not being used at all by FSX. 

Performance issues with dated graphics aside, there is still a LOT of DLC content as well as a decent selection of aircraft that come standard with FSX. So there is more than enough content to keep any flight sim fan busy and if you bought all the DLC as well, there's enough to leave you bankrupt too!

In summary I would say if you can get this really cheap and you don't care about DLC then it is worth picking up. Otherwise I would hold off as Microsoft will be releasing Flight Sim 2020 next year which is looking like a big leap in visual quality, plus it will no doubt be able to utilise more than one CPU core!",1569680146,1569680146,True,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False,76561198203292090,273,81,2166,0,1537,1570564549,,

MFSX is much more cheaper and has more realism in terms of planes and the modding can be really fun with the large amounts of creators making new Free or Payware aircraft and scenary.

What I like about MFSX 
* It has Multiplayer
* Even has a flight missions that teach you to fly Planes and Helicopters
* The game comes with a variety of planes that start off from Single Engine Props to 2 Jet Engine Airliners
* If you cock up on an approach or you're too fast, you just press Y and you can relocate your aircraft and try again
* The PMDG 737-800NGX helps me with my training 
* You can even get the World Trade Center.


What I don't like about MFSX
* Graphics look like they've been imported from Google Maps Potato.exe (You can mod them)
* Airbus (jk) 
* Camera effects, when you go into a 20-30 degree bank your camera will move off center so it's annoying as fuck.

FSX released in end of 2006. Steam Edition (FSX-SE) released in 2014.
FSX-SE = Gold Edition + Deluxe Edition + Acceleration expansion pack and both official Service Packs in one + multiplayer support. All in one.

First release in 1982 Microsoft Flight Simulator, so it is 37 years old now in 2019. Falcon series start in 1984, for comparison.

Lockheed Martin hired members of the original ACES Studio team to continue development of the product - Lockheed Martin Prepar3D. Think about it like FSX Engine + patches and DirectX 11. After releasing Version 2 in 2013 and Version 3 in 2015, the team released 64-bit Version 4 in May 2017 ($50).

On the other side we have X-Plane series, available on Steam too.

In this video I have vanilla game, no mods with only two DLC: Skychaser and Albatros D.III
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1263921482
 

I bought it very cheap on Steam, in a double pack, game and Skychaser plane. It was somehow cheaper than a game alone.

TrackIR supported with no need to set it up. Nice thing. My HOTAS works fine too, but it took me a week to set it up in the way I want it. If you going to use some more complex aircraft models, you will probably end up spending more money for a additional soft to get this handle fast - google: FSUIPC4

There are many know bugs, you can find solutions for probably all of them. Here are some I encounter with solutions:

Blinking airfield, that you can see in video, I already fixed:
Free DX10 Shader Fixers V3.2.2 and V3.2.3 if you use ORBX sceneries.

http://www.lockonfiles.com/files/file/2612-fsx-dx10-shader-fixers-v322/
 

https://library.avsim.net/search.php?SearchTerm=DX10+shader&CatID=root

No Rewards fix: To get rewards, you have to create 'Rewards' folder in every DLC folder you own. Example: .../FSX/DLC/379553/Rewards



[b]Learning to fly[/b]
Have a look at Lessons by Rob Machado. Some of those lessons have very anoying buggs but till Instrument Checkride you should do fine. Google single lessons for bugs if you stuck.


[b]Upgrading and buying DLCS?[/b]

Rule no 1 - DO NOT BUY STEAM DLCs.

Save your money for really good things. First buy planes or just one but good. Two the best on a market right now for GA VFR and IFR flights IMO:

1) A2A - Cessna 182 (I recommend 182 over 172, is stronger, more long term usable model, good tourer). Expensive but 45% off from time to time. http://www.a2asimulations.com/
 
One good thing worth of buying for sure is Accu-Feel from A2A. It extend flight experience for all default models. Here is a good video: https://youtu.be/eAkDywoaeRQ
 
2) Flight1 - King Air B200 v2.



[b]Where FSX is strong?[/b]

Lots and lots of freebies:
https://flyawaysimulation.com/ - just put a name of a plane in a search box.

http://www.lockonfiles.com/files/ - best free models selection

Do you like boats and ships? Have a look here: http://deltasimstudio.com/
 


[b]Sceneries[/b]

Don't go crazy, have a look at free sceneries first.

Freeware sceneries library:
http://www.freewarescenery.com/fsx.html
 
FreeMeshX Global 2.0 - 50GB free global mesh
http://ninetwopro.com/freemeshx-2-0-release-announcement/

Free sceneries for USA 1m to pixel with 10m mesh
http://blueskyscenery.com/
 

You should have a look at ORBX products. You can buy just one particularly region, witch are in best accuracy. Discounts from time to time too. Have a look at demos and freebies first: ORBX Tasmania, ORBX Island.
https://orbxdirect.com/
 

Drzewiecki Design airports, cities, etc.
http://www.drzewiecki-design.net/
 

REX textures - Best you can have if you want FTX look photorealistic.
http://www.rexsimulations.com/
 


Good thing is, that ORBX and REX products can be bought ones and use with FSX and Prepar3D in the same time. Someday, when you switch to P3D or start using both sims at once, you have sceneries sorted.

Setup and Tweaks FSX - lots of guides there, check Steam Guides first.

Steam - FSX Guides - look for guide: How to get the Best Experience by [1BDE] L.Thompson

http://www.fstipsandaddons.com/ - FS Tips & Addons
 

http://c-aviation.net/ - good reviews

Add Freeware 3D Lights Tutorial
http://simviation.com/simviation/?ID=69&page=15&mark=7971

If you want more realism and a global flight network simulation experience google for VATSIM.

If you are in to war birds:
Try Carrier landing practice missions and addons. Free carrier and default A/F-18 can give you some serious good basic training before you switch to more advance models or sims.

Many good free models to fly too.

Weapons.
I found a mod Tactical Combat System & Development Kit for FSX/P3D (TacPack) But haven't try yet. Not much about weapon systems in fsx, you can study planes to a detail but weapons are some how ignored.

You can use pedals from your steering wheel as a rudder google for guides.

Conclusion:
+good value for the money
+flight lessons by Rob Machado (in English with audio)
+big community of people in any age
+lot of freebies
+highly modable
+lot of systems to learn and study
+some very masterpiece models, not available in other sims yet

-engine has his limits, if you push to much you get fps drop to 20-30 level or more, no mater how modern and powerful your pc is;
-Some good, old mods not support Win10&FSX-SE or take some work to make them working, so check before you switch to SE;

Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is a re-release Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition which in turn was first launched back in 2006. When compared to modern games like GTA V, The Witcher 3, Batman: Arkham Knight and so forth you are correct in your observation that the graphics are starting to show their age. However, there are hundreds of add-ons and freeware scenery packs available which can be used to customise the way FSX: SE looks. In fact, for many FSX players customising and modding their game is a key part of their experience with the sim. 

We highly recommend this video guide by YouTuber Jordan King which will walk you through how to install some of the best free scenery packs. Check it out.

If you would like to find out more about what has been updated in the re-release please see this post in our forum: 

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/7/530645961936099124/

We have also updated the game twice since it was first launched on Steam and we are working on a third update which is expected within the next few months. Full details of these updates can be found here in the announcement section of the FSX: SE Steam community Hub:

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/announcements

FSX: SE also lets you use a variety of different controls including the classic keyboard and mouse, gamepad and an extensive range of third party controllers. From the settings menu you can further tailor your experience so that the game plays the way you want it to. You might like to explore these options if you are currently find the default control system a little tricky to get to grips with. 

Thank you for giving FSX: SE a try,

It's buggy, horribly optimized, crashes a lot. Flying, for real, is boring and very meticulous, and simmers who fly have a godly amount of patience.

Thus, having Flight Simulator X crash halfway through cruise, or on final, is absolutely nerve wrecking.

It was the 1st flight sim game I purchased back when it was available on disc.I logged many hrs. on that game after purchasing it from Steam, a lot of them without yoke & pedals.(in other words, you can get started with just a mouse.) Like any hobby, it can get a bit expensive if you start purchasing DLC, (downloadable content) or yoke & pedals to enhance the experience, but it offers the best variety of aircraft of any flight sim I've seen on Steam. The graphics are a bit basic without DLC enhancement, and of course the detail of the scenery relies on the overall quality of your pc, but as far as simplicity of learning the basics of flight is concerned, it's certainly the way to start. My biggest complaint is no VR availability or I'd still be flying FSX.

38,52621197,english,"TLDR:
Great simulator, better with mods of which there are MANY

I've played this extensively before owning the Steam Edition and FSX is still my go to flight sim after about 13 years

Graphics: Extremely meh but just as easy to make it much better with both freeware and payware mods. 

Physics: Really good but not perfect. Also, can be better with add-ons.

Fun?: If you like planes and want to fly then yes. If not, it's not an arcade game and you'll probably get bored. Missions are moderately entertaining. You can fly to almost any airfield anywhere in the world out of the box and you have an okay selection of aircraft which can be expanded with both freeware and payware downloads. 



I had the Deluxe Edition DVD and Acceleration too and used this simulator extensively for years on previous computers but my DVD-key stopped working so I bought this on sale. Haven't noticed many changes. It's still not a very well optimized game, and Microsoft knew this from the beginning and advertised it as being built for future systems. Well it's over a decade later and it's still lacking in the performance department. For the most part though, this can still be helped by swapping out the cloud textures and making a few other tweaks. Sadly, some of the great tweaks that used to really help performance can't be found anymore (at least I can't) but the community for add-ons has always been hugely extensive. Before you go buying all the DLC here (not that you shouldn't as some of it seems nice if you have the cash), go poking around the internet for freeware because there's a lot of amazing stuff out there including aircraft of extremely great quality and photographic scenery. If you love modern military jets, Dino Cattaneo's blog should be your first stop for a few super detailed planes including F-14 and F-35. Other than that, a quick internet search will bring you huge libraries of planes, sceneries, and mods. All you really need is a basic understanding of file systems and a willingness to learn the one for this game for which most of the sites where you can find downloads will have a tutorial. I'm not sure why Steam/Dovetail didn't put up a Steam Workshop for FSX as it would be good to see some of the old creators bring their stuff here.",1561930590,1561930797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198029584971,140,1,1029,0,118,1597619271,,

The Steam Edition of this Classic, is simply FANTASTIC, and you can purchase 3rd party add-ons to enhance the basic Microsoft Flight Simulator X.    New and different aircraft (from Carendo,  Just Flight and A2A) for example, and Airport and  Weather enhancements also.  

The NEWEST enhancement I have added is Air Hauler 2.   (AH2) from Just Flight (I think) which you put in the Library TOOLS section of Steam.  You START AH2 from tools, (or the ICON it puts on your desktop... ) 

The manuals of both Flight Simulator X and AH2 are EXTREMELY helpful and user-friendly   

I also ESPECIALLY like the MISSIONS in Flight Simulator X and the Discovery Flight add-ons..  The Discovery add-ons are basically flight plans  (under the .PLN designation)  and are NOT in the Missions section,  you access them from ""load flight plan"" They CAN be modified and re-edited WITHOUT changing the ORIGINAL plan also, (in case you wish to fly direct GPS or VOR to VOR.  under VFR conditions instead of IFR....   This can make for some VERY interesting flights, by the way.

I have noticed that AH2 has had some bad reviews in the past,  but as for myself, I LOVE all the things you can do in the game. I would venture to say that the ""bad reviews"" stem from the user NOT knowing how to load and set up the company in AH2

I'd also like to mention some flaws, the textures are absolute crap, scenery and aircraft. The game is very... VERY laggy, especially in multiplayer, though then again this is expected in games, ( especially old ) this takes a huuuuge dump. You might not ever hit the 60fps mark. Those are pretty much the only outstanding flaws. Other than that the game is great especially if you like to fly around for a few minutes from time to time. Though flying for long is not recommended...

- Great graphics for a game developed in 2006
- Great models
- Has an option for mods/addons
- Cities have live cars and 3d models
- Shaders are great
- Has Private servers but you need to host it from your router by port forwarding which all routers cant do and will take time
- Most people are friendly
- Devs are active and are updating the game bi-monthly with new planes 
- Will even work on laptops with 2Gb and intel I2 processors with good frame rate and good graphics

Cons
- Most of the planes you have to purchase
- Voice communication is team speak when team speak is outdated and discord would be better to use
- Public servers are mostly role play and mic required or else its confusing

What I would recommend: NOTE these are all FREE!

DX10 Scenery fixer from Steve, pretty much essential if you want to run it with all settings maxed out because DX10 has obvious graphical glitches without it

HDE Sky Textures
FSX Ground Textures
HD Airport and Jetway Parking
Road V11
Texwater

All of these can be found here: https://flyawaysimulation.com/news/4949/#aitraffic
The DX10 fixer can be found from a simple Google search

the flyawaysimulation site has MANY other FREE additions for FSX that will keep you busy for days if you are into heavily modding your games/sims and your FSX will be all the better for it as it is essentially quite old software.

Now, the reason I recommend this over xplane 11 which I also have is because:

1. xplane scenery autogen is garbage, its terrible. No major city actually looks like it does in real life
2. Missing Airports. I had it on day 1 and ALL Airports in Australia were missing, nothing but runways. There are now many free airports but this is hardly a solution considering you can spend days (and I did) downloading freeware airports to populate the sim and they are not much better if at all better than what you get standard in FSX
3. Its a resource hog. If you don't have a great computer then good luck to you, 16gig of RAM will barely cut it, an i5 will barely cut it and anything under a 4GB graphics card WONT cut it. Xplane 11 is a highly demanding sim and if you cant run a sim smoothly this will greatly diminish you experience with it. I run FSX maxed out without a problem with the above specs
4. Payware. You want anything actually good in terms of addons for xplane 11? be prepared for a serious financial investment. Yes, there is freeware for xplane 11 but most of it aside from some scenery options are garbage and I should know, I scoured the internet for over a week trying to find the very best free everything for it and it was a total waste of time
5. Physics. Every plane no matter what the weight ratio is feels light as a feather and this was still after much configuration with control settings both in and outside of the sim
6. The skybox looks bad, always looks hazy and foggy. Clouds look terrible unless you are using payware to make them better and if you do prepare for a real kick to performance, you make anything look better in xplane 11 it will cost you serious frames to do so
7. Weather change pop in's/outs. Weather can change in an instant in xplane 11 and its very jarring and immersion breaking when it does happen, its an issue that has been with the sim since day 1 and is still present to this day

Sure, xplane 11 can look good if you have the hardware to back it up and night flying can look quite amazing but its hardly a substitute for everything else I have mentioned against it. Its very clear what direction they are taking with it and I'm not going to support a sim that has the business model they do, its an absolute cash-cow of a sim, people thought FSX was bad with the amount of DLC it has but when you put it against xplane 11 you find that its quite reasonable if you even want to spend more money. I don't, I'm a big freeware hunter and the freeware quality in FSX is much better, what you get as standard even without freeware is much better. You actually get the whole world in a box, landmarks, airports and all and larger selection of default aircraft to learn and play with without even having to get more for free, and not even to mention the amazing payware aircraft that are available.

Choose the airline you like flying with the most, like I do. I'm not a pilot in real life just an aviation enthusiast so the learning curve for the more advance models you pay for isn't that high, youtube is a great source. 

As much as I love this game, it has it's flaws as I said before the base models don't offer much realism and being a game that came out in 2004 the airports need some updating themselves. So there's a lot of heavy investing in this if want the best experience, but that being said it's a great one. Also you may need to tweek the settings to getting the best way you can.

This brings back all the nostalgic childhood memories of playing with my father as a young boy.

The G1000 aircraft are so well done that I actually used this sim to practice for my instrument rating in real life.

I also used it for practicing emergencies, flows, polishing private and commercial maneuvers, and engine cuts in a multi.

I did not buy this game for the graphics or the action, but because it has consistently stood the test of time.

Over the last 20 years that I have been playing this I have changed computers many times, and either had to contact the company to re-activate my cd key, or had to buy the whole game again altogether.

With Steam I hope to simply re-download each time I upgrade my computer, that way I avoid the hassle of having to buy it over and over again every couple of years.

Again, trees = £10 - should give you an idea of where they are heading. 

This game is basically a mobile version in that it is fragmented and sold to you in bits, only with zero improvements over the original game and I'd hardly call them micro-transactions since things like mediocre tree changes cost £10. This game servers no purpose if you have the disk version. If you buy this, you're sacrificing your OWNED disc version for the privilege of renting it on Steam DRM.

The base content that the product has with regards to learning how to fly aircraft take the user to a novice level at best - there is an abundance of better, in-depth guides that can be found online, made by the FSX community. The base graphics are good, with manual optimization required by the user to fit best onto the specific system that is being used. The advantage of the game being dated as it is, is that there is plenty of additional content in the form of both freeware and payware that is available. The sim itself isn't too complex to get a hang of, and installation of additional content is a breeze. To make the most of it, one should invest in some graphical packs similar to the likes of OrbX scenery and PMDG aircraft (both of which are payware). The disadvantage of this product is the lack of developer support. Yes, there is DLC available on the store - but a lot of it seems rushed and in poor condition. All in all - I highly recommend this game, at its base level, to anyone who's just getting started in flight simulation. I however would not recommend this to someone who already has Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D or X-Plane 11, both of which I would consider to be a more hardcore experience at their respective base content packages. I would consider FSX to be the casual approach to flight simulation in comparison, but - again- would highly recommend it to the toe-dipper of the flight sim world.",1555950432,1555950432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198316213889,217,5,31871,0,25414,1592607386,,
99,50253054,english,"This game is incredible. From a newbie pilot to a seasoned air force veteran, anyone can take to the skies in FSX. There are a few things I deem necessary, however, before you spend $25 on this game.

Necessities:
 - Any Joystick. This could be a simple as an Xbox/Playstation controller that is compatible to PC. Without a Joystick this game is incredibly challenging, but can be overcome with hours of practice.

Recommendations:
 - A real flight stick, throttle, pedals, etc. I recommend Thrustmaster, since each of their products is designed to work independently, without requiring other parts. (If you buy a T16000 stick, it has a throttle slider on it.) Each button on Thrustmaster pieces and two or more separate equipment work together without needing T.A.R.G.E.T. software on FSX.

Final notes:
 - FSX is an incredibly in-depth simulator, with buttons galore and stuff I surely didn't understand. It has taught me many things about aviation.
 - FSX includes plenty of stock aircraft for you to enjoy, and the DLC is completely optional and you can still have fun with the game without purchasing any of these aircraft.

I have thousands of hours in this from the original version, the 146 hours listed is just from after I got it on steam. It's kind of badly optimized so even though I have a top-of-the-line computer from 3 years ago it runs at 20-30 FPS at max settings. However, on all low settings it will happily shoot up to 200+ FPS. I currently have an i7-6700 and a GTX 1080. I'm sure I'll conquer the hardware issues eventually, but they are in no way harsh enough to make the game unplayable. While it doesn't scale well at high settings, its a 2006 game so any modern computer will happily run it on low settings. And don't worry about all the DLC on steam: there's a ton of free stuff to download from the internet, just look for sites that mention ""FSX Freeware"" and you'll be overwhelmed by choice.

As far as simulators go I think this game is THE definitive must-have program, and while the physics aren't 100% spot on it's certainly good enough to teach you all the flying tips anyone could need. Just remember to buy a joystick, the mouse and keyboard controls are unusable. It works with xbox controllers as well, though that won't allow much finesse.

      looking for something that's also not to system demanding this is also a great choice! Most of the time you will be in

them unless you want to.. There's things like freeware from websites there's all different sort's of websites you could use..

 just make sure to do a little research of which site is best for you! also.. control's can be a bit complex and, would 

recommend not using keyboard but... if it's all you have it will still work. If you at least have a console or, PC Gamepad of 

some sort laying around that's optional, but personally i use, a logitech Flight Yoke system and, Rudder pedals and, throttle
 
.. but that can be very price demanding... so really depend's how much money your willing to put into this.. also like i said 

this simulator supports a lot more software addon's than most other flight simulators.. i have X-Plane 11 which i know it's

 better in way's but i don't feel as much fun out of it... than FSX which might be odd but.. i just for some reason perfer FSX..

It was a nice upgrade from 2004 but take that 13 years later to 2019 and it will feel out of the league compared to what prepar3d and Xplane offer today. However there are two main reasons FSX still proves as a versatile option to simmers. 

1- Performance: Flight simulation is very demanding and if a couple thousand PC is definitely needed for even small setups, with that being said FSX can run better on entry hardware being offered today.
2- Addons : The availability of quality scenery and weather upgrades plus the wide selection of professional aircrafts makes this title super worthy. Overtime it has  accrued the most paid and freeware addons. 

If your PC is not a banger you might wanna give this title a shot after all this is the one that started this genre in the first place. Also check for videos online on realism addons and quality achievements.

28,49991270,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator X is still one of the best civil flight simulation products available today.  This was originally released in 2006 in DVD format, at a time when the Intel Core 2 processors were just making headlines, and the fastest available graphics were NVidia's GeForce 8 series and ATI's Radeon HD2000 series.  The greatest thing about the Microsoft Flight Simulator series is the ability to extend or enhance them with either freeware or payware aircraft/scenery (these terms are now called ""DLC"").

What you get in the base installation is a ton of great ""default"" aircraft, plausible scenery of the entire planet, and a really nice air traffic control system.  For those who say that FSX is a ""money making potato,"" this is nonsense.  For those who say that it offers ""no flight training,"" you will find flight lessons in the ""Learning Center"" in the main menu.  This has never changed.  

DLC addon products for the Microsoft Flight Simulator series is nothing new, dating back clear to Flight Simulator 6.0 for Windows 95 in 1996.  You can still manually install free DLC (i.e., by dropping aircraft files in to the 'SimObjects\Airplanes' folder, etc.) which you can obtain from several fan-based websites.  As for the paid DLC, the developers (i.e., Carenado, PMDG, FlightOne, Eaglesoft and many others) put a tremendous amount of time and effort into their products in order to create truly authentic aircraft, scenery, etc.  I actually used the FlightOne Cessna 152 to practice flying a real C152, because its simulated handling characteristics were right on the money.

Also, you are not limited to DLC/addons here on Steam.  A simple Google search for ""FSX Addons"" will reveal hundreds, perhaps thousands of free add-ons and add-on development tools.  The good news is that more and more developers are releasing their addons via Steam to make it a bit easier to install them and re-install them.  Remember that DLC is optional.  Many paid/commercial DLC products are geared towards authenticity.  For example, a company called PMDG offers a Boeing 747 with a fully functional virtual cockpit, complete with a simulated, authentic inertial reference system, flight management computers, control display units (complete with their own software!)  electrical systems, hydraulic systems, etc).  For new virtual pilots, the default aircraft and scenery are still quite good.

Do keep in mind that this product is 13 years old, at the time of this writing.  The civil flight sim world has largely moved to P3D (Prepar3D) and X-Plane.  But there is still a ton of life left in this one, and the fact that it is available on Steam makes it incredibly convenient (instead of installing from discs, activating with Microsoft, etc).  Being able to use external DLC (as we did with the disc-based versions of FSX) is fantastic.

100% recommended.  Especially for the price.",1554562712,1554562712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198071012628,16,1,343,0,207,1598730098,,

31,23960330,english,"Hi Folks,

I have been playing FSX since it first came out and have never stopped since!!!
 
I love it to bits. Steam edition is not just OK, but getting better all the time. Especially as more and more of our favourite add-ons are appearing at a fast and steady rate as DLCs via the library or are already there. In some cases no work needs to be done, like “FS Passengers”, while it is not in the DLC list yet, it seamlessly works well with FSX SE and there are many other examples of this too. 

As all serious FSX players will know from experience, there are thousands of add-ons for FSX, literally. Name an aircraft or particular airport, and you can find it somewhere on the net, so add-ons or now DLCs are so important for a more realistic FSX experience. 

Every FSX player cries out for a more realistic game, and none of us will be totally satisfied until we ALL have our garages turned into a particular FSX aircraft, with multi-monitors, aircraft seats, real buttons etc. If you don’t believe me go to YouTube, most FSX users take the game (simulator) very seriously and have many hundreds of hours logged even before porting across to Steam! 

Add to this the fact that Dovetail and Steam are clearly not giving up on FSX as Microsoft did, oh so many years ago now and I would happily recommend any FSX user to transfer without worry about the huge collection of add-ons that you have accumulated over the years. In the majority of cases, you can get a Steam edition from the designers to replace your existing one, or find the appropriate DLC from the original designer or Dovetail, or in a lot of cases, it will just seamlessly port over and work!

When I first moved over to FSX SE, I was worried about the lack of DLCs and the fact that our beloved add-ons from MS FSX didn’t work. That position has totally reversed now, and in most cases, you won’t lose out.

In my opinion, even the base FSX SE is far superior to MS FSX without any add-ons or DLCs! That’s a good start without adding anything. Dovetail have taken their time, but for obvious reasons, I am guessing it wasn’t an easy port across to Steam for them, especially since MS had imposed many restrictions on them to start with. But I have nothing but praise for Dovetail and Steam. 
They have done a damn good job.

However, there was another plus to moving over to the Steam Platform that I wasn’t expecting.

Steam is full of all sorts of games, from card games to building your rocket and sending Kerbals into outer space!
So while playing FSX, I just had to try out a few other games. Now I think I own at least 10 games and certainly play at least 4 of them very regularly !!! So just moving over to the Steam Platform has been greatly beneficial to my semi-retirement!   

Anyway, this was supposed to be a review of FSX-SE! Job done I hope. 
Any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. 

Good luck to you all, whatever games you like, take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
Best wishes,
Trevor",1467306527,1554414876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198315429972,12,3,28840,94,26523,1601835056,,

This sim does not recognise memory beyond 4 Gb, I have an highend computer, witch goes way over recomended requierment, but that does not help. I have run this sim steadily with free add-on's, but as soon i started to buy dlc's witch has very complex grafic, then i started to get the OOM.

34,47797902,english,"This review is made many, many years after release, so I will clarify a few things: I will be considering the physical features of the base map to be accurate as for the time it was made, and the graphics were very good at the time. Today, both of these claims are false for the most part, though I will say that graphically this simulator is not completely unbearable.

This game has very realistic physics, has accurate crash detection and only small details that should be worked on within the base game. The base game has a decent selection of aircraft with different liveries and more importantly has set up several missions ranging from tutorials to expert-level missions, and the missions often include something special that makes it more entertaining. All of this and more makes this game by 2006 standards one of the best out there.

Modding has only made this game better. While freeware can sometimes includes bugs (they don't get paid so don't expect them to do a bunch of debugging), most paid and indeed some free mods can spice up the simulator experience. Although this is a very old game, the modded flying community has made an insane amount of cool stuff. Not only airplanes, but different types of aircraft, different textures ranging from small airports to entire countries, and different GUI-related mods that can make the simulator's age seem obsolete. Once you are deep into the modding, the base game will seem almost invisible (it's still there, it's just that many mods will override numerous different aspects of the game that you experience.)

Will FSX live forever? X-Plane is not as massive. It only covers a small portion of the world and has limited aircraft although it can also be modded and it is graphically quite nice. I doubt X-Plane will have a large impact on FSX.

P3D is looking like a better replacement. It not only looks much nicer graphically but it is more up to date and has some very nice animations and sounds that are much clearer and simply much more appropriate in the later stages of this decade.

Regardless, I think all FSX Steam pilots can agree that FSX has reigned supreme in flight simulation for many years since its release, an unbelievable accomplishment.",1545718821,1545718821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198184953437,34,7,10321,0,8334.0,1589695365,,

FSX is probably one of the most bad looking, ugliest and in general non-complex games. But wait, how did you get 600+ h in that game? That's where the loved and hated addons come to play. The basic FSX game is not even close to complete, but therefore some genius guys created better looking scenery and new and mostly better looking planes and selled them for a shit ton of money. So if you think about buying a flight sim and just playing a little with it, but you wanna have nice graphics and stuff, you should go for X Plane or sims like that. But if you Want a sim for your lifetime, where you cann optimise or create your own managed sim, I think FSX is a good choice for you. But remember, just for the start, because you really need to use good ol' mums credit card to get it looking great in all aspects, for me I am fine with smaller airplanes, which are in my opinion better, when it comes to Frames and performance.

Would love to recommend this version but I cannot for a few reasons.   I installed it today, tried it again, and promply uninstalled it.

I recall FSX had a great IFR panel and I wanted to use it to practice instrument procedures.  However it seems that everything you use for IFR is 13 years out of date. 

- the install puts a bunch of really really old MS 2005 runtime executables on my system; uninstalling the game requires going into the settings and hunting down and removing each one of these obsolete packages

- with Win 10 Pro on a fairly new/clean install I had lots of instances where the screen went blank for minutes.  Hitting escape and waiting a bit eventually brought it back in all but the last instance, where I had to go into task manager and kill the game

- perhaps more importantly, the aiport information, navaids, waypoints and anything avionics related has NOT BEEN UPDATED since the game was released in 2006.  If your airport has changed runway headings due to magnetic drift, or if you are looking for current navaids, approaches, departures that are modern and up-to-date, you will be disappointed.

If looking for a good sim for training IFR procedures, skip this and try another.

77,47198865,english,"Having just passed my first solo flight on FSX, I just wanted to post my early review for all those contemplating purchasing it. I bought this on discount at £8 having a keen interest in all things flight related. I fly models in the real world and so thought being in the cockpit in a virtual world would probably be as close as I get to the real thing! This has been my first experience of a flight sim so cannot compare against anything else. I have a Thrustmaster Hotas X which is £50 worth of hardware that is probably bare minimum for simulation but it works well. I started from scratch with 'Rod' the in game flight instructor who so far has played a great job of being my 'wing man' tutor. I wanted to know everything from the start and the basics, to get full experience. The lessons are simple to understand and explained well. I dont really care for top notch graphics and the framerate isn't too bad to give you that 'flying' feeling as you nose out the cockpit windows. I have a decent gaming pc to keep things rolling ok. I'm more interested in learning the basics of flight, the 'basic six' instruments in the cockpit to allow me to eventually plot a course out into the sunset somewhere. I have passed my first solo (whereby my wife was dabbing the sweat from my forehead as I flew due to the nerves and high level of concentration going on!) If that's not a result of a good simulator I don't know what is. I play War Thunder also and allthough dogfighting is cool in a P51 and simulated flight is good, nothing comes close to the scrutiny of a real (virtual) flight instructor sitting next to you teaching you the real thing!. I'm still a noob on FSX but have made good progress so far and hoping to carry on my flight schooling with it. You can take it as serious as you want to I suppose. It's good for the money (especially at the discounted price)and would recommend it to anyone like myself who has a genuine interest in knowing how to a fly a plane from scratch.

76,45658412,english,"Ah yes. The starting place of probably most every person who plays flight sims. FSX: Steam Edition. Let's take it from the top, shall we? 

My first thoughts of FSX were, ""Wow, this is great, I finally have a flight sim worth playing."" Then I dove head-first into the aircraft. You can pretty well guess what plane I started with. Yes, it's the good old Cessna 172SP Skyhawk. I started learning every nook and cranny of that instrument panel, and with having a good deal of experience with it from X-Plane 10 mobile edition, I already knew of several of the key items such as flaps, magnetos, switches, gauges, and whatnot. 

I then moved on from the Skyhawk onto more advanced aircraft, such as the Baron 58, Mooney Bravo... then moved up to the Bombardier Learjet 45, and from there onto commercial aircraft. Started off with a Boeing 737, but when I sat in the cockpit of an Airbus A321, I fell in love instantly. I instantly knew that I'd be flying this aircraft for a long while. 

Unfortunately, by now I was starting to see that... FSX was missing stuff. The default ATC is...  okay at best. Still haven't gotten around to fixing that. And I saw that the A321 I came to know and love... was missing a lot of stuff. So when I saw the Aerosoft A321, and all of its features... I fell in love again. You bet I snatched that up ASAP. So.. do I recommend FSX? You're damn right I do! 

Though... to be fair.. I recommend X-Plane 11 more. It's more up to date, plus it runs better. You have to keep in mind, FSX was made in 2006. 12 years ago. It's old, and slow.

As much as I love supporting continued development, have you seen the price of the DLC? 

Individual airport models cost most than half the price of the full game.

Some individual planes cost more than the base game itself!

At time of writing, to buy the full experience (base game + all the DLC) it's currently sat at £3,716.15

£3,716.15 !!

I can't give this a thumbs up. 

The sim is solid, don't get me wrong. Sure the graphics aren't the best, looking very dated now. 

There's a good amount in the base game for the money.

7,37885927,english,"Love this. Bought this with Aerosoft A320 Add on. Works like a charm. Love DX10. Awesome Microsoft and Dovetail.

I started my experience with MSFS-2002. I first played it when i was 9. I made fun of myself as i failed even to take off a C170. I was amazed to see my home airport(Chennai Intl', India(VOMM / MAA). Then I got FS2004 as a gift. I was amazed to see 3D clouds and great terrain. After taking a long break from Flight Simulation, I've decided to purchase FSX and play it on my new PC. The first thing I noticed was DX10. While it doesn't change the visuals to an observable extent, the overall smoothness can be observed. Also, DX10 is buggy on some mods, so be careful. The next thing i saw was FPS. It's clear that the game's engine is getting old. Even with an i5-7400+1050Ti+8GB RAM, I need to turn down some settings like Autogen to increase my FPS to a playable rate. It gets even worse in custom airports like the ones I've downloaded from IVAO

FPS ANALYSIS
Setting- Everything maxed except Autogen, which is set on Dense.Everything measured with Aerosoft A320(Indigo VT-IDE), REX4 TD+Soft Clouds, ASN set to Live RW

FPS at VOMM(By IVAO)- 17 at the terminal, 20 while taxiing, 20-22 at the runway(TO) and about 29 while above the city and the airport. But, while coming in for an approach, things get a bit worse like 10, due to loading problems as it is still 32-Bit

FPS above 6000 MSL: 40 to 90. 

FPS when it's overcast plus rain: 14-20 no matter where you are

FPS at a stock airport(VOCI) 30-50 FPS depending on the weather.

While the FPS is quite low for a modern spec PC, the game is smooth. I dont know how or why, but it wouldn't feel like 16 FPS, unless I press Shift+Z.. The game doesnt feel stuttery and jittery and choppy when the FPS is low. I get the same experience everywhere and everytime. I don't how this is possible, but im happy and want it to stay the same way.

The graphics, textures are about normal for a Flight Simulation. I'm saying this for stock, which are basically FS2004 textures with some improvement. There no special touches that make the game look more special, except for airports, cities, etc. The terrain looks a bit OK when viewing from high altitudes. The Real World Weather featured in game doesn't work at all. Even if it does, it is a galaxy away from the latest METAR. The stock airliners(Airliners only, as I flew them and that too, only once for each aircraft) are basic. In-Game ATC supports only VFR and that is a big letdown.

The game gets better with DLCs

For the graphics, I bought REX4 Texture Direct and Soft Clouds. REX does a really great job in improving the overall visual feel greatly. The textures now have a life to them. The colors and contrasts are improved along with lots of sky lighting, ground texture improvements, airport textures,etc. Soft clouds brings the most expected reallistic cloud exprerience, both from the ground and in the sky. I also use the ENB shaders provided by REX themselves. ENB does a great job for overall lighting, but still, the ground shadows are a bit buggy due to DX10. But, does it matter when we are in the air? No. Now, for the weather issues, I started with FSRealWeather. That gave me a beginner experience in real world weather. I bought REX4 TD, REX Soft Clouds and ASN during Summer Sale 2018. While FSRW did a good job in imitating METARs, Active Sky Next gives life to METARs, Now, there are no sudden changes in weather. There is smooth transition between conditions. All these improvements did not reduce even a single frame per second. For the ATC, I purchased PROATC-X(It's not on Steam). It makes ATC reallistic and improves my FSX Xperience

If you want a completely reallistic experience, please be ready to pay more.

For Airlines, you must consider buying DLC aircraft, as the stock ones are basic and would get you bored over time. Pick anything you want during sales. As for me, I've bought the Aerosoft A320 because I like the aircraft and I only do Short-Medium haul flights. But, you can pick anyting you want as per your likes and distances.

PROS:-
 Mostly reallistic experience(With DLCs) 
Great aircraft DLCs
Stock GA aircrafts are great too
Covers the whole world and almost all airports
Multiplayer(I'm still yet to go in)
There's also great free airliners
Good stock airports(Some exceptions in mostly third world countries)
Completely reallistic navigation and procedures, except the VFR only ATC
Free Aircraft (eg: Project Airbus) are also nice
CONS
In Game ATC is VFR only. So, I use PROATC-X
Stock Airliners are pretty basic, so you must consider DLCs
Night flying is ugly if you don't use ORBX or Night Environment X
Lighting issues
32bit and the same old engine
Optimisation issues. Micro Stuttering is still an issue which is a trend from FS2002.
DLCs are a must and they are expensive( They are a NEED and they must be paid above the game cost)
Lots of bugs. Tweaking of FSX.cfg is a must for every FSX player
You need an i7 or i9 to run constant 50 FPS+

Overall, considering that you are ready to buy some DLCs, this game is highly recommended for every flight enthusiast out there. Make sure to also buy a Flightstick or a yoke to further enchance your FSXperience.

Thank you.

So, don't be upset, get yourself this great piece of software, learn the basic concepts of flying (the tutorials are very helpful, there's also a massive learning center, so prepare for a lot of reading; also, if you have experience in my favourite game ""Kerbal Space Program"", then you'll find flying a metal box a lot more comprehensible) and enjoy the moment when you're able to take-off, fly, and land manually all by yourself!

Even if you decide to buy all the 263 DLCs (the total cost of which is currently 4699,25€) you'll still be getting the cheaper deal (as opposed to becoming an actual pilot).

If you prefer a simpler flight simulator game, then you might very well enjoy ""Simple Planes"". I do own it (DRM-free on GOG.com) and I highly recommend it.

Start learning the planes, continue with flight plans and after, with some investment, it turns into some aerial world ""truck"" sim. At least this is how I'm playing with Air Hauler and FS Captain addons.

For its time, and even today, these are some of the most realistic graphics you'd expect on any decent flight sim. The physics are on  par with what I'd expect out of a real airplane. The controls are very customizable and response times appropriately differ between each aircraft. Someone coming from a game like GTA V jumping into this would be in for a rude awakening; planes are not that brain-dead easy to fly. But! The learning curve is managable. If I can do it, so can you. A few hours of practice and I've got the hang of a handful of commercial aircraft, my favorite being the Boeing 737 because I like the cockpit layout.

There's a lot of texture upgrades you can install with the Rex4 texture software where you can create your own theme of detailed runway patterns, clouds, water, sky, lighting, etc from both the presets and community creations with click-and-done installation. It's that simple.

Granted, this game is not the most optimized creation; I've an i5-7500 and a GTX 1070 and I've had to tone some settings down to medium to get an interrupted 60 fps frame rate going. I'm guessing the CPU will be the real bottleneck when trying to run this game because as you can imagine, there are a TON of physics calculations being done, especially as you populate the game with more AI aircraft.

All in all, it's wel worth the price, and the DLC offers plenty of gorgeous aircraft packs to choose from.

To reiterate the positives, I have enjoyed Microsoft FS since my first copy of FS2004 (A century of flight). Last Christmas I switched to FSX:SE and had no problems until September when only the front splash (title) screen came up and the game did not go beyond that point. This when three days of frustration set in. Eventually FSX user Rogen stepped in with corrective action and the issue was resolved.
As a long time user I love the game and, as Rogen wrote, ""Given the sim came out in 2006 there is large wealth of knowledge on the internet, and Steam is just a small part of all that is FSX. That said there are plenty of self help threads in the Steam forums, you just gotta search..."" which I didn't make a very good effort of doing.

25,44432736,english,"There's something that the 2,000 plus negative reviews don't understand about FSXSE.
It's a simulator, not a game for the most part.

Let me explain this in parts.

I think this program is great. Putting about 140 hours into at the time of this review, I can say that this is definitely worth the $26 bucks.
the reason it's good is:
1. It's a great learning tool
2. It's realistic but customizable.

If you're learning to fly as I am, you will find that this makes a great learning tool to practice meneuvers that your instructor taught you or that you read up on. I've personally found the realism settings to be perfect, because you can choose them to be easy and basic to hell on earth.

That's it. It's a good tool.

But there seems to be other's who have bought this program as a game, find out that it's hard, get confused, give up, then whine on the reviews after under an hour. This isn't all however, as some negative reviewers are veterans to the flight sim community and likely have much more experience than I.

So, TL;DR,
If you're looking for a flying game, look at IL-Sturmovik. This is more like a tool than a game. Yes there's multiplayer, yes people like AirForceProud95 (or daremorsealive79, or fairscrotumguys69, or however you say his name lol) make it look like a simple game, but it's likely you won't find yourself enjoying the game like he does immediately.

Don't get me wrong, this review is wholely subjective and though, there's nothing technically wrong with this game, I personally got some preferences to be met that this game doesn't.

So let's talk about Microsoft's biggest pain in the foot that was a splinter in my eye ever since they released games.

SETTINGS

It's terrible. HORRIBLE. I want to play in Fullscreen but as soon as I do that, my second screen becomes black. I've read you shall play this game in windowed mode which in terms of immersion is something I don't really like at all. You see I wanna be immersed by a game and though, if the game is really good and enjoyable for me playing it in windowed mode is not THAT kind of a big deal but to understand why I dislike this thing you have to know the rest of this review. So hold your buttocks lads, I'm writing a bit more here.

I've been lovehating Simulator games for quite the while now. I love them cos they are fun, I hate them cos they're so blunt. Does this make sense at the first look? Nah. See, I have fun in sometimes doing blunt and simple tasks like driving a truck, flying a plane, making these tasks in a GAME so overcomplicated, that it is almost as in real life. Which is why I really love Sim games in general.

The reason why I hate them so much is that at the time I want some action again, I struggle to stop myself playing these games. But that's a personal issue - as said, this review now should be taken completely relative to me and anyone who feels the same this way. THAT is why I put this in here.

However, MFS:X tries to teach you how to fly but does so SOOOO GOD DAMN COLD. That tutor is treating you like you're the first cavemen that crawled out of the last untouched corner of the earth or a very very very old person that doesn't know how to ""keep up with those youngsters o' nowadays!"". I do see where this game is directed to but I never had a tutorial that was more boring than this one.

Next up is - when I joined a server for Multiplayer to get some player help me with that, everyone just standed around the ATC pretending they're Airforceproud95 or Kennedy Steve not remotely helping in the slightest. Most of them fly around in this stupid Red Bull plane and there isn't anybody that can explain you how the fuck you bring a Boeing in the air and to the ground safely without crashing into oblivion or hell - get yelled at by the ATC or shot down by a military plane cos you don't comply flight regulations.

I only stopped playing cos I wanted to have my money back. I ain't paying 25 Bucks for this shit, nor 8 bucks after it's reduced. If this shit would be for free I would spend more time on it. MAYBE. IF THERE'S ACTUALLY ANYBODY HELPING.

And yes, I can imagine how many of you MFS fanboys cry ""But you sound like you just don't know how to play and that is why you don't enjoy it and"" blah blah blah blah blah. Listen bitch, I played all Dark Souls and Demon Souls parts while having all the fun I had on these games. It was really nice. This is about personal preference and I'm speaking for a minor, minor part of the community and that is the part, that thinks alike.

39,44343109,english,"As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.

There were a lot of things we couldn’t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground.

Regardless, this game has been very fun to play.",1535081984,1535081984,True,97,71,0.722876012325286865,0,True,False,False,76561198350459000,30,1,2195,0,1568,1591076302,,

- The Steam Edition has NOTHING different than the original one
- Dovetail even did not fix some glitches and fails (for example, the glitch when adding an Addon Scenery, which is ashaming), nor wrong placed airfields.
- I purchased a DLC airplane (CSA SportCruiser) but after reinstalling FSX the airplane is simply GONE. I have tried to reinstall it for several times with no results. Basically, I've lost my money.

I'm a fan of FSX, but Steam Edition is simply a scam. A trick to sell you sceneries and airplanes through Steam.

   The physics are incredibly accurate, nothing else to say there. Engine spool up time is about right, the stall characteristics are accurate, all that stuff. I am a huge flight geek, and the only reason I got steam in the first place is for FSX (Flight Simulator X). Worth every penny. This requires some kind of interest in aviation, as a normal gamer would become bored of FSX relatively quickly.

   I got this addon that allows me to fly the US Air Force B-1 Bomber, and that was worth it too. There is still a thriving community developing addons for FSX, so the base game is not all that you get. New aircraft about every month or so, and I love anticipating it.

    Overall great for anyone that wants to learn to fly, any real life pilots in free time, or just a flight geek like me. If you buy FSX, PLEASE GET A JOYSTICK.

1. there is no ground effect in the game, making it usless to practice landing.
2. the stall mechanics in the game are broken. I have no idea what they did wrong but its imposible to recover from a stall in the private pilot standards in the game, i can recover no problem in a real plane by losing 50 -150 ft, in the game i can at best recover within 300 ft.
3. The terrain, roads, buildings, and nearly everything els is not correct. the only thing the game has right is the location/direction of runways, so you can't use the game to practice for a cross country flight.

Wasn't too sure if I should have used it at the first place but I gave it a go anyways. At first it worked perfectly my game experience was good I was confident about who would want to join my multiplayer games as my friend request was pretty much filled with people who wanted to play with me online. Days had passed and I realised something that shocked me, little did I know that this mod was actually slowing down my computers performance dramatically I should have known better to be fully honest but how does this relate to FSX? well it does a lot after I realised that the mod program was using up about a third of my ram performance I immediately shut down everything and began to delete Maldair files. I then hoped that FSX would run a little smoother if not better so I clicked on 'play' as always after this FSX start up showed up so I said to myself great this mod didn't destroy my game experience after all. This is where I was completely wrong to this day I can't play FSX properly little did I know that the Mod actually did more harm than good I absoluely regret every bit of that.

A long time ago, i could reccomend FSX easily, with a wide range of excellent addons, good graphics (at the time) and a good multiplayer. However nowadays this is not the case. The graphics have aged poorly, the game is plauged with bugs, mainly the out of memory crash (this is due to FSX being 32-bit, so it cannot use more than 4GB ram). There are simply far better alternatives, such as XP-11. However, if you'd rather stay in the FSX ecosystem, you should buy Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D. It is somewhat costly at around $60, however it is certainly worth it. It is based off of the FSX engine, so it should feel very similar, however it looks far superior (especially with addons such as TomatoShade, ORBX, and REX texture direct), and performance is far superior, due to it being 64-bit, so no OOM errors.

There's nothing about firing weapons or making risky maneuvers (even thought flying with a decent joystick with the most real settings possible is a hell of a challenge). Put your plane in the air and watch the scenery.

There's a special feeling in taking off and landing that, maybe, nothing can describe.

Microsoft Flight Simulator marks an era, as the preferred simulator of many people. Still to this day, it is one the most realistic and best out there. The great amount of content that can be added to it certainly makes a difference.

You can even be part of a real flight network with other planes and get a job as a professional pilot (all with mods, that support other simulators also).

I believe this game offers great physics, great graphics and a good amount of content. Is my preferred simulator. It's interface is very good and there's even virtual courses with professional pilots that you can take.

It's a different experience that you should try.

It was hard to learn at first but after a while i got it. To use all the utillities in fseconomy your going to need to buy alot of planes in FSX which sucks because they are expensive and drain your wallet fast so watch out.

However, I've found myself impressed with the riduculous amount of ""missions"" which are essentially flight training in all kinds of aircraft. Voice overlays on all of them. Then if you dig deeper, there's an entire book of reading material. 

I grew up and taught myself to fly on a very early version of Flight Sim, so maybe there's nostalgia involved, but I think this is a helluva value if you just want to teach yourself how to fly, or even just polish and play with old skills. Flight model doesn't feel bad to me, sure DCS-A10 feels a lot more modern, but flying a bush plane in a remote landing, or ridge soaring, don't think you can get much better than this for the money.",1529722285,1529722285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198019868377,76,9,11391,55,535,1601769369,,

8,42909919,english,"NB. This is a review from a Single Player aspect only

Sadly a negative review here. Yes it is an older game but I had expected a little, or maybe a lot, more from it. I was hoping for something that meant I could fly a classic Cessna or DC3 from airfield to airfield in the NW USA /Canada, or the Caribbean, doing various courier flights and taking in some (basic but quality) scenary, which it essentially does, but not well enough.

So:

I do like the ATC interaction it gave some feeling to the purpose of flying, but there was little else I found satisfying

Generally the frame rate is pretty poor and there was stuttering.

Base grahics are poor, the textures just look so bad when at low altitudes.

Locality maps are far from realistic (try flying along the River Avon at Bristol if you've ever gone along that road in real life, the river bizarely flows up and over and down a hill again?! there's no suspension bridge and it just looks poor)

Some of the interiors (DC3 for example) look terrible

Then, everything, and I mean everything it seems, has to be added, i.e. paid for:

- Aircraft with decent textures and flight/systems models, there's no systems failures modelled by default (as far as I can see)
- Ground textures and locality map improvements
- Realistic weather
- Realistic physics and effects like head wobble, views, wheel bobble on the catseyes/surfaces, damage model (on teh default a message just pops up saying you over stressed?!)

You have to buy them all seperately.

I get that things would need adding, particualrly on the map side, but the physics and weather and damage/systems failure? That is what I was hoping would be in 'a simulator'; giving challenge and a believable environment that meant i could see past dated graphics. but alas no.

I bought one map textures improvement and a physics one* and tried some free map/texture mods. The free ones corrupted my game, the paid for map texture was better but was limited in effect by the general poor performance of this game, the better things start to get the more it all slows down.

Then there is the lack of an in-game 'career', I found an online service that can provide somethin where you earn money and buy/rent aircraft (a free thing!) but sadly I never managed to get into this because of the point about the bought physics mod below.

*So I bought a physics mod from FSPS store ltd, this caused the entire game to take about 20 minutes to load, and when it did, it ran at a handful of frames a second, if that! I reported this and after initial responses it all went quiet, my updates were ignored, so I chased and chased and got a couple of 'looking in to it' replies but now it is 4 months later and it still won't work. Windows apparently detected that the physics programme caused a memory leak.

I've finally lost patience, I can't wait any longer for this paid-for mod to be fixed and maybe provide what I consider the basic physics I would hope for, so this along with the other parts I find lacking, means FSX is being uninstalled.

Overall, you need a number of often expensive add-ons to get anywhere near a complete sim, yet each one runs the risk of reducing the poor fps further, and, you are at risk of corrupting your game files, or buying a broken product.

PROS:
-Many addons from the internet to up your game. Examples include rikoooo.com , flyawaysimulation.com and simviation.com
-Wide array of DLCs for you to buy from steam from sceneries and textures to planes. You can also buy them externally such as PMDG and OrBx products.
CONS:
-Default textures are just too low end and outdated. I reccommend you to go online and find some good textures  
-DLCs. Ah yes, the DLCs. Just waaaaay too expensive to buy all the DLCs. But thats normal because the devs (such as REX, Aerosoft etc.) take a lot of time to develop the DLCs.

You might think this would run fanstically on a modern machine with 8gb ram and a video card with 1gb ram. But sadly 32bit software is incapable of taking advantage of modern hardware. This simulator will probably run very well at first, however eventually it will cause problems and the headache of getting it to work again is not worth it. Do yourself a favor, get XPlane instead; or if you are into military aviation, I suggest DCS World (the base simulation is free and includes two planes).

Also, while XPlane is a great simulator, even for those who are more serious about aviation, if you are set on MSFS and considering training for your pilot's license, have a look at Prepar3d. It basically is MSFS updated, and maintained by Lockheed Martin, to run on a 64bit system. Prepar3d is not available on Steam, it is not a game.

I am running an AMD 1800X, 32GB RAM, GTX1070 8GB RAM; MSFS runs great, for a while. Then it crashes, and maybe will work intermitently. Then eventually, it doesn't run at all; at which point uninstalling and reinstalling alone does not fix it. You will have to edit the system registry before reinstalling. PITA Pain In The A**

25,41722451,english,"It pains me to leave a poor review of this game, because ultimately, Microsoft's flight simulator series has been one of the driving forces behind most of my computer purchases and decisions over the years.  I've sunk thousands of hours into 2004, and recently I had to give up on it because it's just become too unstable graphically, and was never designed for 64-bit and multi-cores.  

Well sadly, neither was FSX.  I went from 100fps but frequent graphics crashes in FS2004 to 5-20fps in FSX, and I've struggled to get anything more than that.  Oh sure, at high altitude, I can keep 50fps smoothly.  But approaching any airport with any kind of AI traffic on, and my computer tanks.  I've played with every configuration setting imaginable, experimented for hours on end, and I've concluded that my 2015 computer with a GTX960 doesn't matter to this 2006 era game because FSX wants CPU speed, not GPU.  2.0Ghz is a bit of a lie, unless you want to fly around at low graphics settings by yourself.  In order to use the amazing addons, better aircraft, and to populate your world with real-world AI aircraft, you need an extremely high speed CPU, 4.0Ghz+.  

I'm thoroughly disappointed because now I feel like I've wasted so much time and money on replacing my beloved old 2004 simulator (that wants Windows XP to run stable) with something that wants a NASA supercomputer to run at half the FPS I used to have before.  I know I'm exaggerating a bit, but I'm frustrated.

46,32615868,english,"[b] Flight simulator X : Steam Edition [/b] is a classic, when it comes to flight simulators. Released in 2006, it's still a good simulator. Especially if you're a beginner and you want to learn the basic's. There is a learning center in-game that can teach you everything you should know. There are also plenty of tutorials (missions) to choose from. I don't own any other simulators, but I think this is the best beginners sim, especially because it's an older game => should run pretty easy. It has it's age, and that shows. Graphics, autogen, aircraft, physics are outdated; but not bad! I have played for many hours (don't be fooled by the number, I have many hours offline) and I can say this: for what you get, it's pretty good! If it's on a sale, give it a chance! Dovetail should lower the price tho, a sim that's a decade old, isn't worth 24,99 euro's.

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Easy to run
- Great to learn the basic's of flight simming
- Great learning center + tutorials in-game
- FSX community is massive
- Steam multiplayer fun

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Old engine, graphics, autogen, aircraft, physics
- Flight model isn't realistic
- Addons are quite expensive (for every sim, addons are expensive)

Pros:
-Realistic physics (most of the time).
-A lot of planes to choose from.
-An online multiplayer mode.
-Working air traffic control.
-Compatible with addons.
(I could go on but I don't have the time).

Cons:
-Very complicated at first.
-The taxi mechanics aren't very good (at least for me).
-In online mode, it's relatively rare to find a large server where people are actually being serious, and not doing stuff like taking off from the taxiways.
-It does cost over $25.

In conclusion, I do recommend this game. However, there are quite a few cons. If you are able to learn how to fly in this game by watching tutorials, you'll eventually get it. If this sounds interesting to you, go ahead and buy it. If you're kind of interested, wait until a sale to get it. If you're expecting a very simplified flight sim, this isn't the game for you.

The most recent release, Flight Simulator X, was hugely received at the time and quickly established itself as the key player within the flight simulation industry.

However, if you’ve previously spent time using these simulators then you’ll be probably wondering just what the reason for buying this again would be.

8,13453744,english,"Well, there is certainly a lot to say about FSX.

FSX Steam Edition is basically the original FSX released in 2006 but with the expansions included and one or two compatibility fixes with modern OSs. As a result you are buying a 2006 game so expect it to look very much like a game from it's era. However, the thing which has made FSX so enduring is it's 'modability', aka the ability to change almost every aspect of the experience. If you are looking to be a serious flight simmer I would recommend you invest in some decent aircraft beyond the simplified versions offered in this version, then you can look at improving the world aesthetics if it takes your fancy.

ATC is included in the game but it is inaccurate and is mostly based on the US system which differs from how it works for actual commercial operations around the world (Europe is particularly badly done), however it is workable and if you want the extra bit of realism you can connect to a virtual ATC envrionment like Vatsim.

A word of caution however, despite the fixes this game at the foundation is still made in 2006 and you will inevitably run into fixes, in a modern day environment there are now newer platforms such as Prepar3D (The spiritual successor to FSX) and Xplane (which apparently has made huge leaps in realism in recent years. In comparison FSX is clunky, unreliable and reliant on a 32 bit architecture. However if you want a nice cheap flight sim to start off with this is a great way to see what the platforms have to offer.

Pros:
* Highly Moddable
* Probably the biggest available stockpile of Freeware and Payware addons due to it's longevity
* Low Price compared to newer sims

Cons:
* Buggy and prone to reliability issues
* Obsolete compared to newer sims
* Large amount of money required to upgrade game from it's very dated appearance to newer standards.

Moreover, for its time it was and still is a technological advancement in the right direction!  More so an imprint for what you see in today's market. 

However there are things, you should look out for when using this flight sim.

1: Maneuverability and control- Most stock aircraft will feel ""unrealistic"" and ""floaty""  this is because Microsofts stock aircraft and all the things that make up the planes internal physics are outdated!  Purchase a flight from a2a! Payware is a must if you are an enthusiast like myself!

2: Online steam community- There isn't anything I can say its something you must experience for your self. 
There are tons of people acting very unprofessionally!    Why do you ask? Oh, Steam edition.

43,20041530,english,"[h1]Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition[/h1]
Ah, good old FSX. I spent so many hours on this game, way more than Steam tracked with this Edition. Back in 2006 I bought the original Deluxe Edition, later on the Acceleration expansion pack. Prior to that, I bought FS2004, and even before that, FS2002.

I flew so many hours, experienced so many things with FSX. I'll let you know if this game is good or not - but only at the end, of course! :)


[h1]What it is about[/h1]
Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is about flying. Yes, flying. But that's not it - with add-ons, you can drive cars, boats or walk as a person. Yes, that all is possible with third party addons, that are available en masse on the internet.
Apart from all the DLCs that are available on the Steam Store, there is way more to explore on FlightSim-communities. Not to mention that you do not have to buy any of the DLCs to have fun.

The big point about FSX is its mod-ability (or whatever you spell it). You can modify everything you want - from the sceneries over the aircrafts you are flying to the whole environment.

Yes, it will crash or hang up at times (there is no doubt that this simulator rather should be named ""Microsoft Crash Simulator""), but then mostly something is misconfigured in the settings - sceneries overlapping, wrong textures for something or FSX was using too much RAM for everything and said ""goodbye"".

To put FSX into the genre ""Simulation"" is a bit far off - it is a game that one can modify to a simulator. But I doubt it will ever feel like a whole simulation - XPlane and Prepar3D are a little more deeper in that niche.

Yet Microsoft Flight Simlator X: Steam Edition is fun, and surely is worth the price for an entry to the flight simulation world - and maybe even for the entry to a real pilots license, if one is getting the hang of flying and bored of FSX!


[h1]In a nutshell[/h1]
Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is for those who wish for an FSX that does not crash as much as the original version off of Steam. Not much has changed, a few files did, which help FSX being a little more stable.
People that want to sniff a little more (virtual) air are welcome to buy this product too - for some it might be addicting when exploring the world of flight simulation, for others it might become boring.

5/10 Obviously isn't high quality like X-Plane, however still good for its time.

Scenery:
6.5/10 Scenery is lacking, even though major landmarks, etc. are present, the terrain is mesh and is low quality.

Variety, quantity and quality craft:
9/10 Pretty large variety of aircraft and liveries, multiple companies, and lots of mods and addons with high quality airplanes. All aircraft have fully animated exteriors, working lights, landing gears, etc.

Community:
8.5/10 Multiplayer servers via Steam are present and sometimes fun to fly in, additionally there are realistic servers such as VATSIM, and friend servers. Also lots of modifications to the game.

Stability:
6/10 Even though game is completely playable on Windows 10, lag does occur and an odd bug where if you open any menu it crashes does furiate me a lot. Though, if you have a decent computer, no major lag should come.

Handling:
6.5/10 Keyboard handling is horrible, don't even try. However, if you have a controller or joystick you can easily handle the aircraft, the airplane does respond to movements and it does feel like you are flying the type of craft at most times.

Realism:
7.5/10 Game is realistic for its time, however, sometimes, eg. at takeoff, you just don't feel like you're in an actual airplane. Also, sounds are lacking and physics is not the best for default and addon aircraft.

Features:
8.5/10 The features on vanilla aircraft, though somewhat lacking on specific elements, are adequate for the price, including working cockpits (even though most buttons on the O/H panel are not functional). Also, addon aircraft can be very indepth and have multiple features.

Map:
9.5/10 Map is massive, you can fly to and from any airport, airports are realistically modelled, even though not the best, the map is great for its time.

Miscellaneous:
8/10 Some other small things like night environment, general feel, and other personal touches are great for its time and for today.

Overall opinion:

89,39635678,english,"Hey, before I get started with the review, I would like to say this is my first ever flight simulator on a PC and I can tell every single one of you, it's still one of the best ones out there. Although this is my ONLY flight simulator I have experienced others at my friend's house and there is no flight sim that gives so much satisfaction as this one. Now with the review:

As a not of a long owner of this game (around 4 months), you can see that I have logged hundreds of hours in the sky using this flight sim. This simulator also comes with in-game audio which I have to say isn't the best but still gives you a better and more realistic experience. Also do not forget that if you there are trollers on this game you can just get a Vatsim account and get vPilot (which you need to know phraseology and how to operate aircraft in it), which will sure to give you a very nice experience.

The DLC's are definitely worth the money according to my friend's and I can back that up as they include things normal or default aircraft wouldn't include. With a wide selection of livery, sound, planes and all other things you can get from the internet, the possibilities are literally endless! You can do so many things it's unreal! Ranging from formation flying, realistic flying, dogfighting (AFP95 reference), and so much more it's just impossible to name them all. One of the perks of buying this game is that it will give you more practice and realism in aviation. Also if you think that you're bad at flying, bad at pretty much everything in aviation (LOL) this game would still fit you!

This game only costs £20 and it still stands strong today. One of my favorite features is to be the Air Traffic Controler which a lot of games don't have. This can make you interact with other players. One of the features I was scared to use was the talk when I got the game. I was so scared to transmit on frequency however, this little press of a button can connect you with an amazing and funny community. It will sure give you many possibilities and drag you deeper into aviation.

Now onto the people that don't like aviation. You may disagree however with this game only costs £20, so give it a try. Come on! I mean it's one of the cheapest fight sim games out there. Not to mention, I only got this game because of a YouTuber. Now, I have had so many experiences. Also, the community can help you out.

To sum this up, FSX:SE is a great game. There is no other thing that is better than this legend game from what? 2006? THIS IS AMAZING. I mean yeah, the graphics might not be that good but seriously, 2006! I have to recommend this to everyone.

Before I end this I would like to say that everyone has different opinions. Personally, I enjoy playing this game and connecting with the community. You might not like to but again, that's your opinion! Even though you might be like: wow nice game. Landing on runways so fun. NOPE! You can land on buildings. I hope this Review helped you change your mind or encouraged you to buy this game and discover the depths of early aviation.

There are also many platforms that can make this experience better. For example discord with frequencies. The server is excellent, perfect and is run by a homeless person named Noah! (Jk Noah is a god! Server link: https://discord.gg/z5dCW34 ) Hope you join us :D!

I've played Flight Sims for quite a while, from Jane's Combat Simulator 1997, to Wing Commander I - IV and all of the WC's in-between, (At one point or another!) to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002.  Sad.  After a while, I upgraded from my Vintage Windows 95 Desktop, (Not as old as my old Packard-Bell 500 that got passed down to me from my Grandpa, but still a pre-historic beast to most youngsters out there!  Young being Ironic because I turned 20 just before the year 2018, haha!!) and I fell into a hole of First Person Shooters and Role-Playing Games.  

Contrary.  I know what you're thinking, but I say that in the reference that - although I LOVE most of the First Person Shooters and/or Role-Playing games that I have, so do not get me wrong.  Sentimental.  I just, for the longest time, was missing Simulator Games without even knowing it.  Excited.  But THIS, THIS brought me back!!

Controvercial.  I like Combat-Based, ""Fight the Bad Guy and Win"" games myself - leveling up my character by fighting the Empire, Dragons and other Evil Creatures in the Land of Skyrim, Building Spacecraft and Fighting on-foot in Empyrion, Interstellar Rift, and Space Engineers, and especially Co-op playing with my Friends on Starbound, my Steam Playername, Avatar Pick and where my current style of Speech (One word to describe my feelings before sepaking, which is really useful when you're texting someone and they'll only understand your joke if you say that you're being Sarcastic) on Steam comes from - but to be honest, I think that one of the absolute most challenging games to make is a game that is both absolutely amasing, is a Multiplayer game, and is designed around a theme of NO Violence.

Admirational.  It is so amazing that this game can revolve around subjects like professionalism, seriousness, communication, mathmatics, coordination, teamwork, physics, overall learning, observation, attentiveness, micro-maneuvering, and even (most) Trolling, instead of violence, killing, murder, self-defence, war, famine and death seen in at least some degree in 99% of popular games, yet still be one of the absolute best, most challenging and most rewarding Games ever to be created!!  Disclaimer.  Sure, Modiffications to this game exist and the ability to add these features are possible, not to mention already out there, but for the most part, the people who play this game are dedicated to it's primary objectives and overall appeal.  Motivational.  If there were more games like this out there, then I believe that this would still be a Gem among them.  

Recommending.  If this game isn't either on an installation disc in a box sitting next to your computer or in your Steam Library, then my biggest motivation to you all is to hit that button as fast as you can and add this baby to the cart!!  Motivational.  Even though there are still many people playing this game, there are so many more who I know will enjoy it.  Controvercial.  Granted, it is a much older game compaired to games like X-Plane 11 - which is $59.99 currently - but the truth is that it is remarkably similar, AND it's only $24.99!!  Extatic.

Every tweak that actually works has been applied to this version. You can spend many hours on different forums looking for ways to make it run smoother etc but take it from me (I've tried them all) this version is well optimised and the ""tweaks"" you may read on different forums don't do anything. Finally I would advise buying orbx scenery, its works beautifully with this version and looks fantastic. Start with the global base pack, you'll never go back.

-Basic to Advanced totourials to teach you how to get started
-A giant community that provided countless addons and experiences for the game
-A starting wide variety of planes to use

Cons:
-Sometimes confusing game directory for installing new files
-FPS can drop sometimes in random places, mostly in real-life weather chnages. (Could possibly be my computer)
-Would be nice to have a catalog of Free-ware addons

2,36777636,english,"Long-time FSX user here and I've made the jump to FSXSE. After playing it for 16 hours some observations, bear in mind everyones PC is different so your findings might well be very different:

(1.) Defenitely much more stable than FSX. Where FSX was CTDing this one doesnt
(2.) More FPS. In some places Im getting 15FPS more than in the identical location in FSX
(3.) Tweaking the fsx.cfg doesnt seem to make the huge difference it did in FSX, however there are still tweaks that help.
(4.) Many of your FSX addons will run on this sim. 
(5.) The age of the engine really shows and if you want it to look good you are going to need a 3rd party global texture because the defaults look horrible. Right out of the box this is where XPlane 11 really shines.
(6.) The LOD circle around the plane is small and blurries are very visible unfortunately. Reducing the visibility helps
(7.) Still the extremely clunky old FSX menus and GUI. Dovetail should have IMO updated these (like what P3D did)
(8.) You are still going to need a 3rd party global mesh if you want more terrain elevation accuracy - theres some nice free and paid ones out there
(9.) No more messing about with Activation codes and such if you have to resinstall
(10.) An internet connection is needed when you start the sim. But once youre up and running you dont need to keep the connection alive.

If you're a long time FSX user and dont fancy switching to XPlane 11, P3D or FSW then I highly recommend this. While its the same old engine under the hood they have made some tweaks here and there that do give some positive gains to the simming experience. 

If you spend some time tweaking the sims fsx.cfg + using 3rd party global textures &mesh + an ENB (or ReShade) you can end up with a very nice looking and stable sim.

One last tip - its best to keep this as the SOLE fsx sim on your system. If after playing aoround with FSXSE youre happy then get rid of the old FSX installation -  unless you have good reason not to (they can exist together no problems)  Remove every last trace of FSX, there are tools on the various simming sites that can help with this. The PMDG site has a good guide. You want every installer to only see FSXSE with no trace of FSX remaining.  My thinking is: why deal with what would be 2 fsx installations?

20,17619648,english,"UPDATE: Incompatible with Windows 10 latest update per DTG Support Flight Ticket ID: SOX-990-46312. Nov 2017
A rehash of MicroSoft's ancient, abandoned Flight Simulator X code.  Once a good game/simulation but limited to Directx 9 (never given the promised Directx 10) and does not do well adapted to Steam. Unreliable with very limited and sometimes unhelpful support.  Recomendation, wait until Dovetail gets a handle on this product or switches to a different engine and check then.
I'd have many more hours on FSX:SE if it would not crash, hoping support will eventually get around to fixing my problem)
Update: a kind steam user helped me fix the crash problem (Hooray) but loud buzz when applying brakes and printing flight plans fails... .. .
UPDATE: Finally got it to run, more or less, using these settings [1] No Directx 10 preview [2] No SLI. Also Microsoft dropped support for some graphic compression used by a lot 3rd party developers, some of whom are updating their models. And finally, using GPS navigation on Garmin 1000 goes haywire after a short while, making it useless for cross country navigation.
Another UPDATE: Cross-country navigation Gamin 1000 autopilot problem can be eased but not solved by setting simulate rate to unity during transitions and changing simulation rates while paused.
YET EVEN ANOTHER UPDATE: Late June FSX;SE has taken to hanging during launch, and therefore is unplayable. No help from support.

I've owned MS Flight Simulator '95 as well as MS Flight Simulator 2000. 

It's always been a funny piece of software. Clunky interface, but once you learn it reasonably powerful. I've never really used any other flight simulator... X-Plane looks good, but I'm used to MS FS. It's like an old jumper.

Many reviews mention add-ons. No doubt they would enhance the game in many ways, but I have always just played the vanilla version of the game as I haven't had time to muck around with add-ons. And the vanilla version is fine. 

I love the feeling of freedom in the game. You can fly to any airport anywhere on the globe. You can take in an ultralight trike off from an airport in the Netherlands, fly west over the North Sea to an oil rig, set the weather so there's a realistic breeze to land into, and float the little trike down onto a heli pad on the oil rig.

Or just take off from an island and runway-hop your way around exploring. 

In short, the game has always had a feeling of freedom, adventure, and very scalable levels of challenge.

Other aircraft add ons are a disappointment as well...had high hopes for the C-7 and DC-10 aircraft simulation but they had some major features missing that rendered them near impossible to fly in the instrument mode.

Also, MS developed the Boeing 777 in its FS...this aircraft should be added to the selection of aircraft available to FS.

The Steam FS could be really outstanding if the Steam folks would develop some working enhancements to the basic FS.

37,35482076,english,"If you’re wondering why there is a review for a game that has been out for almost ten years, it is because there is a new publisher, formed via a partnership between Microsoft and Dovetail Games, the developer of the highly successful Train Simulator series. Dovetail Games have taken over the franchise, made some fixes, and have released the newly titled, Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition onto Steam for the very first time.


FSXSE_review (1)

For the uninitiated, Flight Simulator X was the last game from Microsoft Game Studios to be developed back in 2006. An expansion pack was released in 2007, named Acceleration Expansion Pack. It added new planes, such as the F/A-18 jet fighter and the Red Bull stunt plane alongside new challenges and missions to take part in.

The game does a great job at teaching you how to fly within the game. There are great tutorials that cover different aircraft and different airports. There are also missions to take on, such as Search and Rescue and Red Bull Air Races. These give the game attitude and some neat ways to experiment with different vehicles. But you’ll probably have the most fun creating your own flight paths, weather conditions, time of day, and where to take off and land at. The game is a true sandbox allowing you to be your own pilot on many types of aircraft.

FSXSE_review (6)

At the time of release, Flight Simulator X  required a near supercomputer to run properly. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is much better than what was released 8 years ago. Dovetail Games has done some great work in getting the game to work on modern systems. As an owner of the original, boxed version, I ran them one after another, and FSX Steam Edition is far superior, allowing it to run at 60fps easily. After maxing the settings, I was getting 120fps without a problem.

The terms of the partnership deal do not allow for any graphical updates. So you should go into this knowing that it isn’t an HD remake, but rather just an update so that modern machines and operating systems can run the game. And with that, using Steamworks, allows for the game’s multiplayer to be updated and enhanced to talk to each other over modern connections. It is still the same great game from 8 years ago. But for anyone who has never played the game before, might be a little disappointed.

FSXSE_review (3)

FSX Steam Edition allows you to play multiplayer not just as a pilot, but on a server with hundreds of players. You can direct traffic in air-traffic controller position, be a pilot, or a co-pilot. There’s a racing mode that utilizes the Acceleration Expansion Pack, that is included here to do Red Bull Air Races with friends, and strangers alike. And the courses themselves have multiple difficulties and varying weather conditions.

There are over 24,000 of the world’s airports to take off and land on. All of it can take place in real-time, or a time of your choosing. Airports look busier, as AI now fills the runways with fuel trucks, baggage carts that make things feel less empty. It’s a small, but meaningful change to the game that makes things seem more lively.

FSXSE_review (4)

If Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition seems too outdated for you, then a new Flight Simulator from Deovetail will probably resemble what you’re looking for, and be worth waiting for.

60,13510952,english,"While I haven't had a chance to really dive into it fully yet, I can honestly say that this is a golden opportunity to play Flight Simulator X on current hardware. If you've ever been a fan of the Flight Simulator franchise from the recent years (Flight Sim '98, 2000 through 2004), FSX is basically the culmination of some of their best efforts.

Disclaimer: this game probably gives even modern gaming rigs today a run for their money with every single graphic option turned up to maximum. But with modern hardware (and even Surface Pro 3 tablets), those framerate-heavy moments hopefully won't steer you away from the fun to be had.

Of the things I've seen so far:

* Air traffic control is more integrated into the game than in FS2004
* Dynamic scenery by land, air, and sea
* Surprisingly cool special effects
* Really, REALLY good adventure/mission dynamics and experiences

I'll be paying attention to see how well add-ons integrate with this version of FSX. That should take care of some complaints of ""my town doesn't look that realistic"". (I took a flight over areas where I live and work, and major and regional roads are represented, so you can theoretically fly to a reasonably close proximity of your town.)

Sure, even a game like FSX has its shortcomings, but lack of scenery ""authenticity"" aside (they did a FANTASTIC job with stock scenery included), this is a world-class conversion and provision of the franchise.

Of course, it still has setbacks in the realism department and internal coding constraints like being stuck in 32-bit rather than 64-bit architecture remain.   A plus is, it runs on older computers which makes for a great nostalgic return down memory lane or if you're new to flight sims, makes for a great first low cost sim.

I dismantled an old joystick and used a potentiometer (axis) from it for homemade rudder pedals and I was able to easily program it to work as a rudder control, REALLY EASY! The missions are also a lot of fun too, with Tutorials and challenges. The Multiplayer is awesome (Apart from the microphone support, which isn't too good), you can fly with other players and do so much fun things!

[spoiler]]Read at risk of being triggered if you like FSX	[/spoiler]
[b]Since I have to give this a rating, I pick no, but if there was an option where I didn't have to, I wouldn't. Read on to find out why![/b]
There is no denying FSX [i]was[/i] a good flight simulator when it released. It has aged well, with a few exceptions. But as the years go by, FSX isn't what it used to be. The graphics have not aged well, and even with graphical mods, it is lacking compared to competitors such as PREPAR3D and XPlane-10/11. (albeit them being priced more than double FSX's modest $25) However, if you are willing to look past the graphics, and your budget is lower, go for it. Graphics and features do matter in a flight sim, however, so if your budget allows, I would suggest, as I said above, XPlane or another sim. I would give this a so-so rating. Based on your idea of this game, and your budget, you decide.

The physics engine is also decent, many times I try to do a long climb in a 747 and usually I stall and have to pull out of it. As far as the graphics go the default ones look like fs2004 but I think that's good because If I take off from a small airport like Portland, Maine the fps is pretty smooth. The game is also cheaper than x-plane 11 and all aircraft have great controllabillity with a mouse.  Also to note is that in free flight you can change the livery of an aircraft by checking the ""show all versions"" box.

Overall, for my first true flight sim this was pretty good, the only thing I think thats bad about the game is the hordes of dlc that costs more than the base game.

PMDG, quality wings, and captain sim aircrafts are the only addons I personally would recommend (and to those who want more and better aircraft). Other addons in the steam store are not the best. Graphics wise, they are not the best but its the simulation of a captains role that counts, however bad graphics can ruin the experience, so if u would want better graphics, the REX 4 Texture Direct addon would be the best for runways, weather, taxiways, etc. Better ground/mesh textures that's FTX global's job. If you want more realistic airports... well those are addons too, such as flytampa addons and FSdream team addons (they're usually worth it) and if you want to take your simulation to the next level with live ATC and where YOU give readbacks and request things from the ATC, get VATSIM. It's free, proffensional, however the rules are very VERY strict. Other than that all the sim needs when you first get it, is better aircraft(s), good texture addon(s), and VATSIM.

EDIT: In July 2017 I switched to XPLANE-11 (I didn't purchase it through steam). I was just tired of constantly having to pay hundreds of dollars for aircraft and for good quality scenery. (Yes I have purchased Prepar3d as well). Xplane-11 has amazing scenery fresh out of the box, and for $60, it's incredible. And most addon scenery and plugins are FREE and of payware quality. Xplane really is an amazing simulator, I really don't understand the hype about P3D v4, Xplane-11 has beat FSX and P3D and many ways EXCEPT for one thing. And that's addon aircraft. Many developers like PMDG, do not make aircrafts like their 747, 777, and 737 series for Xplane. And because of that, people stay with MSFX or P3D. 

But for those of you that are interested in some of the available aircraft for Xplane, here you go:
Flight Factor 767 (Study-level, highly recommend) 
Flight Factor 757 (Study-level, highly recommened)
Jardesign A320 (Don't consider purchasing this)
Jardesign A330 (You can consider purchasing this, but I don't recommend)
JRollon CRJ-200 (Recommend, but default sounds are trash)
Flight Factor A350 (Meh, if you want it, buy it)
Carenado aircraft (Isn't that different from FSX and P3D, even has extra features I think)
Airfoil Labs Cessna 172 (YES)
IXEG 737 Classic series (BEST ADDON, but hella expensive)

Those are just SOME, there are still many freeware aircraft and more GA addon aircraft, FSX and P3D are good if you have money. Average cost of the aircraft listed above is around $60-70. This was not meant to be an XPLANE review but I am just trying to prevent somebody from buying FSX or P3D and hating it.

And notice that I am not comparing the two simulators themselves, (I am only comparing the scenery and addons, NOT THE EXPERIENCE) as XPLANE and FSX based simulators are completely different simulators and unique in their own way.",1460593741,1503888757,True,8,0,0.596239566802978516,0,True,False,False,76561198149864456,36,5,35441,0,31457.0,1485109610,,

Although the code for this game dates back to 2006, most modern computers will have a difficult time running this game smoothly at any sort of high settings. FSX is a VERY CPU intensive program. Anything less than an i7 @ 4.0ghz is  probably a waste of time, or will require a serious compromise in your expectations of game performance. 
If you have a dual drive setup, make sure to install fsx on the drive that does not have windows installed on it.
A good, higher end graphics card is manditory(gtx1080),  as is a healthy amount of ram, at least 8gb of  ddr4, however the cpu will always be the choke point in your system for this game. 
 Even at max  settings, vanilla fsx won't impress you graphically by todays standards, but when you consider what the game is acheiving, then it is doing a fine job for  what it is. Adding things like Orbx, and REX texture addons can drastically improve the look and immersion of the world, although the price of those addons may seem too steep for some, and will come down to a personal 'cost/return' decison. 
 I started with flight sims in 2007, and never really had a computer that would run the program smoothly at anything over medium-low settings. Today I have a system that will run most modern games at 100+fps maxed out, and I can just acheive 30-90fps in FSX now with all sliders maxed out. Large cities however, with lots of traffic, will cause significant fps drops, espcially while on the ground.
 It is possible to run the game with a lesser system, but perfomance will vary wildly depending on pc specs, and game settings. It usually leads to a frustrating, 'settings tweaking loop' in search of better performance, rather than enjoying the game.
 I recommend it, but ONLY if you have a system that will run it correctly.",1502623069,1502623069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198411006214,8,1,1839,0,687.0,1598109471,,

58,34071179,english,"If you have been a fan of flight simulation for some time, then you’ll no doubt be aware of just how effective the Microsoft Flight Simulator series has been over the years. It’s become the absolute staple of flight simulation quality and realism for many years and is one of the flagship Microsoft gaming products. The most recent release, Flight Simulator X, was hugely received at the time and quickly established itself as the key player within the flight simulation industry. 
If you’ve never played a flight simulator then before then FSX: Steam Edition is just what you are looking for. However, if you’ve previously spent time using these simulators then you’ll be probably wondering just what the reason for buying this again would be. After all, if you’ve been building up a huge collection of add-ons and DLC for the original FSX, do you really need to install the new one?

We want to take a look at the new features and help users decide if the latest re-release of FSX is really worth your time and money. If you’ve already got the original edition then it might be worth reading on as you’ll be able to find out just what has actually changed from FSX and FSX: Steam Edition.

For anyone who has never taken on the joy of flight simulation before, though, you’ll find all the help that you need in deciding if this seems like the kind of experience that you would enjoy. Flight simulation is quite a niche entertainment subject so it’s not uncommon for people to find it a little bit too realistic or overly challenging – this review will let you see just how in-depth the process goes, and whether or not it’s going to be suitable for you.
Key Features

Changes 

Arguably the most integrated flight simulation experience that there is – despite being released in 2006, this simulator still more than holds its own in 2015

High-end graphics and attention to detail ensures that you have a flight simulator that not only performs well and is hugely realistic, but it looks absolutely fantastic whilst doing so

A huge amount of selections in terms of aircraft – covering all shapes and sizes, you’ll find a massive collection of aircraft to pick from that follow realistic planning and statistics so that you can fly the aircraft just as you would in the real world

Hugely realistic in that it gives you as much control as it possibly can from within the cockpit for each aircraft. You’ll have control over just about everything that you could possibly need to make a safe and simple flight

Massive attention to detail for each and every aircraft in the game – no longer will you feel like you are flying an imitation, with ever aircraft bringing its own personality to the table. Enhance your flight experience and your development as a pilot with this excellent flight simulator

A thriving community that has released thousands of high-end DLC and mods – you’ll be able to pick up just about any aircraft you can think of, and use it in stunning detail and intricate realism!

Made to improve your overall flight comprehension as well as enjoy yourself, FSX: Steam Edition comes with a wealth of extra modes that you can enjoy including a multiplayer section

Included in this modes is a 50-mission campaign mode that lets you do plenty of unique tasks and take on various roles from your aircraft – you can literally play these over and over again, for countless hours, and see a unique situation almost every time!

Based on real-life flight, you’ll be learning the same kinds of tricks that a real pilot would. To balance this, the simulator is extremely punishing – if you are looking for a challenge to your flight credentials and to see if you are good enough to fly, this is it

A huge selection of editing tools so that you can make your own aircraft and edit the world as you see fit

Fully working online mode so that you can take on your friends in competitive flight, and prove who the best pilot is!

Overall, FSX is a bit of a conundrum. It brings lots of positive features to the table and makes sure that you’ll be able to start becoming a better and more enjoyable pilot. It’s a big improvement over the original edition of the game and makes it much easier to get to grips with, and therefore actually enjoy.

However, does it actually change enough to warrant a full-price purchase if you already own FSX and its assorted mods? This is where perspective needs to come in, and you need to decide whether or not having better performance and online features is worth the cost.",1502062587,1502062587,True,12,2,0.611001968383789063,0,True,False,False,76561198137706787,83,5,40565,0,32976.0,1587946433,,

It will take up the majority of your day playing (but I'm sure you know that) Graphics are pretty bad unless you are willing to pay for better ones and all the default aircraft are not very realistic, but I'm not saying that these are bad things. I started off playing FSX:SE with 0 prior knowledge of flight simulation and now I have over 500 hours and counting of game time! Within a few days or even hours you can be flying anywhere in the world! I do suggest getting some FREE addon aircraft at first such as a more realistic 737-800 and airbus a320 family they are normally the easiest aircraft to fly and get a hang off, after a while I bought the Aerosoft a320 bundle and to be honest the FPS isn't the best as it's such a complex addon but you will need to get used to it. As I mentioned before the ground textures and graphics could be better but again you get used to it after a while and if it annoys you that much that the grass is a little funny looking you can always buy new ground textures from the steam store or a 3rd party website (3rd Party websites are normally better, they have a larger variety) The Multiplayer aspect is OKAY to say the least most people in that are new or are just messing around so if you want to play realistically with others go on servers such as VATSIM or IVAO etc. So overall Flight Simulator X: Steam edition, well it's a good starter Flight simulator and will do MOST people fairly well but there is some issues, granted there not major ones but none the less issues, if I would recommend getting this or X-plane 9 or P3D for example is debatable so really if you have some spare money sitting around I would give it a shot, who knows you may love it!",1497204258,1501969211,True,10,2,0.594650804996490479,0,True,False,False,76561198175619339,9,6,327404,24,44311.0,1601144028,,

Granted, it is still the basic mesh you'd find in FS9, but I think MS did some great work somewhat accuratly mapping the road systems, specifically the highways. Still a great game in opinion. 

However, I would not buy this game from Steam and that is my only gripe with this purchase. I should have just installed my disc version. THe Steam version is buggy and not as spectacular as the normal disc version and not as immersive I don't think. THere is a lot of advertising in your face and that is somewhat irritating. Personally, if I wanted to purchase addons, I'd go to a FlightSim online store myself and do it.

Another thing I can't stand, and probably THE most irritating thing about the game is the incredible use of the CPU. I use ARX Control from Logitech and it monitors everything about the computer in terms of RAM, GPU and CPU usage. This game is undoubtedly the most CPU intensive game I have in my library. Nothing else I play uses anywhere near the CPU usage as this game. I use an AMD FX-4300 @ 3.8GHz. Not the top of line by any means, but also not terrible. It performs well anywhere else. This has got to be something to do with the Steam version. I don't not remember having this issue in the past anywhere. I just wanted to say that.

This is ultimately an old game and these images are only representative of the visual fidelity in a few cherry-picked areas. Outside of these areas (about 99% of the rest of the world), your scenery will be generic, flat, empty and barely recognisable as anything that you might know.

If you want visuals that won't make your eyes bleed and might actually represent places with which you're familiar,  be prepared to spend a lot of money on terrain files and imagery to bring things up to anything approaching an acceptable level. In fact, in FSX generally, expect to spend a lot of money on third-party addons if you want to flesh things out. I can't give a personal opinion, but if you're in the market for a new flight simulator I have seen a lot of people enthusing about X-Plane 11. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't have a massive downer on FSX and I'm not saying there is inherently bad about it.... I just don't believe that this game/simulator is the product that it appears to be on the steam store page. FSX had its day a few years ago now.

1.Detail gameplay and Mechanic truly LOVE this simulation games GOOD JOB on every aspect...and 90% chance you cant get off the ground safely and so complicated keyboard things like DCS and other Flight Simulator on PC

You can purchase addons, which will add alot more realism, however i woul suggest to buy those addons from third party sellers such as A2A, PMDG, Aerosoft and others. Do not buy any addon from Dovetail, they suck! XD.. no seriously there are a lot of websites where you can purchase FSX addons. The problem: Theyre reeeeaally expensive .. soo yea you should have a passion for aviation. otherwise this is nothing for you. Once you got some addons its a fun, challenging expirience. Also if you want to fly online then DONT do the FSX-Multiplayer on steam. its full of trolls and children. There are two third party networks: IVAO & VATsim which are great in terms of online flying. They even have humans as ATC (air traffic control) and you can submit a ATC-training for yourself in order to become a controller on one of those networks. So yea ... if you bought the game, if youre looking for realistic flight expiriences then:

-dont buy addons here, go to: simmarket.com (and some other sites)
-dont play multiplayer on steam, look for a network such as: https://www.ivao.aero/ or https://www.vatsim.net/
-you'll need a decent joystick!
-you'll have to have some time and patience to learn some tricky things
-you'll need a big wallet because addons are quite expensive (~100€ for one decent aircraft)

0,32853675,english,"Disclaimer: I am not a real world pilot. I know very little, almost nothing about aircraft. I am simply a game and play FS for fun, so my review will be from the point of view of a gamer, not of a pilot, not of an ATC.

I have been a fan of the Flight Simulator series for a while now. My first game of the series was actually Combat Flight Simulator 1, which, I believe, was made on the FS98 engine. That game brought my attention to many things I look for in a flight sim, namely the possibility to customize and mod your game by adding custom and edited aircraft and scenery. My first actual FS game was FS2004, although I did play a lot of FS2002 as well. I have been playing FS 2004 until now when I finally decided to get FSX on Steam.

When FSX was released, it was a mess, honestly. Very heavy game that no PC back  then could even hope to run properly, and since the FS2004 mod community was so rich, there was simply no reason to move to it. As years passed, this changed. Although the performance of FSX is still far from perfect (specially due to the limitations of being a 32-bit game), this game is the most acessible flight simulation game for casuals and amateurs, while still offering possibilities for professionals as well. I believe when it comes to simulation and physics, X-Plane is a better option. However, FSX has an unbeatable mod community, and the most important part, it is THE game to use if you wanna fly online. Now, I'm a more casual player and usually play on small free flight servers but, if you are really serious about flying, you'll consider joining IVAO or VATSIM and play in a very serious and dedicated community of flight simulation enthusiasts. And if you want to do that, you'll need FSX (or FS2004 if you so happen to own that gem).

Now, about mods and DLCs. I don't really recommend the ones available for purchase on Steam, because there are much better you can get out there. Many good ones are free (the ones I usually stick to, because as a more casual player they fit my needs just fine), and the better ones, while quite expensive, are amazingly well done. I think the best example is the PMDG Boeing 737. It is as close as you can get to a real 737's cockpit.

About joysticks: I have yet to acquire a flight stick (I play with a PlayStation 2 controller), but it is necessary if you want to really play this game seriously. An Xbox gamepad can do the trick if you are just flying for fun, but a flight stick not only offers much more realistic and precise controls, but also bigger immersion. You ABSOLUTELY need at least a gamepad though: playing this on keyboard and mouse is a nightmare, and honestly, MS has done a great job of making it at least playable on keys+mouse, considering how difficult this genre is.

Vanilla FSX can be pretty boring, so there are some mods I would like to recommend to make this game really fun:

1. FSPassengers. If you are going to play singleplayer and more 4fun, FSPassengers can turn this game from just a sandbox flying game to a airline simulator, where you need to manage your company and make airline flights with passengers in them. It gives you a goal and objective in game which is something I appreciate a lot. I think it is a somewhat expensive mod, but certainly worth the money.

2. PFPX: not actually a mod fo FSX itself but rather a tool for flight planning. FSX's flight planner is usually enough for casual players like me, but if you want to make a realistic flight plan (and those are necessary to fly on VATSIM), you'll need this tool. It allows you to create professional quality flight plans, very similar to those used in the real world. Amazing for increasing your roleplaying fun. If you want a free option, SimBrief can do the job.

3. REX - Real Environment Extreme: This is a heavy mod so you'll need a beefy PC to use it. It changes all the weather effects, clouds, day/dusk/night illumination, etc to high quality, and improves the real world weather and dynamic weather features of FSX. Very good mod. 

4. As many scenery mods as yo ucan possibly install
Photorealistic grounds, amazingly crafted 3d addons... They really bring the world to life, making the scenery beautiful to fly at.

5. Your favorite aircraft. The aircraft that come with the game are pretty boring. You'll want to add more variety ASAP.

Let me tell you this, the FPS is x20000000000 times better compared to the standalone version. In the standalone version I had 30-50 fps, in this version I've got over 100 consistently. Moreover, I flew the f-18's (which are usually very fps intensive) and managed to get a good solid 70 fps out of it. All in all, the steam version honestly blew my mind in that asppect of things before I even got to actually play the game properly.

When I did hop into multiplayer, the microphones used in game were very choppy and stuttery. I asked people to get on Teamspeak so that we could do shared cockpit flight together and that's exactly what we did. We flew from San Fransisco to Los Angeles, flew around Saint Martin's and did a bunch of other things and genuinely had a fantastic time together.

Where this game does shine though is the multiplayer which is still active today, with dozens of active servers, some of them with up to 50 players online at once, usually because of Virtual Airlines which uses mods to give the most realistic experience in learning how to be a pilot working for a ""clan"" of players to earn money and build a fleet of planes.

So yes fsx from box is uggly, old and full of bug but if you get the right add'ons, time, and really feel and enjoy flying so fsx will be amazing.

In comparison, i got fsw and just removed it. I am still on fsx and I'm still really  flying with it and able to see what i really see in the real world when flying. 

In one word : it's the only game i play  with, and since fs in 1990. Why? Because it's still the most flexible, upgradable today. You absolutely can do what you want with it.

I have spent quite some time playing flying games, not necessarily simulators, but flying based games. When I launched it, I noticed that something was up with the interface of the main menu. It was glitchy and instantly gave some negativity to the game, as it was not visially appealing. 
Moving on to the tutorials, they were thoroughly explained, but still somehow failed to introduce the player to the game. It was difficult to graps the words of the ""speaker"" in the tutorial, and the controls were overall to complicated for a keyboard user.
As said in the previous sentence, the controls for keyboard users were terrible and impossible to remember. It took me over two hours to start a 747. If you do want to play the game, it is almost mandatory to have a joystick or at least a controller. If you are a keyboard user, do not even bother. 
Overall, the game has a good idea and can be fun to play for experienced players of real-life flight simulators, but rookies like me have no chance in having fun.

When i found this game on steam, i really had to get it by the fact that i've already played it a lot as a little child back in the days. The game itself, which was published in 2006 as far as i know, is quite one of the most or even the most popular flight simulator and that's for a good reason!
- First of all the Simulator itself is pretty cheap ( comming back to the addons later ) 
- It's perfect to use on every skill level
- Bunch of mods
- Big community ( when it comes to flight simulations ) 
- Structured and funny missions to learn how to fly in the simulator 
- A big Wikipedia about airplanes and stuff like that
- Working multiplayer
- Many default airports / aircraft / scenary ... 
- Gigantic world

Negative Aspects: 
- The game always decreases the volume of other running programs on your computer ( like skype does [ i didnt find a way to fix it so far ] )
- The games physics are not really realistic further not challanging enough for experienced pilots
- The game is unplayable without addons, unless you just want to play it for ""flying arround a bit"". If you really want to become experienced in flying ( via simulations [!] ) you will need extra addons, which wouldn't be such a problem, if most of the good plugins weren't payware. But why would you need addons? 
First of all, the default aircraft really shows the age of the game. according to that, you will see undetailed cockpits and only the most important instruments are working, which is a pitty because the FMC ( boardcomputer ) is not part of them.  In addition to that the graphics of the game are not good ( for a simulator ( especially one from 2006 ) it's quite impressive ) so you will need extra graphic addons ( Lighting, clouds, soundpacks, airports,  ... ) and many more (You can pay up to several hunred or even thousend euros but dont have to!). 

[h1] conclusion [/h2] 
Despite all of the negative apsects, in my opninon the fsx is an old game legend. For a price of ~ 22€ ( in sales 5€ - 7€[ Germany 2017] ) this game is definitely worth trying, especially when getting started into flight simulating ( you shouldn't start with expensive simulators as X plane without any knowledge ), but also for just enjoying your childhoods game or seeing a 2006 simulator.

It's a simulator, and as such it does many things very well, except maybe ""quick and easy fun dogfight shooting"" and up-to-date graphics.

I especially like the following features: First among all, aviation (not just flying) is simulated -- air traffic control leads you to your glideslope, ground operators supervise taxiing, all with actual voices and flexible reactions to your situation. Then, all important navigation aspects for instrument flight rules are covered (VOR,NDB,DME,ILS etc). Next, the airplanes have working fly-by-wire systems (e.g. the Airbus 321 goes ""TO/GA"" when stalling) and the autopilot systems are functional -- but sometimes also a bit buggy, sadly. The flight models seem okay -- as not being a pilot I can hardly say how good they are actually, but common sense seems to be that they're not that bad, and landscapes and airports, even small airstrips, all around the world are covered. The graphics is not ultra-realistic (quite bad some times when being very low), but it's acceptable for the purpose.

So, if you want to learn about the details of airplane flying, navigation, communication and procedures, this is a relatively cheap entry point in comparison to other simulators (which have their advantages and disadvantages). If you want some arcade action, this is simply the wrong genre. Don't buy it then.

Now to Oculus Rift / VR support: With the FlyInside extension (currently around $30), you can sit in your cockpit and enjoy flying in VR. That works pretty well, but has some requirements. First, get some flight equipment, like a decent joystick with lots of configuarable buttons and a throttle. I use a Saitek X52 pro and it works well. Remember: Keyboard, Mouse and external flight instruments (Saitek offers some) become invisible with a headset on. ;) Second, take a lot of time to configure everything to suit your needs.

FlyInside also allows you to handle cockpit buttons and knobs by looking at them (you get a cursor like in Oculus Home) and you can assign an action-button to select things. This is okay for some parts of the cockpit (toggles and switches), not so good for tuners and knobs where you need to set a value, especially when you need to be quick. So, your joystick really should have some ""scroll wheels"", turning knobs, sliders and stuff to get things comfortable.

Additionally, you can handle things with touch controllers, but believe me, in the current state of FlyInside you probably don't wanna do this. Not all buttons react as expected, hitting them with a gesture is difficult and you loose some fine control over virtual throttles, yokes or sticks.

When it comes to menus or additional windows (ATC, GPS, etc), FlyInside has a very good concept: They ""capture"" those windows from the screen and put them as moveable/resizeable 3d panes into your virtual cockpit. You can use the eye curser and select things just like with your mouse. You can also use FSX's main menu (the white one when you launch FSX), as FlyInside pauses the sim and shows your desktop as a 3d screen in VR on demand. By that, you never have to take of the VR goggles.

If you have a VR headset, I can highly recommend FSX+FlyInside. Works very well, and being ""in a cockpit"" is much more fun than sitting in front of a monitor that just displays a cockpit.",1497365457,1497365761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198141830004,111,25,16077,0,9903,1527180373,,

80,32338085,english,"Recommended for newbies; Not recommended for today's expectations.

I'm not qualified to write this, but I feel that in terms of experience, this is the benchmark the flight sim market minimally ought to follow. I have some hundreds of hours on FSX before owning the Steam copy, and I find that FSX comes off as cheap but relevant and working, however is quickly becoming a failing ""gold"" standard.

FSX is beginner-friendly, but also at least meets some needs of experienced sim/IRL pilots without burning a hole in wallets. There's a good reason why this software is what got many aviation enthusiasts into the hobby, and that is accessability.

The controls are responsive, while flight models and physics are alright offline. Although not recommended, the mouse/keyboard control scheme works. As of this writing, I'm using a X360 controller which work great with FSX, while saving up for a full Saitek set up that I hope will be a great investment. (Bleeping Flying Spaghetti Monster, those rudder pedals are expensive!) [strike]The set up will be for another software tho lol [/strike]

If you don't mind outdated netcode and multiplayer support, you might still find some fun in multiplayer. Don't be surprised finding passenger aircrafts somehow hovering above an airport. That seem to occur every now and then.

That being said, if you *really* don't mind some immersion being broken, FSX is overall a good [strike](imitation)[/strike] realistic flight sim, minus the same boring landscapes covering almost the whole Earth. At least the aerodome locations are accurate. If you have some budget to spare, go ahead and purchase some of the scenary DLCs.

It's a shame that FSX does not age well with improving hardware. After more than a decade since its inception, we have found that its performance did not scale along. The same loading/caching/occlusion isssues still remain. There are some occasional stutters and awful crashes (both plane and software lol). Some planes still have oversized hitboxes!

27,31914221,english,"Flight Simulator X (more commonly known as FSX by it’s users) was Microsofts’ latest offering in their long line of Flight Sim software.  Despite it being the latest, FSX is now over ten years old with it’s original European version having been released on October 13 2006. Since it’s inception, FSX has seen two Service Pack updates (known as SP1 and SP2) and an the ‘Acceleration’ Expansion.  In 2014, Microsoft signed a licencsing deal with Dovetail Games who then took over development of the software.

Once Dovetail Games received the licence in 2014, they wasted little time in identifying an opportunity to increase the gaming audience of FSX and, later that year, released it Steam as FSX:Steam Edition, incorporating both of the service pack updates and the Accerleration Expansion.  

As far as gameplay and graphics quality go, it’s a software that’s now ten years old and, to an extent, that should give you an idea of what you’re likely to experience when you load up and take your first flight into the unknown.  There are other, newer, flight simulator products out there that carry much higher quality graphics and therefore offer a better ‘immersion’ into the experience.  But on the flip-side of that statement, FSX:SE does provide a relatively inexpensive way to get into flight simming.

Gameplay itself in FSX is, by and large, still as competent now as it was at release.  Stock aircraft that come with the software are plenty varied (everything from passenger airlines and prop craft to gliders and helicopters) and adequate to get going.  If you're new to flight simulators, a large and detailed range of lessons are available to help you understand basic flight dynamics and how to use the systems in the range of offered aircraft.  There’s also a wide range of ‘missions’ that you can undertake, which range from simple take-off, fly for 15 minutes and land missions to racing P-51 Mustangs and performing oil rig transports.

Where FSX really noses ahead of the crowd in terms of it’s competitors are the huge range of freeware and payware addons that are available.  There are so many addons, downloads and expansions out there that you will literally need two lifetimes to try absolutely everything.  I’ve heard, more than once, my fellow virtual airline colleagues who use Prepar3D or X-Plane state that they aren’t able to access a particular aircraft model because no one has developed it.  If variety is the spice of life, then FSX is very, very spicy!

On a technical note, some areas of FSX have been plagued with issues resulting in software crashes and Out of Memory (OOM) problems and I've heard a number of my simming friends compain of such issues, even with high end rigs.  However, this can sometimes be related to the number and variety of addons that are added to the software, rather than the software itself.

Pros:
- Relatively inexpensive compared to other flight sims
- Insanely wide range of potential addons (free and payware)
- Good introductory lessons for those new to flying

Cons:
- Standard graphics are a little dated (can be improved with addons)
- Has been known to crash and have OOM errors more than we'd probably like
- Can be system resource intensive",1495528493,1495528493,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,76561198157565189,44,1,95293,0,57894,1523399227,,

Positive:
Many landmarks all over the world
Lots of planes
Very good ATC
Good In-Game map
Good weather editor
Ingame flight planning options
Missions and Training sessions
Great cloud graphics
4 seasons
Active multiplayer
Good AI traffic
You recognize places like Los Angeles, which is not the case in x-plane
Most of the time flying in FSX environment feels nicer and more comfortable, while xplane-11 cities dont look like the real cities and dont look good but they look realistic, more accurate and detailed instead. 
Lots of available third party addons

Negative:
bad performance on average PCs, you cant max out the graphics without FPS loss
generally old graphics engine is very old, unsharp, the auto-gen, the terrain rendering on long distance etc
The PFD has a low refresh rate, which is especially annoying when you do instrumental flights
Some planes seem to be taken over from FS2002 and look bad inside, for example the default 747 cockpit is very bad
No FMC on default planes

==============================
(1). Old game engine. Game engine  seems to run on 2 of 8 available CPU threads. Low FPS (14-20) at 1080p in City areas even with a high spec gaming PC. 
(2). Only supports Preview DX10 which is unfinished and gives rendering errors - my main issue is Road Lights which look like black 8 pointed Stars. 
(3). The game looks pretty old and some basic landmarks are missing. To improve this you need to buy a texture pack. They are expensive. 
(4). Crossfire will not engage in DX9. Crossfire will engage in Preview DX10, however it does not help because the Game Engine itself sems only to run non 2 threads, not all 8.  
 
Details: 
======
I just bought this on Sale on Steam. 
I used to play MicroSoft Flight Simulator years ago ~ around end 2001 on an AMD Athlon 64 based PC. 
I have some real world flying experience as a pilot (learning to fly a light aircraft, never completed the Pilot's Licence because I could not afford to complete the course at the time). 
I wanted to find out how much Flight Simulators have improved today. 

I had read reviews of Modern Flight Simulators available for PC today and this was recommended along with XPLANE-11.  
I really cannot see why this was recommended as a Modern Flight Simulator at all. 
It should be even cheaper than the sale price.  It is very outdated. 
It does not seem to have improved that much in single player mode since Flight Simulator 2002 (end 2001) running on an AMD Athlon 64 based PC, in fact, I still have the PC and I feel could have just run this game on it instead. 

Seriously this just looks so old and outdated in comparison to a real 2017 title. 
I used to fly (pilot) for real out of one airport that is available on this game and It looks nothing much like the area, with very well known landmarks missing completely.
In some places you can see the main road with cars driving straight through buildings which are planted in the middle of the road. Ridiculous but it did give me a laugh I guess. 

One other point, Steam is usually really easy to use for me. 
I buy the game, I install the game, and generally I just run the game with no problem. 
This thing took me about two hours and two install and verify attempts
just to get running because of a really stupid requirement. 
You have to run Steam itself as Administrator before this game will run. 

I normally do not write negative reviews, but I feel in this case there is nothing much really to say that is very positive at all if you look for a Modern Flight Simulator.

Some positive things I can think of: 

(1). One thing I can think of is it it looks and flys like the game did many years ago, with admittedly higher resolution and some graphical improvement at playable framerates. 

If you are into Retro Gaming and you do not have your old machine still running, and you have fond memories of playing Microsoft  Flight Simulator 2002 or later, then this game is for you. 

However. 

Regarding running the game with higher graphical settings. 

I tested this game on a 1920x1080 resolution. 
I have an i7-4770K (4 core 8 thread)  with Single R9 Nano FuryX active in this game review.
(I have Two R9 Nano FuryX's installed but have not tried to run the game in Crossfire yet).
Thats a reasonably high spec gaming machine, even for today. 

The CPU is running at stable +16% OC and the R9 Nano FuryX's are running at +5% stable OC target on the GPU Clock, with Fan and Temp and Power Targets maxed out. 

I am able to run the game with all visual settings maxed out and in that case it does look better than the game from end 2001. Even then though, things like water in harbors are completely static, no waves in the water etc.  In this case, even with a powerful Gaming CPU, GPU and running overclocked the Frame Rate drops to 14 FPS on a single monitor at 1920*1080p resolution. I wanted to run it on a Triple 1980*1080p Eyefinity Monitor Setup at the very least. 

I need to check what is going on exactly, probably the game can only run on 1 core. 
---> Checked. 
i7-4770K = 4 CPU cores with 2 threads per core = 8 threads in total ( 8 Logical CPUs).   
It looks like the FSX game launcher and background tasks max out 1 logical CPU (thread)  and the Game simulation itself max out two other logical CPU's (threads). The remaining 5 logical CPU's (threads) have some low level / uneven activity.   

Some more  positive points to consider. 

(2). The planes are very easy to fly using the mouse or keyboard mode, unlike the experience I had with XPLANE-11 demo in the past. It looks great but on previous Demo I just found it too hard to fly with the keyboard alone.

But this may be because SFX is like a cross between a simulator and an arcade game versus a XPLANE-11 which seems to be attempting more of a real simulator experince using a special Flight Controller. 

More positive points I can think of about FSX. 

(3). You can get some nice screenshots, provided you are high enough altitude so you dont see how simple the buildings on the ground look. 

Perhaps I need to look at other features in FSX like a DLC pack, and MultiPlayer but I think I have been as fair as I can be in this feedback so far based on Single Player and Initial Install experience. 

If you are into Retro Gamning and want to play Microsoft Flight Simulator from 2002 or later  then this is definitely for you. From that perspective it is nice that this game is still running and available on Steam. I think it is good that old games/code get preserved for future use. 

If you look for a Modern Flight Simulator though, do yourself a favour and  buy something else.
This game seems to be pretty much MicroSoft Flight SimulatorX 2006 ported to Steam + new DLC with more planes / higher texture maps on DLC.  

I have not asked for a refund from Steam yet as I am going to see if running the game with a Pair of R9 Fury X's in Crossfire or running it with an i7-4790K and a Pair of R9 Nano FuryX's will allow me to play at over 30FPS on Maxed out Graphics Settings at 1920*1080p.

---> Update. If you have a highend GPU like an R9 Nano (FuryX),  Crossfire will not help the FrameRate on FSX:SE. 

(A). Crossfire will not turn on at all in DX9 Mode on FSX:SE. 
(B). Crossfire will turn on in ""Preview"" DX10 Mode. Total CPU Utilisition jumps from 55% to 73%.
(C). On this game at least, turning on Crossfire make things worse in the toughest areas of the simulation where you need it.  I have lots of experience running Crossfire on this machine and on most modern titles that support Crossfire it runs well and will provide up good FPS Scaling increase.  

The increase in CPU Utilisation turning Crossfire on is not unexpected.  However the problem is when you turn on Crossfire the Frame Rate will increase which will push up the load on the logical CPU's which are used to run the Game / Simulator. In FSX:SE only two logical CPUs run the simulator and they already run with very high utilization with Crossfire turned off. What I see when I turn Crossfire on is the additional loading due to  Crossfire processes is split off to the remaining 5 logical CPU, 1 logical CPU is already maxed out for the Game Loader and Settings interface at  around 90-100% utilisation. The remaining two Logical CPU Cores jump to 100% Utilization all the time. This results in CPU halting/CPU speedstep kicking in. 


 I want to look at the CPU Utilization Profile and see if I can get it running on Triple Eyefinity setup as well. 

---> Update: Yes, Triple Eyefinity works fine, no Drop in FPS seen in this case with Crossfire off. 
I can run it at 6016X1080p, but the FPS is in 14-20 range. 
I think the reason I cannot increase the FPS is because the simulator engine seems to run on only two threads (Logical CPU's) with an additional thread for the Game Launcher/UI. 

That 's it for this review for now.

Sorry but I cannot recommend this as a Modern Flight Simulator.

That being said, FSX:SE is not without its faults, and is a particular nuisance when it comes to third-party hardware and software. Certain errors that were present in the original version of FSX are still present in FSX:SE, which further highlights that this is basically a re-launch of the original 2006 game.

If you dont own any version of FS yet, I would highly reccomend this game. It runs well on high settings on my 5 year old potato and functioning multiplayer is definitely worth it. In the case you own the original boxed FSX, I would advise you to think about buying this full price. Take into account the amount of free- and payware addons you own and that some may not work in FSX:SE.

Now on to my review, lol: 

I am little late to the game but I had to post how EXTREMELY pleased I am with the Steam version of FSX. Dovetail really did a good job working out all of the kinks. I have been trying to run the FSX boxed version since it was released. Bought more powerful computers and still have never been able to run FSX successfully. And successfully means flying a whole route from gate to gate without crash. Ive always foind myself tweaking the settings and searching the internet to figure our how to get it right... Because surely Microsoft wouldnt release a product that only works on some systems right?! Well i never got it to work. I have been flying on FS9 instead which is VERY stable. The problem? None of the latest and greatest addons are compaitable with FS9. Grrr

Enters FSX-SE

I have done several long distance flights this past week without one crash or hang up and frame rates are awesome. All of MY addons are compatable. I have several payware airports and payware planes, all work without a problem. If you are still having issues with your boxed version of FSX or find yourself constantly tweaking the settings to get somewhat optimal flying performance then you should give Steam version a go. You will be pleased! There is not much if anything different visually between the boxed and SE except framerates. So if you are NOT having a problem with the boxed version, you can stick with that. But for the vast majority of people who are banging their heads on the desk trying to get FSX to work. This is your answer.

It actually required a considerable amount of knowledge. Basic manuvers are to par, but if you try something crazy you might be dissapointed in a lack of authenticity. Also, this game is almost impossible to play well without a joystick or USB yoke. Also the DLC is crazy expensive.

I still have to recommend this game. There are plenty of community made aircraft and skins, and professional flight networks such as VATSIM that allow you to fly in a professional, no fooling around environment. Sometimes, the unrealistic aspect of the game makes great fun, and could make you laugh for a long time. Ever see a hot air balloon do a vertical up into space? Well now you can.

pros:
+ Whole world
+ A big deal of addons to download and install
+ Multiplayer (I dont think its the best choice for realism, so i keen on VATSIM and IVAO)
cons:
- Difficulty of installing and setting up it (It took me 1 week to set up it completely!)

FSX is also not for someone completley new to flight simming. You should probably try something else first to get the hang of it. If you are new to FSX, the learning centre is a great rescource.

A joystick is also recommended for best usage. FPS is usually pretty good on my old brick, however dont expect the menus or loading screens to be too good on an average computer.

FSX:SE is a great game, but still IMO not the best simulator around for realism, I give that award to X-Plane 10, this game is for those people more wanting towards the social aspect of the game, as after a few missions they start to get a bit boring, none of the stock planes have particularly good looking interiors on the virtual cockpits.

The most fun I'm getting out of this game is the multiplayer, it's great to mess around with other gamers online, I also signed up to a virtual airline, which runs through FSX, but that's about it for me.

I'm trying to become a pilot, end of story. FSX I have found is jumpy and slightly too simplified in the stock planes, and as i'm not planning to spend a fair ammount of money finding realistic aircraft, I'll just buy an entirely new simulator.

Cons -The system wide crashes (I mean SYSTEM wide it Crashes WINDOWS 10 FFS)
         -The sheer ingame lag on and 8 core processor with 16 gig ram and a geforce 750ti i can not get above 15fps on medium settings.

81,29471010,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator X came out October of 2006 and it's still one of the best flight simulators around. I have hundreds of hours on the original and plenty on here. The first thing I am going to say to anyone reading this review is, DO NOT expect to be able to do everything if you know nothing about aviation. Many reviewers call FSX a game in their reviews and FSX is NOT a game, it's a simulator, simulating the complex world of aviation. If you know nothing about aviation, do not expect to be able to fly an IFR flight using VOR or GPS navaids and shoot an ILS landing. FSX takes a lot of research to figure out, luckly they have a learning center to help newbies out. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the sim. Yes, it's almost 11 years old, so, it doesn't have the best graphics in the world, nor does it have the best planes. Luckily, during the 11 years of this sim's life, people have been making addons for FSX, including: planes, scenery, textures etc. You can make this sim look nice and feel realistic for free, you don't have to pay for the insanely overpriced DLC Dovetail offers on the Steam Store, my FSX looks great and I only paid for the sim, nothing else.

If you're willing to look past the 11 year old sim and put in the effort to learn about the world of aviation (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) then flying on FSX can be one of the funnest things you'll do, aside from flying for real. 

I got FSX about 7 years ago, I'd never really looked into aviation before, never played a flight sim before, but, once I got an idea of what I was doing, I fell in love.

92,29413084,english,"Pros:
-The game has a sandbox feel.
-Online play is active like it used to be.
-Many of the add on from FSX still work.
-The flying models all seem nice and it is fun to navigate them.
-You can explore the whole world.
-Navigation is easy once you know how to use it.
-The flight planner is good, but I am still learning it.
-Dovetail is pretty responsive on fixing issues with the game.

Cons
-A few of the add ons do not work. (Carrier Strike Force cannot launch 3wirex due to an issue on permissions on the application).
-The F/A-18 Hornet navigation systems did not work online, but I think that I found a way around it. (go to view>instruments>GPS)
-The voice nmultiplayer option is not the best because it doesn't come across clear. It makes me wonder if it is a netcode issue or a lack of VOIP support.
-The software will not allow me to go above 16khz, so this might have something to do with my voice issues.

Conclusion:
I think if you haven't played FSX and you have always wanted to this is a great option if you have Windows 8 or higher.  This has plenty of add ons avaliable online to make you want to try it again if you are a seasoned FSX pilot, but with that being said this can be an expensive hobby given enough time.

The games suffer with some stability issues some crashes here and there (remember to save long haul flights), but nothing that renders the game unplayable.

New Review:

Here's the thing about my updated review. I recently finished building my gaming PC, which is a million times better than my old PC (specs below). On my old PC, the game looked like what it is... An MSoft game from 2006. On my new PC, it actually looks like a REAL GAME.

Keep in mind while reading this that I purchased graphics enhancing DLC's.

The textures for the ground, water, and buildings is very realistic. This is probably because I purchased the HD Textures and Airports DLC, but still. This game was originally released in '06. With graphics maxed out, it feels like you can ""see"" for miles. It's hard to believe 06 PC's could run this. Yeah, that's how good *most* of the graphics are. You occasionaly get texture errors, or tearing, when a building was placed inside another during development. Other than that, graphics look amazing, especially during dawn or dusk.

The default aircraft are the originals from 2006. I didn't play the game back then, but I feel like the new devs may have improved them... The DLC's are decent, but my friends and I have experienced lots of crashing using the DLC aircraft. Animations and 3D cockpit on the inside look great no matter what you choose (other than the B747).

If you want to buy this game and have it look good,  you're going to want a decent computer (see both my systems below). On my old one, the game performed like crap and looked like slightly less worse crap. My new system runs it at a steady average of 135 fps at maxed out graphics settings and 90% AI.

Should you get this game? If you want a campaign, no. If you dream of being a pilot, or are one already, yes. If you want to crash fighter jets into cruise ships, definitely. Best of all, if you want to do group flights with friends, absolutely buy this game.

Thanks for reading :)

Windows will close the program and notify you if a soluation is available"".

The sad part is that there is nowhere to get techinical support, Steam just passes everything of, they are selling the product so they should be providing the support.

I dont want to hear all the excuses or the typical so fall possable soluations its all bs. My computer is totally is used soley for FSX and the hard drive, video card etc is more that enough to run fsx. i also delected fsx and all of it files including everything for steam, i also did a complete clean of my computer and a full update of all driverds etc. I then reinstalled steam and fsx but still have the same problem.

and it doesnt look like i am the only one having this issue, i thing it time for steam to take action asap and resolve this issue. its a great game when its working?

Takes a while to learn ILS landings and how to manage all those buttone in the planes, but once you get used to it, and play some of the mission tutorials, you will soon pick it up.

2,28687843,english,"When I was a Navy primary flight instructor, I made sure my students practiced with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The program didn't teach them everything they needed to know to become pilots, but it did help them get the hang of basic flight maneuvers, local area navigation, and instrument flying.  I could tell which students used FS and which didn't: the ones who had practiced with FS consistently performed better in the real plane.

That was years ago.  Now, I have a child who has expressed an interest in aviation.  When I went looking for FS, I found it here on Steam.  I bought the program and a joystick, and today we worked on level turns.  He could turn to the assigned heading; he could maintain airspeed; he could hold altitude: he just couldn't do all three at the same time.  This is entry level, first-flight stuff, and I'd rather he get a feel for the three axes of flight for pennies at our kitchen table than for $250/hr for an instructor and a rental plane.  I'm thinking of this as $9.99 well spent!

Dovetail has done an excellent job working the bugs out of this game's code and I'm pleased to say that it's light-years better than before. To test how well Dovetail fixed the code I fired up the game and cranked those graphics sliders to the max (AI Vehicles left at default values). I was surprised! While pc gamer would complain that 30FPS in a video game is lame or uncool, I managed to stay at 30FPS with the limiter turned off while I flew a Bell 206 from O'Hare to the downtown area, and from there to Midway Airport.

I don't regret it. The original version of FSX is 10 years old now, but the Steam version loads faster and plays out a lot more smoothly. And best of all, your favourite mods (payware and freeware alike) still work with it!

This game has such a strong community, as well. Most planes that exist in the real world have probably been made for FSX. Versions of all the Spitfires? Check. The F-19 fighter that may or may not be real? Check. 
Even an X-Wing starfighter? (unfortunately, that's not real) Yeah, there's one of those, too. (Take that, X-Plane!)
I even make my own skins for the aircraft, quite often.
There are also tons of well-made, realistic payware choices available as DLC, just for FSX Steam Edition, and the list of them doesn't seem to be ending for a long time.

Overall, I believe that you should get the FSX Steam Edition, whether you're new to simulators as a whole or you just have an older, slower disc version (like I did.) It's just like the original, but it's actually better. You really can fly whatever you want, wherever you want.
It's certainly a 9/10 on its own, but all of the addons out there on websites like Simviation definitely bring it to a 10 for me.
Thank you, Dovetail, for bringing a legend back to life, and the community itself for keeping it that way.

It has been optimized and now uses 4 cores and is not a single threaded application. Expect 30-40FPS during takeoff using an ivybridge @ 3.0Ghz. Once you're airbourne FPS will be way above 60.

There are plenty of mods for textures and aircraft online. SOME are buggy. (dont have autopilot, full cockpit views exc.) But there are quite a few good fully functioning aircraft. The mods are freeware, most requiring installs or simple drag and drop.

This type of game does not need much of an explanation as of what you can do, its pretty ovious. But for the ones that have not played one before, keep in mind it is as if you are in the cockpit of the plane, yeah sure you dont have access to a lot of the controls a plane has but it brings you very close as to how to pilot one and the basics of it. 

I've talked to a couple pilots and they tell me the enjoy this sims cuz it helps them to practice and fly in certain scenarios. 

But dont go in expecting to fly say from the US to europe in 10 mins, you can do this but you take away most of the simulation cuz you would need to accelerate time in game. 

Game is really fun, you get to learn the basics of flying and if you use modded planes you can fly almost every plane in existence.

I believe this is what descibes this game the best. First of all, this is a Simulation, meaning you have to put a certain amound of efford into it, to get some archievements.

Being a hobby glider and motor pilot myself, the entry was quite easy and I could quickly understand the deph of Flight Simulator. This is still fascinating me to the current day.

The only real problem I see with this game is performance. I am running on a i7-4790k + gtx980 with 20fps on ultra. It is not hindering the experience, but it is annoying from time to time.

Very detailed cockpit. Very smooth flights. This is excellent! From the year this game has been made, I have to admit it was well programmed and well made. Does not lag. Very realistic. The takeoff and landing are realistic and the control too. I like how the plane is being controlled. Cockpit options are almost all controllables.

What I like: There is no boundries to where you can go, from what I know, the whole world is your map. Each plane is almost spot on with the cockpit, whether it be gauges and where they're placed, to COMMS and Autopilot. Another thing I like is the amount of airports there are, there are about 24,000 airports, heck, it even has the very airports/airstrips in my home town, which surprised me because I don't live in a very big city at all. I've never flown a real plane before, let alone much experience in simulators, and I was able to pick up on this fairly quickly, the tutorials are easy, and not to complex, they explain a lot of what you need to know, so don't worry if you think you won't be able to to get a plane off the ground. The standard game itself has a large variety of missions, some for beginners, and some for pros. You can be very specific in free-flight, you can change time of day, weather, month, day, whatever, so if you like flying on clear days or in stormy nights, this game has it. 

I could explain a lot more that I like, but I don't want to make this review as long as a novel, so let's move on.

Mixed opinions/dislikes: There isn't much negativity I can say about this game in my experience of playing, but there are some mixed opinions I still have for the game. There isn't a whole lot of planes, maybe it's because I bought the standard $25 edition, however there are some DLCs for the game that do add more planes, but they my cost you. The game isn't very fun nor immersive with just a keyboard, so it's recomended you get a joystick, it's not needed, but it will make this game a whole lot more fun and realistic.

So there you have it, it's not as detailed as some of the other reviews I've seen for this game, but it's my best. Over all, if you like flying planes and helicopters, in a pretty realistic flying simulator, this is for you. To rate this, I would give this a fair 8.5/10, There isn't a huge amount of planes to choose from, but it should be enough. I haven't played multi-player yet, so I can't really say anything about that. Anyways, thank you all so much for taking the time to read my review!

Also, I have a question you could answer in the comments, would this be good practice while taking real life flight school?

However with some graphical mods it looks pretty good, or depending on your system, pretty decent. FSX is also very reliant on the CPU, and not the GPU. That does not make it a bad game though, and if you like to casually fly (nothing too advanced, for example starting an aircraft from cold and dark) then this game is good for you.

53,26452234,english,"FSX + All DLC = $2,530.63 USD. Did you know the most expansive and beautifully detailed flight simulator is free? It displays actual images of the earth taken within the last few years. Yeah. Google Earth. Didn't know Google Earth had a flight simulator? Just load Google Earth and press Ctrl + Alt + A. It's fun to just fly around with amazing detail. If you are looking for a much immersive experience, sure FSX can help you there just don't expect graphics of a current generation triple A game. Another thing, this isn't a game. This is a simulator. Moving forward.

FSX doesn't sport the glamor that Google Earth can muster, not even close. To be exact in a detailed way, FSX is largely outdated. It makes up for the sounds, details to physics, weather, AI, multiplayer and the single player missions are well rounded, fun and interesting for plenty of hours of fun. But....but I've always just loved flying for the scenery. All of the current 137 DLC items available on Steam equals a total cost of $2,530.63 USD. Majority of items are single aircraft downloads that cost an average of $20 USD while larger city packs or even single planes can cost you over $39 USD.  Is Steam overcharging for all the available DLC? Eh, you decide. I've flown with plenty of people where the hub is a particualr city, which, then we just downloaded a mod that we all had in that particular server but I don't know how things are done this day. Everyone must be paying crazy amounts for just one city. Eh.

Having DLC of one city at the cost of $25 USD is a bit greedy, and besides, the game is about flying and if anyone in charge of the Steam FSX DLC prices has ever flown in a plane, you're not over a city that long. Sure I'd pay for the DLC that make the game look more detailed and photorealistic but FSX is a massive world and as for DLC scenery, it only affects one location (on that massive 1:1 scale world known as Earth) because, well, it's the entire world. And is $25 USD really worth a change in a single tiny location? Why not just download all the DLC for $2,530.63?!? (Please, don't take my money). 

I just can't seem to stomach the price tags of any FSX-SE DLC to be honest, cause even a tree pack is $12 USD. (cough*mods*cough) Maybe it's just the way I fly because I prefer to ""hop"" my flights VFR from field to field spanning wilderness and mountains, over rivers and canyons Let me continue.... 137 items at $2,530.63. SMH.

Moving on. FSX isn't your average ""game"" because it is actually a ""simulator."" Multiplayer? For anyone who has been with FSX since the end of GameSpy we all went to dedicated servers or hosting/connecting. So I'm only sure FSX-SE multiplayer connectivity will be swarms of F-18's flying fast as possible thru any controlled airspace from the grass blades to the heavens edge.  Or the frequencies will be jammed with ""maydays"" every twenty minutes clogging ATC landing/take-off priorities... I don't miss that, that's right.

FSX was not a ""game"" to me as I had binders of printed pages all printed off airnav.com or my personal VFR map (http://vfrmap.com/?type=vfrc&lat=40.043&lon=-99.251&zoom=10). That is just the fine-lined version of FSX. Then it get's dirty as you master all the airports you've ever landed at, or thought of landing at, then you want to master more planes... and more and more. Then you study Air Traffic Control like your life depended on it because you don't want to take to long in your next server session when ground control calls ""seven lima romeo taxi left bravo right mike right hotel short runway 32 contact departure one two eight decimal two zero."" (or something)....

This is a simulator, it is the ""steam edition"" and this truely is all about ""flight."" Maybe even some over priced DLC. So yeah. Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition: Over-priced Downloadable Content Option. Enjoy! (cough*mods*cough)

Simulators are cash cows when it comes to add ons, if you want a beautiful world to fly in youll have to put another 150-200 bucks into it to fly proper planes and have proper airports and world scenery, being a flight simmer is not cheap... after over 1200 hours on FSX i actually moved over to Prepared 3D, for that extra bit of performance that FSX:SE (already a slightly beefier version of FSX) cant offer, after spending another 2000+ hours on P3D i am now moving over to X-Plane, because it is the future of 64bit sims (P3D and FSX are both 32bit so you are very limited, especially when it comes to memory issue and memory leaks) 

X-plane is a little low on content right now, but for the last year they have been getting a lot of work done and there are more and more content coming in and with the release of X-Plane 11 at the end of this year, you are probably better off waiting for a bit and getting X-Plane as a simulator, and if you are already an owner of FSX and/or P3D you are able to bring over all your Sceneries to X-Plane, although there is no compatibility at the moment to do so for your aircraft... No matter what an FSX or P3D simmer tells you, X-Plane is the sim you need, and if you dont agree with me now you will be after spending a couple thousand hours on both sims.

Note to new buyers and first timers... 

before you buy this and expect to have an awesome experience like you see on youtube videos and such please know that to have the same result you will have to spend a lot more than the initial 24 bucks price tag (24 swiss francs in my case)

There are also missions to take on, such as Search and Rescue and Red Bull Air Races. These give the game attitude and some neat ways to experiment with different vehicles. But you’ll probably have the most fun creating your own flight paths, weather conditions, time of day, and where to take off and land at. The game is a true sandbox allowing you to be your own pilot on many types of aircraft.
The terms of the partnership deal do not allow for any graphical updates. So you should go into this knowing that it isn’t an HD remake, but rather just an update so that modern machines and operating systems can run the game. And with that, using Steamworks, allows for the game’s multiplayer to be updated and enhanced to talk to each other over modern connections. It is still the same great game from 8 years ago. But for anyone who has never played the game before, might be a little disappointed.
There are over 24,000 of the world’s airports to take off and land on. All of it can take place in real-time, or a time of your choosing. Airports look busier, as AI now fills the runways with fuel trucks, baggage carts that make things feel less empty. It’s a small, but meaningful change to the game that makes things seem more lively.
If Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition seems too outdated for you, then a new Flight Simulator from Deovetail will probably resemble what you’re looking for, and be worth waiting for. This game is approaching a decade after it’s original release, and the game’s graphical fidelity is not holding up.

39,25901757,english,"It's a good simulator, a tad dated but there is essentially infinite content to create a better world. Default is fun, interesting, and you can see parts of the world - however it's not entirely realistic. Some of the larger cities have more details but if you make a lot of road trips or spend out time in the country you'll quickly realize that there's not a lot of realism near ground level. I prefer to fly low following roads, rivers, streams, canyons and it always amazes me when I see a house in the middle of an interstate or houses lining runways at smaller airports next to terminal buildings and hangars. I'm not complaining too much because the game is dated but the fact that it's still in use by so many and new content is always appearing shows that there is a lot of love for this sim. You will probably spend days or weeks searching through free content and you could easily spend hundreds or thousands of dollars for paid content. Personally, I don't want to spend too much to make it better I would rather wait for a newer sim with better/modern coding and better graphics out-of-the-box. I think Dovetail is going to be delivering something soon or perhaps I would look into P3D or X-plane. 

This is still a great sim though and is usually on sale throughout the year for a low price. If you fly high or do standard traffic routes you may not care about the up-close ground level details, but if you prefer to fly under 500ft you're going to notice a lot of goofs and glitches with the world. There are mods and DLC packs that can correct and modernize and make things more realistic, but again it's going to take or money or both and the game is around ten years old or so. 

I love the amount of content though, sadly a lot of the freeware aircraft out there are still optimized only for DX9 and I don't like having to turn my graphics down to enjoy games or simulators so I've wasted many hours, probably days or maybe even a week or two downloading and trying to use aircraft only to delete them after being forced to cut my graphics and performance backwards. I recommend it, it's great for beginners or advanced flight sim fans but just like any other simulator or hobby it can become quite pricey depending on what you want to fly, where you want to go, what you want to see, and how much detail and realism you want to experience. There are plenty of stores that offer content and they have plenty of sales throughout the year as well. Be warned though, more realism you want the more you will spend - but even going baseline or buying one of the packages on a Steam sale you'll get plenty hours of this. After-all there have been sim pilots flying this for over ten years...

Even taking the age into account I would give it 7 or 8 out of ten, fly high and it looks good enough, fly low and you'll need to make it look better. I'm not talking about 4k textures or over-detailed roads or anything but I tried following a couple familiar interstates and highways and found very little realism - even some smaller cities and towns the layout just appears completely randomized. I found a spot on I10 where the interstate twisted around a random house - I've seen HP cars sitting in the medians before but never houses. So take that how you will, good simulator, good out of the box, great with pricey add-ons like ORBX. 

*You can get a lot of free trial-ware add-ons for scenery but most of the trial aircraft are so limited it's not worth it. Yay I can throttle up and throttle down and look at it in chase plane but can't lift off or turn! If you go with add-ons I would suggest flying a specific path in stock version, load the add-on - I love the Pacific Northwest trial from ORBX - fly the exact same path to see the new level of detail. Stock version you may see power line towers, with a good add-on package you can actually follow the power lines visually, or follow actual roads. 

I have not tried any of the ""Photo-real"" packages though but I'm tempted - however P3D and X-plane are also trying to tempt me these days. 64bit optimized versus adding onto 32bit...

FSX is good though, just make sure you have plenty of hard drive space and some extra spending money to make it better for you.",1475840380,1475840380,True,3,0,0.563111722469329834,0,True,False,False,76561198073752620,102,12,4195,0,3779,1476435306,,

For example, t isn't really worth it to spend $90 on good physics and wind patterns, when they are already in X-Plane or P3D. P3D should actually replace this, for it copied FSX, since Microsoft abandoned it, and started making new updates with DX11 support!

I would reccomend FSX for anyone who plays flight simulators or wants to, it is a good starting point. Apart from a few bugs and pet grievences it is ver PC friendly and runs smoothly.

If you are into simulators and are willing to shell out £100 I feel P3D is a better options as it rund better and has more compatability with Addons",1474656245,1474656333,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,76561198211245568,8,1,4504,0,3226,1504274466,,

I have been flying on Flight Gear, an open source flight simulator that is totally free, and I decided to upgrade to a sim with a more reliable game engine and better graphics. I did some research and found that FSX: Steam edition is almost the same as the $100 version. So, after buying and downloading FSX:SE I booted up the game and saw a terrible thing... the plane was already running. I then closed the simulation and looked through the settings to find a ""Start aircraft cold"" setting. After looking through the menus and multiple online forums I found that I could only ""Cold Start"" an aircraft by turning off the aircraft and saving it in that state. So, I booted up FSX:SE in a 747 and I look up to the overhead panel to turn off the aircraft and hit the battery switch. And then again. And again. But the battery switch will not turn off. I try to hit other buttons on the overhead pannel, and then discover, to my dismay, that I can only turn on the external lights. I go through the rest of the plane and discover that I can only hit a scarce amount of buttons and switches on the aircraft. I then go throught multiple aircraft and discover how little buttons I can hit. Very dissapointed in this simulator, cough (just a game) cough, I refunded my money.

30,25037267,english,"I have been a Microsoft Flight Simulator enthusiast since inception, and my enjoyment for Flight Simulator has continued to grow as each release corrects bugs, makes improvemetns and provides opportunities for 3rd party support for add-ons.  The Steam Version has made several improvements while keeping the basic FSX concept intact but ignored the one factor that all users face and hate about the FSX franchise - the Out of Memory Error.

2016 brings very powerful CPUs and GPUs to our disposal, and while my PC is at the top Tier in performance, Flight Simulator Steam Edition does not fully take advantage of this power due to FSX 32bit program structure.

Many vendor's add-ons such as ORBX, Aereosoft, and even Steam DLC for Flight Simulator place greater demands on the finite 4GB Memory limits of Flight Simulator.  Thus when using the products with a fully capable aircraft cockpint simulator you will face the Out of Memory (OOM) issue at some point.  It could be 10 minutes into your flight, but more often than not it happens just as you approach that ""mega"" airport you paid $50.00 for  - resulting in a fatal error,  and the need to restart the program to begin again.

The 4GB memory limit is the one thing that needs to be addressed more so than anything.  Otherwise it is pointless to buy highly detailed aircraft, scenery and airports then dial everything down to bare minimums to avoid running beyond the 4GB barrier causing a simulator crash.

I use a tool called ProcessExplorer to monitor my memory usage during flights, and when the memory usage creeps up to 3.7gb I immediately save the flight because I know what is coming next - this is ridiculous. For everyones edification - Out Of Memory is not a ""physical"" memory limit but the restrictions of 32bit limits of the program itself, Memory caps out at 4gb regarless of how much physical memory you have installed. 

For consideration: Starting up the SIM at a detailed airport with an iFLY 747 you just used about 3.2 gb or Vmemory and as you fly, use the panel cockpit instruments and enjoy the views, the remaining memory will slowly be depleted until your sim crashes - OOM.

Even if developers of this Steam Flight Simulator version produced a tool that automates saving the flight when memory is near the crash limits at least that would be a step in the right direction, but no tool is offered. I guess creating one would be admiting the problem exist and wise folks would avoid the 32bit  franchise all together.  

The other issue with this version as in previous ones is Flight Simulator does not properly flush memory between flights, and with each session, the more you fly it too will deplete the 4gb limit eventually,  unless of course you restart the program and waits the 3 minutes for a re-load.
Once again no in game ""memory flush"" feature for a long known issue.

The one major limiting factor that needed to be fixed went answered: and companies are more than happy to sell you add-ons knowing their add-on products place added demands on the limited memory space of this 32bit program. 

Back when Aces was doing the development they would make a statement following each release, ""they intentionally build the simulator for the next generation of the PC"", WELL here we are, and my system can throw this around at 40+ fps BUT crashes because no one has taken time to address the 32bit limit.  the issue rapidly begain to manifeste  itselft once end users moved up to more powerful systems, and content creators offered ""better"" higher detailed planes, airports, and scenery.

Moving forward: I would think offering a 64bit release would destroy compatibilty for all those add-ons, and this is the underlying reason the program remains 32bit, to keep the 3rd party suppliers happy more than the end user. 

My prediction is this simulator will simply be 32bit forever, and a NEW Flight Simulator will be offered, sold and we enthusist will venture out and buy it, and cough up money for basically the same add-ons to get us to this point in time to facilite the true enjoyment of flight simulation without the OOM crashes. as they say in contracting - you dont make money fixing it, sell them something new.

So how do you avoid all this OOM stuff:  Stick to the basic Flight Simulator and Aircrafts, forgo any add-ons, or at least keep them to the bare minimum. Make your choice- Do you want to look at pretty scenery or have a simulator cockpit experience - with the limits of 32bit program it is difficult to have both.

IMHO it would be best to stick with the basic FSX steam version with limited add-on purchases, and hope the next FXY version will be 64bit.

So how do I like the Flight Simulator Steam Edition - I love it, due to the vast content one has access to, the realiasm, and landclass graphic details frim orbx that can be achieved using new improved land classes, and add-0n airports. but as stated, fatal program crashes will occur depending on your combonation of aircract, area, and detail level settings. 

With all the above being said.  Flight Simulator Steam Edition has plenty to offer with many hours of enjoyable game play for all flight simulator enthusiast.

36,14084327,english,"In case you're not very familiar with FSX as a flight sim, the general consensus of it's rather small userbase is that it provides a decent platform for civil flight simulation.

Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is an updated, not remastered, version of Flight Simulator X, and it's expansion, Acceleration, released back in 2006 and 2007, respectively. A bunch of bugfixes were applied by Dovetail, the developer, as well as some optimization which previously required the user editing configuration files, and the game had it's multiplayer component integrated with steamworks, replacing the now dead Gamespy client.

FSX on it's own, provides a very average simulation experience for today's standards: Scenery might not be that great or detailed, aircraft systems aren't simulated with much depth, visuals aren't really breathtaking. However, as written above, it's a rather solid platform for addons.

And this is where FSX starts to shine. The addons available for this, in particular aircraft made by companies like PMDG, Flight Sim Labs, Real Air and Majestic, are really quite something. Incredible systems depth, broadly documented in countless available manuals, mixed in with scenery developed by companies like ORBX and others pump new life into this ageing sim, providing with a flight simulation experience which is extremely hard to compare with.

Summing up, if you do fancy flight sims, in particular of the civil kind, and intend to spend money not only on this product, but on other products which would fit into it, I'd say you're in for a pleasant and enjoyable ride.

If you do intend to acquire this on it's own just to have an introduction to flight simming, keep in mind that FSX: Steam Edition alone might not offer much in simulation depth and visuals department.",1421773696,1472329539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004715173,351,59,4051,0,3817,1474743587,,

But if you're more than a noobie, but less than an expert simmer, I recommend FSX:SE. Because with a strong enough computer, and the right mods, you can turn FSX into something ultra-realistic, or into a game.

Overall, I reccommend it for those with decent computer, and graphics card. And enough money for a few payware aircraft. With just that, you'll have a pretty nice looking sim.

It is smooth with improved graphics over the older FSX, and so far all my addons, which I used on FSX and had problems with on P3D all worked perfectly.

I recommend when you install this FSX, that you make it a clean install making sure that you removed all the left-overs or remnants of the (Boxed) FSX, if you had one; this includes cleaning up the Registry. Not doing so could run you into working problems with some of your (Boxed) FSX addons. This happens because FSX:SE was re-designed to work in dual with the older (Boxed) version if chosen to, and this causes the install program to name the FSX:SE folders to FSX:SE rather than FSX, and this is where problems can occur.

Go for it and get this newer version, I think you will be satisfied as I am. Since I moved over their have been two updates; which happens automatically when you boot-up your computer.",1470384751,1470384751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198317610666,1,1,60045,0,3104,1560690988,,

Likes: 
MASSIVE MOD COMMUNITY! YOU WILL LOVE FINDING NEW AIRCRAFT TO DOWNLOAD AND FLY! 
1000s of FREE AIRCRAFT AVAILABLE!
Slightly optimized for new gen PCs & hardware
Great multiplayer aspect revived via steam servers (versus obsolete Gamespy)
Works with a ton of my joysticks, yokes, and even custom mapped switch panels
Fun with friends: FSX is great alone, but if your looking into SE, you probably want to fly with other pilots around the world! This is the main reason I picked up SE and I am very happy.
Cons:
Some public servers are pretty chaotic & uncontrolled. If you want a true flight experience, you must VATSIM or host your own server and invite your friends. The public servers are still fun!
OVERALL:
If you are reading this, and you enjoy aviation, avionics, ATC, airports, or if you want to be a pilot some day, this is a MUST HAVE! FSX is to pilot enthusiasts as Nascar is to racing fans! :)

My Computer: Dell Inspiron 15R

- I can normally run FSX at 40 fps just fine when I have my laptop plugged in, on a cooling fan and running a second screen. I use the Saitek x52 Pro split joystick set and it works great. I would not recommend FSX on a laptop like mine but if that is all that you have then you can get by with it. If you have an iPad like me they are a great kneeboard that you can use for airport charts.

19,24532807,english,"A re-release of the dated, but loveable classic, FSX-SE will once again enchant newcomers to the genre, but may disappoint existing fans.

Do not expect shiny visuals, a modern game engine, bug-free play or anything new: this is a repackaged Flight Simulator X, sold on Steam. The one exception to that is a re-kajiggered Multiplayer system, bringing it up to the standards of convenience that the original probably should've released with. As such, [b]it is well worth your while looking up the multitudes of FSX original reviews[/b], given that it is, again, a classic game with many devotees and much attention paid to it over the years. Also because of this legacy, there are thousands of free add-ons online that can still work with this edition, in place of the scant collection of money-grabbing DLC that presently reside in the store. This game being opened up to the Steam Workshop platform would be a suitable godsend, and will likely come as soon as the DLC-money-well runs dry.

The game's price is rather interesting given that this really, really is a re-release, and it wouldn't be hard to find FSX Gold Edition sitting in the back row of a store's PC DVDROM collection for less than $10. Still, the price is not so high as to be unfair.

If you already own FSX, consider carefully whether you want this. Perhaps your flight-sim community is mainly on an FSX-SE server now - although that is unlikely, as the native multiplayer servers are not presently cross-platform with Prepar3D and X-Plane. Perhaps like me you'd rather the convenience of an automatically-repairable installation tied to an account, not a disc. I do not recommend concurrent installations of both - despite using mostly different directories, some registry entries are shared, and many add-ons are not programmed to recognise each separate installation.

I used to be a big fan of the boxed version of FSX and switched to FSX : Steam Edition. On my system, FSX Steam Edition runs much smoother with better FPS than the old boxed edition. 

After installing, however, FSX:SE looks kind of bleak with rather boring standard textures and unrealistic weather etc. But luckily this can easily be changed with add-ons, both payware and freeware (for those who are new to FSX, you might start out with the freeware first, check out the awesome tutorials you can find on youtube!). After tweaking FSX:SE a little with better textures, a weather engine and whatnot, it is a great product and fabulous flight simulator.

My favourite defualt plane is the Cessna C208 Grand Caravan. I usually fly to Toronto, and by default there is really good scenery there. XP10's version of Toronto is a flat piece of gray wasteland. Plus, there is more addons for FSX than XP10 and P3D. XP10 is way overpriced at $60 for just North America, when you can just get FSX for $28! And it comes with the entire world!

dovetrail should add more suport to hardwere, like the ram limitation of miserable 2 gb, this is awful becouse the FSX comunity are alive because the mods, in my case i have a lot of mods and of course i have a bugs, because the ram memory can't suport my fsx 5 minutes loading, with a good pc not too good but enough for FSX. Dovetrail should put more hardwere  suport four fsx, with they do this people stop from migrating to other flight simulator's like prepard 3d or xplane,
now let me tell the positive and negative points of FSX SE. 

Positive

-FSX steam ? dovetrain realy improve it and get rid of many bugs 

-The gameabilit stay the same 

-This is an very realistic simulator with you dont know a little bit of aviation this ""game"" is not for you just kidding anyone can play it

-The Microsof fligh Simulator x mods work's perfectly in FSX SE like, PMDG Carenado A2A and whatever you buy !!!!!!!!!

-With you have played FSX before you have to buy it,  you will not be regret !

-The multiplayer it's awesome, but many trolls thanks ! steam

-FSX Steam comes with deluxe and aceleration !!
                                                                                                                                                                                          Negative 

-FSX SE stays almost the same as Microsoft FSX 

-Old Fsx bugs are not exterminated like, fatal error freazing, crashes and 1.000.000.000 is grather that 1.000000000

-Planes are the same as FSX the texture are the same, evrything is the same :)

-Dovetrail won't suport fsx airac\navdata updates 

-Textures are ugly (like Microsoft FSX) the are the same in both 

Conclusion: Fsx SE is an grather game Mods can rid off all that problems with you you like avition you gonna have good times playing it.

78,24151934,english,"If you nurse a secret ambition to be a pilot, this is a great game.  Very realistic, and there's loads of add-ons and hardware out on the market you can purchase to make it even more so.

There's a serious bug in it, however, that ruins the whole thing, and there's enough people complaining online that I know it's a very common problem.  What's more, considering the number of years the franchise has been around and constantly upgraded, it's reallly inexcusable.  

The game crashes, regularly.  When I first bought this game and installed it on my previous PC, it worked well enough at first, but then started to stop working after a period of time.  The more I played it, the more quickly it stopped working.  Finally, it would stop working within a few minutes of starting, and I'd be lucky even to get the airplane off the ground.

I tried reinstalling it.  It made no difference.  

So I quit playing it for a while.  After I'd bought a new PC, I installed the game again.  Again, for the first little while, it worked just fine.  Then the software started crashing.  And then the longer I played, the quicker it would stop working.  Rght now, the game will work for about 30 minutes, which is barely enough to take off, turn around and land again.

I've hunted online for explanations and solutions.  Microsoft seem to have none.  Various forums contain posts saying, ""You need to install this link.""  Of course, you have no idea what you're downloading, or whether it contains a dozen virusses, and the reactions of other people on those forums don't suggest any of those links really make a difference.

Given the years this franchise has been available, Microsoft really should be aware of this problem and ought to have solved it by now.

93,24015810,english,"With this game on a big sale right now, there are certain to be people on the fence about buying this game.  I thought it is time for me to write a review on this game.

Over the past year, I have tried all of the current ""big three"" sims: FSX (got it 75% off), X-Plane 10, and Prepar3D v3.  I also have Dovetail Flight School and even FlightGear.  Out of all five, FSX:SE is by far my favorite.

Yes its technology (32 bits and unfinished DirectX 10) is aged by today's standards.  However, I myself am a diehard retro gamer and I am able to overlook its age to make the most of a sim that is still relevant in today's market.

Its greatest strengths are:

-Diversity in gameplay.  You can take lessons and try to pass checkrides, fly in a variety of missions, or go on a solo or multiplayer free flights.  The game has GA aircrafts, airliners, a helicopter, a glider, and a few other aircraft types right out of the box.  Even if you don't feel like flying, you can read its vast in-game library to learn about the game and the planes' different features and how they are used in real life.

-Expandability.  The default terrain is a a bit bare (but still waaay better than FlightGear).  There is a good number of add-ons available through Steam, and around 75% of the add-ons designed for boxed FSX still work for FSX:SE with no or only a little tweaking.  The default game will keep you busy for many months and the add-ons will keep you busy for YEARS.

-User friendliness.  Almost everything works right out of the box.  Yes there are a couple of bugs that DTG unfortunately cannot fix due to its distribution agreement with Microsoft, but some of them can be fixed by the players with the right amount of research (and back up all originals!).  The in-game options, AI planes, ATC, dials and gauges, four seasons landscape, real-time weather, map, flight planner, rewards, and frame rate all work.  You can start on the runway or at any of the parking or gate area in the game's 20,000 airports.  You aren't given a million options to choose from just so you can set the game the way you like it and take to the skies.

People very new to flight simmings or to aviation in general will not have their hands held - they will still need to take the lessons, read the library, do additional research online, and invest in at least a cheap joystick to make the most of their experience.  That is where many would-be simmers give up.  If you want to fly as soon and as easily as possible, this sim is not for you.  If you want to learn how to fly and enjoy the rewards out of doing so, this sim is for you.

Will FSX:SE be our go-to flight sim forever?  Maybe not forever, but for at least for the rest of this year, yes.  Prepar3D (based on FSX) is still boring and built on old technology despite its price tag.  X-Plane 10 baits and switches for sales and still can't offer detailed airports, good ATC, and the four seasons right out of the box.  Dovetail Flight School is missing too many features for serious simming, but the upcoming Dovetail Flight Simulator may be FSX:SE's rightful replacement.  FlightGear is admirable, but it is freeware for a reason.

So in short, if you are interested in aviation and you are willing to learn, then take advantage of this sale.  FSX:SE, sale or not, is an affordable and accessible entry point to the wonderful hobby of flight simulation.",1467465542,1467465542,True,5,0,0.582311570644378662,0,True,False,False,76561198121646551,103,27,57984,481,19133,1601827503,,

- Some of the mission packs are not working (could be my own ignorance.). I'll review them when I finish them or if I can't finish them because I can't get them to work I'll review that I can't get them to work.

  I wish I could or I wish I knew how to use two 360 controllers. I'd like cockpitview mapped to a second controller right thumbstick and throttle on the first controller right stick. I would like to do that without a 3rd party gamepad mapping software. 

  I've googled (not deeply), but it's generally a load of people saying ""Omg, you can't use a 360 controller"". A 360 Controller works reasonably well and the people asking are not asking about 'what they should be using' but 'what they are using'. Reddit had a post and the replies nice enough, but they didn't really suggest any information other than ""Yeah, 360 controller works"". What I am using is a 360 controller, and I'd like to use 360 controllers (2+).

With that idea seemingly dead, I went shopping online for flight gear. Looking at flight sticks and yokes... okay, I want that yoke with the quandrant, instrument panel, box with the flippy switches and the box with the knobs, captains shirt and tie, .. okay just the yoke and quandrant because this is going to be expensive. 


22 hours into this game and 
I can confidently fly a cesna (I don't ATC though :\). I've finished most of the tutorials a few missions, Soaring had me confused for a bit, I almost have a feel for helicopters, and jets are quite difficult.

31 hours. Flight stick arrived, Saitek x52 for half the original price. This makes the game at least 2x easier than the 360 controller. I am still using the 360 controller, but it has moved to my lap and is for cockpit view and a few switches (like landing gear). I just had the most beautiful landing of my desktop piloting experience. Only issue I've had with the flight stick was that the rotation x and y (throttle joystick) didn't work very well for panning :( made the view shaky (and I calibrated). Anyway, I was able to Transistion to Jets Tutorial 8 without much problem. Helicopter Manuevers are seemingly harder now, which was unexpected... but an hour later and I was getting the hang of helicopters,",1466537473,1467256692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084457922,96,14,3038,0,1986,1563908980,,

I bought this game on sale, thought why not, I generally like simulator-type games. Unfortunately I don't own a working controller/pad at the moment, and this proved to be a game ruiner. This game really doesn't seem to work well with a keyboard, and the control bindings and the settings weren't exactly user friendly if you don't know plane jargon. I spent an hour fiddling around with various settings and still couldn't get a setup that allowed me to control the basic plane properly and so I gave up and got a refund before I spent so much time playing around with the settings that I didn't qualify for one anymore. I'm sure this game is great once you actually get to play it, but unfortunately I can't give a thumbs up because I never actually got to play it and I don't have several hours to spend tweaking settings to get the sensitivity just right so that it's playable.

A quick Google search told me I wasn't the only one to have this problem, there were whole forum threads stretching back years talking about this issue. It's annoying that there's nothing telling you before you buy this game that it requires a controller to be fully enjoyed or indeed be playable.

28,21190281,english,"The classic is reborn with some new content, plus revived and revamped multi-player!

This is the quintessential flight simulator!  It is the most accurate, in-depth, and authentic flight simulator available.  So realist, I have seen this software used in flight sims in museums!  Whether you are looking to pilot a hand-glider, a helicopter,  a prop plane like Cessna, or a jet airliner like a Boeing 747, it is here; and true to life.  From the control panel layouts and aircraft operation, to Air Traffic Control and flight planning.  If you are looking for a non-military flight simulator, you can not go wrong with Flight Simulator X:Steam Edition.

The Steam Edition adds the ability to play in multi-player environments; where you can play as a pilot or co-pilot to an air traffic controller.  There are also different races like Red Bull Air Race and Reno National courses, and even more!  There are also the original missions from the game plus many more, providing 50+ hours worth of single-player missions; or just pick an airport, pick a plane, and take off!  You will be playing this game for years.
In addition, if you really become addicted to this game, there is a plethora of accessories that you can get.  You could literally have professional grade flight simulator with life-like throttle levers, panels, headsets, and more.

PROS:
I could say everything but...
Added multi-player and single-player content, stunning visuals, realist (or not so much, if you prefer) flight conditions and aircraft controls, ridiculous re-play value

NEUTRALS:
Aircraft selection-While there is a variety in the types of aircraft you can pilot, it still feels like one or two aircraft were selected from each category of aircraft and that's what you get.  Some may have some color options, but for the most part, if you want to fly a prop plane you have these 2 or 3, if you want fly a jet plane you have these 2 or 3, and so on.

CONS:
I don't have any cons for this game, what there are cons for is from Steam.  This is not a con in the non-Steam version of this flight simulator, since it can be resolved.  Sorry guys; love ya but this is on you...
Add-on Content.  If you own the original Microsoft FSX game, there is FREE add-on content; literally by the hundreds of thousands.  From texture and airport upgrades, to improved visuals on landmarks, and I couldn't even begin to list all the options.  But NOT with Steam Edition.  The game description blames it on compatibility, which I concede may have a level of truth to it.  However, to charge over $1500 for DLC is truly...rediculous...outlandish...unbelievable...I think those are even understatements.  I don't understand this pricing on any level, period.

Overall
If you are looking for a flight simulator, you need not look further.  This is the pinnacle of consumer-level flight simulator.  In regards to the DLC pricing issue, my recommendation would be this.  Buy the Steam Edition, for two reasons. First is the online multi-player content, this is not available on the original game.  (*There is a multi-player option on the original game.  However, it is LAN multi-player meaning you don't play online, and I don't have any experience with it.)  Second, if you really like the game and find that you want to improve the experience, buying a copy of the original game isn't too expensive and then you can download all the free add-on content until you heart's desire.  I stress this because if you want to put some time into it, there are a countless number of beautiful fly-bys you can do in this simulator; and in fairly realist graphics with add-ons and high settings.",1455399536,1466829429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198167202845,81,1,765,0,108,1543076529,,

It technically does work with a joystick, I'm attemping to use the same one I used before, but the calibration is totally off.  Even when the throttle is in the zero position, the plane thinks it's at 50% so good luck trying to land when the throttle won't go lower than half.  I haven't tried the xbox controller, and trying to fly with only a keyboard is a joke.

I'm extremely disappointed in this.  Everything that's helpful and makes the game fun doesn't work.

45,23693044,english,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If you're looking at this game because you played FSX and are getting nostalgia for it again, you'll find everything is exactly how it was on the original CD release. All the control mappings and defaults are the same. Flight controls are the same. Missions are the same. It's the same simulator that Microsoft released a full 10 years ago. The scenery is that outdated look and the engine still has the same fun problems (except for some compatibility issues, see ""Steam Edition""). The plus side is the base package can be run on max settings from even mid-range laptops with integrated graphics.

[h1]Steam Edition[/h1]
Let me explain just why this game is now available on Steam. Dovetail Games (a pretty bad developer who sees itself as the god of sim-games) bought the rights to distribute FSX 2 years ago so they could make their own flight simulator. What they did for FSX was quickly patch some issues with compatibility for Windows 8/8.1 devices (and probably W10 too), so that it could run on Steam users' current PCs. Then they released it into the wild to earn cash to fund their development project for a new flight sim. I don't think they've touched it since.
[i][u][b]Warning![/b][/u][/i]
Lots of add-ons for MFSX will not work with the SE version for a number of reasons. The most basic is that an add-on refernces the standard installation directory, which is not where the SE version is installed. There are other reasons, but I can't really explain them.

[h1]Persistent Issues[/h1]
While Dovetail [i]supposedly[/i] fixed some compatibility issues with newer operating systems, they certainly didn't fix all of them. In addtion, there are some things they should have fixed before re-releasing this on Steam. For example, the mission compass is still really stretched out on a monitor that isn't at a 4x3 aspect ratio. If you use DX10 rendering (better performance), you will never be able to go near an airport because of the horrid texture clipping that occurs. Every line and every asphalt surface that overlap encounter the WORST texture clipping with the DX10 engine. And if you go back to the default renderer, DX9, it then becomes impossible to see some pause menus (for example, rebinding keys mid-flight). Instead all you see is a black screen where you know there should be a menu. At that point, the only thing you can do is close the program externally. So you're basically forced to have massive texture clipping.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While I miss the days of FSX when it was new, I definitely am not reliving those now. The software has so many issues relating to newer operating systems that it makes the game unplayable on any modern platform (especially on the Windows 10 that Microsoft has been shoving down our throats). If I had a computer running Vista or XP (both no longer supported by Microsoft, fyi), this would be a worthwhile buy. However, to get this playable on a modern system requires you to dig around the web for solutions that involve manual edits to the game's source code/installation files. It's just not worth it.

[h1]Footnote to Dovetail Games[/h1]
Dear Dovetail: how is it when you're given only a handful of things to do that you still manage to fall short? Even a cash grab should be well patched to work on a modern system. And you saw that your new flight sim/school was targeted at the wrong audience (I mean, what did you expect? The last good flight sim at its release was THIS, in 2006, or XPlane, which is quite a bit more complicated to use. Of course we're first in line for a new flight sim). And can we talk about how all of your other sims seem to tank in the reviews as well? You're not [i]acclaimed[/i] for anything, and the only thing you're [i]renowned[/i] for is pissing people off with shitty simulators. I.E. your train simulator should still be in the oven for optimization fixes. Your new flight school still has a lot of artifacts from the FSX engine like details popping into view and it's only got 2 planes. From all I've seen, you're one of the worst developers I know of. I WANT to enjoy a new flight simulator. Don't push out a release too early when you build the full thing. GET IT RIGHT. It's so frustrating when a developer is desperate for cash so they push a game out before it's ready. Then it never gets fixed and everyone hates it. Thing is, this is what it feels like you, Dovetail, are doing with EVERY SINGLE THING YOU MAKE.",1466542692,1466542972,False,45,11,0.582557141780853271,0,True,False,False,76561198074046884,162,52,126,0,64,1596386450,,

Even though it originally came out in 2006, Flight Simulation X still holds up as a truly amazing simulator.   The Steam Edition has made improvements to the performance.

The base simulator covers the entire globe, has flying lessons built in and also many missions to complete. 

A word of warning though, if you end up getting into flight simulation, it may end up costing you a lot more as there are some amazing addons to pick up. 

I'm a photoscenery fan, as I like to know that what I'm flying over is an exact replica of what I would see if I was really flying.  Plus it can be used to navigate accurately.

If you're new to flight simulation, here are my recommendations, bearing in mind I'm a GA flyer: 

Firstly, buy the book FSX for Pilots- Real World Training.  It is the perfect way to learn how to fly using the simulator. 

Essential Addons:

General:
REX
FS Global (preferably ultimate editions)
Natural Tree Environment X - not essential but I like it.
Accu-Feel - Makes the default planes feel more realistic.

If you're not into photoscenery:
FTX Global
FTX Vector

If you prefer photoscenery, then it might not be worth getting the two FTX products, as your photo scenery will overwrite them

UK Photoscenery: 
VFR Generation X v3
Revolution X ( a criticism levelled at photoscenery, is that they can appear flat, however this adds loads of autogen andis fantastic).
UK2000 UK airports

These titles are amazing.  So realistic.

USA Photoscenery
Megascenery Earth
TreeLines (like Revolution X, but only includes trees.  Works well though)
Night Environment for each state where available.

Airplanes:
The default ones are ok, but there are better ones out there.  For GA flying I love the A2A Piper. 

Traffic:  
Ultimate Traffic 2 is a good one.  Makes things a lot more interesting with other planes flying around.

Finally, I recommend a decent PC to run it on, and a decent yoke and rudder pedals.  I use the Saitek products. 

You might want to try a few tweaks too.  I recommend Frooglesims youtube video called 'VLOG: How to get better FSX performance' and the tweaks referenced in the Megascenery manual.  Matt Smith is also a good user to watch youtube videos on.

As I said, beware, because if you do get hooked, you may end up spending a lot (of time and money) on the hobby. Time and money very well spent though.

86,23484254,english,"This game is awesome. Even though it is from 2006 it really delivers an amazing experience and as it is so old the community is so big and great. Tons of mods is available both freeware and payware.

Pros:

*The community is big and has a ton of freeware mods available*
*You could fly wherever you want in the big open world*
*The game includes missions that could be funny and good if you have to learn something*
*It's really realistic even without mods and with mods installed, it could even be hard to spot the difference between game and reallity*

Cons:

*The game is old and could not use 100% out of new computers*
*Even though it's pretty good detailed, the terrain and so could have been done better*
*The including airplanes works if you just want to have some fun, but is not so good if you are looking for a real simulator experience*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclution: The game is awesome even though is old. The including planes works for having fun with, but not for simulating. So should you buy this game? YES!

Why would I want to play it in theater?  I want to play it in VR.  Oh well, so I try to play it in theater mode.  It says ""Connecting to Game""... then, [crickets chirping], nothing happens.  

Frustrated, I walk away from my computer, and come back sometime later.  It still says ""Connecting to Game..."".  I close everything out and request a refund through Steam.  Of course, they coldly deny my refund because the game time has 20hrs on it.  Of course, I didn't play the game for 20hrs, I played it for 0.00 hours.  But, the Steam folks don't care.  No refund.  No sympathetic ear fo a newbie.

If you are a current user of FSX this release only adds some more stability to the Simulator and the .cfg is already tweaked to run nice and smooth.

There is only one reason that would make me go back to Boxed FSX and that is to fly the F-18 by VRS. I say that because the Boxed FSX version of that addon will not work on FSX-SE unless you also purchase the TACPACK.

Be warned, You will require a high-end PC to run it on high settings. And will spend countless hours tweaking your settings and config files to get those all important frame rates to a reasonable level.
Personally I think FSX days are numbered.

72,22847859,english,"After so many years it run pretty well. Ya, you have to get a stunning high end pc to run at full resolution, but it is also very enjoyable with a middle pc specs like i do.
The bad by doing this is that you have to remove something from the setting option menu to run smoothly, like:
-reducing AI plane (basically you are playing alone)
-reducing scenery object (like roaming on google maps, just ugly terrain image and few airport build.
-and more....

The best part of the game is that you can download and play with a great range of aircraft, paid and free.
The worst part is that the best planes come with a high weight in term of file size (+100mb), so if you choose those planes the PC will have to run faster and this means Frame Drop.

I found a way to balance everything, so i can still fly with other AI aircraft and land on airport with the main builndg on.
I reinstalled FSX on my PC more than 15 times, because after all  i wasn't happy with those setting, even with the balance.
Can be simply me, I think that the best part of the flying is the take-off procedure and landing, so im not enjoying and airport where there is no plane moving and no activity at all, maybe few cars going around the track.

What im trying to say you is that you need a very good pc to enjoy it fully, but if you don't care about AI, scenery building and you need just a plane and 2 runway... Go on!

In both case i Strongly reccomend the game!",1462641344,1462642077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198083207680,39,6,3632,0,2528.0,1566749916,,

75,22506413,english,"Still the better civil aviation simulator due to its extensive support with a vast selection of 3rd party addons. This means that although the base package is very dated, it can be easily improved with better scenery and aircraft for a more up-to-date and fun flying experience.

[h1]Performance and Playability[/h1]
The base game works fine out of the box with Windows 10 and because it’s from 2006 it should run on the average computer without difficulty. However I found DX10 to be mostly broken on various graphics cards, its hit or miss whether it will work for you – if it doesn’t, DX9 mode will play fine. This is simply because the DX10 that came with the game was only a preview build rather than a full DX10 support.

Another thing to note is that when you start installing lots of addons, the game does suffer from performance issues relating to the fact it’s a 32-bit. While there are no-shortage of community config file edit suggestions, the only thing that will really help is a really high end computer here (notably cpu etc.). To avoid issues, simply be wary about what you install as some scenery addons can be terribly un-optimized.

[i]NOTE: This Steam Edition is essentially the 'Gold Edition' of the game, which contains the base FSX and the Acceleration Add-on in one install. It also uses Steam multiplayer instead of Game-spy. I have however found this version does not contain all the SDK files which were found in the Deluxe edition of the game, but most of this can sourced with a few google searches. None of this really matters unless you are going to be developing content for the game or trying to install a really outdated add-on that doesn't work around the newer service packs.[/i]

[h1]Aircraft[/h1]
The game comes with more than a dozen aircraft, ranging from airliners like the [b]Boeing 737[/b], bush planes like the [b]Piper J-3 Cub[/b], General aviation planes like the [b]Cessna 172 Skyhawk[/b], classic warbirds like the [b]P-51D Mustang[/b], and even some helicopters thrown in the mix such as the [b]Robinson R-22 Beta II[/b]. All these come with detailed cockpits and various paint scheme options.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679814115
While this is indeed a reasonable selection of planes included for new pilots to the game, it has to be said that experience does improve considerably when getting 3rd party aircraft as these are not only better looking, but can feature more accurate flight models.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
Multiplayer works out of the box via Steam, is pretty easy to join and works well. However the game does not come with a dedicated server, but there are 3rd party hosting applications (Such as [url=http://www.chocolatesoftware.com/fshost/]FSHost[/url]) that will fill this gap.

Exploring during a group flight with friends is something I really enjoy, and one of the things that keeps me playing FSX. 

[h1]Free Flight[/h1]
In Free Flight you can choose to spawn at nearly any airport in the world with the aircraft, time, and weather conditions of your choice. From here you can file a flight-plan or just fly wherever you want. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679813932
While the scenery included by default is global, it is strongly recommended you do replace it with either payware such as [url=https://www.fullterrain.com/]Orbx FTX[/url] or freeware such as [url=http://ninetwopro.com]FreeMeshX[/url] as it is very lacking and not very accurate by default. With modifications it can become really nice to look at and will improve your enjoyment of the game.

[h1]Missions[/h1]
There are dozens of included missions with the game, ranging from tutorials, to racing, to landing on an aircraft carrier! There is quite a varied selection here, with skill levels ranging from beginner to expert, and mission lengths of around 15 minutes, up to a few hours. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679813639
No career mode is included, just individual missions, but plenty to keep you busy here.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
So if interested in civil aviation or aviation in general then FSX is well worth the purchase, but do so under the knowledge that your experience will improve considerably when done so with 3rd party addons, even if freeware.

[b]Good[/b]
Varied selection of included aircraft (good, however not as good as payware)
Steam multiplayer
Vast selection of payware and freeware mods
Global Scenery
Lots of available missions

[b]Not so good[/b]
Included aircraft flight models lacking (can buy payware aircraft that fly more realistic)
Default scenery outdated (can be improved with freeware and payware)
No included dedicated server

FSX includes a flight planner and has a fully implemented GPS simulation, you can make a flight plan and then configure autopilot to travel to destination, ATC is capable of correctly guiding you in all phases of the flight , also AI traffic is implemented correctly, you will see other planes during the flight or at the airport, taxing or on runway, ATC will handle it all right

I recommend this Flight Simulator cause I spent thousands of hours playing it since Flight Simulator II was out on Atari Xe System back in the 80s and I'm a big fan of this series, also it has a huge community making content both paid or for free, there are also mods adding combat capabilities to the game engine.",1452724308,1461090894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198073097631,299,33,3517,0,2491,1571926710,,

20,22464588,english,"If I had to think of a single purchase in my life that returned the greatest value for the smallest initial investment (5 dollars on a Steam sale), this game would have to come near the top of that list. I've never flown an actual plane and don't know if I ever will, but I certainly feel like I could now, and I owe that all to this game. 

Of course, flying a real plane and flying in a simulator are never going to be identical given the level of potentially life-threatening danger involved with a real plane, but at the same time, this is software that instrument-rated pilots use to keep their skills sharp, so it's probably the closest you'd get without buying a multi-million dollar simulator. At the very least, you will learn the fundamentals of flight.

I never purchased any DLC because I didn't really see the point, as there was already a good collection of default planes (and excellent freeware depending on where you look). On top of that, there are around 24,000 airports covering basically every country on Earth.

There are quite a few missions and they're structured more or less like tutorials, teaching you everything from the ground up and ranging to emergency situations/expert level missions. 

There's even a mission where you are a stunt/trick pilot who has to land on top of a schoolbus driving down the runway at 50 mph. Flying Hannibal's route through the Alps into Italy, or landing at Lukla at the base camp for Mt. Everest are some of my favorite highlights too.

The rush you get during the last two minutes of every landing is one of the best feelings I've ever experienced, so I can only imagine what it must be like for an actual pilot. Landing a fighter jet on a carrier in high-wind or taking off after barreling down the slope of Mt. Fuji in an Orion on Skis, how could you possibly go wrong there?

47,22314750,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator X (Steam Edition and all that bull...) is a great flight simulator, and a game.

I used to play this game from the boxed edition (Golden Edition), and I had a blast of a time, sitting for hours on end trying to figure out how to automatically land an Airbus A321, or just sitting for hours on end just flying, admiring the scenery (which to modern day standards, isn't the best, but hey, it's an oldie). 

When Gamespy decided to fuck over many who enjoyed anything multiplayer, I was left stunned, and resorted to weird methods to manage to play multiplayer with friends of mine. But now with Dovetail's 'new' game, it's given this old gem a new platform, more players and all from the comfort of using Steam as a multiplayer platform. Multiplayer still has it's downsides (compared to the previous Gamespy thing FSX had). Voice chat still sounds like everyone's face-fucking a blender to no avail. Planes jitter if you try to fly in formation with friends over the internet. All of these issues were common with Gamespy, so no change there.

Knowing Dovetail's track record with Train Simulator 2016, FSX(SE) has more DLC than a pimples on a prepubescent teenager's face, and that's saying something. Although this isn't much of a bad thing, it allows everyone to buy payware aircraft from one centralised platform. If anything, this pleasures Lord Gaben's cock even more when those sales hit. 

I think I've wrote too much, so I'll simplify it,

You will probably have to spend a few hundreds of dollars for add ons and DLCs for taking the default (outdated) graphics to the next level.

Yes, an awful way to start a review, but really, this bug-riddled version of the otherwise excellent simulator is just bad.

In the last couple of months, I've had one ""successful"" flight. I say successful, it did end with the game crashing when I reached cruise altitude, but heck, I got to take off at least.

If you want to experience top notch bug searching, self patching and painful bad-review writing, then this IS the game for you. Otherwise I would recommend PREPAR3D over this any day. Now I totally regret buying PMDG for the Steam Edition.

Also, the support for this game is pretty good, but when there's no error logs or anything other than ""Application Hang"" - Yes I know game, please give me more information. - Then it's to no avail.

So, Microsoft Flight Simulator X on steam improved absolutely fuck-all! The only difference is all the DLC that dovetail pile onto every game they endorse! But like the antidisestablishmentarianist I am, I bought it because there's something enjoyable about flying a big metal box with rockets strapped to it over the ocean then trying to get it back down again.

80,22171133,english,"It's about time I gave my opinion on FSX:SE.

I never owned the boxed edition of FSX, however, I had a friend of mine who did, and he reccomended that I get FSX. I got it about a year ago when it was on sale for $5.00. When my friend found out, he was as excited as I was.

Simply put, it was the best $5 I ever spent. I love FSX:SE. As this was my first full fledge flight simulator, I didn't need all the bells and whistles of newer flight sims such as X-Plane. I just enjoyed flying planes. I really learned a lot playing this game, as it taught me the basics of aircraft flight. I started off on small Cessnas and Pipers but gradually worked my way up to larger Boeings. The default aircraft are good but not perfect. If you are just beginning, you won't be able to tell the difference, but if you are an experienced flight simmer/actual pilot, you will see some things missing. However, if you get bored with the default aircraft, you can always download more planes for free at simviation.com.

The multiplayer is very fun. The Steam multiplayer works well and I enjoy flying formations and airline hops with other players online. As a member of the FSX Competition Center, I can participate in landing competitions online. However, I do have a few complaints about multiplayer. The first is that the microphone communication is TERRIBLE - it's almost impossible to make out anything anyone says. It is for this reason that most servers use TeamSpeak to communicate. I personally prefer using the chat box. My other issue is that you can't use the direct connect feature - which prevents FSX:SE from playing online multiplayer with FSX Boxed. This was something dissapointing I found out when I tried playing with my friend - luckily, he recently purchased FSX:SE himself, so now we can do multiplayer! My last problem isn't with the multiplayer itself, but with the people. Many people on the SE multiplayer are less experienced than people who played the boxed edition. So if you want the most realistic ATC multiplayer possible, you may want to get VATSIM (which works great with FSX:SE BTW).

The graphics are nothing special, considering this game is over 10 years old. But I can ignore poor graphics if the gameplay is good, which the gameplay in FSX is OUTSTANDINGLY FUN!!! However, if you want improved graphics, they have addons for that.

The most notable thing about FSX:SE is how WELL it runs on my PC. My laptop is far from a gaming powerhouse, and it even struggles to run some of the most basic games at times. However, at times, I am getting maximum framerates on FSX:SE at high settings! FSX:SE is the most playable game on my PC by far, so if your PC is weak, don't worry, it will likely handle FSX:SE fine. Also, I'm running Windows 7.

In the end, FSX:SE is a great flight simulator. It has excited me for hours and taught me a lot about aviation in the process. It may have even inspired me to eventually get a real pilot's liscence! If you are a beginner or expert in flight simming, and you want an excellent flight simulator that will grow with you, then FSX:SE is the game for you. I give it a 9.5/10.

1st point: It's highly convenient. Microsoft set it up with simplicity in mind, it works well with both old and new joysticks, aircraft are set up to fly as soon as the game has loaded without any random surprises & it's highly modifiable with semi-competent knowhow required. If you're after complexity to rival the real world you can set that up too.

2nd point: The whole world is in the simulator, and is practically complete. Fly from seattle to Sydney with a stop off in Honolulu & you can see iconic buildings, entire downtown districts surrounded by their suburbs and dynamic weather if chosen to give you a near perfect realistic experience. The detail the microsoft team put in with the default game is unrivalled.

3rd point: The support online is huge. Add mods to update the games graphics to todays next-gen standards, or add to your library of flyable aircraft with hundreds, if not thousands of additional aircraft.

4th point: The age of the game is getting up there. Released in 2006, the last support for the game was in around 2007-08 before microsoft discontinued the series after disbanding the dev team. Dovetail games, the new publishers have been denied access by microsoft to modernise the internal code to utulise todays hardware. What this means for you is if your pc is newer than 2009, regardless of your pc's graphics power you will have performance issues. Stuttering, low framerate will be a plague unless you can tweak your system and the game's external code to fix performance, and these tweaks are different for each computer, requiring a high level of competency in knowing what you're doig. This is the biggest letdown & you can blame microsoft for that.

The other option is X plane 10, but that's not perfect either unfortunately. Watch that space though, the game developers are still highly active...",1459304713,1459304713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198062351907,51,4,1466,0,1323,1459311874,,

When I first bought FSX, I thought the technology of the plane would be too complicated for me, and that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game due to me not having the throttle. I was wrong. While you do have lots of tech at your disposal (Especially in larger planes like the 747), most of the tech is optional. After watching a quick Youtube tutorial, I was already a pro! On my first take off(In Moscow), I crashed several times (but I had fun). Then I tried doing an actual flight, from Montreal (YUL), to Ottawa on a smaller plane (I tried with a 737, I failed), I enjoyed the beautiful and realistic views during the flight, I failed the landing. To this day, I still fail at landing. I remember doing a longer flight, going from Shanghai (Pudong) to the Japanese coast in a fighter jet, that is the farthest flight I have ever done. I love the game, I enjoy doing flights, seeing the beautiful and realistic views. This game is perfect for people that love exploring the world, the game is also good for people that like simulation games and people interested in aviation. I would recommend this game to any patient gamer. I give Microsoft Flight Simulator X an 8/10 realistic and very fun

I have flown this program on many computers both IBM types and on Apple. I have tried all the various versions and too many add-ons to mention.

I have a mid range computer running at 2.8 megaHertz (slow by todays standards) it has a great deal of memory, 4 cores, and it is running on Windows 7 inspite of Microsoft's badgering me to change my desktop to a tablet. I have been flying my Steam editon of MFS now for 3 months and I dont even fly my non-Steam edition anymore. 

My experience on the Steam edition is that it is smoother, a great deal less quirky at startup and shut down, better frame rates, better video all around, and even the sound seems improved (though I am not the best judge of sound quality since I have lost much of the upper pitch ranges of hearing). 

Here's one of my favorite Steam edition pluses, buy a Steam ed. add-on and have it flawlessly and quickly installed at purchase. That's a big plus in my book since my 'puter was once loaded with crap I bought to add-on but never could install it/them so that they worked well if at all (dont know how many $$$ I wasted with crappy install-yourself add-ons.

38,18666336,english,"A slightly re-vamped version of the 2006 classic.  Dovetail Games have agreed distribution rights with Microsoft for this flight-sim and released it on Steam late 2014.  Along with the distribution rights they have been permitted sufficient access to the code to allow them to adjust and optimise the sim to better suit todays PC.  That having been said, this is [strike]still a single threaded[/strike] [i]a poorly optimised[/i] 32-bit application and even the most powerful of todays PC's struggle to attain ""high"" frame rates, especially when you start to include a few add-ons.

That brings me nicely on to the add-ons.  Due to the program being around since 2006 there is an unbelievable amount of DLC available for this sim, before you reach for your credit card though, make sure that the supplier specifies that it is compatible with FSX Steam Edition or the add-on is listed in the known compatible add-ons on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/2/620703493312371968/]community page.[/url]

There are some very good add-ons that are free, there are some exceptional add-ons that cost quite a bit of money (A2A Simulations, PMDG) and there are add-ons that are free for limited functionality or can cost for full functionality (FSUIPC). The key is research, have a look at [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUDrRR-VW-U]Jordan Kings Freeware Video[/url] to get an idea of what is possible for nothing more than bandwidth. Alternatively you can very quickly rack up a £100 or more spend and still think there is room for improvement (REX, Orbx).

A final word about add-ons. FSX requires you to generally get your hands dirty when adding features, if you don’t know your “%appdata%” from “My Documents” make sure you have fully researched the product you intend to buy and ensure you are comfortable with the installation procedure before you cough up the dough for it. This isn’t the case for the DLC that can be purchased from Steam, though I have to admit, most of the Steam DLC doesn’t appeal (see edit at the bottom).

Regardless of whether you stay with the stock program or buy enhancements, the core sim can give hours of enjoyment if you have an interest in aviation. Users range from the complete novice that has only sat in row 14F of an A320 (me), to fully licensed pilots (so it must be OK).

Although not a requirement, a joystick is recommended as well as a bit of patience and a lot of reading. You can jump into a Cessna 172 and lark about, or you can plan a flight for the same plane and follow, as close as can be reasonably expected in a 2006 sim, required procedures and protocols.  If, for example, you buy a PMDG add-on you have to calculate the fuel for the plane based on the number of passengers and their luggage, then you have to program the flight management computer and select your route, waypoints, approach etc. It must take 20 minutes or more to get to a point where you can actually start the engines! Alternatively you can just jump into a micro-light and be flying over Friday Harbor in a trice, the choice is yours.

Edit 18/12/15: DTG are introducing a number of add-ons that don't deserve my original comment. Examples are FTX Trees HD, REX Texture Direct 4, RAAS Pro, Accu-Feel and a couple of the aircraft.",1445725138,1458768216,True,282,21,0.911383569240570068,12,True,False,False,76561198030867254,1182,11,43067,0,29811,1579296773,,

Multiplayer:
You can chose to be a pilot or the ATC at an aiport. This can also be done with freinds as you can share cockpit.

Singleplayer:
Great as well you can use a AI ATC or just go on a flight where ever you want.

65,21378090,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition (FSX:SE or simply FSX is commonly abbreviated by players) is a simple multiplayer or singleplayer game which falls into the genre of Simulation games, specifically Flight Simulation (if it isn't obvious already). In this game, you fly a plane in real-world terrain and airport layouts with real-time simulation.

Pros:
-Almost never crashes (on my system, anyways. See my system specifications listed below.)
-Real-world terrain, making you feel like you're a pilot.
-(Mostly) functional cockpit, which allows you to turn off engines, taxi lights, etc. There is also autopilot (both IFR and VFR).
-In-flight radio communications with audio in singleplayer. You can contact air traffic control towers and includes human speech (not ugly robotic sounds).
-Multiplayer support. Allows you to interact with other FSX players and plan group flights (commonly called 'hops') between  airports.
-Affordable for low-end machines (though I wouldn't recommend it much). You can still play it on lower-end machines and laptops if you can handle lower quality.
-Crashed only on one instance (for me, at least). It's when I open a new window when FSX is simulating a flight. I solved this issue by going into windowed mode (Alt+Enter).
-Missions. To challenge yourself.
-Public and Private Multiplayer. There are public servers, which are listed in the multiplayer window. Some are public but require passwords. There are also private servers, which can be accessed by entering one's IP address so you can play with your friends and without strangers.

Cons:
-LOTS of keyboard shortcuts. You're gonna have to get used to them.
-Can be hard to fly on your first days of flight. In my first days, I forced the turning too much and ended up crashing a lot of times. However, with some patience, you can easily fly a plane.
-Low quality terrain (though solvable with paid DLC). The terrain and airport's terrain are quite poor in quality. Though there are DLCs to solve this, they require money.

My opinions: If my playtime hasn't predicted what I'm about to say, then... here are my opinions.
It's the perfect non-combat full flight simulator and certainly the best one. I love the customizability (if not just a biiit pricey) but either way it's pretty realistic (though I've never been a pilot, so take that with a grain of salt). Multiplayer is smooth and the missions are really well coded and the voice acting is amazing! FSX probably has the best community, both on Steam and on its multiplayer.
I also like how it has Steam's direct messaging service built into it. I don't have to get out of the client to answer messages! Awesome!

On to the review:
------------------

Coming from the boxed edition of FSX to FSX:SE I notice/experience very few improvement to the sim mostly on how CTD (crash to desktop) occurs, before I could hardly finish a long flight, now mostly I could. Still there are errors that occurs that results to CTD but not as often as before, but occurs rather randomly in different phase of the flight.

One very noticeable improvement is to the Piper J-3 Cub default aircraft, before you could hardly land it without ground looping even when there is no wind. 

As a bonus if you have invested on some add-ons the odds are you could still ""add-it"" without a problem or at least with minimal fuss, but of course not all of your add-ons will work.

Would not recommed to a casual user (non-techy), but I could still recommend this game to people who would not mind not having a constant update and who could in one way or the other resolve their own issues or thru other users.

Way back when, I used to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 with actual CDs. A lot has changed since then. I’ve passed quite a few grades in school, I have a much more powerful system to play games on (I mean schoolwork… yes), and Steam is an integral part of my day to day activities.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623900512
What hasn’t really changed is Microsoft Flight Simulator. A lot of the elements, such as being a reasonably build product, hasn’t changed. MS Flight Simulator X is probably one of the last in a long line of flight simulators.

Being on Sale for 75% off I thought I might as well pay for the Premium version, it was less than if I was to just pay for the base game without any discount. Some of the DLC content is really just gimmicks, such as Rex Texture 4, which just changes runway textures at a cost of $27.99.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623827082
Going back to having a powerful system, I thought that a GTX 980Ti would be more than capable of maxing out settings while still providing a very high frame rate. I was kind of wrong in that department, as the game still uses the old DirectX 9. MS Flight Simulator X still has a lot of shaders and what not in DirectX 9, and even states “2.0 Ghz or higher (single core)” as a minimum requirement. Performance isn’t as great as I had hoped. Sure there is a DirectX 10 “preview” option (whatever that means) in the graphics settings, but that doesn’t really help out. A lot of DirectX 10 cards were in customer’s PCs before MS Flight Simulator X was put on the market, it’s just a shame that we will never see an update to address this.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623765534
Besides performance, graphics, and overpriced DLC, the core mechanics are great. I was surprised how easy the game was to play with just a keyboard and mouse – I did find myself using the keyboard instead of the mouse most of the time to fly however. It has certainly been a while since I’ve played a proper flight simulator, but I was piloting jet aircraft in a short period of time.

85,21785868,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator has been and still remains the gold standard of flight simulation. This version has, remarkably, been around since 2006, but has worn amazingly well. While it gets stiff competition nowadays from Prepar3D and X-Plane in particular, it can still more than hold its own.

For the purposes of this review, I am only going to concentrate on the default, ""out-of-the-box"" scenery and aircraft - in other words, what you first get when you buy this game. As is the case with P3D and X-Plane, there are numerous add-ons that can enhance the game enormously, but I think the fairest way to review a game like this is focus on what it comes with initially.

One thing I really love about Microsoft Flight Simulator X (hereinafter: FSX) is the extent to which it teaches you about the basics of flying. Quite aside from tutorial missions, there is a section called the ""Learning Center"" which has an incredible wealth of information. There are detailed instructions about how to fly each of the default aircraft, for instance. Then too there is a tab in the ""Learning Center"" called ""Lessons"". This will give you highly detailed ""ground school"" articles by professional flight instructor Rod Machado, along with practical lessons guided by Rod. You will learn the fundamentals of taking off, landing, turning, stalls, VOR/DME/ADF navigation, ILS landings and so much more besides. You can also do checkrides and, if you pass them, get a certificate that will go into your ""Pilot Rewards"" (an unnecessary but fun component of FSX).

""Boring,"" you may say. ""I want to fly, not study!"" Well, there's nothing stopping you from flying straight away if you want. (Indeed, I did.) But take it from me, repeatedly crashing because you have no clue about how to land a plane, or much of a clue about any aspect of flying, is not a lot of fun. Yes, it may take a bit of time to go through Rod Machado's lessons and study some of the other articles in the Learning Center, but it will enhance your experience of the sim enormously in the long run. And it is immensely satisfying when you apply what you have learned and begin to master new skills. FSX can, if you are willing to make the effort, train you in a way that its rival X-Plane will not. (I don't know about Prepar3D, so can't comment on how helpful or otherwise it is to flying and flight simming novices.)

There are two main ways you can play FSX. The first is ""Free Flight"". With this mode, you can select an airport and simply take off from it to go wherever. Or you can file a proper flight plan and fly from one airport to the next. If you change your mind mid-flight, just open up the appropriate menu and file another flight plan. You get pretty much the whole world - including Antarctica - to fly in. You also get plenty of noteworthy landmarks to see.

The other main playing mode is Missions. There is a great variety of different missions you can do, with difficulty levels ranging from ""Beginner"" to ""Expert"". Some of the missions seem a bit mis-classified though. Several of the ""Beginner"" lessons require some pretty advanced piloting skills, although you don't have to know about navigation or ATC interaction to fly them. In that sense, they are ""Beginner"" difficulty, but they're otherwise really hard. Other missions are more straightforward though. The missions are a good way to get acquainted with the different kinds of aircraft that FSX has to offer and see what types you like best (I discovered for instance that I really enjoy GA planes and airliners, but can take or leave helicopters and gliders aren't my scene at all). They are also a good way to challenge yourself in a variety of interesting situations. And if the default missions aren't to your liking or just aren't enough for you, there is no shortage of mission packs on offer (such as ""Cargo Crew"", ""Arctic Rescue"" and ""Dangerous Approaches"" available here on Steam). You get rewards for passing missions (nothing that special, just a ""sticker"" in your Pilot Records, but still, quite good fun).

Actually, there is also a third mode: Multiplayer. However, I have never used that, so can't comment on how good or otherwise it is. All I will say is that it doubtless adds another dimension if you want to use it.

Planning a flight couldn't get much easier in FSX. This process is very intuitive and easy to learn. I especially love the Navigation Log that is generated, and which you can refer to on your ""Kneeboard"" (press Shift + F10 for that) during a flight. Interacting with ATC is also very straightforward. The ATC window can be used to auto-tune your ""comms"" radio, although you can also quite easily tune radios manually if you want to do things more like a real pilot. Aircraft come with both 3D virtual cockpits and 2D panels. When you're in 2D mode, you can make mini-panels pop up (press Shift + 1, 2, 3 etc.) that give you access to things like the radio stack, throttle quadrant and overhead panel. Very handy, and saves a lot of fumbling around trying to find where things are.

As seriously awesome as this game is however, it is not without its faults. The ""out-of-the-box"" scenery of instance is pretty blah. Cities - especially less well-known ones - are not very accurately rendered, and the textures are decidedly average. Topography is one area where X-Plane 10 beats FSX hands-down. However, there are plenty of add-ons to improve the scenery (I especially recommend Orbx's FTX products), and at least FSX gives you buildings at airports, which certainly can't be said for X-Plane in a lot of cases! In flight dynamics too, FSX can be a bit ho-hum, especially when it comes to helicopters. Taxiing can also be rather fiddly. The ""Pilot Records"" section is a bit of a mess. It would be nice if some real airlines were represented rather than just generic ones (although it's quite easy to add new liveries). And because FSX is so old, it is only capable of running in 32-bit mode, which means that it tends to struggle with more sophisticated add-ons. 

That said, there is a vast amount of add-ons out there, and you can do a tremendous amount to FSX without breaking it. But the more advanced computers become and the more sophisticated add-ons get, the more FSX will struggle in the future. For now though, it still works very well and there are so many great ways to enhance it. Steam alone offers a lot of great add-ons, but there are more to discover at places like The FlightSim Store or Just Flight. No shortage of freeware to be found either (check the AVSIM Library for instance).

Another thing I sometimes struggle with is visibility. However, a neat trick I have discovered is to open a ""mini-window"" while in 2D panel mode and set this ""mini-window"" to Outside Spot view. This way, I can keep an eye on my instruments while being able to see easily to taxi or land. Best of both worlds!

All in all, I recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X very highly indeed. If you are new to flight simming and flying generally, as I was when I bought this game a little over a year ago, this game, with its Learning Center, will teach you a tremendous amount. It gives you a far better grounding in the basics of flying than X-Plane, which is really designed for people who already have a reasonable amount of experience. (Again, I don't know how novice-friendly or otherwise Prepar3D is.) And once you have grasped the fundamentals of flying, there is no end of fun to be had and discoveries to make. Be warned though that it is quite addictive once you master it (also the case with real flying, so I've heard), and while the basic game is very cheap (certainly a better deal initially than X-Plane or Prepar3D), your wallet can still suffer as you chase after add-ons to further fuel your virtual flying addiction.

No problem so far, integration into the Steam platform and community around is really great. I use external addons (like ORBX suite, REX4) and DLC addons, both work well. Eventually, having the game and its extensions in a cloud storage is a great advantage, and easier to use for the end user.  

Concerning FSX, the fact that a 10 years old game remains on the spot and still creates so much interest is enough to say. The real strength pertains to its open platform. A complete ecosystem and market place for all sort of extensions and enhancements has raised through the years, so end users can fully personalize their simulator with all sorts of airplanes, sceneries, missions … 

Probably what gives this game such a never ending interest, as you create and evolve into your own flying experience and strategy, the exact way you intend.

The roads, rivers, and lakes are done in surprisingly well detail. The buildings, not so much. Don't expect too much there.

The added attraction of the multiplayer capability makes an interesting new dimension to flight, where you have to avoid other fliers that may maneuver irregularly. The only drawback to the multiplayer realm is that you get an interpreted display of other's aircraft unless you have the exact same plane installed, with precisely the same name on your system. With there being literally tens of thousands of add-on aircraft and helicopters out there it makes it a guarantee that many, perhaps MOST, will be flying something entirely other than what you see. If there was some way to have the game transmit the appearance of the plane you are flying so others see you as you are, this would add a level of realism that would have me in multiplayer every time I fly.

54,21338935,english,"In real life, I'm a beginner pilot. To begin with, this game feels more like a ""adjust your seat and field of view"" simulator, than an actual flight simulator. I can't even comment on the simulation much, as I've only just got the game set up properly, although it seems very good from the 50+ hours I put up with the default view and flew around in the non steam version of this game.

When you first start the game, your field of view will be so far zoomed in you'll feel like a blinkered horse with its face smeared against the inside of the cockpit windscreen. If you want to look at your instruments (airspeed, altimeter, DI etc), you have to take your eyes completely off the horizon. VFR flight from the default view is damn near impossible.

To fix this, go to the game's settings, and note the key bindings for moving your eyepoint backwards (by default: Ctrl + Enter) and downwards (by default: SHIFT + Backspace). In your config files (Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX), open fsx.cfg in Notepad and set WideViewAspect to True (erase ""False"" and type ""True"". In the Cameras.cfg, under camera002, set InitialZoom to 0.3, so you have a bearable field of view (you can do this in-flight by holding the spacebar and scrolling the mouse wheel back).
Once you get in-flight, use the aforementioned eyepoint key bindings to move your view as you would like it, and if you hold the spacebar, you can use the mouse to move your view. When you let go of the spacebar, your view is locked there. Very handy IMO.

If you're hardcore and want all the options in-flight, an Xbox 360 controller doesn't really have enough buttons. You'll have enough bindings for your throttle, control surfaces, and I even set pitch and rudder trim, but if you want to mess with landing lights, carb heat, fuel mixtures, individual engine throttles etc, you'll need to mess with the keyboard bindings or invest in a proper flight joystick.
Sadly the game counts the keyboard's num pad buttons and the home, end, page up, page down, and arrow keys as the same thing, so you lose some key bindings there.

However once you've set everything up, this game is fantastic.",1455971689,1455971689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047548396,104,1,492,0,492,1455995930,,

80,21174959,english,"TL;DR: It's basically the same simulator that Microsoft published in October 2006. See the chapter about differences if you're not new to FSX.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]

Those who don't know the series, should know that Flight simulator X is called FSX by short. 

I've been using flight sim software for a long time now, and actually got the FSX: Gold edition for free from Microsoft in 2006, so i have spent some hours (about 1500-2000) in this before it was released on steam. 

In this review i will focus on FSX: Steam edition as a game presented for new users, and then point out the differences between the Steam edition and the regular one that was published in 2006. 

[h1]Flight Simulator for new users:[/h1]

To be fair, if you only want to play FSX for casual arcadeish gameplay, crashing planes and so on [b]DON'T BUY THIS[/b].
If you have checked out FSX on youtube and found HD videos of big living Airports, shiny ultra realistic planes, and other things that look very realistic, and think that this is what the ""game"" is, then [b]DON'T BUY THIS[/b]. These videos is a result of many add-ons, a beast of a machine, several short clips, and a lot of editing. They look incredible, but doesn't represent FSX for what it is. 

But if you are new to flight simulators and want to learn the basics of flying, and/or want to learn how to fly by instrument rules, or knows how to fly and want to fly from/to locations you know, you should buy this!

[b]A short list of what this simulator has to offer from stock:[/b]

Pros:
- It includes the whole world, with almost every airport (some big cities, but mostly blocky buildings at airpots).
- Decent flight model (How the airplane reacts to the world)
- Extreme rate of customization (see add-on chapter below)
- Many settings that allow anything from basic to advanced flights
- Decent amount of stock airplanes.

Cons:
- 32-bit architecture/VAS (See Add-on chapter)
- Poor performance (Very CPU demanding, and not forgiving for AMD users)
- Stock planes (very basic and does not represent the real aircraft very good)
- Add-ons (see chapter below)

[h1] Add-ons [/h1]

Flight simulator must be the sim with the most add-ons in the world. It's amazing how many developers that make things for FSX. Without the add-ons i would NOT recommend this simulator. An example of what add-ons you can buy/get is:

- [b]Airplanes:[/b] Anything from basic free planes, to really advanced and realistic airplanes like the Majestic Dash-8 Q400 or PMDG 737 NGX. 
- [b]Scenery (Landscape/Cities/Airports):[/b] Anything from free fan-made stuff, to professionally made add-ons from companies like Orbx FTX, Aerosoft, Flight1, and so on. 
- [b]Weather/Textures:[/b] Like with Airplanes and Scenery you can get a lot of other software to boost the quality of the weather system (new textures and possibilities to get the real world weather), ground and water textures. 
- [b]Tools/Mission packs:[/b] You can also get a lot of mission-packs, and other tools. Both freeware and payware. 


[b]Add-on cons:[/b]

Even tho FSX is nothing without it's add-ons, it's still many problems with them. Often to get what you really want, you need to pay a lot of money to buy all the good add-ons. And there is also the fact that the more add-ons you add to FSX the slower it loads. Some add-ons also cause problems with other add-ons installed (from minor bugs to FSX not starting at all). This happens more often with freeware add-ons than payware add-ons. 

Also because of the poor performance in FSX, and the fact that it's heavy CPU demanding (I got an 4Ghz AMD 8-core processor) you might not get to a playable framerate if you have combine a detailed airport with for example the PMDG 737 NGX (6-10 FPS). If you run Intel you will get a much better performance because of the logical cores in the intel processor.  

Also; Remember that this version of FSX is called FSX: Steam edition. Even though every add-on for FSX should work on FSX:SE, some might have problems if not optimized for FSX:SE

[b] 32-bit architecture / VAS [/b] 

[i]Disclaimer: Im no expert on how the architecture of software works, nor how VAS is built. The following are own experiences and forum research to find a solution to this problem.[/i]

The biggest achilles heel that haunt allmost every FSX user is VAS (Virtual Access Space). Im not going to go in detail on what it is and how it works, but i will tell you the basics, and it's limitations.

VAS is basically virtual memory (Note: this does not equal RAM, nor harddrive space). Each program you run gets it's own chunk of VAS that it can fill up. If the VAS limit is exceeded the program will STOP WORKING with the well known ""Out of Memory"" (OOM) error. 

FSX is built on the old 32-bit architecture. This limits the programs VAS to about 4GB. This becomes a major problem when you start putting add-ons in FSX. Too many add-ons, or add-ons that is poorly optimized will push the VAS limit and cause an OOM. 

The VAS will fill up over time. An example: FSX base game will take about 1,2 GB. When loaded into the world you will be at aprox 2 GB VAS. You then have a fancy add-on airport that takes about 300MB, and an add-on airplane that takes about 350MB. You then start flying with a VAS at 2,6GB. No problem you think? You take off and fly towards the destination, that is on the other side of the country. On your way you fly over 4-5 other add-on airports, and your VAS is suddenly 3,7GB. Then you reach your destination, and on final, about to land you hear a ""DING"", with a message telling you ""Out of memory"", and FSX quit. 

Another problem with the VAS is that it doesn't clear it's memory when you don't need it anymore. So if you fly a short trip from airport A to airport B where you reach 3,2GB VAS usage, and then start another flight from airport C, your VAS will still be 3,2GB. 

FSX Users have several solutions to avoid this error, like for exampel using a program to monitor their VAS so they can save the flight and restart FSX. Another solution is to deactivate all the scenery you don't need for the flight. Also, the AI traffic fills up the VAS, so be sure to have this set to 0%. Some developers also run the core of their add-on in windows and not FSX to save VAS usage. 

Other than that, it is NOT possible to fix this issue, other than developing a new simulator that uses a 64-bit architecture and allow higher VAS usage. 

[h1]Difference between FSX and FSX:SE[/h1]

If you are a long-time user of FSX and wonder if you should buy the steam edition, the answer is maybe. 

I will list the main differences i've found between FSX and FSX: Steam edition:

- FSX:SE is a re-released FSX: Gold edition, so all servicepacks are included
- FSX:SE uses Steamworx for multiplayer. FSX used gamespy (no longer supported after february 2013)
- FSX:SE can be installed on every computer you own using steam, and no CD-key required. Every FSX disc have a maximum installation limit of 5 before the disc is useless, and you had to save the CD-key.
- FSX:SE is still supported and receives updates. Microsoft doesn't support FSX anymore.
- Some bugs from FSX is fixed, and FSX:SE is tweaked to run better on modern computers.
- FSX:SE does however NOT include the SDK that's included in FSX.

There might be even more differences that i haven't noticed/forgot about when i wrote this.

Overall it runs slightly better than FSX, and when i finally had to reinstall FSX i landed on using the steam edition. 

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

I recommend FSX:SE because of all the add-ons from FSX, and that there are few other decent options out there. You should also check out x-plane 10 and P3D (Lockheed-martins version of FSX).

The base game may look below standards today, but you have to remember its coming onto 10 years old. However there are plently of various add ons that change that. Since buying this I have bought several add ons and though some are a tad expensive, the change to the sim are worth it.

There is quite a steep learning curve, especially if you decide to get one of the advanced aircraft. But its had to beat nailing a landing in bad weather :)

The only downside to it is the fact that its showing its age and cannot use modern PC's to the full. I have had several instances of ""Out of memory"" errors when trying to run everything on ""High"". Other than that, if you like flight sims and you dont mind a challenge, go for it.

41,20021846,english,"I originally wrote a long-winded review on this title, with the developer actually replying in an obviously scripted manor.  Needless to say, in the months since nothing has changed.  Starting out with the game, don’t let the title fool you because this new ""edition"" is the same Flight Simulator X that’s been around for over 10 years.  There is nothing additional added.  There are no additional default aircraft, the scenery isn't better, it' only some minor workarounds that have been done.  Let me explain that further…

While Microsoft is still the developer of FSX, Dovetail Games has taken over as a “publisher” for this title.  Now, it might sound a little unclear but here’s the facts surrounding Dovetail’s involvement.  They’ve done some work on the multiplayer aspects of the game, making it once again “functional”.  Not that you couldn’t play multiplayer before Dovetail got involved.  You just needed a 3rd party program and a little instruction from a Google search to get connected with your friends.  Now, due to Dovetail's involvement, that method of multiplayer has been blocked so they can provide a centeral hub for all games.  They also made the game “Steam Compatible”, which is another way of saying they modified the game so DLC could be directly installed by Steam.  That said…

When you discuss the core of the game, nothing has changed.  The scenery is still the same.  The default aircrafts are still the same.  The interface is still the same.  It’s all the same as it was 10 years ago.  Nothing has changed or been added to this new ""edition"".  There have been no noticeable improvements, quite the contrary.  New bugs have crept up that cause the game to occasionally crash.  This coming from someone who has had the original FSX since it originally launched.  So why would Dovetail resurrect a game that is 10 years old when Microsoft itself doesn’t see fit to keep on the store shelves?

To answer that question you only have to browse other simulation titles by Dovetail.  The company is the kings of DLC content.  Look at their Train Simulator 2016 game.  There is very little content included with the actual game yet the cost of all the DLC for it, 232 items, comes in at close to 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS!  The DLC for Flight Simulator X is a little more tame, only around $650 for all of it, but that's still fairly ridiculous considering nothing has been added to the new ""edition"".  THIS is the main focus of Dovetail bringing FSX to Steam.  It’s not to make improvements to the game.  It’s not to fix the glaring bugs they've added and fix the outdated graphics.  It’s to sell DLC so they can make a quick buck off an old (and relatively dead) title.

If you already own Flight Simulator X… DO NOT BUY!
If you’re on the fence… DO NOT BUY!
If you expect new scenery… DO NOT BUY!
if you expect more aircraft… DO NOT BUY!

There is ONLY ONE reason you should ever consider buying this Steam version.  It’s the same reason I bought it.  Because I already have a large library of free FSX content that I’ve gathered over the past years, my DVD’s were damaged somehow, and this is the only way I can now reinstall FSX.  Don’t let my play-time fool you.  If I could have avoided buying this buggy Steam version and stuck with my original FSX, I would have.",1451278194,1451954551,False,192,24,0.646882891654968262,10,True,False,False,76561198078187111,464,101,1423,0,679,1596681386,,

I have just recently found an error that says "" Initialization of license library failed,"" this error has prevented me from doing numerous things in FSX:SE, for example: Change my aircraft from the PMDG 737-800 NGX, looking at the main panel with the instruments, the instruments show black, flaps don't work and none of the bottons or switches work on the overhead panel... After I do try to change an aircraft FSX:SE stops and exits me on to my desktop, because of this I am very confused. I have no idea if its the addons that I use or if it is my computer; yet, this is an amazing Flight Simulator game which, I am very impressed about. This error has stopped me from flying on networks such as vatsim, IVAO and the Steam multiplayer network. 
It would be very helpful if anyone knows how to solve this problem please reply on the page of FSX:SE. Please do not doubt this game it is amazing and is very realistic.

My imagination at the time.

I would become the vomit comit by taking a 747 overspeeding it at 30,000feet and dive down and push it into the fastest the game would allow. 

I would use a 747 to bomb entire cities with thousands of bombs.
I would recreate hijacking senarios, and other emergency situations. 
I would take a tour of the Hawaiian Islands.

Ive heard there are rumors that Dovetail is releasing a new Flight Simulator Game in 2016. I would like to reccomend a few things in the new Edition. 

1) DLC for more Airplanes: DO NOT CHARGE $5-10 PER AIRPLANE. Do not become EA.

2) Missions like Firefighting, Bombing, Attacking, Emergencies. Enable us to do more with the Airplane (I want to be able to interact with our game enviorment more)

3) Better Graphics

I also feel it is worth mentioning that my weak laptop runs the game perfectly, even with the PMDG 737-800. Many, I note our daunted by the apparent dramatic system requirements of simulators- yet it is worth mentioning that this game easily maintains strong preformance even on my pathetic laptop- wether it be minimum or maximum settings. 

An unfortunate downside of the game is that modding it can be difficult, and for those seeking to get a much more advanced/shiny preformance on their computers, you may have to devote serious time and effort to getting the pretty landscape or shiny aircraft you want. Though the PMDG products simply used an installer, few mods have this liberty.

Overall, especially when on sale (like now, 12/23/15) for four dollars, it is most certainly well worth the purchase.

I've owned all the versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator over the years and was very disappointed when Microsoft abandoned the Flight Simulation world back in 2008 or so.  When I recently bought a new Laptop and also upgraded my Desktop to Windows 10, I discovered that I couldn't get my MS Flight Simulator X DVS's to load on either computer.  I also discovered that it was impossible to find new MSFSX new anywhere, in stores or on line.  I hadn't even heard of STEAM but my 14 year old grandson did, so we went there and I decided to get the Steam Version.  Well, what a disappointment.  Not so much with the software, which so far seems to mostly work on the laptop but more with the horrible interface that is STEAM.  I'm not exactly what STEAM is other than a venue to distribute aging software titles, while offering little or absolutely no support along the way.

I have a IPhone and an iPAD and, although I'm not much of an Apple fan (I prefer the open architecture of the PC platform over the Apple), I am very impressed with the APP STORE.  But, trust me. STEAM is no APP STORE.

Realism of sceneries is quite a good for flightsim and i definitely like it, but realism of controls/systems in default models (even cessna) is far from realistic. I cannot setup circuit breakers, disable alt and or bat power, omg even fuel valve, open the door etc. Some of those procedures are in basic checklists! And it is damn simple cessna skyhawk!. Even open source simulator alternatives are more precise. How can you motivate young pilots with this junk?

When i crash, i simply crash and nothing is torn apart. No damage seen. But this is what i've expected from FSX. Its 20 years old concept.

Default aeroplanes like boeing or airbus are crappy. For example in airbus if i disable engines, the power from batteries are not depleting, many essential switches like electrical system are not active or they are not working at all. I know this is free variant included so i am not expecting FMC or pressurization system controls. But with basic model you have to be able perform basic checklists to motivate you for buying more sophisticated models. I am not expecting every system controllable on default model, but basic checklist components even on small aeroplanes are not working. 

Game acts to me as simulator framework with sceneries and a few hello world examples (default models). It is worth of 5 in discount but definitely not 25. If you want to start seriously, then i suggest to buy even older version of X-Plane for similar price or spend money(it hurts i know, but pilot training cost much more then X-Plane+HW:) to new version X-Plane. 

BTW: I remember funny situation when i tried to push fire extinguisher to on of my engines and they are able to start again:)))

As you correctly point out Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is a highly detailed and realistic simulator. It is not something you can just pick up and master in a few hours. There is certainly a lot to learn. 

If you are interested in developing your pilot skills you can simulate flight lessons with professional flight instructor Rod Machado. To access them click:

1. On the Main menu, click Learning Centre.
2. Click the Lessons tab.

That all said, we understand that simulation is not for everyone and that some players may prefer a more arcade type of experience. In which case we agree with you, this is probably not the game you are looking for. 

Thanks again for taking the time to write us a review.

97,19394881,english,"I will split this into a quick Good points Bad points and Neutral points, with a final conclusion at the end!

Good:

Highly Realistic simulation of aircraft
Great Price on offer
Active Multiplayer community
Lots of easy to follow lessons and missions
Free flight mode allowing you to plan and carry out your own flights.
Millions of addons available on the web (I do not recommend any of the DLC aircraft listed on steam personally)

Bad:

To get realistic planes you are looking at around $30 to get the Airbus or $70 for the pmdg, the default ones simply aren't that great.

Outdated graphics don't look that great.

Extremely unoptimized, people with GTX titans can sometimes get 15 fps from a 10 year old game.

CPU hog

Multiplayer is quite unrealiable



Overall

Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the leading product of Aviation simulation to this date, it is quite frankly amazing, but the fact that the market for a game like this is so small means that we will have to cope with the older engines as this is it as far as the FS series goes, however you cannot blame the devs for work done 10 years ago when this would of truly been a even more amazing example of simulation technology

You get a very fair amount of planes to choose from, not like other crappy flying sims that give you 2 planes to choose from and charge 10 dollar per plane.  You get around 20-30 planes, varying from holiday trikes to fighter jets. The virtual cockpits are also unique to each plane.

The atc system, wheather, flight plan system/design, tutorials, information etc... Are pretty polished. If the new tutorials didn't explain enough for you, they've got another section of tutorials from the older msfs games, which is PLENTY to wet your whistle.

my comments are aimed at not the concept of tuition which is sadly lacking in our hobby, but the way in which it is thrown at us the customer. Post purchase, I after reading a rather negative review was able eventually to navigate to some videos  and printed manuals which I hoped would steer me to the instrument flying tutorial, but no the videos appear to be corrupted and stutter their way through in an unfathomable fashion and the direction within the manual to go to the mission s menu  provides no mention at all of any addon material.
I feel sure that someone has gone to a  lot of trouble putting this much needed type of  package together and  feel that a short written statement from the marketing department as to where and how the ""academy"" may be located and accessed would have been a straight forward necessary addition.

-Dovetail gave it their signature laundry list of overpriced DLC. On games like TrainSim, you at least know you're paying for good stuff, but on this, it seems DT is just adding in a bunch of low-quality payware and even former-freeware addons at a ludicrous markup.
-To ensure their profits keep coming in, DT ensured that there would be enough tweaks to the game's code so that it rendered most third-party addons incompatible. (chief among which being VRS' TacPack)
-The multiplayer community is a shadow of its former self. While this isn't Dovetail's fault, they could certainly do a lot more to promote the multiplayer experience. There seem to be a lot of military groups; why not add an AWACS to their mile-long list of DLC?

Flight Simulator X offers different grades of realism for differend kinds of players, newcomers and professionals alike. Luckily, the Steam Edition also includes the ""Acceleration"" Add-On, which added a bunch of content.

FSX is great to boot up and take a short flight or spend several hours with, although the default aircraft aren't as detailed, there is tons of Add-On content out there, both free and payware. With it's plug and play system for new content, FSX made it incredibly easy to develop more, and most importantly, realistic content for. From aircraft that couldn't get closer to reality, with detailed cockpits and every switch working as it does in real life, to amazingly detailed scenery and sounds. Latter is often found in payware content, though.

There is also a multiplayer mode, so you can fly with your friends or strangers and even have real people in charge of ATC. If you want it even more realistic, you can join VATSIM, a network dedicated to giving you the most realistic flight experience right at home.

46,19083119,english,"For People who plan on using their sims for serious matters:

Why I do NOT recommend it:
If you are one who wants to make their simming experience as realistic as possible, I would NOT recommend this ""game"". At least when it comes to the feel of it The reason for quoting it as a ""game"" is because people who are serious about flying, don't want a game, they want a Simulator. FSX (SE) has been long debated wether it is a true Simulator or just a game. Of course there are always people who want to defend what they are used to and so you'll have mixed reviews. Truly, the flight controls, no matter how much you tweak this game or purchase more add-ons, will always be less realistic. This game doesn't feel like flying a real plane. It's close, but not quite there. Also, the standalone aircraft are absolutely obsolete. there is no way of learning much about an aircrafts systems when flying these planes. If having the feel of flying and being more into a planes systems without purchasing 3rd party Add-Ons is important to you, I'd reccommend X-Plane 10. The wise choice is to not go for this game when taking things more suriously but I also do. 

Why I recommend it: 
FSX, because it is so old, has made a lot of progress. The game itself is already a fun experience but when truly taking things suriously, one can just purchase 3rd Party Add-ons. I will be honest, if one plans on purchasing them, this game is a must for you. There are highly realistic replicas to real aircaft to buy that are absolutely a great experience. Such as the famous PMDG developers or A2A, RealAir. Then others such as ASN, REX and FSUIPC. If you have this kind of money, this game is perfect for you because such complex simulations do exist, but for a price. 

Summary:

Reasons not to buy:
- When wanting to get to know how flying a plane feels like
- When not wanting to spend more money to learn about an aircraft's system

Reasons why to buy:
- If you have the money, the best 3rd Part Add-ons exist and are great for learning a planes systems
such as: PMDG, A2A, RealAir

All factors can be important but overall, for what I look for in a sim, I'd recommend FSX (SE) more. The reason is because I find learning the systems before flying is more important. I do have the money to purchase 3rd Part add-ons and do. I own many nice Aircraft which have tought me great things. I also own X-Plane 10 and use it if wanting to practice Hands-on flying. Of course I also own 3rd Party add-ons for X-Plane. With about 6-7 years of simming in my life and 4800 hours of flying experience, I am happy to share my thoughts about this game.

50,19025898,english,"Review/How I made the game a good experince
Flight Simulator X, for the price is a truly amazing simulator. When you account for its true age (10/2006) it makes it even more astonishing. While only being on steam for a short while most of the modding community have embraced it although I will go into detail with this later.

The unmodified experience is great, until you start getting into it more. For my first 100-120 hours I was playing with just the base game planes and free online mods and it was plenty of fun. But once you decide to really get into it, say hello to montly subscriptions, goodbye to $500+ in addons and much more!
Here is my summary though.

Air Traffic Control:
The Air Traffic Control in hine sight is terrible but I never knew at the time not with only being new to the community, now I am a member of Vatsim and a paying customer of PilotEdge to get online ATC which greatly improves your experience.

Planes:
After that is sorted you get into the issue of planes. If you are happy with the stock planes, I urge you to continue using them because once you decide to expand on your library and get premium planes you struggle to go back to the limited ones. When purchasing planes also dont go crazy on your first purchase, and buy adverage planes. My first payware plane was the Just Flight Boeing 737-200Adv. and it is alright but as I continued to advance I discovered the wonderful world of PMDG. They are from my understanding the best addon company for planes on the market. I started off with their flagship, the 777-200LR/F package, a truly fantastic plane and then advanced to purchase the BAe 41 Jetstream which is where I run into my first truly major con of Steam Edtion. I learnt the hard way that not every mod is compatable with Steam Edition, and I can not urge you enough to ensure that any mod you purchase clearly states that it is supported because spending $50 on a unsupported mod does not make you happy (There are work arounds but it is not perfect). I am now wanting to add few more planes to my fleet then will be happy with that department.

Scenary:
I am yet to purchase scenary mods because I personally like to fly all over the world so purchasing scenary is just not going to work for me yet. But the option is there and the built in stuff is terrible but changing it costs a lot. If you fly in one area and VFR a lot then I couldnt recommend anything better.

Gameplay Mods:
The final polish in my opinion is mods like GSX (Ground Services), FS2Crew (Co-Pilot/Voice control), FSIPanel (Training) and many others that just add so much to the overall experince. GSX was the first thing I added to my collection because it makes all the time you spend on the ground a little bit more fun and the I got FS2Crew with my 777 which makes the games fantastic. FSIPanel is new to my collection and I am still to really play around with it but it will help make me a much better pilot. I also have mods like FSPassengers which add a goal to the game, to run an airline but that didn't appeal to me much. It will make some people enjoy it a lot more though. These either mean a lot to you or just about nothing, but to me these are probably the most important.

Conclusion:
I get asked a lot how do you have so many hours in that game. I reply I dont know :P At first look it looks boring but once you really get into it and put the time into planning out what you are going to do, roleplay and do it it is really damn fun. It has cost me a lot to get it to where i have it and it was not easy, trail and error like anything I guess.

62,18939346,english,"I've had this program for a couple of months now, and I'd highly recommend the steam version of FSX. They've done an excellent job of updating and integrating a very old flight simulator. I've bought quite a few add-ons for the program, and I haven't had any significant issues getting them to work, even when installing them to another drive and pointing back to the Steam FSX folder. So far I've installed Orbx FTX Global Base, Vector Global, PNW and NCA and Australia scenery upgrades, several of the Orbx airports; PFE ATC program, MyTraffic 6 (a little bit of an odd install, but it works well), REX Cloud textures (though the full REX weather engine didn't seem to like FSX:SE very well), an unregistered version of FSUIPC, and finally, and my favorite by far, A2A's Cessna 172 Trainer. It's amazing and has worked nearly flawlessly with FSX: SE.

I tried X-Plane 10 (and reviewed it separately), but even with it being a much newer simulator, and over twice the cost on Steam, FSX to me does a much better job of conveying the realities of flying, at least as much as a simulator can.

Recently, i got back to flight sims and i bought X-Plane 10 on Steam.

Played it a bit and trash it in my library.

Bought FSX and got shocked.

FSX is a dozen years older than XP and still better. It's not sooo good looking, but it has much more stuff on Vanilla.

Much more realistic scenarios and more planes and stuff, even the community is way better and bigger, with more stuffs.

This works MUCH better than the boxed version. Now time for the pros and cons:

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
• Less glitchy on newer systems
• Fixed major bugs and applied common fixes (e.g. HIGHMEMFIX)
• Ongoing support from DTG (Dovetail Games)
• Steam forums
• Add-ons available fom Steam
• Most freeware and payware works
• [u][b]SALES!!! [/b] [/u]
• Steam Multiplayer*

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
• Some 3rd party add-ons don't work
• Might crash on older systems (e.g. Windows Vista, Windows XP, etc.)
• [u][b]ALWAYS[/b][/u] requires an active internet connection to start the game. (DTG are going to make a workaround for this... hopefully sometime soon!)
• [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] backwards compatible with FSX Boxed multiplayer sessions.

All in all, this version of FSX is great for new systems and new hardware, but, if you don't mind the bugs, and all your friends have FSX boxed, you might want to get that and this so that you can play with them as well.

FSX: SE is indeed compatible with Windows 10. 

Windows 10 is a brand new operating system, and like all new OS, a few problems are likely to pop up. Likewise, many graphic and sound card makers are yet to release driver updates which are compatible with Windows 10. Things will get better, however it will take a little time. We understand that this doesn’t stop the situation being any less frustrating when you are experiencing unexpected problems.

We have compiled a list of possible fixes if  you are having issues running FSX: Steam Edition on Windows 10. While these fixes may solve the majority of problems, we cannot guarantee they will work for everyone. 

Please see either [url=https://fsxinsider.com/windows-10-fsx-steam-edition]FSXinsider[/url] or our [url=http://dovetailgames.kayako.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/160/14/windows-10---fsx-se-advice]support website[/url] for the list of recommended fixes.

PROS:

- Accurate Flight model
- Active Modding Community
- Active Multiplayer Community
- Active Sim Support despite over 10 years of development
- Exellent selection of aircraft to pilot
 
This is by far one of my favorite simulators of all time.  I remember playing this years ago with my buddy who got this to replace his 'Janes' simulator.  I can't talk well enough about this sim, it literally has everything, the whole planet, amazing aircraft, fantastic flight mechanics (STILL), an outstanding modding community ...

CONS:

- Dated Graphics
- Dated Current/Weather Models
- Empty World
- Airports!!!!
- Expensive Modding Community

As with any game more than 10 years old, things will start to look a little dated.  Some of the textures really need a reolution touch-up being they were made for old tube-style 240p televisions but hey - that's progress!  The airports are abysmal seriously, Dev's wanted to keep things light-weight rendering the whole world and all but still, abysmal.  The world while absolutely gorgeous feels somewhat empty even when you are online with DTG's FANTASTIC multiplayer addon.

I saved this part for last as in my opinion it is the most important and potentially the most controversial:  FSX:SE DOES still have a hyper-active modding community, but they don't come cheap.  There are a lot of free addons but for the most part, the supported and most widely used addons will cost TONS of money.  A single airport mod can run almost $40 or more and just ONE aircraft *addon* can run nearly the same figure (or upwards of $100).  For those of you on a fixed income like most of the world at present - You really need to pick and choose.

CONCLUSION:

For the newly initiated in the flight-sim community, FSX:SE is still one of the best sims in town despite the grey hair and crow's feet.  If you do just a little research, you can gussy this girl up to be the GPU/CPU Killer she was always meant to be (seriously be careful) and fly some of the best aircraft available today.  

A special thank you to DTG for showing the love to the flight-sim community and bringing us back from the shadows and into the ... well .... streetlights at least.  Great Job I look forward to Microsoft Flight.  PLEASE!!!!!

Coming from the regular boxed edition of FSX the switch to Steam Editon was a little bumpy at first with some of my favourite addons such as PMDG, Ultimate Traffic 2 and many more not working out of the box. Over time DLC developers updated their software to work with the new steam edition. So anyone planning to purchase FSX:SE now I'd say go right ahead.

For me I feel like the only really noticable improvement is with the content management now that DLC can be bought through steam. As for actual in-game performance I haven't noticed much/ if any improvement at all. If you play Flight Simulators often then the chances are you've built a pretty good PC to run the simulator well and so an improvement of 4 or 5 frames per second on top of your usual 30 isn't an awful deal.

Saying that I do appreciate how the multiplayer servers are back online and thus allow virtual pilots to fly together, this was a really nice editon to the updated game. 

All in all FSX is really a must buy for any flight or aviation enthusiast with thousands of DLC aircraft, scenery and scenarios to purchase from the steam store and online FSX is probably the most supported flight sim available.

It has to be said that I am no expert pilot, but I have been gaming for well over 30 years, and in my humble opinion, I would say FSX wins hands down on the overall gaming experience. Ok the basic game you download doesn't look fantastic (although pretty good for a 32bit system), and you may feel that it's lacking in something. But with little or no money you can get it looking and playing fantastic.

It was priced at $6, and by all means it was worth the money.
At first, i did have trouble using the controls 
I had to look at them atleast 5 times before understanding how to fly and land.
Do not expect it to be so easy at first.

When i learnt how to take off and land, it was so joyful and extravagant. Being able to fly above mountains,
and following other planes to piss them off.

The graphics are not the best, but hey its a pretty old game.
I think the normal price is a bit too high, but the game is definitely fun to play.

Tips - 
Try to get this on a sale, as it will be more worth your money.
Dont get mad because you cant fly at first, i had difficulties too.

8,17985564,english,"Flight Simulator 10 is an odd duck of a game to be sure. I feel some days it is not as much a game but an operating system. The potential is one of the allures to the game, some days it feels like it is as close as you can get to real world flying and have fun doing it. I own X plane 7 and 9 do not want to argue about realism.  X plane is the cheapest wind tunnel you can buy it can simulate planes that do not exist yet and can do things by the numbers, It is technically better a better simulator, so why not just fly X plane?  I have never been able to completely switch over because Flight Simulator feels more fun. 

X Plane uses a Blade element theory to figure out flight.  Lift is simulated by flowing virtual air over an approximation of a virtual wing. This is very good, the feeling of lift and interaction of lift and balance of a plane is well represented. If you design a new plane and want to sort of know if it works you can. It falls short where there are odd drag or flow interactions on a plane that make the perfect math model not match the real world. 

Flight Simulator 10 uses Table lookup so the planes are more of a grab bag. They only can simulate the Data and are only as good as the Data in the table. Some mod planes all feel the same because they don't have the flight model they deserve. It is cheaper to calculate the plane this way computer wise.  It has fun multiplayer and with a good plane it is wonderful. If I were to start today I would buy FSX 10 and the A2A piper cub http://store.steampowered.com/app/360080/ and a Joystick, and have fun.

Flight Simulator is not a trouble free game; it is much better as the steam edition then the boxed version of the past. All problems are solvable with some reading, and people are usually nice and knowledgeable. I needed to install the Orbx Felts field and had an error of missing building tops  I needed to write into a forum to get an answer, and it has been patched, but sometimes things don’t always work as you would expect them. I have had good luck with windows 10 no real errors or crashes when flying. I found if when I am choosing a flight and click out of the game window and start looking stuff up on line or starting other programs it will get mad at me and crash. It is a far cry from the boxed edition when I would save on a schedule so I didn’t have to start the flight over from the beginning and crash at the same spot. As long as the crashes are just in the menu and only because I am trying to multitask I can live with that. I also hope with continued development we will see 64-bit version in the future.

If you want to shoot down stuff, have latest technology or have a very short attention span then this game is not for you. If you love learning new things, detail, tinkering, flying, messing with how computers and graphics work, moding, or honing a skill this could be the game for you. 

I own but not the steam version of the A2A cub so I can’t review it on steam, but you can paddle it out on a lake and prop start it like a world war I plane and it is just fun. A2A is one of the best companys out there for DLC for FSX please support them. Can’t recommend the plane enough hope to see more Orbx and A2A stuff on steam.

There may be no actual new gameplay features, but a endless list of bug fixes to help support this classic, yet fantastic game onto newer computers makes the experience much better.

Back in the days before 2010 I would play the boxed editon, I would encounter endless crashes mid-flight for no apparent reason. I would be cruising at 35000ft directing to my next waypoint and all of a sudden, ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X has stopped working."" Then boom. Flight over. This use to drive me nuts. Thanks to Dovetail Games re-releasing the product to make it extremely stable with new computers, I can fly now without the stress and worry that the simulator would stop working.

If you have the boxed edition, getting the steam re-release is an absolute must.

If you don't have it, then I will still say the exact same thing, I have spent so many hours on this extremely versitile simulator. Whether I go for an IFR flight with a virtual airline whilst connecting to an online network with thousands of pilots and controllers or whether I go for VFR flight, I still get the same satisifaction.

Admittely though, if you are like me and wanting to take your simulation experience to the next level, you are going to have to purchase addons, to make especially IFR flights in commercial planes more realistic. As much as the default 737 -800 and A321 are ok to start off with, you become hungry to endevour in the replica aircraft, like the PMDG Boeing fleet that costs up to £40 or the Aerosoft fleet that usually is about £30. Then you want your home airports to look like the real thing and so on. You become to demand more.

This is game fantastic, But in my opinion, it is a very much a base package for what is an ever growing flight simulation world.

70,17612042,english,"Hello everybody, I have to say that I was very impressed with everything I've seen with FSX so far, I've flown a Cessna out of Groton-New London Airport in Connecticut while taking flight lessons so naturally this was the first airport I had to check out. And I was really surprised to see it was basically the same right down to the office building I use to do my PTI in front of before going up. The physics of the aircraft felt and behaved the same as if I was flying the real deal, Oh sure, a few of the switches and knobs were there for looks but I was really impressed with the number of switches that did work and even though a lot of the terrain is only 2 dimensional like what you find on Google earth, I was really pleased to see how much of the buildings and such was actually in 3D. I took a flight in a DC3 over the mountains in Alaska and from 9000 feet they were realistic enough that I was glad I was flying in good weather. The only real issue I had was every time I ended a flight or training mission or anything I would hit Esc like it instructed and all I would get is a black screen and that wouldn't take the program back to the menu board like I expected but just stay black until I hit the widows key and completely close it out at which time I would have to go back to the steam menu and hit play and start over again. This I believe to be more of a compatibility issue with Windows 10 and not one of the FSX program and look forward to getting it resolved very soon, even with all that said I'd say it was still worth the $13 I paid for it and am not worried this issue can't be resolved because the enjoyment I get out of running this program still out weighs any problem I have encountered thus far.  Personally I have to say that I can't fly or even drive to far anymore as a back injury put an abrupt end to all that a long time ago, and maybe that's why I am so grateful to have this program because even though it's called a ""Simulation Game"" it's a good way for me to get out and explore the world and see all the places I use to see and a few thousand more I haven't  all from the confines of my little apartment. I really have to hand it to the young people at Microsoft that put this together and continue to work hard everyday to make it even better and I have no doubt they will.
     If your the type of gamer that loves the feel of open world games and more realistic adventure then check this out, It's not perfect, then what is these days? I believe FSX has enough to do and see to keep anybody from getting board for as long,long time. The reviews and comments I have read that say the add-ons suck and some of the other aspects of this  or that aren't good enough, well all I can say to those people is just wait. It wasn't that long ago we were trying to hit a square ball with a short flat line to another short flat line on the other side of a dark green or black TV screen, Now one can fly one of many types of aircraft to thousands of destinations all over the world and talk with other people from around the world while you do it. Maybe FSX might have a few bugs but I think it's a really cool way to bring a world of people together instead of looking for a way to rip it apart. 
  Just one last thought,  the next time you go to see an air show and see a really cool plane parked in the hot sun but can't climb up inside to take a look because of the line of people with screaming kids got there way ahead of you, maybe you'll wish you spent the money on the simulated experience of flying it instead as long as you want without the long lines or the terrible parking or the cost of admission or gas to be there.

The default controls for helicopters on an xbox 360 controler are terrible! Worst part is the game will not save changes made in settings. Even if a save my settings in a config file and load it the controls setings are not restored. Every single time i load the game i have to reassign my controler and adjust the sensitivity. This is made much worse by the fact that the game freezes every time I want to change my aircraft.

The cockpits are nicely detailed and the controls are rather responsive. However, the game itself is barren. The terrain is much of the same, the cities are no different one from another. Alaska, for example is covered in cities that probably don't have the population the city sprites in-game would make you think they did. The worst part is actually wrecking. Don't worry about failing... Or actually damaging the plane.

And there is a utility out that allows you to connect one of those Oculus Rift DK2 devices FSX-SE (Flight Simulator Steam Edition shorthand name..important as FSX and FSX-SE are not always equal!)

Now for folks who have the BOXED version already: I feel your pain, your indecision....

Frustrated as I am that I own the box set and some new software requiring a latest version from Microsoft for the first time became a PAY ITEM! NOT A Service PAck! What the HECK! Had to buy it again here... if I wanted the new software to work (which I'm not happy about). Microsoft has bitten me a few times here and there over the years professionally, as programmers and Microsoft have a relationship of a different sort - often involving lots of money); this however is only a woe for folks who already had this software; and it is not a dig at Steam or the folks who seem to be maintaining FSX-SE now! Kinda nice to have some new blood in there that actually pops into the forums now and again - beats press releases only! lol 

No regrets - These folks optimized a lot of the stuff so out of the box you really can tweak the performance pretty sweetly after tinkering with the sliders and making tradeoffs speed/smooth versus sys candy - it's tough - deciding what to pick when you system can't do it all - almost seems to be part of the game is getting the thing tuned premo for your machine!

I have been mostly playing x-plane - love the physics - but the Virtual Reality brought me back; so I'm not a FSX-SE expert, however, after some fighting with things - cuz I break them making changes, add-on software etc... I am going run my FSX-SE once after this clean install finishes downloading... then I'm going to back up the entire FSX folder in steam.... THEN I'm going to tweak it so I can get things back without a full download again if things go wrong.

Don't get impression things go wrong all the time - instead - look at it this way - there are so many neat things you can add and enhance flight sim - well - sometimes these things don't play nice with each other - this is highly experimental - and usually not a problem - but every so often it's just easier to start fresh. (nice way of saying - i messed it up myself - its broke - it wont run - I killed - it but - .... never mind - its my fault) LOL

SO - Thinking about getting this? I recommend it.

On fence X-Plane or FSX-SE ? GET BOTH! Each have TONS to offer - different flight models, add-ons, aircraft.... GET 
THEM BOTH!

Oculus Rift Suppport? - There is a utility from FlyInsideX - I know it works with Direct-To-Rift or Shared Desk-Top modes, Direct-To-Rift is recommended. I have DK2 - So this I can say works and made me not give two cents about GPS, navigation, anything.... YUP.... Got me just flying... just flying for the sake of flying. 

I mean..  for me - this ... I mean I'm sitting at my desk one day hotdog'n a Mosquito One Man Sport Heli Ultra Light thingy - and I flew past something really fast and I looked back and then I stood up partially for some unknown reason while I whipped my attention foward - then , as if from another dimension, an disembodied entity punched me hard in the head - after my brain had a few seconds to realize that flight simulator isn;t haunted - I took the mask off, rubbed my head and saw how I slammed my head into My book shelf - some might think this is bad.. some might think nausea from a sim is bad.... ITS NOT  ....THESE ARE SELLING POINTS DARN IT!

Granted my rift locks up - why - dunno - fsx - dunno - the flybysim thing? Dunno - seriously but this is my recovery, rebooting being the last resort. 

Oculus Rift Frozen? 
- Turn Oculus RIFT Off - Keep PC ON! 
- LOG OUT (Don't shut down)
- Log back in
- Turn Rift On

Still Being Stubborn?
- Fire Up Rift Mode Utility
 + Switch it to SHARED DESKTOP MODE (wait for the flicker) 
 + Switch it back to Direct To Rift Mode

Still? Reboot! UGH! :-)

When you get some VR time in - you will forget all about the headaches... until it freezes up on ya the next time lol! So worth it!



Back to the rest of you with/without VR: Flight sim has all the radios, gps, navigation beacons, vor, airports from all over, and lots of eye-candy. Many hardcore simmers say get X-Plane for physics and FSX-SE for Eye candy.... Well - truth is you can manage both with both - but there is some truth in there - but there are really accurate flight models for some aircraft in FSX-SE while there are some real lame flight models for stuff in x-plane - but there is an important, undisputed fact in here....

FSX-SX Can look so freaking awesome! And you might have to look a little harder for those super advanced realistic physics models in FSX - but they are out there. There is even a tool to aument the handling of the FSX-SX helicopters to make them behave closer to life... HTR I think its called.

Anyway - this is a program you might find you use for years..take breaks perhaps but come back to.

HOWEVER.

With the upgrades dovetail made to the game, it is much better optimized than x-plane. On my laptop, x-plane stutters even when run on some pretty low graphics settings (to be fair it offers more, but it isn't as scalable as its advertising would seem to suggest and it looks fugly when you reduce rendering range). With FSX:SE I can run the game at some pretty high settings, and it looks much prettier than X-plane given the same frame-rate, plus FSX:SE doesn't stutter. I think FSX:SE has new scenery textures that make it look much better than the old FSX.

For most entertainment purposes, FSX:SE is a much better experience than X-plane. It is a much better game. The traffic and ATC is much more bearable. The default scenery is good, if a bit outdated, but it comes at a much lower disk space cost which I'm finding to be a great advantage on my laptop's tiny SSD.

For professional purposes and if you have a high-end rig that can stomach it, X-plane is still an excellent training tool.

Thank you for your question. All screenshots which appear on the Steam store like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/314160]here[/url] are taken directly from the game and have not been modified in anyway. The only thing we did was take them using a 4K monitor. 

You can adjust your in game graphics from the settings menu and we would advise spending a little time doing this. This video in our forum will teach you everything you need to know about setting up FSX: SE. 

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/541906348041878556/

Many players enhance their game with a selection of add-on content such as scenery or weather packs for example. It is always worth keeping this in mind when viewing screenshot outside of the Steam store. 

The good news is there are many fantastic free mods and add-ons that can improve the look of the game if that is something you are interested in. This video guide will show you how to set these up:

5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing",1437740308,1437740308,True,2,1,0.469879508018493652,2,True,False,False,76561198090024753,181,3,688,0,688,1432329414,,

77,13794284,english,"I'm a private pilot & Ive been playing this game since before it was Microsoft flight sim (it used to be subLogic)... And it is hands down the best flight simulator available. While it does have its weaknesses from a simulation point of view, no other flight sim has ever come as close to simulating all the aircraft systems like MSFS does.

Every switch in the cockpit works. For example, you can reach down & yank the mixture knob all the way out & lean the engine out... tune (or turn off) the radios with the panel switches... flip the master switch & the panel goes dark... all just like in a real plane.

MS abandoned MSFS some time ago though & we thought the franchise was dead. Heres to hoping dovetail will bring something new to the game and not just charge us for airplane/scenery downloads.

EDIT: Changed from recommmended to not recommended because dovetail is doing exactly what i hoped they wouldn't

Hey dovetail... i can download literally thousands of free planes the same quality (or better)... what makes you think i'm going to pay $20 a piece for them.

what a shame.

EDIT: Tried the game again after dovetail attempted to fix MSFS broken multiplayer. They somehow managed to make it even worse. On the ground, other players planes will often be seen sliding around as if on ice, of even bouncing 20 feet up in the air and sometimes disappearing below ground.  In the traffic pattern you can often see players aircraft flying through buildings, mountains and other secenery. This wont be a problem for long though, because you will lose connection before you get very involved with anything. MSFS's hit-and-miss voice com has been replaced with a new mis-and-miss system that never seems to work at all.

+More planes/airports/scenery than the boxes edition.
      F-18 Fighter Jets, Grumman Goose, more updated locations calls for a great flying experience.

+Configurible settings.

-Poor DLC packs
      If you've ever seen DoveTailGame's Train Simulator 2015, you'll most certainly know their cash-grabbing techniques. That resulted in literally $3000+ worth of DLC on that game. Here you have a few poorly executed expansion packs. 

-Multiplayer Mode [READ THE WHOLE THING]
     Little squeakers. It's inevitable that you'll find one on any game, no matter the type. One word. PewDiePie. He plays all these games (I am not sure if he ever played FSX, I didn't stay on his channel for more than 10 minutes.) and they attract little kids. That ruins the fun experience of a GOOD GAME. One time I had this little kid screaming at me due to me landing (WITH CLEARENCE) because he claimed to be the U.S. President, Obama.

I previously play FS2004 on my laptop, with many add-ons installed (REX, AI Traffic, etc) and it runs at 50-60 fps, Later when I tried to switch to FSX it lags really bad, without any add-ons I was running at around 15-20 fps. I tried many optimization guide on the web and none works for me. My laptop isn't very powerful as it only got a AMD A10-5750m CPU, and Radeon 8670m GPU. At the time, I gave up on FSX, and sticks to FS 2004, as I thought my system isn't powerful enough for FSX. Couple of months later, FSX:SE was launched and I read many reviews on the web stating that it really improved stabilty and FPS (not by a very large margin, the reviewers said). At first i'm not really interested in acquiring the Steam Edition, since I thought my laptop isn't powerful enough for FSX, but then FSX:SE goes on sale for around $2-$3, and I decided to give it a shot. I launched the game for the first time, and surprisingly, none of the lag issue I encountered before was gone. I got a good 50 fps, without any add-ons, and even after installing many add-ons such as ORBX, REX, and AI Traffics I still get around 40 fps, with occasional drop to 20 fps, when i'm flying near third party airport, with many AI Traffics.

As you point out FSX: SE is a re-release of Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition on the Steam digital platform. It includes all of the content from Flight Simulator X Deluxe, the Acceleration pack and both official Service Packs. We have made some functional changes to FSX in the development of FSX: Steam Edition most notably replacing the now-defunct Gamespy multiplayer systems and enabling multiplayer to work seamlessly once again over Steam.  However, in terms of content nothing new has been added at this time.

If you would like to find out exactly what has changed you can read the full details here: 

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/7/530645961936099124/

Since the release of FSX: SE we have also been working closely with players to further update the sim. The details for all the updates we have released can be found on the Steam announcement page here:

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/announcements

Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is compatible with all versions of Windows from Windows® XP Service Pack 2 onwards. We have tested Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 - both 32 bit and 64 bit (please note that FSX is only a 32 bit app) and can confirm running the software under all of these operating systems without need for workarounds. There are currently many players running FSX: SE with Windows 8.1 and if you would like some help setting up your PC to do this please get in touch with us via our dedicated support website here:

https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://dovetailgames.kayako.com/

You will also find a detailed knowledgebase on the website with answers to most frequent question questions we get asked about FSX. 

There are so many add-ons currently available for FSX that we cannot promise that all of them will work with no issues. Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is installed in a different way to the boxed version and occupies a different location so it is possible that some add-ons may not work, but rest assured that we have made every effort to ensure that as many of them as possible work. Where add-ons do not immediately function with Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition we will try to work with the community, developer or publisher of the add-on to find the solutions as needed. Again, we cannot promise that 100% of all add-ons released over the history of FSX will work with FSX: Steam, but we are committed to trying.

We understand that this can be frustrating for players who are keen to fly their favourite add-on, however many developers have already updated their add-ons to run with FSX: SE and many more are currently updating them. If you have a question relating to non-steam add-on we would advise contacting the developer who made it. These developers know their add-ons better than anyone else and are best placed to advise you on matters such as compatibility.

The graphics in FSX: SE have not been changed from the original release of the boxed game. If you would you like some help optimising your graphics settings for your PC, again, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us via our support website above. 

Finally you might like to check out the FSX: SE Steam forum where you can chat to your fellow players and find out how they have set up their games. You will also find lots of useful information in the forums regarding installing add-ons which might be of interest to you. 

Thanks again for the review and giving FSX: Steam Edition a try,

That is some strange behaviour you are describing there and certainly not what your average FSX player experiences with the game. Sounds like either the game has not installed correctly on your PC or something else running on your computer is causing a conflict. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may of caused you. 

If you are having problems running Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition on your PC please try the following steps:

[b]Verifying your game files on Steam[/b]
This causes Steam to compare all the Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition files installed on your computer against the ones it believes you should have. If any are missing Steam will update and download them. In order to complete this procedure you will need to be connected to the Internet. 

To verify you game files please do the following:

1.	Load the Steam platform and log into your account
2.	Click the Library tab in the menu at the top of the screen
3.	Click the List View from the view options on the top right of the screen
4.	Right click on Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition to bring up a popup menu
5.	Click on Properties from the popup menu to bring up another popup box
6.	Click on Local files from the popup box menu
7.	Click on Verify integrity of game cache from the Local file options
8.	Wait for the progress bar to finish verifying your files. Additional files may download
9.	Restart Steam
10.	Restart Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition 

[b]Free up your computer’s memory[/b]
Running lots of different programs in Windows at the same time may mean that Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition does not have enough memory available to run correctly. Your computer might be displaying an Out of memory error as a result. 

Please try the following steps:

1.	Check that your PC meets the minimum memory requirements to run Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition. The game requires 2 GB RAM to run. If you have less than the require 2 GB RAM then you will be unable to run the game. 
2.	Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete on your keyboard and select Task manager from the list options. Click on the Applications tab in the task manager to see all of the programs currently running in Windows. Shut down any additional programs you have running. Even if you have not started any programs running Widows may launch certain ones upon start up. Please refer to the Windows help files for more information about enabling and disabling programs when Windows starts. The less programs you have running the more memory will be available for Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition to use. 

[b]Reinstall Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition[/b] 
Steam provides the ability to reinstall the game to the default system. To perform this reinstallation, you should perform the following steps:

1.	Sign out off Steam
2.	Backup the disk containing your FSX installation
3.	Delete the contents of ""<drive:>\Program files (x86)\ Steam\SteamApps\Common\FSX\"" and all subdirectories
4.	Log on to Steam
5.	Select ""View Games Library"" from the ""Games"" menu
6.	Right-click the Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition icon and select ""Properties""
7.	Select the ""Local Files"" tab and click on ""Verify Integrity of Games Cache""

FSX: Steam Edition is compatible with Windows 8.1. You will need to run the game as a Windows Admin however. If you use the User Access Control (""UAC"") features of Windows, unless you are logged on as an administrator, you may be prompted to permit multiple program changes during installation. This is normal and can be avoided by temporarily disabling UAC via the Control Panel.

Further information about Windows UAC can be found here:

http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11841-run-administrator.html

FSX: SE requires you to run it as an Admin in order to access addition folders on your hard drive where add-ons not available on Steam may have been installed.

If you want a completely proffesional game you will need to set up vatsim but first you need to know the ins and outs of the plane. FSX is like the tariner sim, atc arent that importatnt right now and you can just go on free flight if you want no trolls and have atc. However in multiplayer you can share your aircraft and if youy have a friend witht he game sharing the aircraft with them is awesome. In my opinion i would buy this game in a sale, when it is around £5 and if you really enjoy it and want a more professional sim, when you are ready download vatsim/vpilot buy a payware plane and maybe some scenery packs.

51,16728195,english,"What can I say, been playing FSX ever since it came out. Awesome for anyone with an interest in flying.

Now, since coming to Steam, there have been a few, but not many updates from the original game. Main features are Steamworks integration, which brings online flying to anyone who wants it. In the old days you would have to play around with VATSIM and specific modules to get an online connection, which if you want to fly as accurate as possible is still available, but for the more casual gamer/pilot is a doddle. Works perfectly!

Also, there has been a DirectX 11 test system introduced into the graphics options, which not only improved framerates on my GTX660Ti, but also made the scenery look better. Only issue I had here was with the CamSIm aircraft, whos landing gear doesnt appear in DX11 mode, but that isnt a problem with the game, just older addon freeware aircraft, although out of the many I've tested this one is the only issue.

Also, from what I've tested, 99.9% of previous addons still work brilliantly. I use many of the UK2000 airports from my old FSX copy and they work fine in DX11 mode, along with the POSKY 73s, 74s,, 75s, 76s A330s and A340s, alongside the old iFDG A320 series for FS2004. Alongside these are many other various aircraft which I have loved to fly again.

Only issue I've seen is with some of the new DLC loaded alongside on Steam. As some of these are just a single aircraft with a saved set of flight plans for a ridiculous amount. Many packages like these can be found on sites like FlightSim.com and AVSim.com which will still be compatible from the original FSX and work fine in FSX Steam Edition.

All is all, still highly recommend this game for anyone with a passing interest in flying or higher.

Also, get a decent joystick or flight yoke if you can. I use a Saitek X45. If you do invest, ensure you have both a Rudder and Throttle controls.",1435355786,1435355786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198008193009,699,11,5829,0,2989.0,1534801830,,

On my laptop I fly with just a 360 controller, and it also works fine.
So you can really have the best of both worlds with FSX. A complete sim pit, or just an xbox controller. It's really up to your preference. If you want to hang out on the back porch and drink a few road soda's while you fly from NH to NY in a Cessna on the laptop, that'll be a good time. If you want to rip a leerjet from coast to coast with a yoke and pedals, you can do that too. It can be as high or low fidelity as you want it to be. I prefer my simpit, but on a nice afternoon I don't want to be cooped up inside, and the laptop w/ xbox controller is enough to get you into the air and back down (although the TPM control would be nice, the B and Y buttons for throttle can be tough if you don't keep an eye on the RPM's).
There are plenty of addons for the game, most of the good ones are payware. I like some Carenado products, but A2A's Cessna is right on... You can burn out the starter, foul your sparkplugs, kill the battery, flood the engine, cylinders can loose compression... quite a bit can go wrong, making it more fun.

If you are an enthusiastic or just passionate about flying and flight simulation, pick it up impulsively

This is the 3rd time I have bought this product and in ten years time if it is available to buy I will buy it again.

It is the be all and end all of flight simulation, there is nothing to compare it to, it is peerless.

There are of course other flight sims e.g X-plane that may have a better physics and flight engine, but as a whole gaming experience I still think FSX flies the highest. A deeper experience.

And this is the first time I have been able to play it on ultra graphics settings.
I loaded up, took off from Heathrow EGLL in a Lear Jet, flew low over London, turned right at the Post Office Tower and over Tower Bridge and landed at London City Airport. Watched a replay from London City Tower then wrote this review.

Forget all other flight sims.

As real as it gets. 12/10

84,16570000,english,"When you first start the game figuring out the controls can be a hassle and although flying without a joystick is possible, you are going to need one if you want to be able to fly properly. However after that is all figured out, it is an amazing game to play for professionals and people who just feel like goofing around. There are fun missions for times when you dont know what to do and tutorials for newcomers You are going to eventually have to buy some payware addons to really make the game shine, but there is plenty of freeware like project opensky aircraft if you dont have the money. The game does not appear to be hard on your computer and has a really good community. The graphics are ok considering when it was made, but they could be better especially the water and there is no wingflex for the default 737 and the gear doesn't tilt in the 747 which is a realism killer. The clouds also magically fade away when you get near them and there is no volumetric effect. I would definitely recommend this. After making the move from x plane to fsx i feel that the colours look my vibrant and less gloomy, better freeware, more payware, and the wingtip vortices add a nice feel. In terms of physics, i have never flown a plane myself but the physics in airplanes feel not completely realistic but pretty good in my opinion. The touchdowns feel a bit stiff but the overall flight doesn't feel ""on rails"" as others say. Helicopter physics do not feel very realistic. They are too stable and easy to control. For how i like to fly though the physics suit me perfectly and i personally dont want that realism but i know others will. The atc is easy to use and great for beginners aswell. No need to go all professional and download flight plans, all you need to know is where you are leaving from and where your destination is. All in all i give this game a 7/10 by itself but if you include the vast amount of addons i give this a 9/10 Even if you think a 7/10 is a bit low my opinion is to watch and read some reviews, look at some pictures, if youve already done that then my opinion is buy the game. For total honesty, there is an 88.5 percent chance you wont regret it

Make sure you play with a joystick, even a cheap one. I got this game on sale for $4.99. Totally worth it. The game runs smoothly on my i5 laptop with 620M GT graphic card (lower mid-range).

One thing that is missing that I wish Dovetail would include was support for Steam features like trading cards, cards achievements and Steam Workshop. Right now Dovetail is focussing on making a new sim, (As of June 2015 still In early development according to DTG) which would probably have these  features.

FSX still operates the same and for me, I won't even use Steam Multiplayer within FSX, I just bought the SE version as it allows the game to receive updates as and when they become available, if this will happen at all and I just bought it thinking it might be slightly more stable which it is.

45,16428223,english,"Its as good as FSX ever was. The main improvement is that the multiplayer is now based on Steam rather than the defunct Gamespy (nice work). Also, if you're so inclined, the Xbox 360 controller is perfectly mapped out of the box, which I'm sure must be a new addition. Dovetail have made a really good job of this.

However, off the shelf, big 'survey simulators' like this represent the core of a simulator eco system. When FSX (and versions before it) was developed, Microsoft included a world that was passable, and in places quite detailed, but not detailed enough for VFR flight, and included a collection of aircraft, no single one of which was all that realistic, but was intended to be accessible to most people with an interest in aviation.

So what you're buying here is a product that is really just the tip of the iceberg. That's confirmed by the number of other companies that spend 100% of their time making, for example JUST scenery for FSX, or JUST as perfect a representation of a 747 as you can possibly get. Microsoft or Dovetail aren't going to spend their time creating ultra-realistic content because they don't need to, they can sell FSX as a platform to other developers that do that.

That said, you get a more 'complete' product designed for the home with FSX than you do with for example X-Plane 10 (X-Plane 10 is a very different beast and again, the core of a giant industrial sized simulator). Also I believe Microsoft worked with Cessna on this one, so the Skylake can't be all that bad.

I understand profit, but some upgrades to the existing scenery quality, flight dynamics and even some free addons would probably go far in maintaining a fan base and would definately encourage people to buy some addons (I have several) because they would see the company as being invested in the simmer which at this point I simply don't see.

87,16127075,english,"I've had both FS9 and FSX since 2003 and 2010 and enjoyed both until all the good FS Host servers died and the MP feature of FSX was turned off. Just having MP back is good enough to buy the Steam edition, but there are other reasons also.  The game is more stable than the older box version, I've yet to have it crash because any one of the many dll's stopped working. The frame rates are better, not only faster but smoother too. In general to me everything about it seems new again. 

You only need to buy 3 things for FSX and the last one is optional

A good stick and throttle controller

Paid license for FSUIP to unlock your controllers full potential. You can use it for free but you only get just the barest of functions

A 3rd party weather program, this is optional as the live weather in the sim seems to be improved.

Things I like about this

More stable than the original release

Faster frames and smoother graphics

MP is back (YAY!!!!!!!!!)

Plays nice with your existing install if you have one.

Things that I don't like ( most are not the fault of MS or DTG )

We had to wait years for the sim to be improved with out buying PrePared

Some 3rd party installers don't recognize the Steam install, and some 3rd party companies want you to pay again for a Steam compatible installer

A few companies selling old products with a Steam installer with one texture and then selling the remaining textures as Steam DLC. Note, buy the regular installer if you can and point it to your Steam install, it will work and you save some money.

Some MP servers are overrun with kids that think it's fun to override/monopolize comms, try to dog fight guys flying airliners and last but not least crashing into others for fun.

As I said my dislikes are targeted at things outside of DTG and Steam, the game in itself is a revitalized gem and still has life like it's older FS2004 sibling despite it's old age at 9+years. The FS community is still strong with active forums, flight clubs and virtual airlines. There are thousands of addon aircraft, scenery repaints, sounds and more for FSX and it's all for free. Don't like the sound that the default DC-3 makes? change it, theres a freeware sound package that 4 times as large as the original. Want a VFA-31 texture for the default F/A-18 ? theres one out there along with many other Navy and Marine squadrons. Want the one airplane that you've loved for ever? chances are that it's out there to be downloaded. And best of all the things I mentioned are free to use, for everyone. Okay, you might have to buy a membership for faster download speeds but 90% of those sites still provide free access.

   Buy it, fly it, you'll love it

28,15926297,english,"Here's the headline: BUY THIS! Especially if you're an aviation enthusiast and/or have a disc copy of FSX and are running Windows 7 or newer.

FSX has been my favorite flight sim for some time. I purchased the Gold Edition a few years ago and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, FSX is nearly a decade old at this point and it hasn't been supported for years. Naturally, this meant than when I loaded it on my nice, shiny new Windows 8.1 machine with a powerful CPU and graphics chip, it ran poorly and in worse cases, caused it to bluescreen.

I was initially skeptical of purchasing another copy of a game I already own but since it was on sale for $5, I figured ""Why not"" and bought it. Did not regret it simply because of how much the game is an improvement over the retail version performance-wise. This game takes much, MUCH better advantage of the power of a modern midrange-high-end graphics card from a GTX 960/R9 270X to a GTX Titan X/R9 295X2. Furthermore, it natively supports Windows 7 and above, meaning that there will be no unpleasant effects playing the game on a machine running that or Windows 8.1.

Of course, FSX is not FSX without its planes. The default plane list is pretty okay-ish. Some airliners, fighters and whatnot. But where FSX truly shines is its unparalleled support for third-party content, both free and paid. The FSX modding community is one of the largest and most active ones out there and you can easily find your favorite plane and either get it or buy it. Free planes are decent and some are actually pretty good but if you want the true experience, payware planes are the way to go, offering outstanding realism both in terms of visuals and physics. Oh, and did I mention that FSX has graphics mods that turn it from a 2006 game to one released in 2012? 

Another important thing that has been added is online support. This is a HUGE plus, since my retail version did not have online after GameSpy shut down. Simply put, it's fun as heck to mess around with other pilots or impress them with landing skills and aerobatic moves.

All-in-all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves planes in general and/or is a seasoned veteran pilot, either in real-life or in FSX. Online support is a big plus and it's still compatible with the hundreds of thousands of planes made by talented people. For the best possible experience , invest in a joystick and some payware planes of your choice. Or if you really wanna go nuts, build an actual cockpit. :P

Planes that I usually fly in FSX are the Boeing 747-8i in Boeing Sunrise Livery, Boeing 777-300ER in Japan Airlines/Cathay Pacific livery, Boeing 777-9X in Boeing livery, Boeing 757-200 in AA livery, and a McDonnell Douglas/Boeing MD-11F in FedEx livery.

I use FSPassanger, I use TaxitotheGate Airports for Orlando KROD, and I use GEX and UTX, with Clouds and Weather Mods. It makes the realistic nature of flying so much more fun and real.

Can you fly for fun and do what ever? Sure
Can you study mechanics in a simulation where one mistake wont kill you and others? Yes
Can you practice landings, stalls, and get very close to realistic simulation of aircraft? Yes

I have used Flight Sim to scratch my itch of learning to fly. I also use XPlane as well for the ultra realistic aircraft aerodynamics, and trust me, learning to fly in XPlane over Flight Sim is rough, but a good natural progression.

Dovetail did a great job making this older flight sim much more stable, and much more enjoyable. It wont crash as it runs out of memory anymore unless you heavily modify it like I do and try to run insanely high auto gen than expect things to get interesting, but in reality, it is a solid update to a beloved flight sim and one everyone can enjoy.

FSX: Steam Edition is a re-release of FSX Gold Edition so you should not expect dramatic differences.  However, we have updated it to include all standard Steam functionality, we’ve removed CD checking and combined the components of Gold Edition into a single installation.  The major change we've made is in replacing the now-defunct Gamespy multiplayer systems with Steam features, enabling multiplayer to work seamlessly once again.  Additionally, some outstanding bugs have been resolved, as detailed [url= http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/0/622954747293264584/]here[/url]. Our aim in this first instance has been to ensure that the software will run for as many people as possible rather than radically improving or updating it.

Since this time we have released two further updates for FSX: SE to address outstanding bugs and issues reported to us by FSX: SE players. Please see [url=http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791436916733/announcements/detail/243535262349401340]here[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791436916733/announcements/detail/231141125830072041]here[/url] for further details.

79,15626982,english,"Started out great! Graphics couldn't be beat, still can't! But as all things go I bought some add on aircraft found they fly only from the virtual flight deck. This isn't good for weather or heavy ATC-environments, but not Steams fault. The Beta version that was released wreaked havoc with my system. Several third party aircraft lost textures and paints, the mouse went transparent and became useless.
Update: After a continuous battle of about a week, I have reached the conclusion that without the ability to nullify the beta release my system will be forever in ruins. I have recently discovered I can get my mouse back if I do an ALT + ENT and use a reduced screen. Again if I opt for the full screen no mouse with which to set courses, frequencies, altitudes or anything else you need a mouse for. My surrender doesn’t come lightly, I have headed the word of those much smarter than I and tried their fixes, work a rounds to no a vail. I have had the keepers of the program tell me that the fix I seek has already been discovered! All I need to do is go to this forum, search, read a couple hundred lines of data from others that are having similar problems and the answer will magically appear! After a Thirty-six hour delete and reload of Flight Simulator X Steam, (the initial only took twenty-three but was worth it) with me pushing the download instead of letting the system wait for the scheduled time, I’m no further than I was two days ago. So if you’re looking for the best graphics this is it. If you’re looking for the best support,,,,,,,,,, well let’s just say I have an email address. If they only answer. The route for requesting support in the Steam network left me a bit mystified. One place I would be logged in, the next place I wouldn’t be. I would put in ID and password and have to retrieving my password every-time I did this. I would get logged in go to support and the blocks of hell the first was pretty simple what was the problem, next block what system/game/something, and the last was just as informative.

Since their last patch, the simulator platform has become quite stable and changes the experience quite a bit.  I actually have some flight experience and while certainly this is not a true measure of flight, it is a very good introduction to it as well as a means to maintain your skills.

PRO'S:
There's a robust support group out there, seasoned and developed and happy to help.

The missions supplied are very well arranged and developed, the presentation is enjoyable as opposed to a bitching betty.

The radio traffic is excellent, allows newer pilots a chance to get in some communication practice out of the real world.

This game still has collisions, which is great for those wishing to ensure they are ""not hitting"" obstacles.  The new simulators require that collisions are turned off, so if you're testing your skills to make sure you're clearing that 50ft tree at the end of that short runway, this simulator will definately let you know if you cleared or not.

CON'S:
Very few with this latest patch.  The graphics are getting a bit dated, but they're not bad.

Some of the missions do have dead spots or don't really give good instructions on what to do next to advance in the mission.  Most do very well.


Overall, I've enjoyed this Steam Edition very much and am regularly using it to keep up and develop my pilot skills.",1428159753,1430579401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022263223,128,50,16173,0,5950,1548531473,,

I have owned a copy of FSX since it was realeased all the way back on Windows XP, and as it was my favorite game, and I was in gradeschool, I played the game. A lot. How much a lot? Total flight time was over 5,000 hours flying alone. My total landings were over 10k, and my total distance was enough to circle the globe 120 times.

I was very proud of my logbook (all printed about 25 pages), so when I went with my dad to work one day (he's the supervisor of ground operations at Cleveland Hopkins, he basically says if the airport is open or not **not if flights are cancelled or not**) and 12 year old me showed my printed log book to my dad's former boss.

He looked at my dad and asked ""Did he really do this?"" My dad, although enamored with the game himself, responded ""Sadly, yes."" (I would rather fly than play baseball or whatever) My dad's boss then took me to a 737 which was about an hour from departure. My dad's boss, my dad, and myself all walked into the cockpit, where the boss said to the pilot ""Show me your logbook."" (Every pilot has their own, and if they get filled up, they carry over like a checkbook) After looking at the logbook for a considerable amount of time, he said to the pilot ""Impressive stuff captain, how long have you been flying?"" He responded ""Since I was 17 sir, and I'm 27 now, so 10 years.""

""Good for you captain, however would you like to see something impressive? Check this out."" He handed the pilot my logbook. After the pilot was done leafing through it, he looked in disbelief and said ""Hell, you're more qualified to fly this plane than I am."" I then looked at his logbook, which had totaled just under 4k hours, and less than a quarter of my landings.

Later that day, we went to the disastrous landings simulator, which tested pilot's abilities to land in the weird extremes of Cleveland weather, and the boss had the people running the simulator set it up for a 5min takeoff session, 5min  at cruise, and landing from 20k ft. I flew the simulator, and when I got out, the boss said to me ""If you were 16, I'd hand you your license right now, and take you down to the Continental offices downstairs.""

So yeah, thats the reason why I love this game, and it has been such a big part of both me and my childhood.

**My dad's boss is the SuperIntendant of the airport, basically he rules all
**What did 5000 hours do to me? Make me good at flying in simulators
**Yes, I have flown a plane in real life. Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee

You are correct we did recently release a brand new update for FSX: SE which you can read more about here:

http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791436916733/announcements/detail/243535262349401340

However, this update did not include any changes to the games graphics engine so if you are experiencing an unexpected issue with your graphics it is most likely being caused by something else such as a third party add-on. 

If you would like some help with this you can reach us here in the studio by emailing our team at dtgflightsupport@dovetailgames.com. We will get back to you with some advice as soon as possible.

12,15469759,english,"Here's my take on the civilian flightsim hobby as it currently stands: More than ever, it is a period of transition and I believe the future looks good. I have and use both FSX and X-Plane and therefore have a foot in both camps. It's a case of fully realized capabilities versus future potential. From another perspective I see one nearing the end of its 32-bit lifecycle and the other very much in its 64-bit adolescence.

Background: I've been flight simming since SubLogic's C64 release, and have been firmly entrenched in the Microsoft FS camp on PC since FS5.1, although like everyone else in the day I had and used Flight Unlimited, FLY! and ProPilot. We loved the variety and happily used them all for what they had to offer. For me FS2004/FS9 was the watershed, and I was entrenched for a decade in the sim using all the familiar add-ons and a full suite of GoFlight hardware. Unfortunately my computer was firmly stuck in 2004 as well, so I avoided migrating to FSX. I was aware of and had messed around with XP during my biannual pilgrimage to Oshkosh, even chatting at length with Austin Meyer, but I was already too deeply invested in the MSFS camp. I'm certain that many can relate.

I've been a licensed private pilot since 1991, with a multi-engine endorsement and lucky enough to have had exposure and stick time on some pretty cool equipment. Now as most real world guys will tell you, flying a computer is NOT the same - I don't care if the flight models are based on lookup tables or basic real-time elemental calculations, it's just not worth arguing over. Get over it.  Where there is tremendous value in simming however, is the 'process' of flight - planning, procedures, checklist habits, instrument scans, IFR approaches. For true immersion in the system look up PilotEdge and add that to your mix no matter what platform you fly.

I was fortunate enough to finally build a cutting edge computer recently. As a treat, I picked up FSX-SE to see how she'd run on a modern box. Looked good and I was enthused enough to purchase Aerosoft's A320/321 (an absolutely excellent add-on BTW). Then the dreaded terrain.dll crashes started on flights lasting longer than about 60 minutes. While I understand these errors may have been largely addressed in the new FSX-SE beta patch, I am very grateful for them. They gave me pause and saved me the hundreds of $$ I was prepared to pour into the scenery and add-ons in order to bring it up to the available standards: Orbx, UTX, ASN, PMDG, et al. It's a slippery slope most know only too well, and when you finally stop and look back at all the resources you have dedicated, the thought of migrating to something totally new seems not only daunting, but is likely financially unwarranted as well.

While waiting for a decade old piece of software to get patched by a third party so that I could run it on modern equipment and proceed to spend a great deal of money and tweaking time to get it to run correctly, the light bulb went on for me. Here I was at a crossroad and I was prepared to reinvest in the same old song and dance. Yes, it's the one tune everybody knows, but there was an opportunity to learn a new one. Even though I tried and failed to get the X-Plane demo working, I purchased the full version (10.35 currently) in order to give it an honest shakedown, flying it exclusively for a week. What that week gave me was an appreciation for just how immersive, smooth and realistic XP can be.

I spent a good deal of time reading the related forums, familiarizing myself with the tips, tricks and FAQs. I found the stock 172 and Baron okay (certainly the equal of their stock FSX equivalents), but added the beautiful Carenado C340 for some GA flying. (Aside - the C340 is a nice looking package and I'm glad I have it but there are some unforgivable faults that required modifications to actually work - in particular the CDI when tuned to an ILS. Basic stuff. For shame.) Then the FlyJsim 737-200 for some good old fashioned radio navigation at jet speeds. Wonderful aircraft, beautifully modelled cockpit and convincingly realistic performance numbers. Definitely a pilot's plane. The coming IXEG 737-300 looks incredible. And I needn't mention that PMDG is developing for XP with a DC6 to be followed by one or more of their 7xx series...

Sparse scenery? To me it looks far and away better than stock FSX. It's nicely scalable to the hardware you're running, and XP definitely makes proper use of modern hardware. The stock mesh is great, autogen works well, the road traffic is cool, and the night lighting is the stuff of pilot training heaven. But here's the kicker - there's so much freely available from the community. I've managed to populate my XP world with all the airport scenery I will be reasonably using with a few visits to the XP ORG. And if you have a look at what's possible using world2xplane... the future looks not only bright, but incredible. Need I mention no terrain.dll CTDs or OOM errors?

Stock XP weather is in my opinion better than stock FSX. Dressed up with ASN and REX however, and FSX has a strong lead. But based on how close XP is getting with aircraft and scenery, the weather engine won't be far behind.

Stock ATC is crap. But so is FSX's. Sorry, it's just not real. I alluded to it above, but try PilotEdge to see what real ATC is. Full stop.

This has become a rather long piece, sorry about that. I suppose I felt I had a lot to say about where we've been, where we are, and where we're going. MSFS has been how it was, and largely how it is now (I include P3D here). Is it time for change? One platform is nearing a developmental dead end, albeit with some wonderful add-ons, and one is just beginning to realize its potential with continuous and meaningful support.

I'll continue to use both platforms for now, I mean why not, I own both and enjoy each for what they offer. Let me be clear though - I will not be adding anything further to my FSX ecosystem, but will simply enjoy what I already have. FSX will be limited to getting my bus fix with that awesome Aerosoft A320, at least until the sim crashes with the latest .dll or OOM error. For the price of a decent FSX add-on, I would urge you to give XP a fair evaluation.

In the end I see FSX as an old woman all gussied up in makeup and a new designer dress. She looks great and is pleasant to spend quality time with, but be careful if you go out dancing - she may fall and break a hip. Now have you seen the new girl in town? Dances funny, but she's smart, modern, and has some really cool moves. You may want to meet her.

My future in the hobby is with XP. I know I am not alone. Developers take note.",1429569597,1429569597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198140689896,109,9,2431,0,1800,1510869807,,

The physics feel good, and with appropraite controls, so good that it feels like you're really flying. I recommend using the mouse for the flight controls if you don't have a joystick, as keyboard controls are a headache.

I'd go for orbx scenery over the ones being sold here(expensive but just pick the areas you want to fly), ezdok camera(there's a beta for the steam edition that works fine), Accufeel, DX10 fixer, FSFlyingSchool and some of the higher rated planes that interest you(again, the ones on steam are 'meh' at best).

Overall, FSX is a proven commodity but  could seriously do with a 64 bit  visual overall.

Other issues with a dated program such as this: Limited memory that it can access. I believe it is 4 gbs. So you will be looking at Out of memory errors as you add on the addons as it were. You will try to compensate by making room on your hard drive for virtual memory. But this will be an ever present issue with this 32 bit program.

The addons are multitudes.  Many will work and many won't or will need significant modification. These are the lifeblood of FSX and DT should do their level best to accelerate the transition.

I wish the DX10 issue was sorted out as it remains a problem on the Steam version.UPDATE: DX10 FIXER payware now available and compatible with FSX steam! Huge PLUS.

I just installed all the Orbx scenery texture/landclass  addons (3 main ones) and all work flawlessly including the great nightlighting.

So ultimately the success going forward for this franchise is DLCs . In that respect, I see some reviews crying about payware. Well yes, while freeware was the lifeblood of the entire franchise of MS flightsimming for years, when the 2000 editions overhauled the looks and graphics, etc. payware vendors started to create important content. You work, you get paid. Cry a river of tears otherwise or check out AVSIM as there is still plenty of freeware stuff out there. The reality is that it takes time and energy to create content such as a voice ATC communication program like MCE Ultimate Edition, beautiful airports, etc. It's in fact what has driven this franchise despite the fact MS dumped it but still retain the SDK like the family jewels (and on that issue MS - you're morons - like you dumped the other franchise which was getting a fantastic makeover MS train sim).

The only thing that will perenially afflict FSX is its 32 bit ceiling which severally limits memory access and is heavily dependent on the main processor. That's why you can come back to FSX after being away for several years, crank up the textures, etc. and your powerful 17-4790 and GTX 9800 graphics card  will be brought to their knees when you have weather implemented, textures maxed out,  AI going, etc.

Final point about this Steam version. Disappointed that though it appears more stable than the dvd version  it plays absolute second fiddle to Prepar3D v2.5. This latter FSX incarnation got a graphics overhaul and it is now DX11 compatible!! And it looks gorgeous and runs way better than any previous incarnations. What that means to me is that the Steam version will now be displaced. I've migrated all my stuff over.

At the end of the day this is the MOTHER franchise of all franchise games - the Bruce Artwick child of the Sub Logic days to it's sale to Microsoft and MFS 1.01. By the time of 2000 Microsoft Flight Simulator the franchise was  in the Guinness Book of Records with 21 million copies sold per June 1999. So why not dump such a successful franchise right?

85,15241781,english,"OVERVIEW:
This game, for being made in 2006 is amazing, and with the Steam Edition revamp it's 400% better. It has an entire Learning Center for learning just about anything you could think of. FSX still rules as the best Flight Sim for someone to pick up and to play professionally, or casually. It has Free Flight where you can do whatever you want, and make your own trips, it also has Missions, where you can do stuff from flying around taking a guy who yells at you for turning to hard, to intercepting a suspected plane of illegal goods! The graphics are yes, a bit dated.
   Also the game plays alot like FS2004 and  shares alot of the same charactoristics.
   BE WARNED: I advise you not to buy the DLC because it doesn't have a rating of over 35% recommendation. ONLY AND ONLY IF it is 80% you should buy the DLC. Dovetail makes good games, but milks em' of money from DLC.
   This is also not really a game itself rather a learning tool, but there is alot of missions you can do.
   While this game works well with a keyboard, I like my XBox 360 controller a whole lot more.
   The Steam Edition is FSX Gold with acceleration.
PROS:
Great Sim for Pros and Novice flyers
Highly customizable flight conditions
Lots of missions to do
Many, many buttons to push
30+ Planes
Fly absolutely anywhere in the world
50+(ish) Missions
CONS:
Rather dated graphics (they get the job done)
A rather large learning curve if you never played a flight sim before (nothing that Learning Center can't fix tho)
DLC is worthless if not 80% off (but thats not the game itself)",1428355963,1428355963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198102006322,150,30,884,0,718,1576970565,,

Nice refresh of a classic,

- After almost 10 years still no big changes on FSX engine
- Price is high, only sale on their own website (60$ is high for DX11 update, you should also re-buy some FSX add-ons)
- Some add-ons are expensive then FSX, 
- Bad UI
- FSX add-ons not %100 compitable (FSX:SE more compitable)
- EULA restrictions (also for add-ons)

X-plane 10:
Pros:
- Only 64 bit and OpenGL flight sim on market (so its supports Mac PC)
- Steam support, flexible payment methods.
- Its actually very different Flight Sim then FSX engine based games so you should read its own reviews. Because there are too many new features
Cons:
- Limited 3rd party support, limited add-ons
- Huge Download Size

Lighting and some textures flickr when the camera is in a certain possition causing the strobe lights to effectively be invissible. Furthermore the ILS isn't working entirely, i came in at a very nice glideslope and had a average speed. However then the plane for no apparent reason crashed into the ground. This never happened on the original FSX, however it could be the plane. This leads to my next point, i understand that many planes cannot be installed because you would need to reconfigure the installation, however this game just isn't built for stock aircraft because frankly they're aweful. PMDG 737 needs to be added to this game ASAP because that's one thing im looking forward to seeing. Overall though with these bugs fixed ill be playing much more!

I use Windows 8.1 so when I bought the boxed version of FSX it didn't turn out so well. It crashed all the time, low frame rates and lets just say it didn't suit my computer as its a very old game. After a while it went completely corrupt on my computer and I gave up all together. Then I bought X-plane 10 when it went on sale. It was alright. Then one day I saw FSX on sale for only £3.99 and thought to myself, hell I enjoyed FSX so much before so why not buy this and if it goes corrupt on me then its only just £3.99. Let me tell you one thing. It was the best decision I had made in a while. It took me about 35mins to download (its a big game around 10gb) and as soon as I put it on I could tell this was made for my computer. I have around 24 hours on it and never has it once crashed on me. The boxed version felt like it was made for a 10 year old computer but Dovetail have done a great job on this and now it works great on Windows 8.1. I even use the PMDG 737ngx on it and no crashes whatsoever. Downloadable content is bs but I don't really care about that not when there's so much 3rd party content out there.

This however, FSX SE, has fixed all that and now I can finally play this stupid simulator/game without it crashing or glitching out every 5 seconds! It's great!

52,15140730,english,"First off FSX has a huge fan base, although the game [simulator] was released way way back in 2006. This is supported by the fact that a 8 year old game has received ""Mostly Positive"" reviews so far with many people claiming to have aviation background praising it for being their all time favorite flight simulator. Don't be mislead however by this current status - it is more of a legacy feedback and does not fully represent what the Steam Edition actually is.

I will skip all the positive aspects in my review. They have already been pointed out extensively by others and I do agree with many of them. I will briefly give you my reasons for voting it DOWN which for me outweigh easily all the positives.

FSX:SE has has been licensed to the worst developer [acting as publisher for the current edition] who is in charge of creating the next installment under the brand name Flight Simulator. Why worst? Well – Dovetail has no interest in the community other than milking it continuously with DLC releases. SDK has already been cut out from FSX:SE which means that the community will not be allowed anywhere near to creating and sharing. It is clear that the current, as well as the future FS, will follow the same path of Train Simulator by allowing only licensed companies to develop and sell DLC. Dovetail has once again waived the finger at the enormous creativity that the community has – it is strictly business, m8s!

At first I was very excited for the game coming to Steam. Even more so at the possibility of getting a new flight simulator in 2015. However after a short research it became apparent that I am not the target group of Dovetail. Have a look at the trailer of Train Simulator 2015 – the guy being brainwashed to buy it is a middle aged cash cow, looking to waste time and has money for 4000$ worth of DLC crap. Yes - **** *** to the people who actually CAN create and contribute to the development of the game. They do not bring money and without money Mr. Cameron would not come again to our offices to praise us for creating worthless jobs.

The potential of this simulator is to be the definitive open world exploration game. If it were to have the right developer the community would jump right in and fit a detailed copy of Earth together with the whole aviation industry inside.

Thumbs down for the lost potential – this game will develop to be yet another epic failure.

You are correct when you say that Dovetail Games is acting as a publisher for Microsoft and is only licenced to modify the simulator in order to make it Steam compatible. Microsoft remains the developer of FSX and is solely responsible for implementing any new features or content to the core simulator. This includes the decision not to include the SDK in this release. Microsoft’s position on the SDK is that it remains available in the boxed version of FSX for anyone who would like to use it however it should now be considered discontinued and is no longer officially supported in regards to FSX: Steam Edition. Once again we would like to clarify that Microsoft remains the developer of FSX and is solely responsible for decisions regarding the content included in the game. 

Likewise you are also correct that we are working on a brand new flight simulator however this will be a completely separate game to the Microsoft flight simulation franchise and is in no way supported by or related to Microsoft or this version of FSX. 

We work very closely with the FSX: Steam Edition community both on our own community sites and on a range of independent websites. For example, we recently ran an open beta for the next update for FSX: Steam Edition which allowed players to try out the update before it was made live and to provide feedback and suggestions regarding how the game can be improved. We are now working hard on making further changes to the game based upon what players have told us. If you would like to find out more you read about it in our Steam forum here: 

http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/617329505864354279/

We are currently partnering with a range of existing and new third party developers to offer players brand new content for FSX and a selection of add-ons from the games rich add-on history. The development platform for FSX remains controlled by Microsoft, the same as it always has, and we believe that by bringing FSX to Steam this will help reinvigorate the flight simulation community by making the software available to a generation of people who would not have encountered the simulator before. In turn, we hope that this inspires new players to explore FSX and that it helps to bring fresh developer talent to community. 

To this end we operate a third party developer programme which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind for FSX. Through this programme we work closely with developers helping them craft exciting new content for FSX. Combined with our close work with the FSX community through projects like the open beta we believe this will usher in a new age of creativity and expansion for this much loved simulator franchise. 

While we welcome your feedback about Train Simulator this Steam page is for reviews about FSX: Steam Edition therefore we kindly ask that if you would like to discuss Train Simulator that you do so on the appropriate Steam page or community site. 

Once again we thank you for your review,

57,15142257,english,"Overall: 8/10

Ok, I've loved the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise since the early 90's. I've played tons of flight simulators and none of them come close to FSX. The real time weather is fantasticly accurate and when played on the highest realism settings the aircraft behaves as one would in said weather. The pockets of turbulence above a rise, the shift in heading from a headwind. It's very, very accurate. I find flying on here is probably one of the most relaxing things my PC has to offer me. GET A JOYSTICK.



Pros: 8/10

1. The landscape is decent. It looks dated. But that's because it is. The size relationships between the aircraft and the buildings is a bit off but it works.
2. Very realistic both in aircraft interior/exterior apperance and in flight dynamics.
3. Missions are fun (I tend to re-run them for better metrics like time when I'm bored).
4. The handbook and lessons are helpful.
5. When used properly the ATC radio communications are very realistic.



Cons: 7/10 (points subtracted for cons)

1.  Not a lot of choices for aircraft. Would like to see more jets/jumbojets/helicopters etc.
2. Multiplayer VOIP is broken. Period. It doesn't work right. Maybe ONCE in a blue moon you'll come across a server with a working VOIP system, but that it superbly rare.
3. The airports are... disappointing. Microsoft claims they're accurate representations of the airports. But they're not. They're really not. They're close enough that you can ignore it, but don't make a claim about being ""accurate representations"" of something if it's really not. And no it's not because it's been a lot of time since the game was released. RDU International Airport never looked that way.

60,15136273,english,"If you have money on steam and you don't know what to do with it you can buy this only if it's on sale for 5$ or less, you can find something way way way better for less than 25$. This a game is a definite cash grab and I bought it because I was impatient and bought this game because it looked like it had good reviews and really cool pictures and videos, but in the game the graphics are pretty bad. Ik graphics don't have to do with really anything, thats just one minor thing. THE ONLY THING TO REALLY DO ON IT IS FLY AND THATS IT. When I thought ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X"" I thought that you would do the insides of the planes, or design it differently, but basically all you do is fly. Now there are missions in this game, which I guess in the only good thing in it, but when I opened the first mission up, it seemed very unfinished, in the tutorial there were untyped words (coming from someone who has some untyped words in his review probably), wrong punctuation, and apparently you need an Xbox controller to fly it because the tutorial narrarator tells you some things to do with the keyboard and mouse, but to move the plane he only talks about the xbox controller, it has STEAM EDITION at the end of the game title..... Although I havent played them but have seen them, the intermediate - expert missions seems slightly decent but thats about it. The multiplayer is awful, when you crash into things you either noclip through it or just automaticly 'plop' right up on the thing your crashing onto. The controls are very difficult so I had to use the keyboard for some controls and the xbox controller aswell at the same time. And OH right when I'm righting this review I see that its 20$ for another airport and 25$'s for seperate planes......... Ugh......... Anyways, the whole point is that if you want to buy this game you better be Bill Gates grandson and it better be on sale, and you got to be someone who just likes to fly with bad graphics and maybe do some plane missions. I'm sorry if you like this game and may have offended you but I just hated the cashgrab of this game, and btw I still think its a cashgrab and I bought it for 5$. It should be either free, 5$ or at the max 10$ Thanks for listening and I hope I helped the people on the fence of buying this game,",1427782375,1427782375,False,2,0,0.489544212818145752,0,True,False,False,76561198086459091,170,6,55,0,55,1427689533,1427808682.0,"Thank you taking the time to try the game and write us a review TheFluffyLlama. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is flight simulation game where players take on the role of pilots and fly a range of aircraft across the globe. The simulator features aircraft such as the 747 jumbo jet, F/A-18 Hornet, P-51D Mustang, EH-101 helicopter and players can take off from one of more than 24,000 airports. As you say, the core of the game is based around the principle of simulating the experience of flying aircraft. FSX: Steam Edition is very much a detailed simulator and players who prefer a more arcade based form of gameplay may wish to consider other options before adding the game to their collection. 

FSX: Steam Edition offers players a connected world where they can choose who they want to be, from air-traffic controller to pilot or co-pilot. You can play online with your friends or other players from the FSX: Steam Edition community. As identified in your review collisions between the aircraft and the scenery are not modelled and this is by design since crashing your aircraft is not a core focus in the game. 

New players can learn the basics of piloting an aircraft through the various tutorial missions and once mastered they can test their skills in one of several missions. 

For players who want to expand their experience beyond the core game there is a range of additional content available for FSX: Steam Edition in the Steam Store. This content is optional and not required to enjoy any of the features in the game.

Worked absolutely flawlessly for me from the start, took some work to find the right balance between display quality and performance but I got it to run at an acceptable quality on a computer which really isn't designed for gaming.

Really recommend playing through the lessons if you want to fly seriously. The missions, on the other hand, bring you into the game in a less serious and more fun way - you don't need to be an expert pilot to enjoy FSX!

You can also improve it with a wealth of freeware (and payware) add ons which can really enhance your experience. Yes the DLCs are expensive, but you do not NEED them to have a very good game. In terms of freeware, I recommend Plan-G  as a great little piece of software to plan and carry out VFR flights.

I play it using an Xbox One controller - it works, and it allows you to fly to a decent standard. Joystick is probably better, but you can certainly have fun with a console controller if that is all you have access to. Keyboard on the other hand is a bit difficult in my opinion.

         You can use keyboard and mouse to fly, as well as any generic joystick and throttle.

Cons: The aircraft that come with the game are by default kind of clunky(This can be fixed with updates).

This is not a game i would recommend to everyone, only weirdos like me. 

The missions are long and boring, you dont' fight things, you litterally just fly airplanes. But thats okay, because it's relaxing. 

So if you are interested in this game, keep in mind:

It's a simulator so expect the only thing you do to fly 
This game is better if you have a HOTAS
Flying takes time, don't expect to get anywhere fast
The missions are simple tasks that don't require to much thought and take up to a maximum of 3 hours to complete, so to normal people it should be boring.

But other than those i would recommend it to anybody that has a interest in flight simulators because it is the BEST flight sim i've ever played. It will consume your life because there are so many diffrent planes, and missions, and areas to fly, and you can download more planes, and missions, and areas to play. It's endless fun.

9/10 would not recommend to normal people.

It appears that Dovetail is simply harvesting cash from the unsuspecting public at this point, as there has been zero response from their Customer Support.

39,15088067,english,"Ive owned the disc version of this FSX since it came out, and boy did I enjoy it!
But, the time came where I had to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 8.
I installed the disc version, but it was so unstable and unpredictable. Then, I heard about the Steam version of FSX, and I thought, hmm! That would be a good idea! So, I bought it as quickly as I could, and began playing as quickly as I could.
But, I was really disappointed.

The disc version may have been a RAM hog, but this version (in my personal experience) doesn't use enough. I am constantly losing textures, and sounds do not load directly on startup. My rig is more than powerful enough to handle this on highest settings, but I have had to downgrade from Ultra High to Medium for my textures to stay loaded in.

Installing addons was a massive hassle for me. No matter what I tried, I could not get any addons to work. I checked the 'SimObjects' folder, made sure everything was there. But still nothing. Eventually, I gave up on adding in additional aircraft.

Now, for multiplayer. Oh, multiplayer! What an experience several years ago when I was using the disc verson! But that has suddenly changed. I love being a traffic controller. but there's a bug for me that seems to want to keep me from being an ATC. No matter what I try, I cant become an ATC in a multiplayer session. My game just wont launch the game window. If I try pilot, it launches.

Thats all I really have to say. If you want a much more stable version of FSX for Win7, Win8 or Win8.1. then this is for you. These three points above are the ONLY things bothering me, and I hope they get fixed in the future.
Recommened for sure.

Not only does FSX support more then 10.000 mods (skins, completely new planes, scenerys, instruments) it has every single airport you can possibly imagine on here, you want to take off from that small grass strip 10km away from your house? sure its possible.

The game also has a speed up button if you don't want to fly for a long time it also has fuel so if you're flying in a small plane from Europe to the US you won't make it over the ocean if you don't fill up your fuel tank.
Before you land and when you take off its the best to start with talking to the Air Traffic Controll because you don't want to crash into someone else.

Overall its a great game but ofcourse there are somethings to consider:
The FPS is low, always have been its a heavy CPU game
There a whole lot of nothing.. you take off you fly for ~1/2hours and you land.
The scenery is not that beautyfull although the planes look fantastic.
It crashes sometimes when Alt Tabbing.

48,13437114,english,"The Microsoft Flight Simulator series is one of the most iconic PC game franchises of all time, and, to an extent, back in '06 FSX lived up to what was expected of it. Aside from the obvious performance issues and supposed cut content relating to visual fidelity (some early screens depict incredibly dense scenery and fantastic lighting effects that weren't  seen in the final game, even on the highest settings), it was a good way for the series to come to a close. The Steam Edition of FSX now exists because of an agreement between Microsoft and Dovetail Games, who made the Train Simulator games. This agreement permitted Dovetail to make a few minor tweaks to the game to allow it to function properly on newer machines (specifically Windows 8.1), manage the updated multiplayer component, and obviously distribute it on Steam. I am not fond of the Train Simulator business model, and thankfully the devs have NOT modified FSX at all in this release, as a result the legal agreement. This ""Steam Edition"" comes with the Deluxe Edition of the original FSX, the ""Acceleration"" expansion pack, all service packs, and said performance enhancements. As I stated above, you can also play multiplayer again.

If you're new to Flight Simulator, are an X-Plane enthusiast, or are just interested in aviation in general I strongly recommend picking this game up on sale, while the sale lasts. There is a TON of content included. FSX allows you to fly around the globe (no BS micro transactions for different places, a la ""Microsoft Flight"", the failed attempt to ""casualize"" the series in 2012) completely unrestricted, and comes with 24 planes/choppers, which all feature a set of liveries. The AI aircraft make the world feel more alive, and airports feature pivoting jetways and moving baggage/pushback trucks to add to the experience. If your PC will allow you to crank up the settings, you'll get the fully featured terminals, but expect your framerate to tank while on the ground.

The simulator also includes a strong and (in my opinion) somewhat underrated set of missions, which are VERY well voice acted and feel incredibly realistic. I strongly advise anyone who buys this to not only enjoy the Free Flight mode, but also to play some of the missions. They range from extremely easy hand-holding missions in Ultralights to challenging air races in stunt planes, along with everything in between. My favorite part about the missions is that whenever the writers needed a guiding voice for the player, they carefully wrote a believable character into the mission who helps you with your task, rather than having a voice from above tell you what to do in every mission (you only hear this voice in the tutorial missions) or simply having written on-screen dialogue boxes instruct you, like most other flight sims out there. There is a LOT of content here, which is what sets FSX apart from its competition.

Now, while FSX is a great sim, it's still 8 years old. There are some worthy alternatives out there, probably the most famous being X-Plane, which, unlike FSX, is still being actively developed. It runs better, but the world you're playing in doesn't match the complexity and visual fidelity of that of FSX. The planes look and feel more realistic, but the game is not necessarily technically superior to FSX. From an objective standpoint FSX takes the crown when it comes to gritty realism in most cases because of how the game is programmed from a simulation standpoint. These games may look similar onscreen, but under the hood they are completely different. FSX handles almost everything physics related by computing complex mathematical equations based on data tables for each aircraft, whereas X-Plane was literally born as a wind tunnel simulator, which sets it ahead of FSX on the tech side in some respects. You can easily make your own plane in X-Plane, since the physics are handled by its wind tunnel engine, whereas in FSX you need to go in with a full knowledge of how it will perform to do the same. It took the ACES team years to perfect the physics of each aircraft, some of which would carry over from previous iterations of Flight Simulator because it took such meticulous research to get the tables perfect. That being said there is a lot of free content available online for both games. And yes, from what I can tell legacy mods function in the Steam Edition of FSX.

Now for the subjective part of the review. You have been warned.

While I was very fair in my above comparisons between FSX and X-Plane, it's worth mentioning that X-Plane isn't all it's cracked up to be with regard to actual content. You'll often see advocates online telling you to ""come into the future"" because FSX is outdated. If the future means paying for individual airports and aircraft models, count me out. Let's talk about X-Plane's own Steam release. The product itself, which is fully priced mind you, is essentially just the game engine with a few mediocre airplanes and Tarmac-only airports. Just abandoned parking lots (on par with respectable mobile sims like Infinite Flight...wow). I've been told that you need to pay for additional content, which in my opinion is very unjustified here. I can see this model being fair in sims like Rise of Flight, but here? Thankfully X-Plane has a rather nice free modding scene, so that may be a saving grace. Furthermore, the full install is 80 gigabytes. This is probably the result of distrust between the devs and their autogen engine, since, unlike Microsoft, their map data wasn't acquired internally (FSX uses MS's own satellite imagery, which means ACES, the Microsoft game studio behind FS, was inherently more familiar with the data and how they could use it to apply automatically generated scenery). It's a shame the Flight Simulator series isn't still around to offer some serious competition, because X-Plane currently dominates the non-militaristic subsection of the flight sim genre, and it's got a ravenous community to defend its every business decision. The engine is good and runs well on most PCs built within the past few years, though it is a huge memory hog. FSX isn't, but its utilization of modern CPU configurations is embarrassingly poor.

In conclusion, if you're going into the simming genre hoping for a fully featured, fleshed out flight sim that's excellent for beginners and is the absolute pinnacle of its genre (the FS series is over 32 years old!) FSX is a great choice. This is the only official version of FSX still sold today, and it's very unusual to see a product like this from a company like Microsoft show its face on Steam. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition, while considerably outdated, is a welcome addition to the wonderful collection of flight simulators available on Steam.",1418940720,1427503310,True,396,8,0.953327417373657227,12,True,False,False,76561198042115815,41,1,644,0,328,1523771127,,

61,15073124,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator has been THE simulation program for many flightsimmers out there for years.
From the smallest prop planes to the biggest jumbojets, people have enjoyed FSX, and surely will for the coming time.

Many add-ons have been made for FSX, and while FSX:SE is slightly different, a lot of add-ons have been updated to work under this version as well. Also, while Gamespy is no longer, multiplayer has been fixed to work via the Steam platform itself.

Does this mean it's the holy grail for home user simulation? Not really. While at the moment it's a working platform, Dovetail does not have the appropiate license to make big changes to the program like Lockheed Martin is allowed to in their Prepar3D program, based on the same Microsoft software.

In the long run (years) FSX:SE in its current form will be obsolete and outdated. While LH Prepar3D and LR X-Plane are actively being developed, FSX:SE does not have that luxury.

At the moment it's still an awesome platform, and anyone who wants to fly can do so no problem in FSX:SE. Including all those awesome add-ons that have been made for FSX over the years.

Ever.]When I found out it was on Steam, I immediately bought it [my CD version got a little wonky :(] +700 Hours between CD and Steam version. And ever since I first played it, I grew a love for flying. While the game has it's up's and downs I do highly reccomend it for those looking for an introduction to flying or those wanting to continue that hobby.

+You have a great variety of default planes to choose from, from the 737, to the classic Cessna Skyhawk, even something like the Piper Cub
+Game is easy to mod
+Plenty of add ons planes online, both free and paid
+/- Haven't tried Multiplayer Yet
+Hosts a large number of airports to fly through throughout the world including small airstrips you think would not be there
+Includes the Acceleration Pack so you have the famous F-18, P-51, and EH101 Heli
+Nice Scenery [if you have your setting up]
+Very flexible settings for low end and high end PC's
+Features an AI system where you can fly with AI planes, features setting to change frequency of traffic
+Has an ATC Radio System you can use in flight
+Multiplayer has the ability to play ATC instead of pilot [Haven't played that though]

-Cockpits aren't necessarily professional or realistic [There are realism settings but those looking for more professional cockpits that you have to program preflight, look for payware planes by CaptainSim, Aerosoft, or Wilco Publishing]
-P-51 for some reason is unbalanced in fuel, Plane leans to the left in flight
-All the addons on Steam do not have dynamic missions but premade flights.
-There are some scenery glitches such as airstrips sitting in large holes or sitting on plateaus suspended in air [wtf?]

All in all, I give the game a [b]9/10[/b]. While it has it's errors, it's the best you'll find anywhere.

I can't speak highly enough of my first 10 hours. Same experience as the other versions of FS, and great updates to graphics since the last iteration. I have been playing Flight Simulator all of my life and have owned every version, and this version is easilly the best. 
Unfortunately its UNPLAYABLE. 
Spend hours learning to fly. Spend hours learning to Nav. Spend hours figuring out ILS. Now your ready right? 20-40 hours sunk into it and you are ready for your first airport to airport. Make sure to pick two that are 20 minutes apart in real time, because anything longer will CRASH THE GAME. 

Seriously. There is a huge bug in Terrain.dll and it will crash the game WITHOUT FAIL on EVERY flight over a certain length/distance. Gone is any chance to fly from London to Hong Kong or Sydney to LA. Oh, and if you turn on time compression, watch out! It makes it worse!

So, if you like short flights of 20 minutes or less, to look at terrain not modeled with any accuracy (because Google maps is hard) and then a nice CTD, by all means, pick up this title. 

Otherwise avoid as unplayabale as the game has a FUNDAMENTAL FLAW that will NEVER be patched. The community answer is to 1) Turn down settings until the game looks horrible 2) fly short distances 3) do not use time compression.

The update is currently in open beta (depending upon when you read this) and full details of how to try it can be found in our Steam Forum. 

We also have a dedicated Help and Support section in our forum too if your would like any further assistance from ourselves or your fellow players in the FSX community.

97,14947136,english,"I'd never played Flight Simulator before purchasing this, I'd only ever played combst sims like DCS World and Falcon BMS.  I was happy to discover that there is a lot of in depth learning in FSX Steam Edition (if thats what you like - I do).  There is a good selection of standard planes included and as well as creating your own flights there are ready made missions which are good fun and a challenge to complete.  There is also an instructor course - a bit like flying lessons which I have found useful.  Like all Steam games it installed and ran without issue, also frame rate is good on a i5 system with GTX660 and 8GB RAM.

I've purchased addtional scenery (ORBX) and one plane (A2A C182) and although they're not specifically desgined for FSX Steam Edition they both work fine with no install issues.  There were no Steam add ons at that time.

If you'd like to have a go at learning to fly 'properly' or just for fun this is highly recommended!

You can play FSX: Steam Edition using a mouse and keyboard or with a Xbox controller. A number of third party controllers are also available for players who want to take their gameplay experience to the next level and build their own cockpits. 

Like all simulators FSX: Steam Edition is not a pick up and play game. There are a host of training scenarios available in the game and we always advise that new players start there. Ultimately this is a very deep and rich simulator experience and the more you practice the more rewarding your gameplay experience will be.

To reduce bugginess, change any settings before starting your flight.  Accessing the ALT menu seems to reduce the amount of time you can fly before the game crashes.

Alright, so the graphics are quite nice on this Simulator.  This makes for some nice immersion.  However, I'm getting into flying in the real world, and wanted to do some practice flights that I might actually fly to get a feel for them.  I enabled updating weather and everything.  (Highly recommend using the current weather settings)  Here's what would continually happen.  I would take off flying the piper cub, circle slowly to the correct heading and maintain my climb.  Finally I'd level off and settle in for a relaxing flight to a nearby lake.  Suddenly the Windows spinng wheel of loading pops up, and the game closes.  It says checking for problems, a fatal error has occured.  Restarting Microsoft Flight Simulator X.  After all that I'm staring blankly at the setting screen which has also lost the majority of my settings that I just customized.  Ok it's a fluke, let me try again.  After 5 attempts at this, and the game ""automatically restarting,"" I searched for similar occurances.  It seems this game has a good deal of bugs that just simply aren't fixed.

5,14909257,english,"I had to wait until I had a substantial in-game time to actually review this fairly.  I think I've came to a conclusion.

This is not a game, as anyone who sims would tell you.  Sure, there are little missions and things like that that you can play through and complete an objective, however, the core of the simulator is simply that: simulation.

If you're thinking about buying FSX simply to play through and complete the missions, this is not for you.  Get a game like ""DCS: World"" or ""War Thunder"".  But, if you're part of the small niche that enjoys simulating real life flights, planning flights, practicing VFR or IFR, or anything along those lines, get it.  Even if you don't know much about aviation in general, but you are willing to learn, FSX is a great place to start.

That being said, FSX isn't flawless.  Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is not an exception to this.

FSX: Steam Edition is simply a way to get into the wonderful world of flight simulation easily over the quick and painless Steam platform.  There are very minor improvements behind the scenes, but in terms of content and things like that nothing has really changed from what you can get out of the boxed Flight Simulator X.  The only big changes are the fact that ""Out of Memory Errors"" seem to barley ever happen.  (I've personally only experienced it once, and that was because I didn't tweak much of my game at all.)

But that brings me to the next part of the entire Flight Simulator X experience, whether you're on the boxed version or Steam.  FSX needs addons, tweaks, and bugfixes.  Stock FSX, simply and quite frankly put, is rudimentary.  The flight models of aircrafts aren't nescessarily accurate and scenery isn't beautiful or photorealistic by any means.  On top of that, FSX can be heavily improved by turning on the buggy DX10 and using Steve's DX10 fixer, but that's another story.

FSX also needs some tweaking to it's config files to work better on modern hardware.  But I'm not going to go into that, there are fantastic guides on the steam page, and internet, that will help you with that.

The jist of what I'm trying to say is that FSX is something that you're either going to fall in love with, or become just another game that sits in your Steam library untouched.

You'd want to expect to buy some nice aircraft.  (I personally recommend the ""A2A Cessna 172 Trainer"", fantastic attention to detail and flight model.)  Those cost money, and while there are freeware aircraft out on the internet, you aren't going to get the level of realism and immersion from big names like A2A or PMDG.  Scenery can be easily supplemented with addons like ""Active Sky"" or ""Orbx"" but even then it costs more money and more time from just simulation.  On top of that, you need either a joystick or a yoke and rudder pedals.  You're not going to get away for long just using keyboard and mouse.  It's just not fun.

So in the end, yes I do reccommend this game.  Very much so, actually.  But you have to be willing to put forth the time and money it takes to get this game looking and feeling as real as it can.",1426451067,1426451067,True,4,0,0.56886899471282959,0,True,False,False,76561198013861864,117,10,3920,0,1641,1516756150,,

Like all simulators FSX: Steam Edition is not a pick up and play game. There are a host of training scenarios available in the game and we always advise that new players start there. Ultimately this is a very deep and rich simulator experience and the more you practice the more rewarding your gameplay experience will be.

11,14880306,english,"About a year ago, I found FSX: Gold Edition sitting on my shelf from a few years ago, collecting dust. I opened it and found 3 discs: one for all the military aircraft, and 2 for public aviation. I was (and still am) more interested in public aviation, so I plopped in Disc 2, but it didn't do anything. I inserted Disc 1, and installation started. About half-way, it asked to insert Disc 2, so that's what I did, and installation completed. I played with it for a little bit, and closed it, just to do something else. When I came back and re-opened the application, it asked to repair or un-install the game, so I selected to repair the game, and of course, half-way there it asked to insert Disc 2. When repairing was done, I clicked ""Finished"", and nothing happened. Disc 2 was apparently for installation ONLY, so when I re-inserted Disc 1, it asked to repair or uninstall, again. I set the box back on my shelf, and let it collect dust again.

A few days before Christmas, I noticed that FSX:SE was out for a discount of $4.99, so I purchased it immediately. I was very pleased to now have a permanent flight simulator.

I don't understand why Dovetail is releasing useless DLC's for ridiculous amounts of money.  Instead of falling for Dovetail's useless DLC's, you should get third-party payware (i.e. Airbus X Extended, 737 NGX, GSX, etc.), or save up for it. Otherwise, enjoy using the default aircraft. Not much payware is yet compatible with Steam Edition, so if you really want something that's not out yet, simply wait or request the developer to make it compatible. The game can't be played offline, so if your internet cuts out, you'll have to wait until it comes back so you can start up FSX. If you have the original FSX, KEEP IT, unless you want multiplayer. If you are going to get FSX, but only have Steam Edition as an option, good luck trying to keep yourself from writing a negative review. Remember that you should not rely on Dovetail to make this game better, as it seems they're doing nothing to fix any bugs.

Here at Dovetail Games, we have long been interested in moving into the flight arena and plan on developing the next generation of aviation simulations. The first step in this journey was for us to partner with Microsoft, the developers of the Flight Simulator series. We saw great potential in giving Steam users the opportunity to experience the flight simulation genre by releasing Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition.  We believe this will help reinvigorate the flight simulation community by making the software available to a generation of people who would not have encountered the simulator before.

Our aim with FSX: Steam Edition is to provide a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. Microsoft remains the developer of FSX and is solely responsible for implementing any new features or content to the core simulator. Meanwhile, Dovetail Games is acting as a publisher for Microsoft and is only licenced to modify the simulator in order to make it Steam compatible. This necessitated updating some of the existing features in the game such as the introduction of Steam multiplayer support to replace the now defunct GameSpy services. Although we have optimised FSX: Steam Edition for use on Steam, in accordance with our licencing agreement with Microsoft we are not at liberty to make significant functionality changes to the simulator.

The below change log represents the key changes made to FSX: Gold Edition to create FSX: Steam Edition. 

General
* FSX: Steam Edition is now built using the VS2013 compiler for better optimisation and performance. (Still makes use of VS2005 libraries for backwards compatibility.)
* Updated splash, launcher and mission preview images for FSX:SE versions.

Multiplayer, networking and communications
* Gamespy networking now replaced by new Steam networking.
* Game chat now integrated with Steam chat
* Friends/Banned lists now integrated with Steam.
* Game invites now use Steam.
* Host networking defaults to a single port 6112.
* Host networking uses 27016 for Steam Master Server Browser.
* Host timeout (loss of connection to host) now 35 seconds by default (was 55).
* ""Disconnected"" message dialog now retained on screen for 4 mins before automatic dismissal (was 30 secs).

Steam Support
* Top Down Camera (camera view select 4) was previously bound to F12 by default which is normally used for Steam's screenshot feature. Camera View Select 4 now uses Shift+F12 by default to avoid potential clash.

Compatibility with FSX boxed
* FSX and FSX: Steam Edition co-Existence feature allows both versions to be installed on the same machine. 

Default System-Setting Alterations
* Increased TEXTURE_MAX_LOAD to 4096 up from 1024
* Changed HIGHMEMFIX=1
* Increased Vertex and Index Buffers and the number of buffers. 

Bugs Fixed
* Fix to particle emitter controllers which were not being updated properly.
* Fix to flush all levels of detail in terrain cache.
* Fix to Texture Composition preventing fail and crash.
* Fixed issue where player is able to reserve more slots for friends than maximum players allowed in the game.
* Fixed issue where invalid Briefing Room was presented to player when cancelling session creation.
* Fixed issue where weather text in the multiplayer briefing room is partially cut off.
* Fixed issue where no error message appears when attempting to host a session with the network adapter disabled.
* Fixed issue where there is no error message when attempting to host a session with the network cable unplugged.
* Fixed issue where host player is frozen after a collision occurs in multiplayer.
* Fixed issue where client gets dropped from a multiplayer game after they crash into the host.
* Fixed issue where the Host Options in multiplayer/ Free Flight allow a user to have a maximum of 99 player slots.
* UIAutomationCore.dll work-a-round is now supplied by default with FSX:SE. This fixes a number of crashes relating to UI interaction on 64-bit versions of Windows.
* Fixed issue where the application’s taskbar preview window displays no content on Windows 8 and above
* Prevent default colour mode for Windows 7 and above (enable automatic display composition).
* sserife.fon file now automatically supplied and loaded.

Update 1 - 12th Jan 2015

• Networking: Resolved - potential crash bug when decoding Steam host tag data. 
• Error Reporting: Resolved - error message if the software failed to load the language.dll so that it shows the name of the actual dll it is trying to load. 
• Learning Centre: Resolved - when selecting a mission from the Learning Centre, you would be told that the mission script failed to load and would be disabled. 
• Learning Centre: Changed - the Learning Centre still referenced a GameSpy logo - now replaced with Steam logo. 
• Graphics: Improved vertex and index buffer handling defaults and a few other things to give up to 10% framerate improvement (as long as vsync is not enabled/forced). 
• Graphics: Change - Enable trilinear mipmap filtering by default. 
• Graphics: Resolved - If the Special Effects setting was set to HIGH, some special effects like external lights, landing/water effects would not work.
• Graphics: Changed default value for max per-frame texture uploads to decrease time for high quality terrain textures to appear. 
• Settings: Resolved - HIGHMEMFIX was enabled by default but could very rarely be disabled at load time.

Update 2 - Currently in open beta (as 9th March 2015) 

•FSX: Steam Edition can now be used in Steam’s offline mode.
•Steam Dumps are now created following crashes to help with diagnoses of reported issues.
•Fixed issues reported with g3D.dll affecting some add-ons
•Number of fixes for the terrain.dll crashes experienced by some users have been made.

•Multiplayer:
 VoIP communication is now using the correct device as identified in ‘Settings’.
During mission-based Multiplayer flights, if the host has activated the ‘Anti-Cheat’ flag, users who have modified their aircraft are immediately disconnected without affecting the host or other users. 
 The Steam ‘Invite to Game’ feature will now work by buffering the request until the user enters the Multiplayer menu.
 Users are prompted to use the Steam Client to invite someone from the Multiplayer menu to become a friend on Steam.
 On the Multiplayer Session and lobby screens, the text in the “Weather” section is now aligned correctly. 

•User Interface:
 If ‘Show Saved Flights’ is enabled, the time stamps on the saved flight data will now show the correct time the flight was saved.
 The HTML content displayed in some windows, eg. tutorials, mission help, etc., now runs in IE9 compatibility mode, rather than IE8, providing better presentation.
 On the Multiplayer Session screen, the user name of the host is now shown.
 On the Multiplayer Session screen, before a session is started, ‘In Briefing Room’ is now shown.

Our aim with FSX: Steam Edition is to provide a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. Microsoft remains the developer of FSX and is solely responsible for implementing any new features or content to the core simulator. Meanwhile, Dovetail Games is acting as a publisher for Microsoft and is only licenced to modify the simulator in order to make it Steam compatible. This necessitated updating some of the existing features in the game such as the introduction of Steam multiplayer support to replace the now defunct GameSpy services. Although we have optimised FSX: Steam Edition for use on Steam, in accordance with our licencing agreement with Microsoft we are not at liberty to make significant functionality changes to the simulator.

Since the release of FSX: Steam Edition we have continued to update the simulator. Below is the list of updates so far but we are committed to introducing more. 

General
* FSX: Steam Edition is now built using the VS2013 compiler for better optimisation and performance. (Still makes use of VS2005 libraries for backwards compatibility.)
* Updated splash, launcher and mission preview images for FSX:SE versions.

Multiplayer, networking and communications
* Gamespy networking now replaced by new Steam networking.
* Game chat now integrated with Steam chat
* Friends/Banned lists now integrated with Steam.
* Game invites now use Steam.
* Host networking defaults to a single port 6112.
* Host networking uses 27016 for Steam Master Server Browser.
* Host timeout (loss of connection to host) now 35 seconds by default (was 55).
* ""Disconnected"" message dialog now retained on screen for 4 mins before automatic dismissal (was 30 secs).

Steam Support
* Top Down Camera (camera view select 4) was previously bound to F12 by default which is normally used for Steam's screenshot feature. Camera View Select 4 now uses Shift+F12 by default to avoid potential clash.

Compatibility with FSX boxed
* FSX and FSX: Steam Edition co-Existence feature allows both versions to be installed on the same machine. 

Default System-Setting Alterations
* Increased TEXTURE_MAX_LOAD to 4096 up from 1024
* Changed HIGHMEMFIX=1
* Increased Vertex and Index Buffers and the number of buffers. 

Bugs Fixed
* Fix to particle emitter controllers which were not being updated properly.
* Fix to flush all levels of detail in terrain cache.
* Fix to Texture Composition preventing fail and crash.
* Fixed issue where player is able to reserve more slots for friends than maximum players allowed in the game.
* Fixed issue where invalid Briefing Room was presented to player when cancelling session creation.
* Fixed issue where weather text in the multiplayer briefing room is partially cut off.
* Fixed issue where no error message appears when attempting to host a session with the network adapter disabled.
* Fixed issue where there is no error message when attempting to host a session with the network cable unplugged.
* Fixed issue where host player is frozen after a collision occurs in multiplayer.
* Fixed issue where client gets dropped from a multiplayer game after they crash into the host.
* Fixed issue where the Host Options in multiplayer/ Free Flight allow a user to have a maximum of 99 player slots.
* UIAutomationCore.dll work-a-round is now supplied by default with FSX:SE. This fixes a number of crashes relating to UI interaction on 64-bit versions of Windows.
* Fixed issue where the application’s taskbar preview window displays no content on Windows 8 and above
* Prevent default colour mode for Windows 7 and above (enable automatic display composition).
* sserife.fon file now automatically supplied and loaded.

Update 1 - 12th Jan 2015

• Networking: Resolved - potential crash bug when decoding Steam host tag data. 
• Error Reporting: Resolved - error message if the software failed to load the language.dll so that it shows the name of the actual dll it is trying to load. 
• Learning Centre: Resolved - when selecting a mission from the Learning Centre, you would be told that the mission script failed to load and would be disabled. 
• Learning Centre: Changed - the Learning Centre still referenced a GameSpy logo - now replaced with Steam logo. 
• Graphics: Improved vertex and index buffer handling defaults and a few other things to give up to 10% framerate improvement (as long as vsync is not enabled/forced). 
• Graphics: Change - Enable trilinear mipmap filtering by default. 
• Graphics: Resolved - If the Special Effects setting was set to HIGH, some special effects like external lights, landing/water effects would not work.
• Graphics: Changed default value for max per-frame texture uploads to decrease time for high quality terrain textures to appear. 
• Settings: Resolved - HIGHMEMFIX was enabled by default but could very rarely be disabled at load time.

Update 2 - Currently in open beta (as 9th March 2015) 

•FSX: Steam Edition can now be used in Steam’s offline mode.
•Steam Dumps are now created following crashes to help with diagnoses of reported issues.
•Fixed issues reported with g3D.dll affecting some add-ons
•Number of fixes for the terrain.dll crashes experienced by some users have been made.

•Multiplayer:
 VoIP communication is now using the correct device as identified in ‘Settings’.
During mission-based Multiplayer flights, if the host has activated the ‘Anti-Cheat’ flag, users who have modified their aircraft are immediately disconnected without affecting the host or other users. 
 The Steam ‘Invite to Game’ feature will now work by buffering the request until the user enters the Multiplayer menu.
 Users are prompted to use the Steam Client to invite someone from the Multiplayer menu to become a friend on Steam.
 On the Multiplayer Session and lobby screens, the text in the “Weather” section is now aligned correctly. 

•User Interface:
 If ‘Show Saved Flights’ is enabled, the time stamps on the saved flight data will now show the correct time the flight was saved.
 The HTML content displayed in some windows, eg. tutorials, mission help, etc., now runs in IE9 compatibility mode, rather than IE8, providing better presentation.
 On the Multiplayer Session screen, the user name of the host is now shown.
 On the Multiplayer Session screen, before a session is started, ‘In Briefing Room’ is now shown.

There is vast range of content included in the core game and hundreds of hours of gameplay to be experienced. 

We are committed to providing players with a variety of additional content options for FSX: Steam Edition which you can use to expand your simulation experience. We plan to offer a range of options that we believe will appeal to both the flight simulation and Steam communities. To this end, we are partnering with third party developers including, but not limited to, First Class Simulations, Carenado, Alabeo and Just Flight. Dovetail Games will be acting as a publisher for developers to offer players a range of brand new and previously released add-ons. 

It is our intention to offer players add-on content through a series of regular releases. Although not all players will be interested in every release, we will be bringing a diverse range of add-ons to Steam which will be suitable for players of all skill and experience levels.

Of course all add-on content is completely optional and is not required to experience any of the features included in the core simulator. There is also a vast array of free add-ons available for FSX: Steam Edition and we would always advise players who are looking to expand their experience with new content for the first time start there.

In essence, this is a straightforward port to Steam of the 2006 FSX release. It's had some internal tweaks such as improved texture rendering, better Windows 8.1 support and improved multicore optimization (meaning it runs better than the original FSX on the same PC hardware).
Perhaps the biggest change here is the removal of the defunct Gamespy multiplayer mode, replaced with an all-new Steam online multiplayer. It now syncs with Steam social functions and servers, bringing FSX multiplayer back online for the first time in years. A welcome addition.
At the moment of writing this there's a major glitch with the game which prevents it from opening when offline. There's a patch in the works due within a week or so (available as an open beta on Steam now) which fixes this, though.

They did not advertised the game like requiring a internet connection every start up. On the FAQ the said (MONTHS AGO) that they would have OFFLINE MODE IMPLEMENTED.
BUT already now after MONTHS nobody knows anyithing about it

I don't think it would be an issue if they really wanted to implement this because almost all the games i have installed on steam already have an offline mode.

They simply doesn't care for customers and their needs. I don't have an internet connection in every places i go but i want play this game because i purchased it!

ALSO they promised costant follow up and updates, but very little is coming up.

It is really a shame because the game is great and infact people is still spending thousands euro on its add on, i believe that with more effort by DOVETAIL this sim could be a best seller on SE.

WHAT A SHAME DOVETAIL!

You are completely correct that FSX: Steam Edition offline mode is currently not working. We have heard this from lots of FSX: Steam Edition players and we have been listening closely. 

You may be interested to know that the most recent update for FSX: Steam Edition includes a fix for Steam Offline mode. It was always our intention to including this feature in the initial launch of FSX: Steam Edition however due to some technical challenges this was not possible at the time. Since then we have been working hard with Steam and we are pleased to confirm that offline mode is now working as originally intended. 

The update is currently available in a free open beta (depending when you are reading this review!) which all FSX: Steam Edition players are welcome to try. Once the beta has finished and we have reviewed all of the feedback from players the update will be released to all FSX: Steam Edition players through the normal Steam update system. 

Since the launch of FSX: Steam Edition we have released two updates for the game and we are deeply dedicated to taking the world of flight simulation forward and hope that our actions regarding FSX demonstrates our commitment to the genre. 

Thanks again for taking the time to share with us what you think of FSX: Steam Edition.

It is great to see that you are also a Train Simulator player too. 

FSX: Steam Edition allows players to take the controls of aircraft such as the 747 jumbo jet, F/A-18 Hornet, P-51D Mustang, EH-101 helicopter and others – there is an aircraft for every kind of flying and adventure. Players can choose their starting location, set the time, the season, the weather and take off from one of more than 24,000 airports. There is vast range of content included in the core game and hundreds of hours of gameplay to be experienced. 

We are committed to providing players with a variety of additional content options for FSX: Steam Edition which you can use to expand your simulation experience. We plan to offer a range of options that we believe will appeal to both the flight simulation and Steam communities. To this end, we are partnering with third party developers including, but not limited to, First Class Simulations, Carenado, Alabeo and Just Flight. Dovetail Games will be acting as a publisher for developers to offer players a range of brand new and previously released add-ons. 

It is our intention to offer players add-on content through a series of regular releases. Although not all players will be interested in every release, we will be bringing a diverse range of add-ons to Steam which will be suitable for players of all skill and experience levels.

Of course all add-on content is completely optional and is not required to experience any of the features included in the core simulator. There is also a vast array of free add-ons available for FSX: Steam Edition and we would always advise players who are looking to expand their experience with new content for the first to time start there.

59,14642466,english,"I was never able to start the game. The developer and Steam are no help. Searching Google offered no help. I tried on two Windows 7 pcs.

60,14642287,english,"Where to start.  Well, the game itself is still pretty awesome even though its now nine years old.  I was never able to afford the VFR scenery add ons  when I played the game   originally.  I always wanted to buy the ones covering the UK to get  the better ground imagery, but   they used to cost around £100  for the UK set, so was really pleased to see  them released on Steam  today, and at what seemed a really good deal compared to their original price.  If you buy the pack, you basically get one of the   scenery packs free.   

Unfortunately  I'm very disappointed.  I always though we got   satellite quality  imagery with these VFR scenery add-ons, but what I saw from my local airport (Woodford Aerodrome UK)  - my house is  directly in the flight path of the  runway.  Until last year before the   runway was closed we used to have our trees trimmed at the bottom of our garden  by the airport authority because they were  tall enought to cause problems with landing aircraft.  I know the surrounding country side like the back of my hand, but couldn't make out any land marks in game, nor from the nearby Manchester Airport.  Everything looks the same, with   cloned  houses and trees dotted liberally everywhere and the  grassland areas looking like desert.  I have all the graphic settings maxed out, but   apart from the  aircraft cockpits, everything else looks really dated.  Okay, it's nine years old, but  I  really thought the scenery would be better.  I don't think the  game is  worth £19.99,  and I think the total cost of  dlc so far (with some of it  on sale at between 25 to 50%) standing at over £100 for a nine year old game is    really way too much.  I wish Steam would support Microsoft Flight instead, which had amazing scenery, sadly  that doesn't work   any longer due to the GFWL connection.

Personally I've got mixed feelings about  recommending this game.  If you love flight sims it's still a big thumbs up, but I'd definitely wait  till all of the dlc is 50% off or more.  If flight sims are not  your thing, I'd  leave this game alone, it'll  just  confound you.  

I wish I could  give a thumbs up or down seperately for the  main game  and the dlc.  The game would still get a thumbs up, but the add-ons wouldn't.  There's a lot of free  custom stuff for this game, but I don't know yet whether it'll work   with Steam?

Even though i've said  I think the game is now over priced, i'm still going to give it  a thumbs up, but with reservations.

83,14562805,english,"It might still be a bit early for a review I think, But will still do this one based on the hours played so far.

With my current system, I have seen less crashes with higher settings then the boxed version. I do run some addons that are freebies and after 5 hours or so I get the crash 99% of the time only because of the manual crew addon I have ( pressing a button to play a crew announcment ). Altho I have wanted to see actual people unloading my plane and people moving about as I have seen in videos. My current vid card supports shader 5.0 and the game says must support 2.0, and DX 10 mine handles DX 11. Now that still can be my vid card itself and my system configurations ( still working and testing those settings ) I did add the freeware and demo of Orbx ( the free airports and 2 ground stuff ) no issues at all with them.

It is very nice to see that Dove Tail added some different planes / choppers to the mix vs the box version. And as I have ""only read"" fixing issues with windows 8 that the boxed version won't ever do. 
Something I have seen all over the reviews and forums is people saying 1 they crash all the time still and you can't play off line.
The off line part yes would be nice to see them fix that for those that lose internet I have always been a hater to places like Steam for that one reason. I have lost my internet before and wanted to play a game I have been working on and can't because of no net connecton to verify. ( I haven't tried steam yet on this one... but I have another one that I can log in launch the game disconnet from the net play and exit and relaunch without the net connected like it stores the verifcation after first launch.) But off that rant lol

Crashing durring play all the time well that can be tons of reasons with both gamer machines and store bought.
As a RL computer person for many years here would be my questons for them
What kind of comp are you using? do you have on board or extended graphics? how much stuff do you have running while playing ( that eats up resources )? In steams case how fast is your net connection? and have you tried game boosters?
The number one thing I have come across over the years of the Internet is that people don't know how to properly clean thier computers. Computers I have come across have stuff running in the background and stuff you are unaware of that is distroying your system / internets performance. Along with programs running that are not needed during play. 

My ram ( 4 gigs ) runs with nothing open ( idle) at 13% and cpu is 0-5% right now having steams client open to do this review my ram is at 22% and cpu is 13% when I launch FSX either boxed or steam my ram goes to 44-56% and cpu 50-85% depending on what  graphics are loading. Without a game booster.

Please don't take all that as being a smart butt or anything just trying to give people ideas of what could cause their issues. And I'm sure there will be people saying I'm wrong but we all have our opinion and experence.

Hope my opinions and comments help people out.

92,14438307,english,"GOT CLARIFICATION FROM DOVETAIL GAMES ABOUT THE SDK:

Microsoft has now issued us with clarification on this matter. FSX: Steam Edition does not include a developer SDK and the focus for this release is to provide players with a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. If you wish to use the SDK it remains available in the boxed edition of FSX and all functionality will continue to work as it did prior to the release of FSX: Steam Edition. There are no plans to introduce a SDK to the Steam edition at this time.
*****************************************************************************************************************

The gold edition relaunch on steam after Gamespy got down. New desing on the launcher, steam friends showing on there. Multiplayer is good, it doesnt eat much connection, and does the job on GSM networking too. Ability to play as ATC or Pilot in multiplay is good plus. The King of Flight Simulation has gotten up from the grave, and is back bigger and much more evil than it was with addons, and works fine with old free software like PAX and other addons. 

Simulation is easy to understand, everybody can learn to fly a 747, or even little Cessna in no time!

Graphics are not HQ++++ but there are not many Flight Simulations that can do even that without eating your graphics card alive, or heating your CPU over 1000C. FSX was success, and hopefully this re-release of FSX wakes Microsoft studios to new era.

Only minus i give this game is the ability to play offline is not yet implemented, but becouse there are no CD-keys anymore, i understand this.

The Default Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam: Edition is a light-realistic simulation game, which is, it has a moderate realistic simulation, physics is kind of Good, and the cockpit interaction is bad and very limited (not that it is bad, but very easy and extremelly non-realistic, as you do not have interaction with even 30% of the cockpit buttons, switches, displays, etc), so what makes Flight Simulator X so popular among pilots and airplane lovers?

nothing more than it's gigantic amount of Addons (not talking about Steam's shitty addons, I'm talking about third-party addons you find on Just Flight and sim market.com), like PMDG's, Aerosoft's, Just Flight's and Carenado's ultra-professional airplanes, such as the Boeing 737, 747, 777, Bae Jetstream 41, A320/A321, DHC-6, DC-8, Beechcraft A31, B200, and a shitload others. These are just to point out the most famous ones, as there are a lot other developers and third-party airplanes who wouldn`t fit in a 100 pages review.

Flight Simulator X is a fully modular flexible simulator, the default Flight Simulator X in this steam page is not 10% of the realism it is able to reach, in the last paragraph I pointed out about 1% of the addon airplanes out there, but not it is not limited to airplanes, the third-party developers produce incredibly beautiful and breathtaking realistic scenery addons, weather engines, weather and lighting addons, graphic addons, crew addons, airports, flight planners, traffic, and the amazing (totally free) ultra-professional multiplayer that is VATSIM, and a goddamn absurdly gigantic amount of other addons payware or freeware avaiable on the internet.

If you want to take a peek of what is a fully-realistic addon powered flight simulator X, just open up youtube and type in ""FSX as real as it gets"" and search for a recent video, you'll know what I mean with breathtaking graphics and realism.

Flight Simulator X can be a simple fly-for-fun kind-of-realistic simulator for people who never flown a plane, which is the default FSX, or it can be a breathtaking advanced extremelly fully-realistic ultra-professional as-real-as-it-gets  airplane simulator with over 100gb worth of addons (trust me, my FSX has 133gb in HDD space), it's completelly up to you.

9,13893277,english,"Same as ever;performance wise.Dx9 cpu bias,Dx10 Gpu bias.Seems much more stable,perhaps some bugs were indeed put right.
Textures look basic 1080p and above;some add-ons (paid and freeware) use very hires textures,improving the look of aircraft and scenery.
Its got game elements added as missions;don't get the impression its a game though.Its a serious attempt at destktop flight simulation.
Loading times reduced win64.Much better loading times.Seems to handle big texture files much better,for instance no or little blurry image with vfr photo scenery .
Draw distance as viewed from control tower seems less than boxed version.
R9280 many dx10 preview problems in the visual department(Driver issue possibly dx 10 effects some only work in DX9 from older add-on aircraft)).DX9 glitch free.Keep in mind this was originally  released nearly ten years ago.*
A souncard is recommended though it works fairly well on many built in audio chips.Sounds great on soundblaster z card.
Needs add ons for aircraft and scenery if you intend to make it your serious sim.
CPU and GPU overhead less than those needed in current build xplane10...
Flight model with default aircraft is mixed,in terms of feel.(737 feels realistic for example)Default Cessna feels unrealistic.I recommend you buy  one A2A add-on with accusim bolt on.For Jet liner Captain sim or Pmdg.There are other other vendors that sell great aircraft,however i'd start here if you have a newish PC.
Is it better than xplane?FSX has vastly better support,even now with freeware and payware.FSX is more friendly to use,the interface is still good.Fsx clouds/weather have little impact on framerates.Air traffic and atc are fully intergrated into FSX.It does not have a great flight model (Subsonic flight)or HDR lighting like XP10.Xplanes supersonic flight model has not worked properly in 18 months(still not fixed)Xplane has basic traffic and basic atc.The weather engine in xplane requires very high quality cpu to look good.Both need payware helicopter,if thats what you want to fly.Default choppers are awful in both flightsims.
I like them both but cannot run xplane anywhere near maxed;Fsx is near maxed graphics wise on same desktop computer.
Some people are having lots of issues with installers for add-on aircraft/scenery.Mainly down to old software not supporting Win7/8 properly.*

ORBXpnw installs BUT!!!(area.149 /169etcetc add-on airfields CFG scenery not found)no idea why this shows up on scenery CFG.missing files upon loading(ORBX are looking at fixing the problem,which is good)
Earth sims Alderney(V1)works perfectly.
RealAir Duke V1.5 piston engine versionok
PMDG MD11 works.Needs mine , pref above specs to fly it smoothly.Has a separate program running in background of FSX ,for increased realism compared to the default aircraft.
VFR airfields vols1,2,3.ok(IOM by earthsims conflict with aiports disable in vfr3 configuration)

1 - PMDG: Aparently the new code disabled their products with a porpouse, once Dovetail rapidly contacted them to offer their softwares in its platform, as can be seeing at AVSIM, but PMDG refused this and discovered a way to implement their aircrafts (777 is available now).
2 - SDK was killed, almost limited to older versions of SimConnect.
3 - Some 3rd parties products that once worked fine with FSX SE now are having troubles.
4 - All links are removed without notice and reason! For the most experienced people it's not a big deal, but for new costumers it is. There is a large number of addons, even freeware, available in so many websites, but due to ""automatic delete links"" policy we can't show them. Avsim, Terra-Brasilis, Aerosoft, PMDG, OPUS Software, FSXfreewarelist, Opensky Project... I will not post the links because they will be deleted, but you can google it.

And if you need the sdk to develop new things (yay its so easy anyone can do this *sarcasm* get the boxed version with sdk for 10 bucks - thats just something completely irrelevant for a normal guy who just wants to play).

Personally im happy that this simulation was introduced here. It was at 5$ the time i bought it and i thought ""lets give it a try"". And i love it so far. Just be warned that you have to spend ALOT of additional money to improve it (aircraft,atc,fscaptain,scenery.landclass.. it goes on and on).

Only negative thing for me is that this game really isnt made for triplescreen setups which im used to.
Borderless windowmode on mainscreen i usually get the wanted 30+ fps with orbx,rex4,softclouds, weather engine and so on. And in the end it isnt that bad to undock panels and move them to other screens / watch your flight in a flightplanner.. whatever...

Is it compatible with every addon released ... NO
Does that bother me?... hell NO
You can easily check the forums or other sites to see what is working. And most of the important stuff works.
Like in every other simulator you sometimes have to find workarounds... edit config files... but if you are into that kind of games you should be used to it.

This is a re-release of FSX Gold Edition so you should not expect dramatic differences. However, we have updated it to include all standard Steam functionality, we’ve removed CD checking and combined the components of Gold Edition into a single installation. The major change we've made is in replacing the now-defunct GameSpy multiplayer systems with Steam features, enabling multiplayer to work seamlessly once again.

I knew I was in for a lot of frustration trying to get FSX to work.  I spent the last month trying to do so.  All the reading...reinstallations...everything seemed to go wrong.  Then a few days ago, I was able to configure a stable running game.  It has all been worth it.

This game has the backing of people/players each with over 6 years of experience and dedication to the FSX community.  Almost all the issues I ran into have already been addressed and the solutions posted on the web somewhere.  It's just a matter of searching on the web for suggested solutions to almost any problem.

I kept getting CTD's however which I couldn't stop even with everything stripped away so I gave up. Then I saw that a Steam Edition had been released with the Acceleration pack and which was also rumoured to have been optimised for modern operating systems and hardware.

Anyway, I stripped off the old FSX and installed Steam Edition and there are no more CTD's. It seems very smooth, even sitting in a PMDG 777 at a busy airport with lots of traffic. My old rig used to chug along at about 12fps but the new one is jammed at a limited 30fps (NVidia inspector setting).

Whether it's my new rig (i5 750 to i5 4690K) or whether it's the Steam addition making the improvement in performance, I couldn't say, but I'm a happy bunny either way.

There is also the possibility that more 'improvements' might be made to the code (within the bounds of DTG's license with Microsoft.)

About the game, the simulator out of the box, let's face it, is crap! without the serious addons such as PMDG, Vatsim, Orbx, ... etc the game is rated poor to mediocre and only targeting casual players. There is no actual complete simulation of Airbus and Boeing airplanes, you can't touch the overhead panel of the cockpit to play around with the butons to xfeed the fuel, shutdown damaged hydrolic pumps or extinguish the engine fire using the firing system. Nothing! you only control the navigation and couple of radios. The weather system is obsolete, the textures are old, the mesh is so low poly.
 
Dovetail didn't understand how important addons are, they are only planning for kids missions of simple features and ignoring the players request to support the existing addons that kept the game alive for 8 years. You hardly find a FSX pilot using such old texture or simple airplanes unless he really doesn't care about playing the game.

On the other hand, the addon developers such as PMDG and Aerosoft don't realize the potential of steam. They don't realize how steam is powerful in advertisment, promoting software and increase sales. They simply ignore actual integration by publishing their software as DLCs. Why are they expecting new players to figure out that there are cool addons if they can't be found on steam? A big question mark! The good addons are EUR70+ which is expensive not because they are really good and complicated but simply because they only target very few players. Using steam, they will target millions and the price will have to be reduced. A win win.

It is a big mess. Both parties are only targeting the few thousands of loyal virtual pilots and missing the big picture of attracting millions of new players and make them more interested in buy this simulator.

I laughed at the joke that was Microsoft Flight, and continued pouring countless hours and thousands of dollars into my humble hobby.. the came the announcement that Dovetail would be picking up the rights to sell FSX and it would be released on Steam...  at first, I thought ""well that is nice, maybe this thing isn't going to die after all.""

Here is where the trouble began...

The graphics were the best in 2005 but they do look a bit aged now, specially the ground textures when you're not flying very high, also there's no dynamic shadows and that modern stuff. A lot is left for your imagination, really. Also, even though you can fly anywhere in the world, there are no cities in great detail, you can go looking their signature buildings though, like the Eiffel Tower and the Liberty Statue, etc. It can be fun searching for them. You can learn a lot of geography if you want too.

I'd say it is MORE THAN worth for the money, but it will require some learning on your side if you never played flying games before. There's a huge set of scripted missions that can be pretty fun and challenging: like flying through Hawaii in a small plane with a tourism guide showing you everything to patrolling the skyes in around a rocket launch with a military jet.  Also there are awesome tutorials that will get you started into the game. Almost every mission will have a voiced co-pilot pointing you out stuff, and that makes the missions feel very real and awesome.

And if you want to get deeper into the game, there are thousands of mods that cover pretty much everything: graphical mods, physics mods, realism mods, whole countries and planes built in awesome detail, new missions, you name it. It can get as complex and complete as you want as long as you got the money to get the more cool addons. Looking at it that way, FSX is more of a basic engine you can build up to the highest possible standards. And that probably explains why there was no sequel built by Microsoft: FSX covers everything already. There are on youtube lot's and lot's of videos that show what some mods are capable, just try not to be discouraged into getting the game because of that though, it's is great in vanilla state anyway.",1420159481,1422291610,True,30,0,0.723047196865081787,3,True,False,False,76561198014296224,680,5,1931,0,1714,1513438181,,

15,14074757,english,"I'm a real-life CPL pilot, and I grew up with the Flight Simulator series. Flight Sim 2000 was the high point in the series. As for X, well... it's pretty good, but back in '06 it was very taxing on even the best systems of the time. I bought a bunch of aircraft from Carenado, PMDG etc and some of the aircraft are so detailed (the Precision Manual 747 was the worst back then) that a state-of-the-art PC (back then) ran at 40 FPS on a good day. 

Many years have passed and most of us, pilots and simmers alike, have moved on to the competitor (X-plane). The transition wasn't too hard for me as I had some experience with X-plane during IFR sim training in a certified Seneca simulator with instructor, instruments, flight deck etc. Personally, I prefered MS Flight Simulator to X-plane for personal use. Flight Sim is very straight forward, has a large community and feels good in a home computer. 

Alas, a third party developer bought the rights and gave us a 'renewed' Flight Simulator X. I was thrilled. It's been a long time since I've had a flight stick or quadrant at home, but I was too excited to wait for a proper set-up and made the purchase anyway. It's been nine years, my computer is fantastic (running the latest games effortlessly), thus I expected to experience Flight Sim X in a whole new way. 

Boy, what a huge disappointment...

They took the boxed version of Flight Simulator X, recompiled the nine years old code for modern systems, and released it to the public. The bugs are all there, and new ones have been introduced as a consequence of running a nine years old game in modern systems. The support is the worst. Dovetail Games will refer you to Microsoft for support, even tho they're the ones putting up the game for sale. I'm not even sure they're allowed to make changes to the code itself. Your third-party airplanes? Not sure, as I haven't tried to install anything yet simply because I can't get Flight Sim to work for more than 20-30 minutes at a time. It crashes to the desktop CONSTANTLY. Again, zero support. I've tried the forums, but all I got was a bunch of good-natured fans trying to help me out. You'll find unofficial solutions here and there on the internet, but nothing worked for me. Eventually, I was told by some angry fan that it was my system's fault. I can only laugh at the suggestion, seeing as this is a perfectly well cared for computer, running games such as Arma III (a VERY taxing game indeed) under Ultra at a steady 100+ FPS, zero glitches. Same goes for every other game in my library. 

Flight Simulator X is broken, and hopelessly so, given the nature of Dovetail's business pact with Microsoft. Avoid the frustration. So far, it's been nothing but a huge let down for me.

For the first time in a very long time, I am forced to write: I DO NOT recommend this game.",1421712270,1421712270,False,146,7,0.742146074771881104,18,True,False,False,76561198035410367,113,20,449,0,290,1458007194,1426173483.0,"Thank you for taking the time to share with us what you think of FSX: Steam Edition Widowmaker. 

Here at Dovetail Games, we have long been interested in moving into the flight arena and plan on developing the next generation of aviation simulations. The first step in this journey was for us to partner with Microsoft, the developers of the Flight Simulator series. We saw great potential in giving Steam users the opportunity to experience the flight simulation genre by releasing Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition.  We believe this will help reinvigorate the flight simulation community by making the software available to a generation of people who would not have encountered the simulator before.

Our aim with FSX: Steam Edition is to provide a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. Microsoft remains the developer of FSX and is solely responsible for implementing any new features or content to the core simulator. Meanwhile, Dovetail Games is acting as a publisher for Microsoft and is only licenced to modify the simulator in order to make it Steam compatible. This necessitated updating some of the existing features in the game such as the introduction of Steam multiplayer support to replace the now defunct GameSpy services. Although we have optimised FSX: Steam Edition for use on Steam, in accordance with our licencing agreement with Microsoft we are not at liberty to make significant functionality changes to the simulator.

Although we are working hard to provide compatibility with existing add-ons wherever possible, some add-ons may require optimising for the new Steam file structure by the developers. Many third party developers have already started to introduce these updates, and we will do our best to work with developers, publishers and the community to find solutions as needed. To ensure that as many add-ons as possible are compatible we are focused on providing both players and developers with a seamless add-on integration experience through the Steam platform.

We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing some issues with your PC while running FSX: Steam Edition. If you would like some help and advice we have a dedicated support team who you can reach by emailing us at dtgflightsupport@dovetailgames.com. Please drop us an email with the details and we will get back to you with some suggestions just as soon as we can. 

Thanks again for taking the time to share with us what you think of FSX: Steam Edition.

One touch makes a dramatic turn, and are difficult to fine tune.  Another complaint is that the game starts having framerate issues when approaching some airports, though I cannot tell if that is my system or the game itself.

I recommend finding information about the planes that you are flying to know exactly what they are doing, as this is a sim.  That way you can figure out best climb speed, role speed, best glide and so on, because they will matter in this simulator.  It will also help to learn about traffic patterns and other things like that.  Otherwise, give it a try and have fun!  I do, and I intend to invest in some flight controls for it as well.

The good:
Dovetail improved this game a lot than when the original dev them would have. 

The recent framerate fix really feels like to fly payware aircraft or fly through cities that requires a lot of power on a computer.

They updated the multiplayer since GameSpy is really redundant now.

The game will no longer crash if there's a memory problem.

The game works in Windows 8.1 and I'm running as of right now as I'm writing this.

I really not sure about if they ever improved anything else besides on what they fixed.

The bad:
Lack of support for addons (not DLCs Dovetail are releasing for this) meaning that people that makes payware aircraft and scenery to be tested prior to releasing it to the public to buy. I had tested some that were released and some of them will work and some will not. Its still FSX but some of the installers wouldn't find where the acutal install of the game is.

I'm really not complaining about the rest of the game expect for this.

I used to fly fs2000 way back in the day and enjoyed it but didn't have a joystick or yoke so I couldnt actually enjoy the full potential of that game. I acquired a joystick somehow and noticed FSX in the steam holiday sale so i splurged and bought it. Best 5 bucks ever spent. After watching countless learning vids and lets fly's i decided I wanted to make my experiance much more realistic. 
     I got involved with a few online communities and realized this game is deadly accurate when it comes to airport information. By using websites such as  www.fltplan.com and freechecklists.net I can easily fully plan out and complete a flight from point A to point B exactly as I would IRL.
     Also, to make the game a little more realistic (as far as flight planning) with even more information I recommend dl'ing a program called Plan G which is found at www.tasoftware.co.uk this program has an immense amount of information and alot of tools that can help you with sim flight planning.
     One last bit to mention is for a slight performance upgrade. Alot of people might not be optimized to run this game at the potential that their computer can handle. Go to this site www.venetubo.com/fsx.html and follow the steps on the bottom of the page. Then go here www.fsx-online.com/sites/default/files/files/FPS_Limiter_0.2.zip and download the FPS limiter.

65,13920743,english,"Microsoft Flight Simulator X (X as the Roman Numeral 10) is as you expect, an aviation based simulator released in 2006 by, well, Microsoft Studios. The game has recently been released on VALVe’s Steam distribution by Dovetail Games, bringing modern compatibility to a game that was (ironically) incompatible with Windows 7 and 8. The game is equivalent to the Gold edition, meaning Flight Simulator X Deluxe with the Acceleration expansion.

	Gameplay: The game plays as you expect, to simulate the characteristics of piloting aircraft of varying types from private propeller planes, passenger jets, stunt planes, gliders and even several helicopters. Either this can be done in freeflight where the player chooses their craft, starting location, weather, date and time or can take on missions, ranging from tutorial missions teaching the basics of aircraft to missions with specific objectives ranging from a simple navigation and landing at airports, rescue missions like landing a chopper at a burning oil rig to rescue the workers or running a Red Bull stunt course in the Extra 300S stunt plane. The Acceleration expansion pack adds three new craft, the Boeing F/A - 18 Hornet, the P-51 Mustang and the AgustaWestland EH-101 with new respective missions such as Mustang races or more military missions with the F/A - 18 such as directing air traffic away from a shuttle launch, chasing down a UFO or, with the EH-101, carrying cargo on the lift hook. Many, if not all, missions give themed rewards, completing the taxiing tutorial would reward you the “Rubber Wings”, for example. The player also has the ability to adjust in-game settings of realism such as the torque applied on propeller aircraft, turbulence effects, etc. (These apply to Free Flight only, missions force specific settings). This game either works as a straight-up game and simulator to a training aid that people aspiring to be pilots can use to get a grasp on piloting skills, the game is even used by real-world pilots to brush up on their skills while they’re not flying for real. Part of the appeal is being able to take off from locations close to home, for example I take off from Anoka County-Blaine Airport (ICAO: KANE) frequently, which is 2 nm from my house.

	Graphics: For a game from 2006, this game holds up well by today’s standards, especially since addons can be installed to enhance the graphical capabilities. They say gameplay needs focus over graphics but this is a simulator, it’s really not a crime to add graphical effects and detail into a game like this to give the potential to explore famous locations and in manners not legal or safe in real-life (such as flying in the Grand Canyon in an F/A - 18). As far as I know, the game’s optimized for nVidia cards and it seems to show. The effects can be adjusted to suit one’s taste and/or computer performance, aircraft detail, scenery density, water effects and weather effects. The camera view can either be a 2D cockpit overlay with buttons to bring up specific panels, a 3D virtual cockpit with movement effects and interactable switches, an outside “spot” view that allows viewing of the aircraft from any angle, specific outside views like from the perspective of landing gear shown in movies and a top-down view.

	Sound & Music: The sounds, are, amazing. The point in all simulators is to give a player a sense of feeling and feedback and one of the best ways to do this is through sound. Either the noise of propeller planes, the blasting woosh of jets along with other effects such as the electric motors moving flaps or retracting landing gear. Of course their are also environmental effects such as rain, wind and even thunder. The developers tried their best to emulate the real sounds these aircraft make such as the iconic ringing noise in Bell produced helicopters such as the Jet Ranger. The soundtrack is only present on the menus but the main theme has a very adventurous feel, the second is dramatic, the third is a slow peaceful theme while the rest are varying techno songs, each can be selected or if desired, third-party music can be imported to play on the main menu. The voicework is also well done, the tutorial speaker’s very nice sounding, giving various real aviation trivia and letting you know what to do when needed and giving fair warning of like, say, going too fast and stressing the aircraft. The pilot’s voice is very spliced to give out callsigns like FSX2006 as “Foxtrot-Sierra-Xray-Two-Zero-Zero-Six” but it would make sense to speak slowly and robotically in a real situation to ensure your callsign is loud-and-clear.

	Difficulty: The difficulty is extremely subjective but this game does carry a steep learning-curve to those new to the series or wanting to learn flying. It’s easy to take-off and fly but landing can be a challenge at first when learning the correct speeds and approach patterns. This only gets worse with helicopters that are extremely sensitive and require the utmost care when moving. The realism (and by extension, the difficulty) can be adjusted as stated before, trainees are recommended to keep options such as unlimited fuel, automatic management of fuel/air mixture, etc.

	The Goods: A very fun if relaxing game with a lot of possibility. Either to set up scenarios for oneself like performing cargo runs or flying passenger jets. At least in Free Flight, things like traffic rules and ATC communication are completely optional, allowing very casual play without the requirement of flight plans.

	The Bads: Early on, the game had a lot of optimization and performance issues but with the Steam edition, that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. The game has a steep learning curve that can put of a grand majority of players.

	Overall: Aviation enthusiasts, trainees and even real pilots are recommended to try this game out. Not only is it great as a game but also as a training tool (do keep in mind this is not a stand-in for real world training).",1420877339,1421325734,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False,76561197999957759,122,22,11640,0,1196,1514787979,,

Some updates are coming out, something that the boxed FSX has not seen in a while.

On the other hand, the reason for these updates is due to the fact that the FSX:SE seems to have issues with many addons, some of the addons that are widely used by the FSX community, seem to not work in SE, example would be the PMDG airplanes, which simply do not work.

All FSX:SE needs is to have some updates injected to deal with the addons, and the developers also changing their addons to work with FSX:SE and this would be a very very strong product.

FSX:SE also finally allows for shared cockpit, so you can have a commander and first officer working together to fly and land airplanes.

I've used this feature, but it's not working well, it always takes about 2 hours of frustration disconnecting and connecting, recreating sessions until everyhting works, but when it does, it's a fantastic experience.

Well. I saw this version of the old masterpiece at 50% reduction so I bought in. I think that for my 12€ or so it's a decent price. So, what are my impressions? I'll keep this short.

Firstly, the almost 5 hour download astonished me, considering that the disc version is installed and up and runnung in less than an hour. But fair enough, I don't expect the earth for that price.

When I'd tweaked the settings to the same as my disc version I took a Mooney Bravo up from Kai Tak, just for a quickie.

The first thing I noticed - has anyone else? - is the torque drag (prop plane pulling to one side gradually on the run up to take off). That's cool, because you do get some of this in most real single props.

The flight itself was nice and smooth, 50fps with no stutters, and no 3rd party performance booster. That's good. A lot of people want more fps than that but 50 works fine with me, whether I can get more or not - it also frees up resources to puch other settings a bit more. And I did. And it worked fine. Well done there.

I've only tried Kai Tak as yet, but the Kai Tak scenery... So-o-o-o-o empty!!! I've got the scenery addon disc on my disc FSX version and wow. I'm not only comparing but saying that Steam could have included some better scenery as a part of their tweaks of the disc version. Maybe in the pipeline?

I'd be interested to find out how to uninstall the military planes as I've no time in this life for such stuff. I don't shoot at people - even if it's a simulator.

Last thing, a question. Do freeware addons really install into Steam FSX? Maybe I could get my sceney discs installed into this version? Help?

And last but certainly not least, can I get my FSUIPC (paid) download into this program?

To summarise, then, I'll recommend this simulator (I wish Steam would stop calling it a game...) as I think with future updates initial issues will be ironed out and it will be a very good app indeed. I'll also keep my disc version though because I've got too much third-party stuff installed and I like flying around a full Manhattan scenery as opposed to the one that comes with Steam.

94,13940020,english,"Firstly, I'll get the obvious stuff out of the way...

It's from 2006, so graphically it's not great. The UI is typically Microsoft-Fugly. It doesn't have a great deal of charm. It is spectacularly reliant on community contribution, and while there's a lot of extra free content, it's a pain in the neck to install some of it. As in, unzip files into folders and then move them into other folders...

But if you're OK with the base scenery/planes then this isn't going to be a major issue.

Get a joystick or a controller (I use a controller. I'd love a joystick.) with as many buttons and levers as it is humanly possible to acquire, and it would be beneficial to run multiple screens, because, despite the drawbacks...

... if you want a non-combat flight-sim which doesn't cut corners, you're going to have a hell of a hard-time beating this one... and you may as well have all the kit.

This is a remarkably deep sim, allowing you to take off and fly around much of the world in a staggering variety of aircraft (though you'll have to install a fair few of those yourself if you really want to broaden your horizons) 

There are missions to complete if you want to, or free-flight if you don't. If you live in a moderate population centre, you'll likely even find your local airfield is there... though if there's no specific scenery pack for it, you may find - as I did - that the basics are right - such as where the coast is - but the procedurally generated filler will just hazard a guess as to what your city or town actually looks like.

Where the game excels is how it allows you - as a sim enthusiast - to develop your own flight plans and actually FLY the plane from point-A to point-B, in real-time, using real-world weather taken from your local weather station, and with real light conditions based on your actual time of day.

You can do it using all the electronic gadgetry in anything from a modern Air New Zealand SAAB passenger jet, to the visual 'fly by the seat of your pants' Bleriot XI from 1905... assuming you bother to download them.  The point is that there are plenty of options.

For those of you who are interested, but are not really familiar with the Microsoft sim range... you don't get to shoot things. There are races and missions and training courses, but no enemies diving in from the sun.   There are airports and cities and landmarks, but no AAA or bombing runs.  There's a lot of button pushing (some of it quite obscure) and it depends on the aircraft you're using whether there's a virtual cockpit, or a static BMP one, or none at all.

You'll spend a lot of time watching the autopilot tell you how far away from your next waypoint you are... though you may be able to have a chat to other players or the control tower in multi-player games. It's not about the action.

But it REALLY hit the spot for me as far as flight-sims go, and I'm loving finding those rare downloadable aircraft online and flying them around.

Into hard-core simulation games where you have to stretch a braincell or two, and don't mind not being disturbed by incoming missiles? This could be the game for you.

32,13874846,english,"After numerous bad experiences with ostensibly-well-reviewed flight simulators, I was beginning to think the genre wasn't for me any more, that maybe it was now inaccessible to anyone who didn't either have a real world pilot's license or Job-like patience.  I fondly remember spending hours trying to land my Cessna in the original Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the joy I felt when I finally got it right, but I just don't have that sort of time any more.

I am glad to say Flight Simulator X brought that joy back.  It is not perfect by any means - the shell is a little unstable, alt-tabbing (on my installation of Windows 7 at least) means kissing your session goodbye, and the scenery is often somewhat lacklustre.  But it is accessible, and that counts for a lot.

You get a wide variety of aircraft to play with, the game simulates the /entire world/, and you can choose the skill level that's right for you.  FSX ~wants to let you into its tree fort to play, and has very well done tutorial missions to get you up and running.  (A lot of simulators forget the importance of good tutorial missions.  If the tutorial missions aren't done well, the new user experience is likely to be limited to those missions and the 'Delete all local content' menu option on Steam.)  

How far you want to take it is up to you, and you don't have to take it all as one lump - you can, for example, ignore the radio and navigation entirely if you so choose, and concentrate on learning to fly by the seat of your pants.  If you want to land on a carrier in oatmeal-thick fog on one engine, FSX will let you do that, too: enough real world pilots seem to play FSX that it doesn't seem likely it's been overly diluted.  

FSX is, in other words, easy to learn but hard to master.  My advice for newbies is to take the ultralight, tune down the realism settings, and just enjoy flying around the photogenic city of your choice for a while.  Land on a scenic landmark or two, watch the AI traffic come in and out, then maybe try a short intercity hop or two.",1420606839,1420606839,True,1,0,0.513473033905029297,0,True,False,False,76561197979396307,402,9,41594,0,2385.0,1597811184,,

SHORT VERSION: Buy this game if you love flight sims, lots of missions and a stack of real to life scenery/weather/planes etc.  It will not be money wasted.

LONG VERSION: Lifelong Flight Simulator fans will remeber the day when FS 2000 was released in that big cardboard box with a heatbound Pilot's handbook over 230 pages long; beautifully presented and well worth the buy.  Then, it seemed, when FSX came along, the fad was nearly over.  Releasing FSX Acceleration confirmed this, and the devs behind the Microsoft flight sim series were put out to pasture, where all the devs from closed studios are left to run free range.  Some survived the mass slaughter of 1874, but most, sadly perished.  Apparently, some now work for Dovetail and after a long time, we now have the Steam Edition of FSX to enjoy.

Guys, you've done a fantastic job!

In the original FSX, you would find that moving the camera around the plane was quite sketchy in that it would jump where it wanted most of the time, and there was noticable lag.  This is THE main problem with older games when played on newer systems - GPUs as powerful as those today were'nt dreamed of when those games were developed.  They knew not of 1920x1080 and, as such, the software has to do the best it can nowadays.  FSX-SE has addressed that by ensuring that there will never be lag again.  Running this on a GTX 770, whilst it powers 3 screens; not a single instance of lag in display.  I will say this though, as this is a game that wasn't really designed for 1920x1080, just remember the old Windows Alt+Enter trick, and you'll be fine.

Back to the lag, the controls no longer display laggy instances, and as soon as you move your joystick/mouse/gamepad, the plane reacts, with such precision, you wouldn't know you were in a simulator until you see the pixelated ground you're about to crash into.  Airports were great and really well designed in FSX, but now they have had a bit of a revamp, so expect some sharper images.

In general, the game has been VASTLY improved, and, as a private pilot myself (before I lost my license due to the UK government getting scared of diabetics flying planes and insisted that every diabetic pilot or ATC personell be summarily fired) I love being able to get back behind a flight stick and rudder.  This game is also great for the casual plane nut, as there are so many missions to choose from, all ranging from the VERY basics (which will get you up in the air and give you an understanding of how a plane actually works) to the INSANELY hard (engines on fire, having to fly 60+nm in a snow storm without engines in a 747-700).  You can change realism settings, set failures and faults to happen at a specific time, location or randomly.  You can download real world weather (updated every 15 minutes) from WHEREVER you are in the world.

I would say this, however, if you really are a proper ""casual"" flight nut, I'd recommend Microsoft Flight instead.

A vast array of other great missions, planes, scenery etc are included in the game, however there is a plethora of other mods available and there have been since FS 98 way back when.

So come one come all and enjoy this amazing revamp of a modern classic.",1420589306,1420589306,True,206,21,0.909769713878631592,3,True,False,False,76561197975883045,828,12,3941,0,519.0,1589990845,,

The selection of planes is very good, most heavily focusing on commercial planes, from small single-props to the all-mighty 747.  The missions make for great structured gameplay, and you do not have to follow all the instructions, just complete the overall objective (finish the race, land the plane, go here, go there, etc.).  Also, the map in-game covers the entire world, so you can chart a flight from Laguardia in New York and actually fly to Heathrow  in England or LAX in California.

39,13747015,english,"I am so glad that Steam picked up MS Flight Sim X! I've been using MS Flight Sims since the first version I can remember.  When Microsoft dropped support, I did switched to Lockheed's Prepar3D, which uses a upgraded FSX engine with DX11, but I'd much rather support FSX under Steam!
FSX really needs Steam Workshop for all its many add-ons as DLCs, which always have been a real pain to locate, purchase, and install. Steam would so much improve things for the Flight Sim World!

Fortunately, all the addons I have are compatible with both Prepar3D and FSX, and they all seem to work fine with this Steam version. I may have to run one of the Registration Fix tools like TweakFS, to use a few aircraft again in Prepar3D, but I haven't had any problems so far and I am used to fixing my simulator installations and getting addons working.

I recommend the REX Real Environment Xtreme, Orbx Airports & Terrains, Just Flight's Air Hauler and REX Latitude add-ons, which greatly enhances the visuals and gives you something fun to do hauling cargo around the world, managing the Cargo Company and its aircraft. Someone please make these as DLCs ASAP! Orbx also has a few free demos of a great starting airports and terrain regions to fly in.

I look forward to updates of FSX to DX11 for Better Graphics, More Missions for More Things To Do, More Flight & Instrument Training, Ground & Tower Operations, Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and other improvements!

**NOTE:  If you are having problems with add-ons, it is most likely an registry issue and/or configuration files located in user windows profile directories.  If you check my screenshots, I have multiple addons working concurrently: REX, Orbx and Traffic X including a premium aircraft with everything maxed.  Everything should run perfect in the Steam version, it does take a lot of effort sometimes to get your simulation environment right.  There are guides in the Prepar3D community that address many problems I see people having with the Steam version.

I purchased FSX Gold Edition several years ago, and enjoyed playing singleplayer and multiplayer for many months. I especially enjoyed the multiplayer servers, being able to communicate with other players as pilots and ATCs. The multiplayer ran on the GameSpy service, which was taken offline some time ago, taking much of the fun away. I also installed several dozen extra planes from the internet in an effort to increase the variety and replayability of my disc copy. This, however, corrupted the files saved on my computer, and I was unable to reinstall the game from the disc after uninstalling it in an attempt to solve the problem. FSX was no more.

THEN......... 
Steam releases Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam edition, and I immediately snatch it up on sale for 80% off -- $5
From what I can tell, the Steam edition includes all of the content included in the disc Gold Edition, all bundled together and sold on Steam. 
And the best part is, Steam revived the multiplayer, and it now runs off of Steam, instead of GameSpy . Multiplayer is easy to connect to, has integrated steam friends support, and is very stable and quick. The game is almost perfect.

My one non-positive comment about the game would be the fact that it CURRENTLY lacks Steam Workshop support. FSX is a great candidate for addons, as there are relatively few planes included in the official game. There are planes available on the internet for download, but it would be very helpful to have an integrated source on Steam for well-made downloadable aircraft.

53,13849075,english,"I've been playing Flight Sims for years. I tried a friend's copy of FSX years ago, and my computer was not up to snuff at the time. During it's time, it was cutting edge.

Now, it runs amazingly well on my computer, which is a modest 3Ghz machine with 2 gigs memory running Windows 7. I've had 0 crashes, and am very pleased to see many add-on developers adding support for FSX:SE as well. The developer has made multiplayer work relatively well, as long as you know how to configure your firewall hardware or software. (This is an issue with ALL multiplayer games that don't just use a big central server.)

On to the real review:

   FSX is more of a simulator than a game. It cannot compare to the $200+ simulators out there, of course... but then again, it's around 10 years old. What it does have is BEAUTIFUL graphics, an amazingly huge world, and aircraft that respond in a realistic manner. Do not be heavy handed with the controls, you will meet Charlie Brown's Kite Eating Tree -- Only it's bigger, and eats 737's.


   You get realistic ATC, wonderful weather, and a huge community of addon developers and players that adore flying and aircraft. You can fly with your friends, not only on missions and whatnot, but also both of you sharing control of one aircraft, to allow the more experienced pilot to train the less experienced.  

   The game includes tutorials on proper flight procedures, Air Traffic Control, single engine, multi engine, and commercial flight. This ""game"" is a wonderful experience for aircraft enthusiasts and comes out of the box with a wide variety of fun aircraft... IT is not a shooter, however. You won't be bombing places, or shooting down your friends... However, you CAN set up fly-in's, races, and many other fun activities!

That the developers (Microsoft...) would update the graphics if they would release the game on steam. Online is also very boring. There are probobly around ten servers in total.

Still crashes sometimes
Should give speed reduction instructions during approaches.

Detailed airplanes;Start from a little ultralight and work your way up to the 747-400.Each come with 3D cockpits which can be selected with F9.
Multiplayer:GameSpy powered the old FSX Multiplayer,and unfortunately shut down.FSX Multiplayer here runs off Steam.So you can use your Steam ID to log in.
Landmarks,roads,rivers and more simulated during the game.
Ability to enable G-effects:Blackout when over-G,redout when under-G(Irritating when flying the F/A-18.Yes,there is a fighter jet here.Weapons not included,carrier tutorials are)

But the big thing with this game it that YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT IN 3D! I play this game using NVIDIA's stereoscopic 3D settings, and the 3D quality with FSX is unparalleled for a game that wasn't ""designed"" for stereoscopic 3D. The cockpits looks even more remarkable and flying though clouds or a mountain range is phenomenal when NVIDIA's 3D setting are set to max. (There is a glitch where lights don't show up in the right spots, but it's minor to everything else. NVIDIA rates it as ""excellent"" for 3D quality and it deserves it.)

This version doesn't appear to include the FSX Acceleration add-on pack (yet) with details to more cities like Istanbul and more aircraft, but yet I did notice that Acceleration aircraft (like the F-18) show up in my list if I check the box to show all aircraft variants. That could very well be because upon installation it noticed that I have the disc-based version installed and it prompted me to import my information. So, if you own the Acceleration Pack and have it installed when you buy the Steam version, it looks like it gets pulled in.

Sure, this is almost 10 years old, but it's still a lot of fun to fly around in areas you otherwise might never see with excellent topographical feature and city details.

This is by no means a game, it is a hard core flight simulator, With over 10,000hrs on it my self (boxed version) you will see my hours soon rise quite quickly. 

But if you have the boxed version, why the steam version? i hear you ask. Good quesation. Well its simple really, as i have herd that dovetail intend on releasing new add-ons/expansions for this very version, which means only the steam version is being up-dated and worked on. meaning the boxed version os out-of date. 

The steam version is still just as customizable as the boxed, and housed in your steamapps folder just as it is in your program folder. so installing extra add-ons is not an issue, as they have not touced that side, and if they did, well i woud not have bought it.



 There are unfortunatly some add-ons that currently do not work with FSE:SE, those i have found to be atm 

- Cargo Pilot - from just flight
- Active Sky Next 

But i have herd that ALL A2A planes work 100%, now this is a good point, because if your in the business of getting add-on aircraft. then A2A is the way to go. the attention to detail, the flight physics, the realism, it is all mind blowing. 


This is going to breath new life into an old but epic simulator. @£19,99 (when not on sale) i think that is a more than fair price, being as this is the FULL version of FSX with acceleration.

25,13763053,english,"This is a review for any FSX flyers that are unsure about switching to the steam version.

So I considered buying this again even though I have the retail copy, as I read that it had been optimised which was my main issue with the existing game. Having played this for sometime on at least three iterations of upgraded machines I was quite aware that just throwing hardware at the fsx code gave diminishing returns in performance. 

Through a combination of; reading posts from other converts saying that they had experienced performance improvements and seeing it in the steam sale, I figured what was there to lose, though at this point I should mention that I am a TrackIR 5 user and had seen some posts reporting issues around getting this to work, this did cause me some concerns, but it appeared that there were some work around/fixes that could be applied to sort these problems out. 

After some reflection ( and the sale price enticement ) I figured, at worst I would get FSX running in steam with multiplayer revitalised and the possibility of future support and add-ons through the store or everything would work fine and I would see some much needed performance boost.

Having comitted to the purchase I uninstalled FSX retail from my hard-drive just to be sure that I gave the steam version its best chance, I then hit the install button and retired to a safe distance while the 10.2. Gigs downloaded. 

Once ready to go, I started up TrackIR first, just so that FSX would see that I had it and meant business, then pressed play, after the usual licensing, initialisation and  loading of stuff screens I got to the familiar main screen with all ok including importantly the TrackIR status lights.

Into settings I went, where I noticed all had been set promisingly to ""Ultra"", I just changed the resolution to match that of my desktop, selected stock Cessna at Heathrow ( big airport for FPS test ) and went for a test flight.

Using the shift+f x2 to check FPS, I was pleased to see a framerate of over 70fps with the settings that FSX had defaulted me to ( apart from my upping of the resolution ), so I immediately returned to the settings to put more stuff on, having set everything up higher than I had ever done with the old FSX ( which at last count was giving me around 25 fps ) I returned to see that I was getting around double that at 50ish fps.

So for any unsure about this release, in terms of performance and TrackIR, the transition for me has been smooth so far problem free, I have seen a doubling in fps and this with more traffic ( air, road and sea ) as well as higher densities/detail of buidings and vegetation and my TrackIR worked first time. 

This is FSX that, although still showing its age in some regards, has for me been revitalised to finally provide me with the performance, and so gameplay, which I really wanted but never got from my pre steam version.

32,13531919,english,"Since  I intially wrote my review for FSX, I have discovered and rectified the issues I was having - all of which were down to the settings causing conflicts on my machine - and as a result I have now changed my recommendation of the game.

Pros
The in-game tutorials are very good - some of which are very challenging.
The ability to pick up and drop cargo from some aircraft adds a whole new set of challenges.
The interiors are far more detailed than they used to be on earlier MS Flight Sims and have more working controls.


Cons
Very large initial download if you have a slow broadband connection.
Some of the airports are somewhat lacking in detail - Heathrow looks nothing like the real thing other than the runway layout. For a more realistic feel you would have to buy additional scenery packs - an extra cost.

I have still to try out running some of my FSX compatible addons with the Steam version, but, from what I have read, it should not be a problem... time will tell.

Original post:- 

Currently, the jury is still out on this one as to whether it is worth the download (10Gb) or not due to problems -  hence the not recommending... for now. I played the demo years ago and thought I would give it a crack since there was 80% off at the time of purchasing. I'm beginning to think that I should stick with FS2004 as I get about 2-3 minutes of flying before my system completely freezes and I have to Ctrl Alt Delete and then end task - something I don't get with any other game. Hopefully we may get a patch soon that will address some of the issues that I, and other users, have been experiencing.  SInce there are over 400 reviews giving very positive feedback, I am inclined to think that it may be something about my machine the software doesn't care for, but, I would suggest that anyone thinking of buying this game, be prepared for a bumpy ride.

On the plus side, the aircraft and helicopters are nice to fly and the scenery is better than on the older FS2004 with some nice extras like moving ships etc. I would like to comment on the good points further, but up to now, I've had very little chance to experience them.",1419284242,1420116006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995223384,27,2,9203,0,1011.0,1495057152,,

Played an airplane simulator back when I was 6 years old on Windows 95. I used to call it the ""airplane game"". I didn't do much in it; merely took off and crashed whenever I got bored of being airborne. But that game was SUPER entertaining to my little mind. I played thousands of hours of it. Consequently, my love for aircraft and my seemingly natural skill at flying them took over and I purchased this game.

Although this is a completely different, updated version of the game, it still gives me fond memories.

What I like about this 'game' is the mission feature. Every mission unlocks a reward (no idea why Steam doesn't have achievements for this one). I also enjoy the multiplayer. I love meeting real pilots and hearing them teach you their unique lingo. 

The downside to this game is it graphically lags whenever you're on the ground and there are other players around you. My computer surpasses the system specs by a mile, yet it still lags for me. In terms of network lag, I rarely experienced it.

Long story short - read the manuals, play with the buttons & knobs on your dashboard and play the game. It looks highly similar to aircraft interiors in the real world. 

9/10 I will give it a 10/10 once they get achievements and workshop mods for this going on Steam.",1420095782,1420095782,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,76561198010371788,540,148,2513,0,752.0,1485670073,,
36,13753977,english,"As far as a pick-it-up simulator goes, I still have a hard time suggesting any other Flight Simulator over this one. It comes with many planes and, unlike another simulator recently released, has an entire world full of airports. It's easy enough to find free airplanes online instead of paying $20 or more per plane, and as far as realism goes, it isn't that different for someone who isn't an aspiring or real pilot. I'm sure the hardcore among us (or those with normal vision who have the career available to them) could tell me all day what the differences are, but I myself don't care enough for that. There's a TON of flight help and learning tools available, and a ton of aspects about flying are picked apart and explained through missions and text reads through the Learning Center.

Having said all that it has some issues. It crashes randomly, has atrocious graphics for this day and age (people saying they're better are probably playing on Ultra for the first time as Microsoft wouldn't allow the graphics to be updated), and the menus could really be streamlined especially for new comers, but if you're used to this game and want it in the glory of Steam connection and not have to pray to the gods Gamespy, you're probably willing to look over that. And what a glory the Steam multiplayer is, no longer do I get disconnected from Gamespy for blinking too hard! I still seem to disconnect from my friend's games after about an hour, but odd quirks to be expected for an old game like this. This game is a memory hog, seems to have some issues with certain graphics cards, and the outside camera is still as wonky as ever, but these are things you end up getting used to.

It has one of the largest amount of third party add ons for aircraft, skins, scenery & environments viewable and usable on client side only.

It does have a few lacking qualities in that some of the stock scenery landmarks still seem drab and plain (why can't they get the whole world done right? lol) but as I said above add-ons help immensely.

48,13741485,english,"FSX is a legendary sim platform that still shines despite its age and technical drawbacks. For me, it is a labor of love as flight simulation is my biggest indoor hobby. I'd like to give a fair warning to newcomers (or people returning after some time to the sim):

[list]
    [*]This is still an outdated piece of software and will in many cases require various tweaks to get smooth gameplay. See the FSX Tweak tool website to optimize your config file and subscribe to YouTube streamers like MattDavies to get the latest tweak suggestions.
    [*]This game shows its age in its ugly textures. Think of this game as a basic platform for a hobby. As it stands, it feels unfinished. Entire towns are missing, airports are out of date, much of the world is barren. Decide if this is a hobby you're interested in investing in. If so, it can be extremely rewarding. I highly recommend FTX Global as the first upgrade to make. I also recommend Active Sky Next (NOTE: Currently does not support Steam Edition, being worked on) and REX Soft Clouds. This is a perfect combo of land and sky upgrades for around USD $100 all said and done. There are many other scenery upgrades available, this is just my preference.
    [*]Many of your addons may not work just yet if you're migrating from the boxed version. DoveTail is actively working with developers to get them fixed and I am confident that as long as developers are interested in staying current to the market, they will work on it. Many addons that did not work for me on day 1 now work fine, and some new addons such as REX Soft Clouds are FSX:SE compatible upon launch.
[/list]

Fair warnings aside, if your interest in flight is very casual, this may not be for you. It is sure to disappoint anyone who is looking for a good looking flight game right out of the box. For people interested getting involved in simulation, this is still where it's at. There is a fantastic community and tons of resources, and the add-on market is thriving, FSX still being the primary target for add-on developers despite XPlane 10 and Prepar3d starting to meaningfully compete for a share of that market.

Although we are working hard to provide compatibility with existing add-ons wherever possible, some add-ons may require optimising for the new Steam file structure by the developers. Many third party developers have already started to introduce these updates, and we will do our best to work with developers, publishers and the community to find solutions as needed. To ensure that as many add-ons as possible are compatible we are focused on providing both players and developers with a seamless add-on integration experience through the Steam platform.

69,13695957,english,"Having flown FSX since it's original release by Microsoft, I was very happy that Dovetail took on the sim and re-released it with a few updates to make the sim run smoother and add the multiplayer function again. As a stand alone simulator, even without the multitude of add-ons, the sim is a great tool for helping to understand aviation and flight in general. The real pro's of the stand alone simulator are you have a variety of aircraft already avaliable, you can fly anywhere in the world to thousands of different airports and you can run through all the lessons and tutorials to help teach you all you need to know. With the updates Dovetial have done my FSX:SE now runs amazingly smooth (which is what every FSX owner wanted before) and with it avaliable on Steam with multiplayer it opens up more online fun!

The big problem with the original FSX was when Microsoft shut their team down, no more updates were done. This is where I hope that Dovetail will keep things going with more improvements for FSX:SE. My only concern is that Dovetail need to keep the other already avaliable add-ons able to work with the FSX:SE. This will ensure those previous FSX owners come on board with Dovetail by ensuring the previously owned payware add-ons don't become unusable. The only reason the original FSX kept going was the huge variety of aircraft, weather and ATC updates made by many flight enthusiasts and some great companies with some amazing payware add-ons. Only time will tell, but I have high hopes for the future of FSX:SE.

Stand alone it is a great sim and a lot of fun for any aviation enthusiast, BUT, when you start adding in some of the amazing add-ons avalialbe, it brings a whole new life to the sim. I am looking forward to see what Dovetail can produce. Some add-ons will improve weather (Active Sky Next), some add-ons will bring a whole new level to 'As real as it get's' (PMDG) and other will add realistic ATC via VATSIM. If you want to expand your virtual aviation hobby, it's as easy as downloading some add-ons. They've kept FSX going for the past 10 years!

97,13650916,english,"I'm a private pilot and I've owned the boxed version of Flight Simulator X for years.

When I upgraded my system to Windows 8.1 I was saddened to see that my old Flight Simulator X started to develop glitches.  So when Steam released a new version I was excited.  I bought it on day one of it's release.
 
However, free flight mode wouldn't work.  But after emailing DoveTail Games tech support they deteremined that I had a corrupt download.  I did a re-download and install and it worked perfectly.  The problems were not with the game.
 
I'm very pleased that the graphics are better than ever.  There is over 24,000 airports around the world all with exact runway layouts, taxiways, buildings and scenery around the airports.  Plus every major city, tourist attraction, landmark, river, lake, stream around the world has been simulated. Navigation aides operate just like in real life.  Flight Simulator was a huge undertaking and it's all at your fingers for just a few bucks.  Amazing.

If you plan to get your pilot's license or need a tool to stay sharp (without spending $100+ per hour to rent a plane), then Flight Simulator X is a must have.  It's just a no-brainer.  Even if you own other flight simulators, you won't find any with all these features.
 
Microsoft along with other companies spent many years and millions and millions of dollars developing this product.  When it was developed it was actually built to take advantage of faster computers that would be available in the future.  That's why as time goes by, the game actually gets better.  
 
While I use it as a flight instruction tool, my son uses it like a game.  He enjoys the missions and together we go on sight-seeing tours.  We've  Flown over the pyramids and over the Nile river.  We've tooled over Washing DC and viewed the Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Monument and the Whitehouse.  You name it we've been there, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Space Needle, etc.
 
Your kids will learn more about world gerography from this game than from any book.  Because it's not just pictures, it's real life simulation.  They have to take off froma local airport and actually find landmarks.  
 
After I bought my Steam version of Flight Simulator, I was going to install my boxed ""Accelleration Expansion Pack"".  But to my surprise, I found that it already came pre-installed with this Steam set.
 
AND THE BEST PART... I once paid over $600.00 for a packaged video course on getting a private pilot's license.  But FSX comes with built in flying lessons by legendary Certified Flight Instructor Rod Machado.  He will teach you how to get not only your private pilot's license, then your instrument rating, then your commercial license, and then how to become an Airline Transport Pilot.  That much real life training in a real life flight school would be at least $25,000.  But you get it for free with FSX.  

Obviously nothing beats learning in a real plane, but this is a close second.  And it's all for the price of a pizza.

To start with; the game itself didn't change that much compared to the boxed version. One of the best things of this version is the framerate. Dovetail did some engine tweaks which causes the game to run very smoothly now. Before this wasn't.

Multiplayer is a sort of back, although there are (yet) a few servers and that's it. At least game-spy is done.

Now, very important to remember: [b]this is [u]not[/u] a game[/b]. It's a simulator and basically it's kinda hardcore. Don't expect easy handling which makes you just fly. If you are thinking of buying this game, I recommend to buy a joystick as well. It gives you a better experience and makes it just easier.

Addons on fsxinsider.com are payware (which means you have to pay for those addons) ones, yet there are [b]a lot[/b] of freeware addons. Just google it.

Now, the game doesn't really have downsides other than the few multiplayer server which people have to host themselves. And there is yet no working multiplayer with the boxed version. It seems they will possibly do some updates... I hope at least.

In a nutshell:

Buy this game if you are a aviation freak, and buy a joystick or a home cockpit if you want to play seriously.

9,13618951,english,"     After dabbling around with early versions of MS Flight Simulators and after Microsoft FLIGHT I was finally able to break my fears and frustrations when landing a plane.   I was just awful at it and it kept me from being serious at all or wanting to learn any more for many years.
     After the challenges in MS FLIGHT I wanted to commit to learning all the rest and sought out the MS FSX Demo and learned on that. 

     Earlier this year. After trying to find out if Microsoft would release a FSXI I,  learned Dovetail would be bringing it to STEAM and just waited... ...and am so happy I did.

     You can understand as a noob and with no investment in FSX beyond the demo and with no mods or add-ons to worry about how that would be a good thing.  Just to get the box, the patches, etc. etc. and hope it all works with Win7, etc. was a big worry for me. Typically I am not good with that kind of thing and get very frustrated when things aren't just, ""Install and go!""   Dovetail was going to take care of all that and I was elated to wait.

     When September and October passed I was a little dis-heartened and wrote Dovetail a ""Dear Santa"" letter. To tell them FSX was still #1 on my list and it would be great to get it for Christmas.  My reply was short: ""Stay tuned""

    Every few days I would check and was gobsmacked when it quietly released with no fanfare. Finding out it was available for only $5.00 after the wait and the work they put into it made my Christmas and this whole year! To me...they are the GREATEST!

     ""Install and go!"" And. I have. A no hastle install. It runs beautifully. There have been some random crashes now and then but to me...that is expected for awhile as they fully work it all out.   It's been wonderful to finally go through the tutorials and start making my way through the missions. I'm up to the, 'Rome-Naples Airline Run'

     The mods and add-ons are amazing and blow my mind how far people have taken it.  The Google and BING map/scnery integration and newer GPS systems are at the top of my list and getting them free or in a DLC would be nice.  

    My hopes are there will be a happy medium with regards to the folks who already have content. I see it both ways and can understand and feel the frustration.

   Anyway I have gone on long enough. I am a very happy individual and am very happy to finally join the ranks of the FSX community thanks to Dovetail!

10,13616251,english,"BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I've been flight simming since the FS98 days and FSX is still the unoptomized pig that it was on initial release. Not to say that this isn't a good sim, but the hassle and frustration of going through individual files, tweaking values, and finding the one set of settings that works for your PC isn't worth the effort. And to give you an idea, I'm running an i7 3770k at 4.5ghz paird with a brand new GTX 970 and still get sub 30s with the graphics set to medium high. Get airbourn its not so bad, but the engine still chugs when you're close to the ground (usually on final appraoch, THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASE OF FLIGHT when you need smoothness the most).

The FSX community is fantastic, and there are those who are more than willing to help you find those desired settings to get the game running as smoothly as possible. However, if you just want a sim that is easy to pick up and use, go back to FS9 or go to X-Plane 10. There's a reason why the Microsoft team fired everyone that made this game.",1419616898,1419616898,False,6,0,0.538566052913665771,0,True,False,False,76561198041933323,145,6,72,0,24,1522361599,,
11,13615629,english,"This review is based on my personal experiences.

For the simulator fan:
I will start off by saying that I have both FSX and X-Plane 10, and that I am also a pilot in training in real life. I am relitively new to flight simulators but I would reccomend FSX over X-Plane 10 because it is very intuitive, easy to get flying, has great mechanics and loads of fun. X-Plane 10 also has realistic mechanics as well as great weather and detail in the cockpit, but is very hard to actually get started. I found it quite difficult to use, the contol menu baffled me with all the buttons and was just a pain to get running (I was completely new to that sort of thing). Then I got FSX on steam and it was extremely easy to get going. The graphics (especially in the cockpit) may not be as good as in X-Plane 10 though the scenery is still fantastic and I have had some very enjoyable 737 flights so far. The flight planner is also very simple and you can create a route which you can use in game in no time at all. When you launch the program, everything you need to set up is in the 'launcher' and when you click the 'fly' button, you're left free in the cockpit. FSX also has the addition of missions from an airline pilot role to rescue and military, which are fun and a nice touch. They are rated to a skill level so you know what sort of missions you will be able to do.

For a casual gamer:
If you are looking for some fun or you just want to try out flying aircraft, this game is great. However, it does require some understanding of aircraft(which you can learn as you play if you put the time into it) in order to get the most out of FSX. You can use the 'learning centre' in the launcher to get to know your way round the simulator and learn how to fly anything from a small single engine Cessna to a huge Boeing 747 airliner, and it is most enjoyable with a joystick. Mine just worked as soon as I started the game without me even having to change the settings. Compared to other simulators FSX makes it easy to get flying, just select 'free flight', pick an aircraft, practically any airport in the world, time of day, and weather and hit 'fly now'. I would not suggest getting this game if you just want a laugh, because it does require some time to fully get to grips with it and doesn't really offer any fun from messing about with a plane (crashing isn't any fun - I've tried). You may find it hard to understand all the features in the game (as I did), such as communicating with ATC or performing a landing with full ILS, but through time you get used to it.

Verdict:
This game is great for simulator fans and casual gamers alike. The graphics are not bad even by today's standards and it does not have many bugs, though the ones it does have are noticeable, but not game-breaking. You can get a lot of fun out of it if you stick with it and try to understand everything, and in my opinion is the best low-cost flight simulator on the market - perhaps even competes with higher-budget options.

I would like to think that Dovetail optimized the core of this game due to it using a lot less ram. 

Certain aspects of the game are flawless but at the same time there are aspects of the game that are still a bit buggy. This is not the fault of dovetail but that of Microsoft. When FSX first came out I bought my copy on that day (October 10, 2006). There were many bugs. Some of those bugs were fixed with the implementation of SP1, and SP2. But some remained. Hopefully with the help of my thread titled “Bugs? Post Them Below!” the developers can use that thread as a tool to make some improvements.

Now in regards to the people who said this game is not worth $5.00, ignore them for they have lost their minds. Even with the plethora of bugs I feel that this game could be worth $20.00. There are few titles out there that have the ability to be so heavily modified, and have the web-sites to facilitate those mods.

I highly recommend this Simulator it is arguably the best ever made and every year gets better with the new developments that are produced for it. For the first time purchaser it can be very complicated, but Google, and YouTube are your friends.

I have owned FS9 and FSX:Gold and have flown hundreds of hours with my dad, and I have to say... They really fixed it! This simulator used to run terrible even on my current i5-3570k OC + GTX 970 build, even on Medium-High settings with no anti-aliasing. They really have fixed it as now I can get a solid 60+ FPS (on a 144hz monitor >.>) on Ultra with Dense Autogen scenery and Anti-aliasing.

Well aside from the geek part of it, it is still really fun to play. It takes I'd say, 2 hours of training before you can pretty much fly the stock planes like a pro (given that you continue flying at least once every 2 days), which really isn't that much time at all.

58,13502645,english,"I've held on to Flight Simulator X. I love this simulator to death. Of course, the simulator itself has been showing it's cracks and it's not as shiny as X-Plane or DCS, but make no mistake. There is a reason why a majority of the people play FSX over other Flight Simulator platforms. That said, I was quite surprised to see FSX live its legacy with a Steam Edition.

To be honest, I'm quite mixed about seeing the game on Steam. FSX is my little niche thing and it would be quite annoying (or amusing) to see some nine-year old flying like... a nine-year old, but with this release, the simulator receives a new lease of life as support is finally restored to a game that has long been thought abandoned by the publishers (We all know MS Flight sucked).

That said, I've tried and tested the simulator. For starters, the simulator runs quite well 'out of the box'. I then tested the simulator with add-ons as well. I had too. I've heard that this game has 'improvements'. So I've installed and tested ORBX YBBN Airport scenery with FTX Australia SP4. When I test for performance, I always test this particular airport. FTX is an amazing developer of add-on sceneries, but the Brisbane Airport (IATA:YBBN) is poorly optimized. No matter what setting I do, it just falls flat of expectation (Some settings are smooth, but it's below their recommended graphics settings). And I'm running an i7 3770k clocked at 4.2 GHz. I'm also using a GTX 660Ti. Just a note, the GPU is not necessarily the depending factor here. Usually, a better CPU leads to significant performance gains. CPUs needs to be overclocked (usually above 4.0 GHz) for optimum performance.

Unfortunately, it was no surprise that FSX:SE performed poorly in this scenery. Who was I to expect something short of a miracle? Unfortunately, this confirms what I've feared. The Steam Edition provides improvements (I will explain later), but you still need to tweak the fsx.cfg file located at the AppData\Microsoft\FSX folder. Some tweaks that I had to adjust were the Texture Bandwith Multiplier = 40 (It was set to 160), Set Affinity Mask = 15, Fiberframetimefraction=0.50 (default is 0.33), WideViewAspect = True, Regardless, it still performed like pizza in this scenery (I actually regret having this scenery), Just a note, while I've actually copypasta the entire fsx.cfg installed in my other hard drive, take caution in doing so. I noticed that the cfg file of the standalone and the steam edition are arranged differently. The [MULTIPLAYER] section of the cfg file is most definitely different.

Now I've noticed that some people in youtube have uploaded themselves playing the Steam Edition. I noticed one video where the person was using DX10. It's quite easy to spot when one is using DX10 even if they don't mention it. I found it quite odd. Everyone in to flightsim should know, unless you have Steve's DX10 scenery fixer, It is usually common knowledge to always use DX9. The reason for this is because while performance gains are realized in DX10, DX10 mode is inherently broken. That's why the ticker box is 'DX10 Preview'. Development was never finished. That said, I gave it a shot.

Here is where I was impressed.

Steam Edition performed phenomenally well in DX10. It's still not the homerun, but I was pleased with the performance. By this time, I had installed the ORBX Cairns Airport Scenery and compared it with DX9 and DX10. Brisbane performance was still kinda bad, but better. In both the Brisbane and Cairns scenery, I flew in the 3D cockpit of the default F/A-18 aircraft.

But you said DX10 performs well in FSX in the first place?

I did, but I was quite shocked with what I saw while running the simulator in DX10. Some of the broken things about DX10 have been fixed. One of the most annoying DX10 blunders is the opaque gray texture replacing the livery texture of commercial AI aircraft. That's been fixed. You could fly in the day with no problem. Flying at Dawn/Dusk, or night time can still be a problem though. The runway/taxiway still becomes opaque at dawn/dusk and the lights still disappear at these times. Cockpit shadows are still blunt. So while some DX10 blunders have been fixed, you may still require Steve's DX10 Scenery Fixer.

So do I recommend this game?
Considering that multiplayer is restored in the Steam Edition and DX10 performance is quite well, I'd definitely recommend this game, especially for the price. However, unless you're not into playing with add-ons free or paid, be prepared to modify the fsx.cfg, which I can say from experience, is a frustrating activity. Also, if you're in to add-ons, make sure you do have a Core-i7 desktop and a GTX 660Ti  equivalent or higher. Always overclock your CPU above 4.0 GHz. Memory with low timings also helps (although some will dispute that this is not necessary). It also helps to have an SSD if you plan to install FSX on a separate drive (FSX can take a long time time to load).

That pretty much wraps up my review, so Good luck and Happy flying to you all!

EDIT: So apparently, I had forgotten that my CPU is 4 cores, 8 threads. I was using the wrong value for the affinity mask. I changed the value from 15 to 85. Both DX9 and DX10 run better now.

68,13537822,english,"Having owned the boxed copy of FSX: Deluxe as well as the Acceleration addon, I was originally on the fence when I first noticed FSX:SE on Steam. When it went on sale, I jumped on it simply thinking I'll have the convenience of a digital copy (installing from multiple DVDs + manually entering two serial numbers plus hunting down the latest patches and tweaks to get it to run on Win7 x64 is tiresome).

Little did I realize that FSX:SE isn't just the same binary distribution from the boxed DVD set, but has been updated. The source was modified to support Steam multiplayer and chat, rebuilt with VS2013*, tweaked to ensure Win7/8/10 64-bit compatibility**.

I haven't benchmarked the sim compared to its boxed counterpart on the same system, but it certainly feels smoother. I've cranked the custom details completely to their highest (texture size, terrain visibility, cloud detail, autogen, scenery density, traffic, etc) and haven't noticed any studdering or low frame rates. It might be placebo, but nonetheless it's nice to finally be able to run a 2006 sim flawlessly and smoothly, albeit on a 2014 PC (i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, Geforce 770).

Unfortunately, I don't own any additional payware test out with FSX:SE, but the free aircraft I've tried out thus far appear to work with no issue. I'm hoping to see Steam Workshop support in the future. However, I'm only concerned about the possibility that DTG might start reselling previously-advertised features as DLC (like they did with TS).

*I'll vouch for the advances in optimizations that MS's C++ compiler has undergone since VS2005. I've seen some cases increase ~10% in performance between VS2008 and VS2010 alone.

76,13530037,english,"I have been a real world aviator for the past 18 years. Back when I was training for my Instrument Rating, MS Flight Sim became more than just a game. It was an essential tool in the flight bag that helped solidify essential skills needed to fly in the IFR world. The end result of which saved me time and money obtaining my rating. I basically taught myself IFR flying. It was essential to understanding VOR radials and ADF tracking and intercepts.

After flying for a career for the past 8 years I'd never thought I'd have use for MS Flight Sim ever again. However, recently I dusted off my old copy of MS Flight Sim to help prepare for my Boeing 737 type rating. A company designed a fairly accurate version of the 737 with the correct system logic. It even included a fairly accurate FMC. Once again MS Flight Sim proved useful and was essential to understanding the systems of the 737 and cockpit flows. Hopefully the Steam version will allow for these add-ons. 

My advice to anyone using MS Flight Sim as a training tool would be to treat it as just a game until you start instrument training and be prepared for many misunderstandings. My previous four year’s experience as flight instructor and chief flight instructor has taught me that those used Flight Simulators during their Ab Intio training developed bad habits that needed to be trained out of them. Once you have completed your Ab Intio training, it can be an excellent training tool.

For W8.1 people: This game may work. It may not. It works for me, so I'm posting a positive review.

I can fly anywhere in the world. This game is truly amazing. There are over 20,000 airports in this game. Even in a small island country there are airports. 

If you don't have a joystick yet, you can still play this game but I'd really recommend getting a joystick as it's sort of hard to control the plane with just the keyboard. If you're flying a jet, you're more than likely going to be using autopilot most of the time, so it won't really matter anyways.

At the time of posting this (22/12/14)  a lot of addons for the DVD game isn't working. The devs may fix that, they may not.  However, the amount of content in this game is still outstanding. You have over 20 planes that you can play and mess around with it. If you really like flight games, then this is the game for you.

If you'd like a more combat-oriented game, then check out DCS world. FSX doesn't have any combat whatsoever.",1419266487,1419266487,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198048980967,203,1,34022,0,2293,1577059996,,
84,13525425,english,"If you are buying this steam version because some people said it’s smoother and gives more FPS, you’ll be disappointed because there is no enhancement whatsoever apart from the return of multiplayer. 

I own a boxed version and have acceleration with service parks including lots of add-ons. I get a reasonable FPS in my windows 7-64bits but just like every fsx simmer you never get enough. So when I read the feedbacks here about how it was improved, I decided to give this steam version a go. I bought it yesterday, download took like an hour or so and installation was smooth. I have made few flights now, the truth is that the only difference is that it is a combination of Gold Edition, Acceleration and Service park, and that Multiplayer is back, also uiautomationcore.dll was added to the main directory for windows 8. Performance is exactly the same as FSX Deluxe Edition with Acceleration and service park without any add-on or tweak.

I have to admit that I am not very sad that I bought this steam version, but this is because my boxed version is almost cracked and I think it’s a good idea to have a digitally signed one saved at Steam library. Another thing I’m hoping for is that since this simulation is very old and therefore do not take advantages of new and better graphic cards and systems and Microsoft no longer provide updates, hopefully with steam re-releasing it now future updates will be a possibility, if not it is going to be a waste for those who have boxed version already. 

As for those wondering if existing addons will work. Almost all addons that you can normally copy and paste into FSX will work in Steam version, Mine worked, I have never installed any which needs installation yet. Also I installed this version in the same PC I already have FSX, both are working fine.


If you want to read the reviews, from the beginning there is a separate tab for positive and negative feedbacks, which I didn’t notice. The default is positive so make sure to check the negatives also.

That said, FSX is an awesome experience for players looking for a good flying experience, all the way to real life pilots looking to practice their skills without paying for it in fuel. This game actually has the largest map ever, it's Planet Earth. The shear number of places to go and things to see is insane. Even for a game that is 8 years old, it still has scenes of absolute beauty.

This isn't an easy game. You throw on full realism, a crosswind, and a major thunderstorm... good luck making it off the ground. The physics of this game are beyond good. The controls leave you options as well. You can use keyboard and mouse, or a gamepad, or a joytick, or a full blown yoke, rudder pedals, and throttles. Whilst the full setup is a little spendy, I myself am saving up for one to experience flying in a more realistic manner, the Attack 3 doesn't cut it.

When gamespy went down, FSX multiplayer went with it. I suck at piloting, my joystick doesn't cut it for me. So in multiplayer I tried out being an air traffic controller. Let me tell you, I found my niche. I got hours upon hours of enjoyment guiding players to their runway, destination, or gate. Ground, Tower, Approach, Departure, Center, you name it, I loved it. Then gamespy happened. I was said. Now with Dovetail getting rights, I am happy to be able to try out my ATC again.

Speaking of Dovetail, cudos to them for wanting to continue one of the world's most storied game series. Hopefully they don't use the same sales model as Train Simulator, because that would suck.

10,13504403,english,"Classic Microsoft Flight Simulator X, what more can you say? Great realism and complexity, some new aircraft thrown in the mix, with the promise of add-on packs and the possibility of Steam Workshop content. This is the best flight simulation game on the market, and Steam is brilliant for acquiring and releasing this well-loved classic. I'm an M-Soft F-Sim vet, I fell in love with the series with Flight Sim 2000, then 2002, I've owned the tin box edition of 2004: A Century of Flight for years. Never got to play X until now; the mechanics are vastly improved, as are the graphics and the quality of the missions.  

In the first mission I played, I took mid-air control of a Cessna flying towards a small airstrip set on a peninsula in Alaska. I followed a Cessna Grand Caravan to the runway, and slowed my approach to give the Grand Caravan time to clear the runway. When air traffic control declared the runway clear, I aligned my approach and set the flaps to full. However, as I approached the runway I saw that my path would be blocked by a large cruise liner entering port. His path intersected with mine, bringing him between my plane and the runway just as I was slowing for the final stages of my approach. I increased throttle and pulled up, passing dangerously close to the gigantic liner; but having cleared the ship, I slammed my throttle closed and pulled the air brake in an attempt to land at a safe speed. I hit the runway and bounced once, twice, and on the third dip made contact with the runway and slowed to under forty knots. I then gently taxied to the airport terminal and parked next to the Grand Caravan that I had followed to the runway.

In my second mission, I took mid-air control of a Learjet over the mountains of Colorado, near Telluride. This is familiar territory for me, so I took time to appreciate the rendering of the scenery: deep valleys with low-lying fog at their centers, rivers carving their ancient paths through the Rocky Mountains. Then I was politely warned that I was flying too low and too fast, and needed to maintain an altitude of 12,000 feet to approach the airport, at a speed of 140 knots. I obliged the polite air traffic controller, and spotted the runway nestled at the top of a mesa ahead of me. I was told to increase flaps to full and extend my landing gear, but a problem with the landing gear triggered a buzzing alarm which would become the soundtrack for my panicked descent. I attempted several more times to extend the gear, but to no avail; the doors were apparently stuck. On my last attempt, with the runway in sight only a few hundred yards ahead of me, the doors opened and the landing gear deployed. I engaged the airbrake and pulled the nose back as I gently made contact with the runway. Following the ATCs intructions, I taxied to the left of the runway and parked next to two limosines. The celebrity cargo was safely delivered, and I was rewarded with a autograph that read, ""Greetings from Telluride!""

The missions in this game are incredible and engaging, leaps and bounds ahead of the boring missions of the previous games. The heart of the game, however, is in simulating flights in real-time, and if you have never played a Microsoft Flight Sim before, you are in for a treat. You are given full control of the simulation, you can plan flights to anywhere in the world. Locations are rendered beautifully, and the graphics settings are flexible enough to run smoothly on most any gaming rig. The game automatically logs all of your free and mission flights.  You can communicate and plan with ATCs at any airport in your vicinity, even requesting an emergency landing if you need to do so. Using the flight planner, you can set starting points and destination points, and the game includes almost every airstrip in the world (even private strips). The game can be set to include in-flight emergencies, can require you to stop and refuel when you get low. Nearly every aspect of this game can be customized to suit your playing style.

In short, this is the king of flight simulation games, and Flight Simulator X was the final and greatest installment in this series. Do yourself a favor and learn to fly like a pro, Steam did the gaming community a service by reviving this amazing classic.

A few of add ons like RC4 don't work as FSCUIP isn't compatible with this yet but I'm sure that is coming.

For those who don;t know what FSX is, it's a kind of gateway drug to the life consuming hobby of Flight Simulation. It's a proper sandbox, in the sense that you can set your own goals and make it pretty realistic and learn about flight procedures, flight planning, ATC jargon etc etc or you can just try and fly a jumbo under bridges on the Thames upside down. Whatever.

There is a huge communtity of hobbyists producing freeware as well as some incredible commercial products, and things like IVAO and VATSIM who provide a networked environment with live Air Traffic Control.

-Poorly detailed terrain (but you do get the entire planet).
-Low speeds, even for commercial airliners.
-No crash effects, kind of boring this way.
-No co-pilot AI.
-VERY steep learning curve, but it is a flight simulator.
-No real air transit companies, but you do get real aircraft manufacturers.
-Cities are lifeless.
-No aircraft paint customization.

Pros:
-As mentioned, YOU GET THE ENTIRE PLANET!!!
-Several planes and helicopters to start with, each with a few paint variants.
-Every airport, big and small, seems to be included.
-Confusing controls, but you can easily simplify them.
-Real-time weather based on your location in-game and what it is really like there in real life.
-Static weather choices as well.
-Most major landmarks can be seen.
-Controller support (I haven't used a joystick yet, but you can).
-Air traffic controller and pilot voices, adding realism.
-Can listen in on radios to hear talking between AI aircrafts and AI traffic controllers.
-Great tutorials.
-Multiplayer.
-Sandbox mode, as well as missions
-Custom difficulty (unlimited fuel, or not, etc).
-Weather does affect the aircraft.
-Aircrafts look good.
-Well organized menus.
-Able to customize your voice and callsign.
-Able to customize your jets flight number.
-It feels like a real airplane/helicopter.
-Other aircrafts in the sky, landing or taking off.
-A million ways to customize the gameplay.
-Pretty good sounds, but I do recommend playing your music in the background.

Verdict:
-I have never actually flown a plane or helicopter before, nor will I. However, this game/simulator allows people, like me, to fly the aircrafts of their dreams! I wish that the cities were better, and the terrain looked like real terrain, but this is about the flying, and the flying is great! From fighter jets, which control like the ones in the ARMA series, to the commercial airliners, Microsoft Flight Simulator X provides a fun and exciting experience for anyone who wants it. 

-Minor flaws like the lifeless cities and the lack of damage/explosions does hold the game back a bit, but the flying more than makes up for it! 

-As I said before, the game has a huge learning curve and only real pilots will feel right at home. However, the game does provide several helpful tutorial missions that will get the rest of us in the cockpit in no time!

-Overall, I think that Microsoft Flight Simulator X is a very good game. Now that it is on Steam, I recommend that anyone who likes airplanes, helicopters or simulators should give this a shot.

Tip: If your game doesn't start and is stuck on the loading screen with the Flight Simulator Logo, and it was working fine before, it may be because you have a corrupt log file, happens to me all the time, so go to Documents>Flight Simulator X>Log File -- Delete This:   Yes I know that it has your record, but if you want your game to run, then you have to do it.

Had to re-adjust and get familiar with it before setting realism up to near-full or full. I still got it. I can still fly and land a plane and helicopter. Have yet to fly a VTOL or seaplane yet; nor landing a helicpoter on an oil rig, nor land a jet on an aircraft carrier.

This simulator's still got it. Classic feel and everything. Only things missing now are a skydiver, flying pig, X-Wing, the Guitar Ship from Interstella 5555, and Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang, and I'm set. Oh, and a floating island or Bespin Cloud City, the Aircraft Carrier Airships from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, or the ship from V to land on/in.

I think Steam Workshop integration is in the works right now. I recommend setting yourself up a good set of flight music for those long flights.

This version includes the Accelteration pack, so you have an F/A 18 Hornet and Red Bull Air Races to fly as well. It's pretty awesome. I've watched some of those races, and I can guatrantee that I'm nowhere near as good as those guys. But, nonetheless, that looks fun.

Wow!  What an improvement over the DVD box version!

This Steam/Dovetail version is, in my opinion, what the MS version should have been. 

Launching the Steam version with display setting max'd out and using FRAPS to determine the frame rate during game play, the STEAM version is running at 35-40 FPS.  However, when I run the DVD version (entirely from the hard drive), FRAPS reports only 13 FPS.

Despite using a high end system I purchased in 2007, which I still find acceptable (thank God we are no longer slaves to the software/hardware/OS two-year upgrade treadmill we were on during the late 1990's through mid 2000's...but I digress) when running software such as MS Access, Adobe PhotoShop and Adobe Premier (cloud subscription), as well as other content creating software, I always found that DVD version of MS Flight Simulator X ran very ""choppy"", even at Medium or High Resolution settings.

My system is an HP Pavillion Elite M9040N, which has a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 (quad-core ) processor with 4GB of RAM, Win7 32 Bit, and a Radion HD 5500 PCI video card with 1GB video RAM.

Masses of free addons and content available on the flightsim sites, so you never need to buy the planned DLC unless you really want it but these simulators with this quantity of existing free content on flightsim sites all over the web are under-selling that aspect of the game and community by not including steam workshop as an easy way to import content, instead of trawling the internet for it.

Aircraft can be setup to be easy to fly or configured to fly realisticly including startup procedures.
Don't flick the switches in order and your plane won't start or Overspeed and you will stress your aircraft.

There are lots of FSX groups about.

A word of cultion however, with regards to addons.  Right now from my use most Freeware addons (Aircraft repaints, etc) do work fine.  

But if you're a hard core FSX Player or Sim gamers or are thinking of buying PAYWARE Addons from 3rd parties at the moment many of these appear to not be compatiable with this current version.

Some options you have are currently for these payware items are

1. Most payware addons for weather, and ai traffic generators have demos,  I would reccomend trying the demo first before buying it. Odds are if the demo doesn't work the real thing won't work in game. Most demos are basicly just restricted acesses versions of the real DLC so be sure to TRY IT before you Buy it

2. Wait for payware 3rd party addons or steam to solve exisiting problems (though some issues may never be resolved so keep that in mind)

3. Simply avoid payware 3rd party addons and stick to the basic ""vanaliia"" version: or stick with free ware.

4. For the Hard core gamer it who already has FSX, unless you're intrested in the mutiplayer I would reccomend not getting it until such issues are resolved with payware.   But that's up to you

Over all the steam addition is great and works really well and if the minnor issues of compatitbility/game version recognition errors this will likely become a MUST BUY game for any aviation enthusiasts or starting sim players.

28,13447354,english,"Wow! I wasn't expecting this to be released any time soon on steam. I was aware that earlier in the year Dovetail was going to publish this as a Steam edition version, but I definitley didn't expect it to come out day 1 of the Winter sale and for 5 dollars on sale (25 USD regular). There was a time I felt like a few months ago that it would be great to finally actually own a legit copy of the sim I spent so much time on - but boxed versions on Amazon were becoming increasingly rare and expensive. Now, I'm happy I can have this forever through a decent game client. Yes!!

Just to set some things clear, I've spent tons of hours in the non steam version of FSX: Acceleration. I switched to, and now own Prepar3d V2 Academic a few months ago (basically FSX but optimized as much as possible for DX11 features and some other tweaks to that effect) and a variety of addons. I still think P3D is probably the best you can get for a modern 2014 PC if you want the FSX experience, being as it gets frequent performance updates and has DX11 lighting, etc - but it isn't on Steam, and is 50 dollars for an academic license. There is also the somewhat large issue that most of the FSX addons either don't work in P3D, have some kind of yakety way of overcoming that, or are just flat out not compatible with P3D. So what do you do if you want modern performance enhancements, but want to use your addons?

Enter the Steam Edition. Reading the changelog of the SE version, you can see that Dovetail has taken the best fixes and tweaks that flight simmers have analyzed and tinkered with tooth and nail since 2006 to get the sim working well and incorporated it into FSX. If you enjoy doing .cfg tweaks; you still can, but the workload is much less to worry about if you're just wanting to hop in and fly in regards to performance. the HIGHMEMFIX entry, the uiautomationcore.dll, all of that stuff is a part of this package. Anyone who frequently installed or messed with FSX Accel would know all too well about these ""annoyances"" (in my opinion) and would be happy that they're finally here by default. 

I cannot speak high enough of the sim. The only thing that I never really liked was the infinite tweaking I had to do to get blurry textures to load faster, frame rate to become stable, and the dozens of frame limiting programs and graphic card tweaking I had to do to get an extra frame or so - all recommended by people who were in no way involved in the actual development process. For the longest time, this sim has had to stand on the legs of the community propping it up - which in itself isn't a bad thing at all - just a very slow and tedious way of improving the sim as much as possible, which in my opinion could have happened a lot faster if the original dev team supporting it were still around. Is this sim now so well optimized that you no longer need to tweak? Probably not, but this edition is about half the battle already.

To wrap this recommendation up, the things I'm most happy/sad about in this edition are:

The long known optimization tweaks being implemented as standard, the newer splash screen, the multiplayer coming back (it was so sad when the boxed version's multiplayer died :'[ ) The real world Jeppensen weather feature now back and able to download for real weather anywhere in the world, and the Steam integration. I can also use REX Natural ENB with this without errors. The negative? Some of my FSX addons as of SE release still do not work with this edition. It is unknown to me why. Texture replacers like REX seem to work fine, but weather engines like my copy of ASN do not. It tells me SimConnect isn't installed when you do in fact install it as a first step of the installation of the sim. Uninstalling and re-installing seem to do nothing. ASN is a weather injector that is highly dynamic, similar to OPUS and the REX weather engine. I use it for P3D, but my purchase also has an FSX version as well - which as stated has these problems. It would be an issue if they had not revived the Jeppensen weather downloader in the sim, which is fine for now, but I'd rather like to use my own weather engine!


All in all, P3Dv2 will still be my main simulator, without a doubt. My Orbx addons are there, my aircraft addons are there, ASN works there, and my REX4 HD textures are compatible there. The lighting is better optimized in DX11, and the scenery, performance and frame rate are consistent. The FSX SE brings back multiplayer, FSX only addons, and some under the hood tweaks that have made it function at an acceptable level again - and that, I think is worth sticking around for.",1418989150,1418991014,True,3,0,0.535299420356750488,0,True,False,False,76561198011302149,497,9,2814,0,120.0,1573077073,,

I was happy like everyone else to see FSX in Steam. Even though I already have purchased FSX Acceleration (most updated, complete version of FSX), I decided to purchase the Steam version because the FSX I had before was riddled with ""Fatal Errors"" and crashes. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe this is finally a stable and playable FSX.

Sadly, I was very wrong. The game just stopped responding and crashed about 15 minutes into gameplay. Sure, there are many ""fixes"" if you keep googling, but why would anyone have to do that? This great game is sadly the product of terrible programming and lousy quality management.

The developer/publisher was very sly in his Steam post when they said that they made some tweaks here and there. This gave me the impression that they actually fixed the stability issues. Needless to say, they did not.

This is a classic example of betraying the fans just to cash in. Don't fall for this guys.

59,13440522,english,"My personal opinion about this game or simulation software (whatever you prefer). I'm using FSX since 2006, and honestly, it was a nightmare back than since there simply was no hardware you could buy for money which was able to run it in a way that it was playable. This lasted for approximately 3 years. During that time Microsoft released 2 service packs and Intel released the first generation  of i7 processors which finally allowed the game/software to become really playable. 

I'm always juggling between the terms game and simulation software. This is because to some users FSX is a game and to other users it is a flight simulation platform. What is the difference? Well, if you see it like a game, then FSX does offer you great missions which will provide you a great deal of fun during a few weeks. If you see it as a flight simulation software, then it will become more complicated. The reason is because you can start training for a real pilot licence with this software. But this will only be interesting if you try to do it right as closely as possible as real pilots do. The problem with this is that then it is no more about flying around, which by the way will become boring very fast. But then, you will have to learn the real rules of the sky and the aviators. The learning curve will be much steeper but so much more rewarding. There are some really good books on the market which are based on Microsoft flight simulator training which will guide you through the process. I am myself a real world private pilot and I started with Microsoft Flight Simulator back in 2006 and then started working on my real pilot licence in 2009. It did help me a lot, but I also caught some flaws by simming. The problem is that in the sim you mostly have only one screen and thus you tend to focus more on your instrument panel. In real world VFR flying you have to focus more on the outside of the plane in order to navigate. I was so proficient when I started flight training that my instructor asked me if I already had some flight lessons in the past. But he also caught me too often staring at my instruments, because I got used to it while doing flight simulation. You will for sure not be able to fly a real plane only with flightsim training, but it will help you a great deal to get proficient in procedures and radio navigation and lots of other things.

But Flight Simulator X really starts to shine when you start to add quality add-ons. They bring FSX to a whole new level. You can add new weather engines, highly detailed aircrafts which do cost more than FSX itself but which allow you to operate them by the real airplane books. This is the case for general aviation airplanes as for airliners. But there is also a bunch of software add-ons which enhance the whole world of FSX. More detailed elevation meshes which cover countries, continents of even the whole world! The same is true for airports, roads, amd rivers which are much more detailed. You can buy add-on airports which look exactly like the real thing. Actually most of the large airports have been recreated in detail by add-on companies.

Now you could ask yourself, but what do I get then in the Steam Edition, which is in my opinion nothing else than a MS FSX Gold Edition with a few optimizations and bug fixes. You do get a game/simulation software which tries to approximately simulate the whole planet earth, get a nice fleet of airplanes to start with. Yes, you will be able to fly in every country on earth. But only something like 40 or 50 cities and large airports have been recreated in more detail, which is already very pleasant. The other cities and airports in the world do also exist (well, most of them) but they are recreated in a more schematic way with landclasses and autogen, but lets don't get too technical.

Today's hardware enables you to run FSX in a pleasant way. Since the two service packs which Microsoft did release plus the few optimizations Dovetail did, it should normally run in a stable way. I like Microsoft Flight Simulator X very much and this is why I have already plunged thousands of dollars (yes, you do read correctly) in add-ons and hardware in order to be able to fly as real as it can get in order to stay sharp for my real world flights. I have also bought some great hardware from Saitek and VRinsight which enable me to fly with a yoke, pedals and throttle levers, radio navigation stack. We nearly as I do in the real plane. So beware, if you become addicted, then it can become an expensive hobby :-)

I like the fact that Dovetail now ported FSX on the Steam platform because the flight simulation community is lacking new adopters for years now, thus eroding the user base. The average age of a simmer tends to be in the mid forties and we could really use youngsters which come along to enhance the base of users.
