Pros:
-Hidden modifiers to the enemy do not break the balance of the game on higher difficulty. Instead, the enemy just plays better and sends larger armies against you. What this means is, that almost every tactical combo makes sense to master.
-Awesome graphics
-Awesome intro cutscenes. You will get a lot of aesthetic cutscenes every time you create a unit or agent for the first time.
-Cutscenes for geishas and ninjas like in good old times. Rome II never had them anymore.
-Since the factions have pretty much same roster, the tournament potential and skills are very important
-Nice interface and art, unit cards drawn in traditional style
-Very easily moddable
-Some of the old sountracks from original shogun are brought back
Cons:
-AI sometimes is clunky.
-Siege battles are weird. The defenders get almost unbreakable morale bonuses in campaign
-Rebels are pretty damn op in the campaign
-Some units like all artillery, Yari samurai and bow heroes are not very useful due to their modifiers and in case of bow heroes, size and limit.
- I would say the game is a bit biased towards Oda as they get pretty damn good bonuses if you compare them against Hojo, Tokugawa or Mori. Date clan is hardly playable as their only province is as big as three normal ones and they take too much to travel.
- Ainu people are not presented in this game though they existed in that period.

- Ai Cheats out of their ass, its even bad in Total Wars extremely low standards, they can have 1 Province with 2-3 full armies of upgraded units.

- Economy is extremely slow, leading you to sit there and do jack shit for multiple turns

43,73812489,english,"The CA did a masterpiece on this one. Arguably one of the simplest total wars in terms of game mechanics, but, as the saying goes, ""there's beauty in simplicity"". And Shogun 2 is definitely beautiful in many ways. And just to clarify, when I say ""simple"", I mean simpler than Attila or Rome 2. To master the game, you still need to put in tens or hundreds of hours. Here are my reasons why I think that it's a time well spent:
- BEAUTIFUL. I know I've said it already, but I just want you to fully understand. Everything from the opening cinematic, the menu, the campaign map and the battlefield is visually extremely pleasing. Sakura leafs fluttering in the wind. Rainbows shining inside waterfalls. Rain enveloping the battlefield - be it natural rain or rain of arrows. Add tranquil music to the background (campaign) or wild japanese drums (battle) and you've got an aesthethical masterpiece.
- Probably the best campaign AI in all of Total War. 
- Good battle AI.
- Incredibly atmospheric. The quotes on loading screens, the unit images, the research tree, everything screams ""medieval Japan"".
- Simple, but diverse unit roster.
- Comprehensible research tree
- Great ninja cinematics.
- And just... really good? It's hard to put into words. I can't count how many times I've become shogun. How many times the entire Japan turned against me, how many times I crushed them and established ""an empire to last 10 000  years"" as the narrator likes to say. The campaigns are one of the shortest in all Total Wars. It takes me around 50 hours to take the entire map. So maybe it's that. Maybe it's how the battles are so beautiful and dynamic, how the AI gives me the toughest time. Or maybe Japan is just a good country for war. One long narrow island and a couple smaller ones. Bays and straits for unique naval engagements. Lot of mountain passes, rivers, bridges and coastlines to have epic land battles on. Who wouldn't like to decide the fate of a country with Mt Fuji towering in the background?

What I grumble about while having the time of my life playing this game:
- Settlements. Siege battles are fun, but the settlements are bare, with barely any buildings. Really poor when compared to Medieval 2 or Attila.
- Naval battles begin to be bit dull after a time. However, the Japanese were terrible sailors, so I can't really blame CA for this.
- Minor multiplayer issues.
- CA's greedy DLC policy.

These, however, are in my eyes minor issues compared to other aspects of the game. In my mind, Shogun 2 is a straight 9.5/10. A must have!",1596632200,1596632327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198020957722,26,2,43357,0,43357,1594587496,,

Total War: Shogun 2 is a turn-based strategy game mixed with a real time strategy game. Every Total War game has followed this formula, yet the games always manage to incorporate new mechanics to help differentiate themselves from each other. What stands out most obviously in Shogun 2 as the differentiation is the setting. While many Total War games are set in a wide historical era, Shogun is extremely focused. It is concerned exclusively with feudal Japan and offers little to no variety within that. A different game in the franchise, such as Rome, has a focus on the era of the Roman Empire, but offers the ability to play as a wide variety of countries that were present at the time. Japan's historical isolation prevents this, making every playable faction feel very similar. To counteract this feeling of repetitiveness, the developers have created an extremely polished base for Shogun 2. It has some of the best combat of the franchise, while having very little unit variety. Most factions have 1 or 2 notable units that attempt to define that faction, but the core gameplay stays the same. Shogun 2 overall is one of the best Total War games, but has far less replayability than many other games in the franchise. If you like the general feel of feudal Japanese combat, you will love this game, but if not, there aren't many factions that offer a hugely different playstyle.

It doesn't have the fully functioning family tree and political options of Attila which came out later, and thus you still have plenty of individual unit armies to micromanage. And, frankly, the navel battles are kind of lame with a very weak AI, plus unless you get one of the very very rare cannon armed ships, naval battles are all just exchanging arrows and boarding (plus some hand-thrown grenades and mines from one limited typed of ship). 

But everything else makes up for it. I've gone through this game start to finish probably 10 times, and still come back to it. So very very worth it.

75,73618242,english,"One of the best Total War games next to the original Rome Total War. By far, the most easily balanced games with both challenge and ease depending on a player's preferences. Easy as anything to pick up, easier so more to bring hideous death from both land, air, and water. Comparatively, it's just as addictive to the other titles. Where Warhammer shines with heroes and epic magic--where Napoleon shines with strategic placement and tests of macro--where Rome shines in it's original recipe--Shogun 2 shines in being the middle point. While not like Three Kingdoms--which embraces most of all these games--Shogun 2 shines in keeping historically accurate, while providing both entertainment, and quick-paced strategy.

TL;DR

-Agents have cutscenes for some actions. These can be both hilarious and frustrating when RNGesus strikes.
-Campaign map is beautifully designed, and easy to navigate.
-Fights are extremely quick paced; and can be very interesting with each clan's setup.
-The game requires literally a toaster to run; it is very needless for what it gives.

However,
-Losing is very costly in this. Lose an army and you can lose a campaign immediately.
-On the first point, early game is a game of not messing up. Mess up once, and you likely need a restart.
-Rise of the Samurai is a bit of an inbetween DLC. It can be somewhat meh.
-There's no more support by Total War for this game, so don't expect new content or hotfixes/balancing.

16,73335050,english,"I recommend this game, but just barely. Certain game mechanics are maddening, but the immersion is worth the experience.

Pros:
-The game is gorgeous. Every aspect of the game is stunning to look at and listen to, and you'll find yourself manually fighting battles you could auto-resolve, just for another chance to see your brightly-colored samurai charging into the ranks of the enemy with their katanas glinting in the sun. The campaign is equally beautiful, and the art style of the period has been embraced by the developers to an unprecedented degree for this series, and creates a great sense of immersion.
-The addition of skill trees to generals and agents lets you tailor each one to fulfill specific roles.
-The time limit for the grand campaign is much tighter than previous games, which keeps you on your toes.

Cons:
-Realm Divide. Reaching a certain level of power on the campaign map triggers the Realm Divide mechanic, a huge, permanent debuff to diplomatic relations. This ensures that within a few turns, every other faction will declare war on you, even your closest allies, and no one will ever be willing to make peace, even if you successfully become Shogun. This completely nullifies trade and diplomacy, two central game mechanics. It also makes becoming Shogun before the endgame pointless.
-The harsh food and financial systems ensure that I never saw high-level buildings or units in most of my playthroughs.

Is it worth the current full price ($30)? To be honest, yes. I must admit, even though some of the game mechanics are enough to drive me out of my mind, it does make winning feel like a great achievement.

27,73023052,english,"Shogun 2 is one of the best Total War games. 

The game lacks the faction diversity, fantasy heroes and map scale of games like Rome 2, Empire or Warhammer TW. However, it makes up for this with great graphics/art, performance, difficulty, and depth 

The game looks amazing even years after release Unlike most TW games, the individual soldiers in this game do not look deformed. Their armor look realistic and the amount of blood actually fits the samurai aesthetic. The campaign and battle map both look incredible and remain functional. 

The game performed really well even on release. This cannot be said of most games in the TW collection. The game runs well on a potato. 

The game has a very challenging late game on higher difficulties. On hard and higher the AI is well funded and aggressive. The late game is made difficult by a mechanic known as ""Realm Divide"". This mechanic has every AI declare war on the player and never surrender. Most TW games become boring because the player ends up steam rolling in the late game. This mechanic makes completing a campaign a challenge worth completing. 

All of the factions in Shogun 2 are the same but this hides depth. This issue actually improves the multiplayer because players cannot predict their opponent’s army in multiplayer. Unlike other TW games, Shogun 2 does not have a meta that forces players to play in a certain way. In single player the issue of faction diversity is resolved with bonuses. These bonuses encourage new play-styles, while also making all options available. The multiplayer features an objective based system that effectively stops all camping.

But, that's just me. 

As a game itself, the setting offers an exceptionally small and unsatisfying campaign. I find that uniting Japan under the Emperor or Shogun is just slightly less enjoyable than conquering the world or conquering Europe. It's a very confined setting. 

In terms of combat, you have Japanese people with guns and Japanese people with swords. Surprisingly, the people with guns tend to win more often than not. The roster of units in the game is just pathetic when compared to other TW titles, again, a side effect of the isolated setting. Every faction is more or less the same minus the division between Imperial and Shogunate factions. Fighting battles isn't horrible. Cavalry are easy to use and maneuverable, the infantry AI isn't as brain dead as Napoleon's, but you still have the lack of diverse units and the fact that guns will win 90% of the time dampening each battle you play.",1594926662,1594926662,False,0,0,0.429477810859680176,0,True,False,False,76561198056690511,92,76,244,0,244,1564361507,,

Throughout the turns the player can have several units depending on what he chooses in each province, where each one has its advantage and disadvantage, as well agents. The player can also do dipolomacy and alliances with other clans, being able to help or not when they have in war.

This game contains a skill tree for agents and generals whenever level up, where the player can customize at his will.

However there are some bugs that in life did not occur as for example the Spear Infantry units in the castle do not attack through the holes when the enemy is climbing the wall and sometimes the units are stopped without any action even if the player has given.

57,72376537,english,"Another great Total War title! The campaign stretches the Japanese Daimyo provinces during the Sengoku period. You can play a campaign with 2 people (coop or head to head) or singleplayer. If you are really into campaign play there are good free mods available where (100!) more nations, new castles and other game mechanics are included. Playing all the different factions keeps fun. All the factions have different units to use, some have even european weapons. You can use monks and ninja to convert the populace or convert or kill characters. The end goal will be to capture the main capital and a certain amount of provinces. The game developers introduced a mechanic 'realm divide' for the moment you really get to strong, at which point everyone will declare war on you (even long-term allies and vassals). This will give a new challenge to survive. I personally don't like the unthrustworthy aliances in this game, where every good relationship (also without realm divide) will deteriorate after some time. I would advice to use one of the available mods to fix this. 

Online battles are possible (1v1/4v4) but less common in this game. It takes long to find a quick match, except for evenings or weekend hours. Big difference in my opinion with other Total War titles will be the chaotic element in battles. Its really hard to adjust strategies when the melee battles have started because of the fastness of it. 

Apart from quick matches there is a clan competition map, where clans/steam groups can fight over provinces in Japan. As a clan member you have to fight battles to win points, the clan with the most points wins the territory and will get a higher tier rating every week. Clan competition is still active but battles are only fought at the evening hours/weekends. 

You should definitely buy this game (on sale!) because of its beautiful campaign.

Pros -

#1.Still decent graphics for 2020

#2.Difficult to become shogun on normal difficulty.It is not easy and that is good.

#3.Many units and upgrades

#4.Your strategy is very important

#5.I like the music

#6.There is Multiplayer but I never tried it


Cons-


#1.My biggest problem with this game is that you can have the best army and still get killed by their assassin and it can kill all the progress and time you put into the game to get to that point.

I am not even calling it unrealistic it is just lame when it happens.I understand we can do it back to them but I wish they were not so OP when maxed out.


#2.The time limit to become shogun

I had this same problem with Empire total war. I dont like the main game having a time limit.I understand that in real life there is time limits as we die of old age and that there can be a certain about of time to do things.

It does not really apply to either game though as if you/your people/country are trying to take over everything even if you personally die it does not mean your people/country are going to stop doing it and they have to still stop you.

I understand the time limit speeds things along but I would of removed it and made it more like Rome 2 where there is no time limit like that.


#3.The AI can be stupid

This is how all total war games are but it should be said when it happens.This is why some players only do multiplayer battles only.


#4.That everyone turns on you when the shogun makes you the enemy


This just isnt realistic.I understand that it can make the game harder and more of a challenge and some like that but if someone was always your ally/friend and one day the shogun says that we are now their enemy for them to just agree with that could get their whole civilization destroyed by us.

It would be like declaring war against a friend and knowing he could burn your cities to the ground easily but the shogun told you to so you have to.



The Bottom Line -


Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a fun turn based strategy game.I got enjoyment out of it but I still like Rome 2 more.

I would get SHOGUN 2 on a steam deal and they even do free weekends with it sometimes.

Watch some youtube gameplay of it if you still not sure.",1590186413,1594254627,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561197979985577,362,53,11734,0,11734,1584110203,,

The avatar conquest is satisfing experience although you went toe to toe with fall of the samurai avatar player which have disadvantage if you play a shogun 2 avatar. Although the dlc itself isn't free the main game is fun, it's enjoyable and I been playing pirated shogun 2 in the past and now?

22,71979017,english,"Shogun 2 is the pinnacle of RTS game play and design. It's relatively simple, fun, and rewarding even if it lacks a little when it comes to the political and diplomatic aspects. I've sank over 1000 hours into this game over multiple play-throughs and DLC missions and I recommend it very highly. See below for more a more in-depth look. 8.5/10

The Shogun 2 experience is a little jagged to start with. The tutorial does a very good job of explaining the very basics of the game. Sword beats spear, spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats non-spear infantry. Bow and gun units are great at a distance but get shredded by melee troops. All units are vulnerable to flank and rear attacks. Samurai are better than peasant forces. Morale and stamina all play a part in the combat effectiveness of units over time and if you're attacking or defending determine strategy and assets for each army. 

It all sounds pretty simple, but the game doesn't teach you how to manage or properly use more specialized units or their abilities. Ninjas and cannons are all wild cards and unless you experiment and do the research yourself, and you can seriously neglect cavalry or naval units and their development. Aside from war, the country your faction controls need infrastructure and development as well, and factors like buildings, agents, faction religion, and honor aren't explained through game play. Instead, you're left to discover these nuances yourself.

Another detraction is that there is a simple and shallow political aspect to consider. Each faction is represented by a warlord's (daimyo) family and generals. As your territory expands through conquest you come in contact with other clans and their agents. The way each clan reacts and interacts is dependent on factors much like the populace and territory you control, with honor, religion, and other factors calculated in. You can influence these factors by arranging trade deals, marriages, making payments and bribes, or conquering factions and making them vassals. 

The downside to this is that often there is little you can do to keep relations civil with other factions once a certain point is reached. If you become too powerful the other clans will unite against you. However, many factions will turn on you at the drop of a hat in the original game, no matter what you do or how far you progress. For instance, if you encounter a clan late game, chances are they will never accept trade or peace requests, even if you dwarf them in all capacity. I've personally been in the midst of assaulting a clan's final stronghold and requested peace and trade only to have them spit in my face. Mods can fix and alleviate this to some extent, but it's an issue and hassle. Likewise, clans that have been my ally through trade, military, and marriage from the start of my campaign turn on my without fail once I hit a campaign checkpoint, regardless. 

Likewise, in battle, the AI is all over the place. You'll find that some factions have impossibly sized armies or navies despite the fact they should lack the resources to manage their field and upkeep costs. Also, the AI will deliberately throw armies at you if you defend, leading to strategies where you can cheese your way through the game with low level units and a few strong ranged units to thin the ranks. Also, the disparity between enemy units and your own can be extreme. I've seen my units crack and flee when they hit 50% and never regroup; in turn, I've seen enemy units out in the field hold their ground and delay my line against impossible odds that should have shredded them twice as fast with less casualties sustained.

A few other minor gripes is that naval engagements are downright broken when it comes to boarding, you can't customize the look of your generals, your eligible sons can take to the field as young as 14 or 24, all depending on RNG, and smaller clans know exactly how and when to strike to make things difficult in the end game. Still, I really enjoyed this game, and if you can play co-op with a friend in a campaign, I highly recommend you do so. It becomes a tag-team fun fest with each of you making different units, exchanging them, and attacking strategically. 

As for the DLC ""Rise of the Samurai"", I rate it as ok. 6/10. The new units aren't explained well and the clan management becomes more tedious as the buildings and infrastructure become more convoluded needlessly. ""Fall of the Samurai"", is another matter. Set in the advent of the industrial revolution that brought the Shougnate and feudal eras to their knees, it's incredibly fun balancing traditional units versus more modern gun-toting armies and fighting to keep the shogun in power or restoring the Emperor to power. 8/10.

Shogun 2, coupled with it's DLC is a great experience. It lacks a lot of the more overly complicated aspects Rome II and Atilla suffered from, and it feels more satisfying to field armies and understanding your strength and weaknesses. However, the political tools are lacking and the AI's either zealous blood thirst or stupidity hinder the overall experience.",1593814373,1593814373,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198020699006,129,3,61119,0,60928,1595202716,,

+Noobs will probably learn the ins and outs easily

Cons
-Naval battles are often clunky
-Gun units are pretty bad, and usually only clans that specialize in them can use them effectively
-Alliances can actually do more harm than good, as they drag you into wars you don't need to fight, and they often sit out on wars you need help with.
-You may need to buy some DLC to get the full experience

However, despite on Legendary mode, enemy movements are still very predictable and there are rarely any suprise tactic coming from them.
The Fall of Samurai is my favourite. I strongly recommend Tosa (Tosa rifleman) and Choshu (Kaihetai). Their specialised forces are by far more superior than other units. Tosa rifleman are more vulnerable to artillery and bombardment due to the lack in numbers, however their accuracy (recruited with specialised buildings) and high reloading rate, as well as further firing range, makes them both insane as castle defence and siege. Usually 4-5 Tosa Rifleman is capable of holding a castle when facing 1-2 full armies with medium strength opponents. 6-8 Tosa rifleman is capable of fending off an army predominantly made up of Imperial or Shogunate infantry. I strongly recommend placing 4-6 Tosa rifleman as a standard defence. Sometime each unit is capable of killing 800+ enemies in battles, making them a fantastic army to achieve Heroic Victory (way to improve Honour for your Daimyo).",1592319342,1592319342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198067414640,4,1,94314,4252,69205,1601297355,,

12,70572654,english,"TLDR Amazing game, the single-player campaign is keeping me busy for ages even years down the track

Highlights:

-Genuinely difficult even towards the end game, It takes longer than in other TW titles before you steamroll everyone
-High difficulty doesn't mean the AI cheats. There are slight tweaks to morale and costs at higher levels but it's not like in some TW games where you feel that AI peasants can take down your expensive knights because of cheat boosts or that they spawn armies that they couldn't afford, it's just that the AI is more aggressive and makes better decisions that challenge you
-Amazing atmosphere and graphics keeping up with today's standards, the cherry blossoms floating on battlefields in spring, the Japanese language voice acting, the pop ups with choices to make about your clan and economy, the bloody sieges that end with defenders fighting to the last man before being brutally gutted, all build a great world
-Replayability, which might seem strange considering each clan has nearly all the same units available but they do each have slight boosts to a specific units. It might not seem like a lot but it motivates you to build more infantry focused as Shimazu, have deadly cavalry stacks as Takeda or blow things up with the Hojo. The enemies in each part of the map also change how you respond and every campaign will surprise you by which factions become dominant

A con is that the naval battles are slow. The only other negative is not strictly with game quality but that there are some great DLCs that have a bit of a high price point for the age of the game, but it's still a very complete game without them, and it's hard to say no to expanding it even more.

If you're interested in learning how to survive a legendary campaign I stream at random hours but I try to explain my thought process, would love to have you!

Notably; sea combat is pretty lackluster (but appreciated), some performance / crashing issues, some huge sieges take a lot longer then what it needs to be,  and sometimes units get stuck / forget what to do.  

Other than that, Single player is still really fun.  Also, with the inclusion of Steam Workshop support, you can literally sink hundreds of hours in the single player alone.  Maybe even thousands if you include the campaign mods.  

Multiplayer is a fun distraction & the Avatar system is great. However, There’s a sizable portion of the playerbase, or I just have bad luck, in this multiplayer that abuses the game mechanics.  To the point that it’s frustrating and not fun to play when you get those hardcore, elite abusers of the game.  If you can get into a match with someone that does not abuse the mechanics of the game, it is actually really fun and / or genuinely challenging to go up against people with equal or better skill levels. Even surprised when I get fairly bested.  Ultimately, your mileage will vary depending on the players you go up against.

Co-op campaign is cool, especially when you can get a buddy and either team up or go against each other.  I don't recommend playing with random people though, in my experience, most of them either quit after 10-ish turns or leave when they lose a few units.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of strategy games, and if you are slightly interested in the feudal Japanese period.

There's not enough unique traits and or units to actually change your strategy in campaign. And AI not taking advantage of clan strength or trying to be the first clan with for example, gunpowder or monk unit doesn't help either.

The multiplayer avatar is a nice touch. Realm divide is something that is unique to this game that keeps it interesting. Trying out converting to christian is always fun.  Despite its age it's beautiful looking still. And FoTS was such a refresh, there's mix of the old and modern units, naval bombardments, train tracks, gatling gun, torpedo boats and ironclads.

91,43391819,english,"Alright; So this will probably be the Longest review I will ever write. Most of them aren't good anyways but eh.. why not?

So I never played Shogun 1, so I read that it's ""Better"" but honestly it's all opinions however; I love/hate this game, I play on Legendary mode and it's fucking insane. Crazy hard, crazy fun.

Pros; 
The game is one of the most balanced Total war I've played so far. 
Unit cost and recruitment kinda annoys me, but not as much as Rome II's, but it's good and the units are fun to mess with mainly conquering Japan with on Ashigaru armies it's a blast.
Better Economy system in my Opinion, it's easier and alot of fun actually selecting a better economy build rather than just selecting a building to just build. 
Trade and Trade areas; Yeah all the Total wars I've played had trade but only in Rome II and Shogun 2 that I saw trading actually being better on vanilla. There are mods to make it so much better obviously.

Neutral; 
Siege warfare was weird when I started it. The were things I hadn't seen in the game. Mainly that the enemy can CLIMB YOUR FUCKING WALLS. Which is rather not a problem more of a advantage if you have a good amount of archers based in your fort/castle/stronghold's you can take them down pretty easily.

Cons;
Diplomacy; In this total war, I see dilpomacy as a joke no matter what I have done I can never get an ally to stay as an ally or to pay off an enemy to leave me alone, even with max honor for my Daimyo still nothings, but it's honestly not a reason to even get bother by. 
Auto-Resolving; Now this is the only thing that actually bothers me to my core. It's really broken and unfair, I mainly use it on too large of a scale for battling. It's even worse on Sieging which just bothers me to my core even me more. You can obviously by outnumbering your enemy even more than they could you or if you have a good computer that can run 12k v 12k then you have nothing to worry about. 

My Final recommandation: 9/10 If the dilopmacy and auto-resolve were better it would be a 10/10 but not everything can be perfect.

+ Decent performance and art style
+ The Empire Divided mechanic provides sufficient challenge in order to avoid the typical ""map-painting"" phase of all Total War games.

46,69141513,english,"Shogun 2 is a must have for any strategy fan. It's hard, fun and extremely intuitive. You will lose your first campaign and will immediately proceed to play for the next 12 hours straight... It's extremely addictive. And (to me anyways) it never gets old. 

The soundtrack ismarvellous, the soundeffects are outerwordly , the atmosphere is so damn perfect, the animations are still mind blowing, performance issues are almost non existing and the graphics are still gorgeous. 

This is arguably the best game of the Total War series and a must have for fans of japanese culture, fans of strategy games or both.

Ever dreamed of controlling a thousand samurai warriors and zooming in on the battle to see badass historically accurate battle animations?? Ever dreamed of using a group of ninjas to sneak past enemy lines to kill the enemy commander?? Every dreamed of a game set in Feudal Japan after seeing The last samurai and other classics?? Buy the bloody thing already!!

Pros: Too much to list. + If you dislike something there is a mod to fix it that can be installed by clicking a button on the workshop

Cons (not fixable with mods): Japanese phrases sound painfully ridiculous for anyone that speaks japanese. The tutorial doesn't explain much and naval battles are waaaaaaayy tooooo looooong. Also autoresolve will lose you a battle, that if you fought it, you'd easily win. 

Conclusion: Besides the upcoming Ghosts of Tsushima, this is the best tribute to Asian Military History ever developed in video games. You won't find a better pre 20th century japanese themed game even in your dreams. If you like Japan, you will like this game. If you like epic battles, you will like this game. If you like to be challenged. you will like this game.

- Great combat
- Beautiful art direction, graphics, and music  
- Campaign map is easy to navigate
- Expansion Packs and DLC has a lot of thought put into it
Cons:
- I think the enemy AI is a little buggy at times
- Diplomacy is kind of a joke
- As a veteran player of the series, a campaign can seem boring and repetitive after a while, but that can be easily fixed by playing on Legendary.

0,68443729,english,"Fantastic real time strategy game set in historic Japan with great aesthetic.  There's two aspects to this game:  the overland campaign map where the player manages his/her empire by building infrastructure, managing income taxes, engaging in diplomacy, and of course, producing and upgrading military units for conquest.  This is the strategic component of the game.  

The other part is the tactical battle map where the player fights his/her enemies.  These maps are dynamic and the geography is based on where you chose to fight on the campaign map.  The player can ambush their opponents, engage in siege battles, or even fight in naval battles.  Command hundreds, if not thousands, of samurai warriors, monks, archers, etc; each unit of which is animated individually with wonderfully choreographed movements! 

There're many different Japanese clans to choose from and several campaign options, depending on what you are interested in.  Most of the clans have unique abilities that make them stand out from the others, in addition to their geographical starting points.  

I have not played the multiplayer portion of this game, but I understand that it is rather good and remains somewhat popular, even today.  Especially with the recent Steam sale (free) that was introduced in 2020.

That said, overall I would say the game has aged rather well.  When it was released, this was the most polished Total War game to date, and it shows, even today.  

My primary criticism focuses on the AI, which, beyond hard difficulty, essentially has to massively cheat in order to keep up with the player.  It is decent enough though, that most players, especially newer ones, will find it very challenging and rewarding on the Normal/Hard levels.  

The next issue I have with the game is the fact that it was programmed for 32-bit computer systems, and as such, is incapable of taking advantage of the higher memory of modern video cards or hyper threading technology (can only use up to 4 physical CPU cores).  By default, the game will only recognize around 2GB of VRAM, but is capable of using up to 4GB; to enable this, simply locate the ""preferences.script.txt"" file and find the ""gfx_video_memory 0;"" line, and replace the ""0;"" with ""-2000"" so it should look like: 
 ""gfx_video_memory -2000;"" This will allow the game to use the maximum memory it is capable of using.

Even with this, the game can be quite slow in loading, with the first splash screen at the start taking a minute or two even on modern computers.  Battles can also take about thirty seconds to load as well, but it isn't too much of a problem, really.  If it is, you can run the game on Direct X 9 to decrease the loading time by over half. 

So that's it!  Do I recommend this game?  Absolutely!  Even in 2020?  Heck yes!  It is one of the greatest real time strategy games ever made and provides endless hours of entertainment.  I hope this review was helpful.  Have a nice day.",1588440967,1589080571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198330692148,40,8,17678,0,14271,1589785714,,

Command samurai armies on a beautiful campaign map and battle against other clans, fight medieval samurai naval battles, use ninja agents, employ mysterious geisha assassins, recruit special samurai heroes and so much more.

This is the best TW game before Rome 2 was introduced and brought us those horrible reworked mechanics for almost all aspects of this renowned game series. And I can't stress enough the amount of mods this game has.

The downside of this title is in my humble opinion would only be the diplomacy and maybe naval battles (a little bit). You can always mod this part of the game.

One of the few Total War games that i can trully enjoy without the need of any mods, because of its high level of autenticity and historical accuracy in comparison with other TW tittles. 

- The time period and world zone both feel very refreshing as they barely have been touched by any other game before, even previous Total War games(with exeption of Shogun 1). 

- The art work/UI and music/sound are hands down some of the more immersive and better looking/sounding ones in the whole gaming industry in my opinion. Hell even the graphics still look great so many years after.

- The layout of the campaign map gives the AI a decent fighting chance... almost making it look as if it was competent. 

- The unit composition altough seemingly ""samy"" for all factions, make balance much less of an issue and still leaves a lot of room for diversity and customization(specially on multiplayer). 

- The inclusion of the RPG leveling system for agents and generals gives agency to the players and adds replayability.

- The Avatar Conquest multiplayer it's incredibly engaging and immersive giving each player an unprecedent level customization and personalization over his general, individual units and basicaly the whole army.

There is more to be said, but i think you get the idea... Shogun 2 does a lot of things very well and has an special charm that most Total War games(specially recent ones) fail to capture.

No game is not without flaws tho... most can be found in the multiplayer part of the game; i quote myself:

[quote=Yellow;1735468693692217920][quote=CA Grace]We were aware of issues with the SHOGUN II multiplayer [/quote]

Well if we gonna talk about issues regarding the multiplayer: 

1st: 
It goes without saying that paid DLC Units should had never been allowed in a competitive multiplayer game. 
Those who buy Rise of the Samurai, Sengoku Jidai, Saints and Heroes or the Ikko Ikko DLC all get more powerful and cost efficient units, not to mention a lot of very powerful exclusive retainers! Thus putting anyone who does not pay for the DLCs at a handicap. 
Different time period units should not have been mixed toguether neither, not only does this makes balancing even harder, but also takes away from immersion.

2nd: 
On the retainers topic; They ALL should have been easier to unlock by being directly linked to Territories on the Avatar Map, eventually a few special ones linked to Archivements. None should have been linked to random post battle drops, much less to FULL armor sets where obtaining each individual piece is itself based on RNG. One can play a million battles and still be as unlucky as to not get some of the arguably most important retainers, leaving you with a handicap on the multiplayer based purely on luck. 
I don't see the point neither on having what basically are ""Tiered Retainers"" (same function just better bonus). Let alone paid DLC retainers. 

3rd:
Capping units... This should have been done with all units in my opinion. No one should be allowed to field an entire army of the same exact unit, making certain retainers extremely OP and making said build very hard to counter with anything other than an specialized anti-build, thus further increasing the luck element, where battles are won already on the army selection screen.
All units should have been capped at around 6 (some at even less), as well as having a Unit-Class cap too, like for example max 10 calv, max 10 swords, etc, etc thus forcing melee spammers and in particular cav spammers to at least mix up their units a little; A unit and class cap would also automatically help balance out certain retainers selection. 

4th:
New players disadvantage. A new player with only ashigaru units unlocked (even if said new player is very skillful) has almost 0 chance to win a battle vs a more leveled up player (even if said player is less skillful), as the ashigaru units will simply rout as soon as the fight start. 
In my opinion all basic samurai units (bow, yari, katana, and yari cav) should have been available from level 0 to all players. This would even up the field early on and give everyone a fairer chance. Clan specialization should instead be about unlocking higher tier (specialized) units and upgrades, not starting ones. 

5th:
The inclusion of dojos on the different maps is overall a great idea, as it prevents camping and red lining. However not all dojos are created equal and their positioning and randomness make for some unfair situations sometimes, when one dojo of arguably less importance is closer to one player, while another dojo of arguably higher value is closer to the other player. 
All dojos should simply be equally accessible to both players at the start of the game, being it ultimately up to said players to focus or not on capturing or neutralizing them. 
On the same topic, Bow Dojo should give both accuracy and reload speed, and do NOT give ammo-resupply for 2 reasons:
-  Most games end so fast that you hardly ever run out of ammo, making the ammo resupply mechanic (and even the extended ammo upgrades) rather pointless most of the time. 
- In the special case of the enemy spamming cav and bow cav, it becomes the complete opposite, this dojo and its resupply ability becomes OP. To counter a cav rush with a balanced army you are basically forced to go for the hills and forest in order to have a fighting chance vs said cheese army, however, since the bow dojo gives infinite ammo resupply then we are sadly forced in stead to try and neutralize it and thus end up out in the open near the dojo where we are an easy target, the alternative is to simply ignore it and go to the woods and die from infinite arrows or lose anyway because of the dojo capture timer.

6th: 
Naval battles on vanilla Shogun 2 are a mess. Yet they are necessary in order to unlock all land regions (thus all units and retainers) on the Avatar Conquest map. 
I think this was a mistake; Siege battles are neither required nor ranked, why then make Naval ones both things, when they are arguably worse than Siege?! Don't get me wrong I don't think they should be removed, just make them not ranked, and let us move move our avatar to the islands regardless of water territories being unlocked or not.

7th:
Why allow Public Groups to be selected as Clans? This makes the whole Clan Competition feature rather pointless as zerg clans have a clear advantage over smaller private ones. Small steps to alleviate this were taken such as the implementation of losing points by losing battles and such, but that ain't enough. 
Only private groups should have counted as Clans from the beginning, and only Officers (owners) of said groups should have been able to activate them and select clan specialisation in game. There should have been an option to disband the group as a clan, and/or of changing clan specialization!

8th:
Another thing greatly missing is the option to reset veteran skills like we can do with our general. This would allow players to be more experimental with their units and builds, and reduce the amount of grind. As well as to add another clan token sink.

9th:
Movement speed is way too fast, and time to kill extremely low, resulting in most matches lasting less than 5 minutes. There is little room for tactics and strategy, and too much focus on pure micro and luck (army composition). 

10th:
Special abilities. They work for General and Heroes, but i don't think they should be a part of regular units. I would much rather see elite/top tier units just have access to special formations and/or some passive aura-debuffs/buffs.
This change would actually help with the previous point, as by toning down the power-cap of certain units we would balance them sightly; as well as end up making battles a tad slowed as result...",1539219620,1588681244,True,2,0,0.551709234714508057,0,True,False,False,76561198007592552,40,21,12632,0,4922,1589313068,,

Now, have one that you will NOT sign in with on the game's store and sign in with the other. After the other tab is signed in, use the one that is signed out to claim the game.

63,68323159,english,"I like it. Chosokabe are my favorite. I play fairly modded, so anything I dislike is fixed.(The lack of console cheats I found annoying at 1st, but a cheat mod has sufficed) Main problems; archers have no idea what guard mode means. They just randomly start approaching (under fire) things well within range. They fire at whatever they want to & will repeatedly ignore orders.(even with fire at will off) Sometimes units in general will just do random things you don't tell them to. (Scream""WTF are you doing?! NOOOO!""& ""JUST STAND & SHOOT, GORRAMMIT!"" at the screen a lot) 
 But, other than those minor annoyances, it's a pretty fun Total War. Now that it's free I wish I waited...get it NOW before they change their minds!(oops too late it's over) It was still worth the 75% off I think I got it for. I also got Rise of the Samurai at the time & a bunch of clan packs. Don't like Rise as much. Didn't get FotS because I don't like guns in Total War. ""Too much noise, too much smoke, very bad smell."" Thank God for the person who made the mod that removes the cannon sound from archers caused by other mods. Gimme flaming arrows any day, looks much cooler, burns the fort & arrow towers. Also, love the way the dudes writhe around in agony after being Boromired with multiple arrows. The last 1 or 2 are really funny with 100 arrows in them.(That's gotta hurt)
 I have to agree with others about not needing generals in every army being nice. Love having huge stacks just laying around waiting to swarm like hornets when some clan has the unmitigated audacity to attack my divinely blessed(aka severely cheating, otherwise what good's being a god?) chosen people. They quickly learn the meaning of blitzkrieg.
 The Shameless Endless Movement mod is awesome. Perfect for monopolizing all the foreign trade ports, & attacking multiple targets per turn. Thanks to Steam for having the workshop open on this 1. Without cheats I'd be bankrupt & running a deficit by turn 5; now my troops EARN money instead of costing upkeep. Keep churning out 6 units a turn in every fort/port & I'm soon an all powerful millionaire. Oh, & endless food supply; priceless. Nothing but build & stomp.

Beautiful art direction, accessible UI, responsive AI movement, and dynamic (if not exactly fair) balancing all make Shogun 2 a stand-out experience. I recommend just getting this game now, booting up the base campaign, choosing a warlord with your favorite colors, and exploring everything the game can do. Even if you fail, the first few turns are quick and painless, especially with a modern PC or laptop. The battles are quick if you're not used to the speed of later Total War games, so they can feel punishing if you don't know what you're doing. But I recommend diving in regardless, you'll quickly learn how to outwit the AI--they've never been particularly bright.

If you like multiplayer, I remember Avatar Conquest being the only time I was actually into competitive multiplayer in a Total War game; but it's been years since AC was super populated. Who knows? Maybe the new players will bring it back to life.

Total War is intended as a strategy game, but the map and the way the provinces are layed out, it's very linear; not much more than few provinces side-by-side in one big line.

Aside from that, the game is the ""latest and greatest"" Total War compared to all those the came before it, but for me, that map is just too limited to be interesting, so Napolean (Europe and part of Asia) and Empires (Eastern Americas and much of Europe) are much more interesting and fun games because of their map layout.

In many ways, I can't play this for very long without thinking it's unfortinate in this case that his game is based on actual history, or rather, moreso geography...

I know most people would kind of freak if they made a game about historic Japanese warriors spreading across Eurasia, or some alien planet, so I get that they couldn't make a proper history-based game based on the era without the ""problem"" of Japan's Island/Islands being layed out in pretty much a straight north-south line that doesn't lend itself well to complex strategies, but that said, maybe they should have simply gone for another historic era because the simplicity of the map really did limit my enjoyment of this game significantly.",1588279517,1588279517,False,3,0,0.489428669214248657,0,True,False,False,76561198097819064,280,23,4908,0,4908,1422401699,,

12,68321149,english,"Hello, annon, and thank you for reading.

Having played and enjoyed every title in the franchise; The rudimentary nature of medieval Japanese warfare causes Total War: Shogun 2 to be the easiest version to *learn* within the series (next to its even more simplistic predecessor).
The variation of clans, and their well-balanced specialties allow for wonderful replay value, as well as flexibility toward providing various flavors of game-play styles to enjoy, means that you will also log at least 200 hours as I have into this game.
The DLC campaigns are each totally distinct games with their own sets of rules and units in order to cater to the radically different periods of Japan; so you have a variety of options for levels of technology, and units to play around with.

You can have 28 Us Marines, annon.
You may use them to siege things.

I personally love both the core campaign, as well as Fall of the Samurai - while Rise of the Samurai seems much more challenging, as it feels like more of a culture war... pfft - fire and steel, all the way.

TLDR:
10/10 - would establish myself as Shogun, and then cast out the smelly French and Dutch to pave way for the ultimate weeaboos wet dream of 28 US Marines and a bunch of Samurai laying siege to Ram Ranch, chasing out the Liberal/Globalist Imperialists in order to maintain Tradition, Order, and Integrity within the sovereign United Provinces of Yamato SEVERAL more times.

Only to find out you can't get the core game itself. It says my game is already in library so I can't actually get it. 
I then tried and installing the game (Shogun 2, as it is still named that although I only have FotS), thinking it must have automatically been added... but NOPE, still just the FotS that is unlocked in-game. 

So if you already own FotS but not the base game you can't have Shogun 2 apparently.. well done CA.

The confusion is that Fall of the Samurai is a standalone game. The Shogun 2 base game is also standalone. What the game developers did was streamline the launcher and game .exe to run The Shogun 2 base game, Rise of the Samurai, and Fall of the Samurai all together without requiring seperate installs or game .exe's. So even though you have 2 games that are 'standalone' they are both incorporated the same game launcher and game .exe... Hence, when you buy the base game mode, Steam will update the launcher and .exe to add the base game mode to the main menu you've been using to play Fall of the Samurai.

21,18681567,english,"Not very intensive, would recommend if you can't play newer TW games. If you can, just buy Warhammer 2 and spend your time on that. So much more variety in that game and gameplay.

For it's time, this game is a masterpiece. But with Creative Assembly and Sega creating faction/race-specific research trees, units (not just Ikko Ikki Ashigaru), mechanics, 'stances' cities with set sizes (instead of all them having Citadel potential), a more expansive counter-cycle (Spearmen --> Horses --> Archers --> Spearmen, for Shogun 2) this game is severely outdated.

Let's compare DLC. Just to show how outdated this game is by Warhammer 2.

Otomo Clan Pack DLC ($5) adds a new faction.
[list]
[*]5 'new' units. 1 of them being a Naval unit and it's not the Nanban Trade ship (Otomo's primary Naval power source), simply put, it's useless. Otomo Matchlock Ashigaru, this unit is literally just Matchlock Ashigaru with +5 to reload and accuracy. Portuguese Tercos, these are actually new units in terms of design and name. They're matchlock infantry with good melee and armor stats, pretty cool. Matchlock Samurai, have the same gimmick as Matchlock Ashi. And to finish off with Donderbuss Cav (unique to Otomo) this is an Otomo specific unit and it's new. So you get basically 2 new units out of 5. Score: 4/10

[*]New Buildings. Leased land (give up Daimyo honour for 4500 gold), this is only useful early. Otomo economy is amazing due to Nanban ports. I have only used this once and it was in Legendary. This isn't useless, but it's not useful. The Christianity Chain, actually Otomo's most useful building for conquering, believe it or not. Converting enemy provinces to Christianity makes them unhappy with their Shinto-Buddhist ruler, vice-versa with Otomo. The Missionary can incite a revolt assuming the populace is close to unhappy (which religion differences can cause this). Rebellions on legendary are strong, especially if you can win a battle against the enemy's primary army, they'll struggle with it and possibly lose. Score 8/10

[*]Faction trait. Yeah it exists, not much to it. Score meh/10

[*]Actually playing it. Otomo is a dreadful campaign. Military allies in this game are USELESS, don't even make them. They don't get the repercussions you do for breaking them and for nearly 100% of the factions, you'll have a -60 diplomatic penalty for being Christian, making trade, peace, and avoiding war a nightmare. It's a challenge and there is hours to be had trying to beat it or even survive. Score 8/10

[*] DLC score: 6/10 content is decent, but it makes claims to try and justify the 5 dollar price tag that it shouldn't have.
[/list]

Warhammer 2 DLC ($9) - The Prophet and the Warlock (other similar priced DLCs can vary in quality, primarily Hunter and the Beast)

[list]
[*]2 New Legendary Lords. Ikit Claw and Tehenhauin. Ikit Claw is disgusting, Skaven's best lord. Ikit has a crazy skill tree that corrects almost any pitfalls that are present to begin with. He works really well on a Doomwheel mount spamming Warp Lightning. But there's a lot to Ikit that I don't even know fully. Tehenhauin is a hard to pilot lord with some pretty interesting bonuses, Lore of Beasts, a decent melee fighter (can beat some Lords in melee, but relies on Lore of Beasts buffs to correct pitfalls), and good mounts. 9/10

[*]Clan Skryre and Cult of Sotek factions added. Skryre has the Forbidden workshop mechanic added which is BROKEN, they also bring in a set of crazy good units that Skaven needs to survive (Warplock Jezzails, Doom-Flayers, Ratling Guns). Cult of Sotek brings in a whole lot of new units and a mechanic called ""Sacrificial Offerings"". They bring in 3 new monsters, another unit of flying cavalry, Red Crested Skinks (armor-piercing melee which early game Lizardmen lacked), and Salamander Hunting Packs which are crazy strong in the early game. Their SO mechanic gives them rewards they can buy with the offerings that they get from battles and missions, these can be special units (Regiments of Renown), stat buffs, army abilities, followers/banners (equipable to a character, some are gross specifically 20% reduced upkeep). Both factions are presented their own unique challenges. 9/10

[*]Two New additional lord types. This is less interesting but, Skaven get Warlock Masters and Lizardmen get Red Crested Skink Chiefs. meh/10

[*]Nine new battlefield units. Already mentioned, these are the meat of the DLC. 10/10

[*]Skryre Doomrocket and Great Invocation of Sotek. Doomrocket is BROKEN, it's a nuke, get an enemy army to group on some Clanrats (that you can spawn like 7 times a battle), get 1k kills from the nuke and guarantee a win in a tight battle. Great Invocation of Sotek is not as broken, but it's a strong Wind ability, can rip through units and again secure a victory. 8/10

[*]New Regiments of Renown. It's pretty good, just some good units to grab when you don't want to spend the time recruiting or can't. 8/10
[/list]

Meh its free now so fuck yeah its worth it







*EDIT*

Man, this is fucking painfull. As someone that grew up playing games like Star Wars Empire At War, this game has been pure joy. And with the addition of the fall of the samurai, a complete revamp and basically a completely new game, this is my favourite game of all time. Despite me having about 200 games on steam, and having close to 4000 hours in games like csgo and WarThunder. But the price change is just scummy. Completely scummy. No matter how you look at it, its just a fucking shit move from their part. 
I know that they add a few other DLCs to the main game, but to be honest they should instead have been added as free DLC when buying the main game. Having to pay 60$ to get the complete game, when the game has been out since 2011. 

For now it is NOT worth buying, even despite my love for the game.

So, with that in mind: this game is no improvement on previous games in the series. The enemy AI is still stupidly easy to beat, both sending inferior forces against you and managing them poorly in battle. You still need to fight every battle yourself to get the best outcome because the auto-calculate fight will never perform to scratch; this leads to a lot of tedious little battles. This is exacerbated by poor load times.

So you sit and wait for the fight to load, demolish some poor dumb peasant soldiers, sit and wait for the campaign map to load. Over and over.

There's apparently multiplayer ""drop in battle"" capability, allowing human players to take over campaign AI opponents in battle, but there are several problems here:
[list]
[*]If nobody's on at the same time you're playing, you get no battle. I haven't fought in a single one for that reason.
[*]As a drop-in player, you're going to get poor fights because the campaign AI is still stupid and sends out inferior armies. Taking command of two units of peasant spearmen and one of peasant archers against six samurai units is a lost cause, and no fun.
[*]As a campaign player with drop-in switched on, you run the risk of people screwing with you, just giving your army the runaround until time expires, rather than a proper stand-up fight. They've got nothing to lose by simply trolling you.
[/list]
There have been TEN games in the Total War series, and the AI has not improved since the first one. The novelty of a new setting is not enough to overcome this crippling deficiency. The heart and soul of Total War games is the battles, and the battles simply aren't fun once you realise just how bad the AI is.

If you've never played a Total War game before, you'll probably have an absolute blast. If you've already played TW games, don't waste your time - this is nothing new.",1452565593,1587986391,False,3,0,0.454828709363937378,0,True,False,False,76561197964120751,302,116,1124,0,804,1559439638,,

Total War: SHOGUN 2 is about Japanese clans waging all sorts of ancient warfare upon each other. It includes an encyclopedia with quotes and content, contributing to this theme.

PLAY
It features two types of play, both related to each other. The first requires making large-scale, turn-based decisions. The other covers small-scale, tactical warfare.
Winning involves expanding a clan it's influence, while supporting an economy to maintain and outfit it's army.
Fights reward winning a battle, which in turn strengthens an army unit.

SKILL
It has adjustable difficulties.
When it is played without turns, armies are influenced by circumstances, which are determined during it's play in turns.
Different clans, and both human-, and computer opponents encourage replaying it.

- More concentrated at battle tactics than on economics or politics like Paradox games. It is there but it's all smaller, more compact, clear and easily understandable. There are historical characters here, however you will start the campaign playing as their fathers, and the real sengoku heroes will be born (spawn) later. (with randomized armor, which is shame)

- Battles are the real core here. You need to pay attention to weaknesses and strenghts of each unit and plan your tactics accordingly. In some more difficult terrain the AI sometimes acts stupid and does not do what it is told to, so you need to pay extra attention there. Siege maps seem a bit empty compared to the newer Total Wars, but they are like that so your troops wouldn't get stuck at fences and trees all the time. (I've tried moded maps and they do so all the time) Naval battles are a pain to do. The AI is really stupid here. It won't do exactly what you want it to do and sometimes two of your ships will ram into each other and block their way for no reason. Luckily the enemy AI does it as well. They are fun only when you have slightly higher numbers or slightly stronger ships, which makes them winable. 

- The historical battles are more fun. Except the naval one. They are not all historically accurate though. Usually when you play as someone else than Oda or Tokugawa.

A good mix of melee and archaic ranged battles; Also modern ranged combat
A game deep enough to get lost in, but shallow enough for someone new to the franchise to grasp
An easy to understand economic function, as well as a variety of ways to go about it.
Pretty much the entire game

Cons (or Suggestions??):
Naval battles are kind of hard to grasp, since I myself still do not ever engage without auto resolve
I would have appreciated more DLC on the expansion of more clans or modern units from the West

I passed a Japanese history class in university using some of the knowledge I learned from this game.  There is quite a bit of good, well-researched detail, both in game mechanics and lore that makes this game very enjoyable to an amateur historian like myself.  

Is this the best Total War?  Not by a long shot.  Economics is rather cut-and-dry, have a few military districts and stick a market in every other settlement.  Peasant spam the AI's ""elite"" samurai armies, those aristocrats' lower population and barely improved stats mean that all eventually will fall beneath the ashigaru tide.  You can sell military access to the AI and they stupidly keep paying you for the privilege.

However, the units have solid niches and a good combined-arms military force can keep things interesting as you unify Japan.  Plus, each faction you play definitely is able to win.  Obviously, some are easier than others, as Shimazu katana samurai are worth three yari ashigaru, while the Otomo's matchlock mastery means you can bring 18th century battle tactics to the 16th century.  Your opponents brought a sword to a gunfight.  It does not end well for them.

Plus, the DLC are all great expansions to the game.  Fall of the Samurai (FOTS) is the closest we have ever gotten to a Total War modern war experience and it delivers.  Some people say using guns is unfair.  Well, guess what - in war, if you are fighting fair, then you aren't trying hard enough.  Welcome to the modern world.  There's a reason we aren't walking around with pikes anymore.  

You get to teach that lesson to a lot of factions and it never gets old, in my opinion.  Great game, if you haven't gotten in yet, wait for it to go on sale.",1587193802,1587193802,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198119886865,135,24,41018,0,40344,1598687853,,

The game play doesn't deviate from it's core in any of these games, and believe me that's a good thing, because it's masterful and evolved, but it's still the same from game to game no matter what the age of the edition. 

What shines (imo) in Total War: Shogun 2, is the Japanese Culture in that 1650 A.D. era is just so stunningly beautiful. Yes the architecture, and loading screens, and costumes...all of that is stunning. However, it's also the things you can't see, like Bushido, and a warriors honour, and the cleverness of tactics (eg ninja spies).
Even the random title screen opening graphic, which may just show a dojo, or a boat, while it plays this beautiful gentle Japanese music from that era. This game is still beautiful today, and even a modest gaming PC, with a current GP will be able to run everything on ultra.

 I will say one small or maybe big flaw depending on views. 2 simple words. ""LEASED LAND"". What is leased land you may ask. Well let me enlighten you, leased land is a building that the Otomo can build for no cost. In return the Otomo get a one time little sum of money (4500 koku to be exact) and that building slot is given away to the Portuguese. FOREVER. Thats right once its built no more building slot. If the Otomo are Ai and you conquer that land well SORRY BUD BUT YOUR SHIT OUTTA LUCK. You dont get the money cus the money was given to the Otomo but you have to deal with the consequences. Real fun thing when your hundreds of turns deep into a campaign and you take over Kyushu to find A BUILDING SLOT IN EVERY PROVINCE TAKEN UP BY SCUMMY EUROPEANS(no offense to Europeans) AND YOUR STUCK WITH A USELESS BUILDING.

The naval combat might not be as good as after Total war versions, but it is still nice to see those japanese type of ships fighting.

the campaign can be very boring at times and you can pretty much just win by having a massive army and curb stomping every province and faction that stands in your way by auto resolving every fight.

58,64715454,english,"I purchased this game long time ago, but played only recently. This game offers excellent strategy and warfare experience, it's a very detailed and interesting. However this game also has some CRUCIAL FLAWS, most notably this:

1) Diplomacy is totally broken. Other factions treat you unfriendly for no reasons and it's very hard to get trade agreements with other factions.   

2) Realm Divide event - when you capture 10-15 provinces, all other factions suddenly declare war on you and you can not survive. This is the major flaw of the game. Not fun at all. Basically after you capture a number of provinces you can not continue gameplay.

3) Time limitations - time is very limited, especially in Fall of Samurai. You have a small number of turns to achieve goals.

4) No in game manual - manual for this game contains only 13 pages instead of 300-400 pages because of complexity of the game.

I can recommend this game only partially, and for the early stages of gameplay. The game is really good at the start, but after Realm Divide event it's literally unplayable. I don't know why developers ruined this game with broken diplomacy and limitations. 

Majority of the unofficial mods for this game don't work so dont bother to install them.

Buy this game when on sale, because of its flaws it's not worth more than 10 - 15 EUR.",1583682134,1583683132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041330298,62,22,2688,0,2046,1583803968,,

Total War Shogun 2 is an excellent strategy game which in the base game can be your typical total war game but based in Japan, or if you have the Fall of the Samurai expansion turns the traditional total war game into a hybrid of Empire/Napoleon and introduces more modern firearms and artillery which is the most destructive it's been in the series able to wipe out sometimes a quarter to half a squad with a single round. 
Naval combat is also pretty good in FOTS, the ironclad giants like the HMS Warrior or the sniper L'ocean class . These giants are able to take on incredible odds and make you rule the seas if you can afford them.

Fall of the Samurai is fun but recommend vanilla as it is the most fun in my humble opinion. But if you are into guns guns and more guns it is fine though battles do get repetitive of samurai attack rifles mow them down over and over but is fun if you are a more defensive player....Crossing the two in multiplayer is sometimes fun..though more often than not There are many last Samurai scenarios for Vanilla players when they face fall of the samurai players thereby forcing the person who likes vanilla to buy Fall of the Samurai just so they can compete against the Multiplayer scene though some are willing to compromise and play vanilla.

- Three campaign eras spanning across 1000 years of Japanese history, from the age of the graceful katana to the age of the merciless, breach-loading rifle. Each campaign has its own faction roster, technology trees, and unique gameplay mechanics. Also features two-player multiplayer campaign support.
- Tactical battles that you know and love from Total War at their best. Countless units to choose from, with custom battles supporting every era simultaneously in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Despite the huge technological differences in the eras, you'll be surprised just how ridiculously balanced the units really are. The trusty bow and spear CAN beat the modern army with proper leadership, which makes this game absolutely delightful. Naval battles are also present in the game.
- Breathtaking graphics on both the battlefield and campaign map. Battles are superbly cinematic. Battlefields can be played in any season and any weather. Troop animations are gorgeous and melee combat animations are the best in Total War that I have seen.
- Unit reactivity to orders feels instantaneous and unit movement and transitions are exceptionally fluid.
- Astonishing mod support and a strong modding presence on the Steam Workshop, where you can find mods for campaign as well as multiplayer. I have made several mods and custom maps myself!

81,1416427,english,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#1 out of 555)... it's time for Total War: Shogun 2

I kind of hate Shogun 2. I've been playing Total War games since the demo disc for the first Shogun in PC Gamer, way back when--I fell in love immediately. And Shogun 2 is, arguably, the very best entry in the franchise. It's good. Really, really good. Phenomenally good. And the Fall of the Samurai expansion allows us to experience the surprisingly-engaging gunpowder-age combat introduced in Empire, while still retaining the fantastic traditional medieval combat in the base game. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect--naval combat is a bit of a mess, diplomacy is as wonky as ever, and the lack of the throne room or any similar roleplay-style systems is a bit disappointing. But it's still one of the best strategy games out there--nevermind among the best looking.

But, see, Shogun 2 isn't simply the best Total War game out there--it's also the last good Total War game out there. It's the one game by which every subsequent Total War is judged, and they invariably fall far, far, far short. It's really depressing, honestly. I'm sitting here, writing this, desperately hoping the upcoming Three Kingdoms will finally buck this trend (after all, Shogun 2's brilliance came after Empire's catastrophe) but I am not optimistic.",1301004967,1582084187,True,5,2,0.55653756856918335,0,True,False,False,76561197993023804,709,495,13905,0,8744,1585858281,,

It’s a marketing attribution tool that helps companies determine which of their adverts are most effective. It does this in a similar way to other analytics tools by using cookies to generate a unique token from device information, and comparing that with data taken from marketing campaigns and game activations. In this way, the companies that use it are able to see which adverts are more effective. You can find out more about Red Shell here: https://redshell.io/home

However, while Red Shell was only used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, we saw that players were clearly concerned about it and that it would be difficult for us to entirely reassure everyone. As such, the implementation of Red Shell was removed from all Total War games that previously used it.

Additionally, we were aware of issues with the SHOGUN II multiplayer servers and have been working on a fix to allow players to continue to battle for Japan online. This fix should now be live."

There are unique units to each faction (typically 1), along with a fair number of troop types with some overlap that all have their own unique flavor.

27,31584120,english,"After a few (lol) hundred more hours, I figured I'd review Shogun 2 again in more detail, and this time, on its own merits rather than heavily comparing it to older Total War titles more than as necessary.

[h1]BATTLES[/h1]

Shogun 2 is still a gem in the Total War series. Its real time battles look gorgeous and control very well, if a bit more fast-paced for those who might prefer the older style of Rome 1 and Medieval 2 where careful positioning and drawn-out engagements are the appeal of the games. That said, the scale is still there, so is the importance of deliberate unit positioning and outwitting your opponent.

Sure, it's got that same formula you expect in TW games: RPS where swords beat spears, spears beat cavalry, cavalry runs over bows, bows cut everyone down until they get too close, and modern guns and cannons ruin everything. But where you place your troops, how you time your attacks, the morale of your men and how fatigued they are compared to the enemy can still win you a seemingly impossible but incredibly satisfying victory, even if your unit composition isn't the most ideal. My Avatar Conquest win-loss ratio remains terrible in this game, but I've never not had fun with the different ways other players maneuver their troops on the field.

[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]

Speaking of which, Avatar Conquest. This is probably the most fun I've had with a multiplayer mode in any strategy game I've played. I suck at it, but I adore it, and I wish just as many people played it as there used to be. There's still some, they just happen to be few and in different time zones. It's almost embarrassing how much time I've spent customizing my general, since there's so many options to unlock as you get achievements and gain levels (both as you unlock more regions of the Avatar Conquest map, some grinds, and even from the campaign). The only thing I wish they got to iron out was being able to see what an enemy general looked like in a battle replay. Eventually it just defaults back to a normal skin, so you can't relive a battle with a rando or a friend and see how their general looked like at the time.

[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]

But what I will never get over is the detail. The huge armies, the glints on weaponry, the variety of armor being worn by the soldiers, the weather effects, the falling cherry blossom leaves during spring battles, the blood-soaked snow during winter, the lighting, the distant temples and towns in the various maps, and those gorgeous castles in the siege battles, it all looks so good. For an older game, Creative Assembly did an amazing job presenting feudal Japan in as gorgeous a way as they did.

The fact that the units and agents speak Japanese helps with the illusion, too, unlike the game narrators, which, if I recall correctly, are Japanese voice actors seemingly forced at gunpoint to speak English. At least, that’s how I think the recording sessions went. The campiness of it adds to the charm. I'm sure you're all thinking of that same, iconic line. “OUR MEN ARE RUNNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD. A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!” Sure, the cartoonish blood effects and the way everything shines a little too much when it's raining is meme-worthy, but there's a lot of aspects in the visuals and sound that make the battles absolutely gorgeous to play and watch to this day.

[h1]CAMPAIGNS[/h1]

But of course, you can't talk about a Total War game without talking about the campaign mode. Given Shogun 2’s laser focus on one country in conflict, there’s a lot of polish with the campaign that I would argue wasn’t present in previous titles that focused on entire continents. That said, I'll focus on the original Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai campaigns only. I will admit I've yet to finish Rise of the Samurai's campaign. It just doesn't hold my attention the way the original and Fall of the Samurai campaigns do. It's not because of the history surrounding it, it just wasn't presented in a way that was compelling, and even early on, some of its mechanics, especially the reskinned and repurposed agents aren't very clear in how they affect the game. I still plan to finish it, but not until I've had at least one more playthrough of one of the other better campaigns.

The Shogun 2 campaign allows you to play a whole host of different clans that start off in their historical home provinces in feudal Japan. Each general has certain buffs to their army with a little bit of historical flavor to it. For example, the Shimazu clan of Satsuma province zealously follow the bushido code and therefore have superior sword-wielding samurai, or my personal favorite, the Uesugi, who are devote Buddhists, and therefore have superior warrior monks. Yes. Warrior monks. That's how the game adds variety to what is admittedly not a very diverse set of units. We are, after all, talking about what is essentially a country-wide civil war rather than different nations fighting one another as previous Total War games were.

Diplomacy in the original Shogun 2 campaign is a little bit of a joke. Alliances don't really matter when there's a set point in the game when you've reached a level of wealth and power where everyone is bound to turn against you. It's called the Realm Divide. Is it historical? Not in the slightest. Is it fun though? I'd say yes. It's an absolute mess by the second half where everyone hates you and you have to get to Kyoto and take it over for a few turns, but there's still tons of little details and situations affecting character traits that make each playthrough engaging.

As for Fall of the Samurai, well, this one I'd say is the best and meatiest among the few Total War games I've played. Fall of the Samurai is set during the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration. Here, you can play using a selection of notable clans that played major roles during this conflict on different sides: allying either with the shogun or with the emperor. What’s interesting is that the nature of the conflict affects which troops and agents your clan would benefit the most from fielding, as well as which disciplines and technologies you choose to research. Shogunate forces have a whole host of new units with both old school samurai weaponry as well as modern firearms. Same goes for the imperialists. Battles are much more varied and chaotic when guns, cannons, naval bombardment, and even elite European infantry are added to the mix.

This campaign also irons out some of the issues that the original had. Diplomacy matters more here. You want allies siding with whoever you’ve thrown in your support for, and the Realm Divide mechanic finally makes sense when it’s shogunate clans against imperialist clans aiming to reunify the country under one banner. But there is an interesting third option when the Realm Divide arrives: throwing both sides away and attempting to unify Japan yourself independent of either the shogun or the emperor. Essentially, you’re recreating the Realm Divide of the original campaign while there’s also still a major conflict going on. Absolute chaos. Total. War. I love that that’s an option to win the campaign. That is a daimyo with cajones made of steel folded over 1000 times.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]

Despite some of its minor issues, Shogun 2 endeavored to be a proper sequel to the series' origins. This is definitely my favorite Total War game, perhaps one of my favorite strategy games, and I cannot recommend it enough for anyone interested in a mix of grand strategy and real time strategy with immense scale that’s set in an iconic and volatile period in Japan’s history. Even with the disaster of Rome 2’s release since, the successes of Total War’s dip into fantasy with Warhammer, and now, the rise of Total War: Three Kingdoms, Shogun 2’s leaps for the franchise shouldn’t be forgotten.",1494086501,1581505956,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198074295776,141,30,41504,0,40506,1596963915,,

49,63215507,english,"I'll be reviewing this game in 2 parts; Shogun 2 + ROTS & Fall of the Samurai. Also, this will based on vanilla experience.

Shogun 2
If you play any Total War franchise before, you'll be familiar with the gameplay already. If this is your first entry to the Total War series, then you won't be disappointed. The game is set during the Sengoku Jidai period of Japan. If you like Japanese history, this will be an interesting one. The combat system is excellent and play as any faction as you want to relieve the dream of becoming a Shogun and unite Japan once more like how Oda Nobunaga did. Overall, I like the gameplay and element of the game. ROTS has the same mechanic as Shogun 2, but the setting is set 100 years prior before the main game which is during the Genpei period.

FOTS
If you play Empire or Napoleon, then this game will be familiar to you. The difference between FOTS and Shogun 2 is instead of capturing Kyoto and becoming Shogun, your missing is to unify Japan under the Emperor's banner (Imperial) or Shogun's banner (Shogunate). The setting is set during Boshin War, a few decades after the main game. It also introduces gunpowder units to the game. The combat mechanic is impressive but like Empire, artillery is the king of the battlefield. Also, gunpowder units can massacre a full unit of samurai army in a few minutes. It's fun and enjoyable in the least.

In conclusion, I enjoy all the game. Despite it's not actually historically accurate, but the historical element is there, and I love it. If you read about Sun Tzu's Art of War, it will help you during your gameplay tremendously as this game implements it well.",1581249978,1581249978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198019009246,272,27,28131,0,25378,1595167367,,

59,62372892,english,"First, don't get me wrong. I actually like this game, it's fun.

However, this game is very hard once you hit the endgame. So basically, when you have like 15-18 provinces, everyone start declaring war on you. When I said everyone, it is basically EVERYONE, including your allies and your vassals, no matter what you do, they will attack you. They will attack waves by waves and when you are busy defending the front line from enemy troops, there will be some clans that will dispatch their troops on your back with their ships. You are forced to retreat your troops and defend the back. Trying to defend your front line with some troops and left some to defend the back? No you can't, except you're really expert on this game, First wave will be deadly, enemy will attack with their full samurai army and I can guaranteed that you can't hold them with only few troops. Not even mentioning naval battles...

The other part which makes endgame hard as well is your money. You get income by trade income, trading with other clans, building and upgrading things and taxes, and you're spending money in military, basically the more troops you have, the more expensive they will be. And last to mention, samurai (high quality troops) costs twice more the upkeep price than ashigaru (low quality troops). In endgame, you cannot trade with anyone, and you can generate money only from what you have. With lower income, you are forced to have your troops filled with lots of ashigaru to prevent your income from going negative.

Then you have happiness, in this game you need to prevent the happiness from going negative, or the province will rebel. In endgame, when you need to capture like 7-10 provinces more to get victory, maintaining this happiness in newly captured province is really hard. You will usually have -4 happiness already when you capturing enemy province. And if it was belong to some clans (ikko ikki, otomo) you need to deal with religion differences, that will furthermore decreasing your happiness in that province. High taxes also hurt your happiness, so don't try to even set your taxes to high in endgame. Of course this problem can be easily solved by putting troops in that province. But if you have like 7 provinces with negative happiness and you need to garrison those provinces with some troops while you are actually run out of troops in the front line what can you do??? You need to remember that in endgame, everyone will attack you. Placing some troops in your provinces gonna hurt your income so much and it will be a wasteful resources.

The other important thing is that this game have a time limit. You basically need to achieve victory on 1675. Adding more difficulty to the game
========================================
So basically, this game is really fun. But once you hit that endgame, you will be f***ed up.

El hecho de ser un juego que solo se concentra en mejorar la economia y felicidad de las ciudades para generar dinero y crear inmensos ejercitos y enviarlos a combatir lo pone mas alto en mi categoria de RTS que los juegos parecidos al AoE. Este fue mi primer juego de Total War y puedo decir que es uno de los mas refinados y simples para introducir a alguien a la serie, dominarlo es otra historia.

It is very entertaining to conquer Japan in the Age of the Samurai.
The Naval Battles are also entertaining, but somewhat useless,
because you can have the greatest fleet, but if you are beaten on land you still lose.
If you played other TW games before it might be hard to adjust yourself to some of the main differences.
One of them would be that there are no shields which is why arrows are more effective
or that walls of fortresses can be climbed.

""Fall of the Samurai"", it is many hours of fun and I genuinely enjoyed it.

51,9913016,english,"If you enjoyed the original Shogun total war, then it's likely you'll also enjoy Shogun 2. The campaign is an enjoyable and challenging experience that will have you plotting your path to victory in many ways, and enjoy yourself on the way there. The AI in combat is quite smart so be prepared for a challenge. I will sum up the good and bad to help you decide if the game is worth playing or not.

Good: Beautiful music & graphics
           A wide range of different units, allowing a diverse array of strategies in combat.
           End turn wait times are relatively quick compared to other total war games.
           Fully customisable multiplayer mode.
           Multiplayer uses a ranking system allowing you to gain more feats and units as you finish a battle.

Bad: Diplomacy AI is bad/unintelligent
        Load times can be an issue.
        Cavalry movement is unrealistic and doesn't obey the laws of physics. (Able to charge forward at full momentum and              stop dead in their tracks and turn the other way instantly.)
        Multiplayer is ruined by DLC units making it unfair for those who do not wish to purchase extra content.
        Morale system is stupidly broken, allowing you to rout units instantly if piling morale debuffs consecutively.

On the whole the game is great if you enjoy total war campaigns, but it can get repetitive if you play often, and you may find multiplayer enjoyable albeit a little unfair and agrravating at times. Despite this, I had a lot of fun playing multiplayer, making friends along the way. Thanks for the good times.

Problems

The Starting Positions on the Campaign map is VERY unbalanced (but i guess thats wanted as such)
The Multiplayer IS AWESOME even with a Character/General Leveling mechanic and Costumisation and Armor and Ability gain for level up BUT sadly at this point theres only view people left to play with. Though theres always someone around.
HONESTLY i really CANT think of anything really major negative that would lessen the game experience or be a reason not to buy this game...
what i mean is BUY THIS GAME i have OVER 700 hs played on this game and have ALL the games i the franchise and they are ALL abolsutly worth it. Every price that is asked really looking at the other games big companies are willing to push out at this point. For HORENDOUS prices compared to what you are given here...i only say Fallout 76. I have played 700 hours of Shogun and I STILL want to play more. And as EVERY battle is unique every Campaign a new Story. Theres really NO reason why not.
BUY this Game help the developers by BUYING all of the OTHERS! ESPECIALLY Warhammer I and II and Atilla and Three Kingdoms etc etc
Youll have 10000s of hours of gameplay and UNENDING fun and NAILBITING awesome action on the battlefield with THOUSANDS of Graphically INCREDIBLY detailed Soldiers.

It's an historical 4X title with a turn-based strategic layer, and a real time tactical battle layer that's truly a work of art.

Also, Samurai. 'Nuff said.

Things by which I favor this over others:

* Unit variety (Not too many but also not too few)

* Unit balance (with the concept of basic unit and expensive special units its easy to grasp yet hard to master. And special units are not overpowered versions basic units. Rather they all have a specialized purpose and will lose to basic units if not used correctly). 

* Setting (sengoku jidai setting is perfect to totalwar game.)

* Replayability (with the number of clans and the interesting motivations between each there is much to explore and experiment in the campaign mode. Each AI clan has their own behaviour which makes each major clan feel like an unique opponent)

* Map design (This game allows many tactical maneuvers while most other Total Wargame maps have one to two significant strategic options. Coming up with plans to conquer Kyoto and smash opposition makes you truly feel like aspiring damyo)

I could go on, but these are my main points on why this game is significantly better then any other TW. Now some day we might get something even better with newer graphics, even better AI and combat mechanics but until that day this will remain my absolute recommendation.",1577090954,1577090954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197990153786,167,3,40879,1012,37975,1602021947,,

The rock paper scissors rule still rings true between sword, spear, and bow units which provides the general with an additional challenge of how to stack their lines during battle. 

As for the aspects of growth of towns, again kudos. The dichotomy of growth between castles and farmlands forces the player to adhere to a ""somewhat"" strict building style (as opposed to building an opposing castle as quick as humanly possible) and to really keep in mind what the direct goal of their clan is at that moment in time. 

As a whole, the game immerses you in a world centuries removed. As soon as that opening cutscene begins, I know I'm no longer me: I am a Daimyo, and my people's existence in the future as a viable clan hangs in the balance with every turn that passes. And it is with that feeling that I give the highest praise to the devs. If you can create a game so immersive that it can remove the player from reality...that takes true ability and passion.

88,59942266,english,"[h1]Great TW game that gets boring after a while[/h1]
Not the game's fault tho, but the setting itself. Shogun 2 is very polished and I love how everything works. Pretty graphics, efficient performance, interesting politics, and most of all, the economy. I love how the economy is affected by so many things, making it possible to be filthy rich without having many provinces and vice versa. Also, the provinces now have specialties.

[h1]Why it gets boring[/h1]
The boring part happens during combat, and it's the setting's fault. The game has a great battle system, even better than usual, but there's not many unit variants. However that's not the main reason. The way the Japanese fought is boring. The bulk of armies are light infantry (bow and spear). The melee infantry don't use shields, so they die easily to archers. The heavier samurai don't fare much better either. There's no heavy cavalry to charge down archers too. They're all light, and thus also die easily to archers. The main melee weapons used being long spears further limit your ability to play cavalry, and cavalry is the most dynamic unit type, so not playing them removes a huge chunk of your fun.

[h1]Sieges[/h1]
This shared weakness to archers also make sieges pathetically easy for the attacker. Japanese castles don't have thick high walls like the rest of the world. Archers can literally shoot above them, obliterating the shieldless infantry inside, so sieges depend on who has more archers. Also the same with open battles, only the archers need to be protected more. The siege weapons are lame and unnecessary, because you can just storm a castle in one turn without the need to build siege engines to get over walls. This also means you no longer can break sieges with outside force.

[h1]Role play?[/h1]
I'm also not a fan of the role playing aspect of the game. You gain traits by leveling up. In Medieval 2 you gain traits depending on what you do, so you can create a terrifying general by being merciless. In Shogun 2, you need to go down a skill tree, and the intimidation skill is way below. Ironically, more role playing freedom limits role playing instead.
That being said, it's a great game while it's still new and fresh. Worth the price.",1576470029,1576470792,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198095917852,24,6,13371,0,3100,1598171447,,

99,59885481,english,"I've been playing the Total War series for as long as I can remember. My first was Total War: Shogun, back in the 90's, then Medieval, then Rome, then I took a big break from it, I ended up joining the Army, and getting deployed to Afghanistan back in 2011. I bought a gaming laptop before leaving and bought Total War: Shogun 2 to keep me entertained. My deployment was equal parts chaos and equal part boredom especially when we weren't in ""fighting season"" and the Taliban went back into Pakistan. There is nothing to do. Go on patrol, come back, lift weights, go for a run, train,  shower, eat chow, and then nothing. This game kept me occupied. I had logged many hours on it during our down times. I had watched so many movies over there, and the only thing keeping me sane was Shogun 2. It was great to see how far the series had come. So, I am a fan of the Total war series.

Sadly, my gaming laptop had busted during transport from deployment to home. I forgot about the game and years later noticed they had it for my school/work laptop (Mac) and I have to say, not what I expected. Keep in mind, it is a Mac, and they really aren't known for their gaming. So it's difficult to develop games for them (unless it's a mobile game). I didn't buy the mac for gaming, it was for developing, school, and work. It's more of a productivity computer than an entertainment computer. So, if you have a gaming PC and are into strategy, get this game. If you have a Mac, do what I did, keep the Mac for work/school/developing, etc. but do not use it for gaming, save up for a desktop gaming pc and keep the entertainment there. 

I have bought a gaming PC and I'm excited to get into the Total wars again. Especially no that there are more like Warhammer, and China. I've been waiting for China for ever. But that's my review and suggestions. Great game, just don't buy it for Mac like I did, get a gaming PC, your experience will be much better.

0,59884950,english,"You need a million fixes to get this working these days, and I can barely get it fully functional at all. I had to; Use a screen resolution fix program, a mouse cursor lock program, had to go into the scripts and turn off screen resizing ( if you don't it becomes misaligned on windowed fullscreen). I then found out the ui scale is too large and is cut off on the bottom of the screen and there is no way of resizing it on a 2550 x 1440p monitor, so I don't understand why they have a windowed fullscreen mode if it doesn't work.
Honestly this is a disgrace for a game in 2019, I understand its an older game but I shouldn't have to work this hard for a game on a professional store front. If you aren't prepared to support the game so it at least works on modern hardware, take it off the store front. They are happy to take your money though, of course they are lol. Look at all the bullshit DLC you need for the game too. The fact that they still have the audacity to sell you ""blood effects"" for £2.50 is absolutely shameful and they still do it in newer titles too. 

If you report these problems on CA forums you are met with bullshit ""we know"" responses but never any fixes years later. There is nothing worse than patronising non answers, they obviously think customers are brain dead and beyond stupid. There's nothing more insulting. 
If you really want to try this game make sure you either play it on a 1080p monitor, or play it on fullscreen mode on a higher resolution. Playing on windowed fullscreen you will need to do a million fixes, and its not worth the trouble in my opinion, and it's all for nothing if you own any screen higher than 1080p. The UI doesn't scale well and it will have to look like total dog shit, so you can see all the ui elements.
 If you want to pick this up, for the love of god buy it on a 75% off summer sale or something, I can't stress that enough.

12,59770487,english,"The turn based mixed with the real time strategy elements is as always perfectly balanced. You get to manage over your realm in turns, while fighting in real time. The fighting part is divided into battles on land and sea, and of course the sieges. The management part is fairly difficult, as you have to balance your economy to your evergrowing military might. You don't have as much variety in the troops as you're used to, but every unit has its value and both significant strenghts and weaknesses, so you have to balance your army as well. There also are 4 different types of agents that can either boost your army and settlements or weaken your enemy. Different factions with different bonuses.
Also includes 3 different religions.
In my opinion the best total war game to date, even though it has a few minor problems.

13,59766284,english,"I'll be honest, having been introduced to Total War with Rome I, and then faithfully following the series as it got more ambitious and epic with every iteration, culminating with the release of Empire: Total War, Darthmod, and the possibility of worldwide domination, going back to this comparatively microscopic campaign in feudal Japan felt like a massive step backwards. I [b] hated [/b] this game when it was released, but still bought it out of loyalty to Creative Assembly. For the first weeks, and even months, I could only play this game sporadically, I was constantly frustrated by the small campaign map, the lack of unit diversity (this game has been rightfully called 'Total War: Yari Ashigaru', or 'Yari Ashigaru Simulator'), the over-reliance rock-paper-scissors style gameplay, the massive limitations to building slots, castle upgrading, unit upgrading.

Well, it's been almost a full decade since release, and I've had about a thousand hours with it (and I'm not a massive gamer - that really is a lot for me). If you can't tell, I've become a huge fan of this game, it's delicately balanced and rewarding game design won me over. Before Shogun 2, playing Total War for me was all about the power fantasy, massing huge armies and crushing the AI, but after the release of this game, I really started to see it as a [i] proper game [/i]. I love to fail in Shogun 2. In terms of balance, pacing, challenge, AI performance and overall polish, it's my go-to in the Total War series, especially on the harder dificulty settings. Whenever I play other Total War games, or even other strategy games, I just keep coming back to this oldie. I can't help it, it's a masterpiece. I play it once every week, at the least. I can't seem to stay away from it for long. Mind you, I've not played the Warhammer or Three Kingdoms games, mostly because I don't enjoy the fantasy / mythology setting as much in Total War.

Shogun 2 indeed lacks the epic feel that the Grand Campaigns of Napoleon, Rome I & II, Medieval II and Empire had (and I suppose WH and 3K too), but more than makes up for it with the tightest campaign mechanics out there, by far - the AI is more effective because of the streamlined campaign choices, they're agressive, decisive and fast - every battle matters, every unit you can recruit, rank up and preserve, every building slot you can get access to, every agent you get and rank up, every high ranking general is crucial. More often than not, on the harder difficulty settings, one single turn wasted can be the difference between winning or losing a key battle, and also the campaign. Losing your only experienced army with that 4-star general is often a death sentence in hard, or very hard, difficulty, but you can still roleplay with your doomed clan, defend you castles to the last man against the vast experienced enemy stacks, raid their lands, make them pay as you go down. Brutal - love it. Play this game.",1576244247,1576245362,True,39,1,0.80797654390335083,3,True,False,False,76561197993686452,103,7,59902,0,57303,1597026943,,

65,16327377,english,"1 - Basic Game:

One of the best video games ever made! In the Top 10.

The single player campaign is the remake of Shogun1, but brings unquestionable and significant graphical-strategical improvements.
Compared to the previous Total War has been perfected in the diplomacy and in the relationship with other factions, in the management of agents and of your family members, as well as for the technological evolution of clans.
It fits very well in a medieval Japan ambientation and the strategy, although in my opinion less diversified than Rome (between one faction and another), is very well done and realistic.

The real strength of this total war chapter was the multiplayer, well conceived, with direct battles or 2 players campaign option and thanks to the possibility of creating a game avatar and the presence of multiplayer clans to figth with.
[b][u]After 7 years, however, the comunity is at its minimum and affected by the presence of cheaters in too many games. Plus, recently, servers were down and the avatar conquest section is dead such as the coop campaign.[/u][/b]

Some nostalgic from Shogun 1 like me, will regret the paper map of Japan on a table inside the ""command room"" and the pawns of the armies. Sometimes the simple things are the most beautiful!

2 - Fall of the Samurai expansion:

Renews the game in strategy and diplomacy. It changes historical epoch and revises the conflict in a more modern way.
Firearms, railways, trade with western countries and give a touch from ""The Last Samurai"".
This expansion want to divide the original campaign and the two historical periods taking better care of the environment and ambientation compared on what was for Shogun1 and so makes it more realistic.
The only expansion-DLC that is worth to be bougth! This version of Shogun 2 is the one I prefered in the multiplayer section.

You will be into the civil war between Shogunate and the Emperor factions. You will have to choose which way to stay with and whether to prefer the old way following the shogunate or if you will follow the emperor; alternatively you can iven try to declare your independence.
The presence of firearms obviously brings a very similar strategy to what we saw in Empires, but more dynamic and engaging thanks to the combination of range and melee units, managing to give a fair balance.
Strategy and landscape will have a great importance.

For the land battles there was the possibility in the multiplayer to play the two mixed versions and being able to compare the armies and the strategies of the two historical periods. It is not said that the armies with firearms will be the ones that will win.

Rating: 8.5 / 10 (with multiplayer was a 9.5/10)
Some annoying multiplayer bugs. Too many cheaters in multiplayer mode.
To much DLC's clan pack. Servers were down for long time and so not aviable for the multiplayer.
Under the sales yuo will find the basic game plus the dlc fots at 15 euro. In my opinion to much with out the multiplayer.

94,11160140,english,"So coming back after posting my initial review which was about 50 hours game time, and now I've got a couple notches on my belt and a lot new releases of total war, I can say without a doubt this game is probably one of the best I've ever had the chance to play. 
    Total War Shogun 2 is an outstanding game that doesn't clobber you with the min maxing of the towns as the other games do, it's simple precise and forgiving if you mess up. Research isn't a real big hassle at all, it's also simple two trees, one is for fighting and the other is for civil upgrades and agent abilities, basically building passives and money. The game play is what you would expect in a total war game not going to go too much into it, but the units themselves are excellent. The variety isn't as intense as the other games though like Warhammer, but it gives you enough to play around with, including the special clan units and especially when you play Fall of the Samurai. Boat combat is technically simple, either burn the ships, board the ships, or kill all the people, it gets more fun in Fall though as you get cannon ships and torpedo ships.Trading is really a small trade boost, but grading the rare ports are usually a MUST for the money they rake in. Including Mods they usually make the game way more fun, as do mods do. Some mods may fix niches and make the game more challenging as the game itself can be a little easy. 
    Overall coming back to this game made me reevaluate how well this game was. It had great content and great game play and still can hold up when compared to some of the newer total wars. It's a game that I can play endlessly time and time again as I had done so without the feeling of boredom or unfairness as other games.

Parts I enjoy - Unlike some games, I have a chance to win seemingly hopeless battles by using superior tactics and terrain, diplomacy is relatively streamlined - no need for annoying messenger units, and the other game systems work well and are balanced (economy, espionage, research, etc.). 

Parts I didn't enjoy - The naval combat felt more like a chore, but that may be more my preference. Siege battles were a joke - the AI is so bad. I once had a massive AI army destroy itself on one of my barely defended towns as their leader and heir dismounted and attempted to scale my walls. They both died and the other units scattered easily to be cut down by a couple of light cavalry. It was a massacre. I feel like I'm cheating whenever I play out siege battles and I usually try to fight outside, or I autoresolve.

A great game has a great beginning, it starts you off in a beautiful cinematic of two samurai dueling, then after a betrayal an all out war starts, giving you a taste of the warfare to come.
It's your typical Total War game, you pick a faction, build up your army and cities and survive for as long as possible or conquer everything, battles are intense too as you have people climbing castles, falling off, firing hundreds of volleys of arrows or bullets at each other and burning castles, it's classic TW fun.
The only real issue here is that the AI can be dumb at times, going through all sorts of complicated loops in order to exit a gate 50 feet in front of them.

A huge positive to this game is the amount of DLC you get, Rise of the Samurai and Fall are both amazing additions to the game that add their own unique stories and contributions to historical battles, Rise takes place centuries before the main game, you pick from three major clans as well as keeping your vassals loyal, and you battle it out until the new leader is decided.
Fall of the Samurai is different, taking place during the Boshin war, you can either play as a pro Shogun faction or be an Imperialist, it also gets deeper if you choose to accept aid from western countries, similar to the base game, you can recruit veterans, get guns, even get assistance from them in the way of naval help or money if you allow them to set up shop.

The final point will be historical battles, they are very well done with good cinematics to set up the theme, you play as either the historical winner or try to rewrite it through a surprise victory, such as the Ikko-Ikki surviving the castle siege that eventually destroyed their numbers, or try to rewrite the final battle of the Sengoku era and defeat Tokugawa on the battlefield.

My final rating is 9/10, dealing with some annoying bugs, this is a very beautiful game that was well made, besides the meme value from your war adviser constantly yelling at you the combat is thrilling and the geopolitics are fun to move around.",1573775632,1573775632,True,9,0,0.591872811317443848,0,True,False,False,76561198128147860,281,31,767,0,767,1573774100,,

to make it short if you want to buy this game for the campaign it worth it but only when it on discount and be Aware that there are DLC factions

92,55271324,english,"This is the Total War game that finally got me into the series. I still have a soft spot for it, even after witnessing the glory of Total War: Warhammer 2. In comparison it feels naturally clunkier, being an 8-year old game by now, and it lacks the variety and strategic options later games have. But even to this day, if a friend wants me to play this in co-op, i'll gladly take them up on the offer.

You have 12 factions to play with. Out of the 12, 3 are DLC and thus need an extra investment to gain access to. They don't differ from what they offer in terms of troops or such pretty much at all. The primary difference between them is obviously the starting location, and then what unit types they specialize in or what domestic thing they're good at. Then they have access to unique versions of their favored unit type, like Shimazu, being a Katana-specialized faction, has access to Shimazu Katana Samurai, that are stronger all-around compared to regular Katana Samurai. Later DLC's added 1-2 actual unique units to the factions, but I fail to recall if these were paid DLC's or whether they're accessible in the base game.

Campaign gameplay is instantly familiar to Total War veterans. It takes place in feudal Japan, where gunpowder is only just being introduced to the island. There's roughly 65 territories to conquer, with about 50-60 factions in total. The primary goal is to capture Kyoto at the middle of the map and hold it for a year to become a Shogun, then capture however many provinces your chosen campaign requires, ranging from half to pretty much the entire Japan. You got your generals with simple skill tree's to lead the troops, though in this game new generals are either born into your family or recruited via random events. You cannot just up and hire them from an infinitely regenerated list of faceless dudes like in say TW: Warhammer. Also as a sidenote, for anyone coming from newer games to this, you can move armies around without a general leading them, though you should not try to fight battles without a general leading the army (although if you win, this may prompt a random event to hire yourself a new general, supposedly the de-facto leader of that battle getting promoted for his martial and strategic prowess which is a nice touch).

Battles are the same as they are in other historical TW's. Every army stack can hold 20 units, and you can have other stacks reinforce each other for even more units in the field, as has been in every other game. There's not really much I can think of to say here, tbh. Its Total War, its real time strategy battles with your basic Sword and Spear infantry, Archers and either Sword or Spear cavalry, with their own rock-paper-scissor relationship to each other. Additional unit types include the siege weapons which work like before, just bombarding people with hurty things, gunpowder units that turn any other units to mince meat ESPECIALLY if they are defending a city from a wall, but get squished to fine paste if they get forced into melee by almost anything else in the game, and then there's Ninja units that throw very nasty bombs for massive damage (NOTE: The bombs, if thrown while defending from a wall, will deal damage to the wall as well and end up blowing the entire section of the wall up. Its funny at first but then you realize you just lost a mass of units to this and then it stops being funny).

If you shell out extra dough, you'll get access to two additional campaigns, Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. Rise is Shogun 2 but with more peasants and less Samurai on the field (havent played this much tbh), and Fall is much more gunpowder and much less Samurai on the field. In my experience Fall of the Samurai was fine to play through once, but it felt like the AI did not know what the heck to do with or against the gunpowder units which is bit of an issue when 75% of the game is now fought with gunpowder units.

I love the game but will absolutely agree it has issues. Shogun 2 has Naval combat in it as well now, which was touted as a key new feature that everyone should love. In actuality, in my own personal opinion, i've found the maintenance and dealing with the Navy to be an absolute pain in the ass and a definite stain in an otherwise great strategy title. The AI is absolutely relentless in harassing your ports and smol navies with it's own impossibly large fleets, and when an AI comes over to blockade your port, SURPRISE ALL OF YOUR INCOME IS NOW GONE! Yes, majority of your income will most of the time end up being via trade routes by the sea, and AI will not only know where the most valuable trade port is, it will ABSOLUTELY sneak in a single ship to blockade it at the worst of times to make sure you go bankrupt. I hate the navy gameplay in this, and do not miss it's absence in Warhammer 2 in any way.

Another big thing that i've slowly grown to be irked by is the end-game. When you either conquer Kyoto or get enough infamy in the world, an event will trigger called Realm Divide. Dread that name, because the moment Realm Divide happens, every single existing faction in the game (even your co-op ally, which is slightly amusing) gets a modifier that makes them get more and more unfriendly towards you every turn, until everyone is unified against you in war. At this point all of the diplomacy is thrown out the window, because nobody will ever make peace with you anymore, no matter how trusted allies you used to be throughout the entire game (except the co-op ally since you cannot break alliance with them). This sucks, because it greatly diminishes the importance of diplomacy throughout the entire campaign. You end up only kinda forming temporary truces with people just to buy yourself enough time to backstab them before they end up backstabbing you. I love to form alliances with factions and go through absolute hell with them side-by-side to finally grab that hard-earned victory at the end of the campaign, but that is just not a thing you can do in this game.

I completed 3 campaigns in shogun 2 and I am still very frustrated with this game.
I played Rome 1, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon, Rome 2, with no problems but this is a big dissapointment.

Your economy is really really limited, even at a relatively late stage of the game >15 provinces you can barely afford 2 full armies, the development of the cities is very slow, rising an army is also slower than in previous games.

The technology tree takes a lot of time to complete and is not particularly useful.

Your limited ability to recruit armies combined with the big size of the map makes really difficult to decide wars, you can lose 2 or 3 provinces in a row in one side of the map because you dont have enough troops to defend them and simultaneously conquer 2 or 3 provinces in a row in the other side of the map because your enemy has the same problem too.

I have the impression that the terrain is strange too, in previous game most of the battles were in open terrain, now looks like every battle has a lot of hills and trees in the middle of the field.

45,54702277,english,"I just played my first play through of Shogun 2 where I conquered all of Japan and it was really fun. I admit that when Empire first released in its buggy state, I uninstalled it, threw it away and ignored Napoleon and Shogun 2 when they were released. Years later I bought Shogun 2 when it was 75% discounted, but couldn't motivate myself to play it since medieval Japan didn't interest me and I was used to playing Medieval 2 Total War and RTW2. 
I had just finished a play through of Attila which I found disappointed and uninstalled it, when I then decided to install this game and give it a try.  
It's a very well made game and it even made me wonder what happened with Rome Total War 2 since this game seemed to have so much more to it. There are little cinematics for all kinds of things. When a unit type is created for the first time, a cinematic shows them and explains what they do, when you assassinate targets using ninjas, there are more cinematics for them.
The battles are actually pretty and I like seeing the battlemap, whereas in the other games I had started to view manual battles as a chore and would usually auto resolve them. 
What else can I say....
I had heard Realm Divide and was under the impression that ALL factions would declare war on you once you hit realm divide, but it wasn't true and two factions, the Shoni and Chokosabe stayed allied to me the entire game, even after having -200 reputation with them from realm divide. This is likely because my faction (Shimazu) and they were Christian while we were at war with three Buddhist factions.
The only glitch I saw at times were the cannon ships that would at times attempt to go towards an enemy ship instead of just firing at them. 
I'm certainly going to have other play throughs as other factions and will try Fall of the Samurai soon enough, but after playing this, I understand why it's one of the or even the highest rated Total War games out there.",1566235160,1566235160,True,5,0,0.575944483280181885,0,True,False,False,76561198093777167,21,6,5187,0,1811,1580849361,,

57,54636818,english,"(English is not my native language so there may be some mistakes and misspellings).This is by far one of the best CA's games, im fascinated with japanese culture and traditions, sengoku era is my most beloved one due to the heroic times where samurai would pay with their own life just to save their honour. This game gives you this feeling of power, when you lead your army of samurai men to battle you feel like each and every one of them ready to give their life for you. Battles are really atmospheric, its almost like youre there commanding your men on the frontline, i would definitely recommend this piece of art to everyone who has some interest in medieval strategy games. Yet there are some buggs and things that are really annoying, for example when you shoot your cannon and it hits that tiny-itty-bitty tree, that could be torn appart with a single stroke of a sword, but this piece of wood easily stops your cannonball, another thing to mention is how stupid AI sometimes act, seriously, even on Legendary difficulty they blindly go at you, no strategy, just straightforward all-out fight. And the most annoying is unit controlling, when they choose the fastest but the most dangerous way, i had a fight in a city and my katana unit decided not to go around the house as i told them to, but to walk through the cavalry unit that was around the corner of the said house, those moments are the most annoying. But enough for bad things, the game is really good, it feels satisfying to play it even with these dumb buggs and undeveloped AI. TWS2 is not just good, its a great piece of art that still needs improvement, thankfully there are mods that make your gameplay experience better, but its not enough, unfortunately, we need an official bugg fixing patch, and with all that said, im gonna end it here.

81,54399162,english,"Wonderful game, I genuinely enjoy it.

The gui is one of the best of the series. It's clean, and simple. No flashy graphics, but it still remains beautiful.

The music is very aesthetically pleasing. I often find myself humming along to Cherry Blossom.

The action is the best in the series. It is clean and simple, but with room for advanced maneuvers and tactics (such as positioning matchlock soldiers in rows on hills to increase the amount of lead being fired down field.) The horses tend to be a bit... weird for me. They'll go do whatever the hell they want, regardless of order or stance.

The naval battles: Still wack. It's better than Empire and Rome 2, but still really shit. The AI rarely ever misses a volley on my ships (in FotS). The AI ships also rarely retreat. Meanwhile, the moment one of my crew trips over a bucket, I'm down to just a gunboat even if I outnumber the enemy.

The campaign map is fairly solid. It's gorgeous, and the layout of the roads and towns leads to some great ambush potential.

My only gripe is the AI. It goes from really stupid to Big Brain Time randomly. The harder difficulties only increase in difficulty by literally boosting the damage, economy, and attributes of the enemy which is pretty cheap. It's fine if you can overlook that aspect, but it feels like if I lose, it's far beyond my control so what's really the point? One false move and you can lose in two turns within a year.

Give me more control of the terrain selection for battles.. Let me pick my Ambush location..let me select where I build the small strongholds.  Let me promote my other Generals from the ranks, so I make my Generals, loyalty based on service and time,.. bigger maps, these things add depth to a wonderful game, but these changes would also lend a level of depth that would bring players back over and over again..

84,54366202,english,"So, great game; had a lot of fun, but I'm giving a no to recommending due to a few things I found really annoying and silly.

Naval fights and everything about them, pretty much anything to do with ships is awful. The AI spamming 100, one ship navies around the map to raid your trade and blockade ports 50 times each turn is just stupid. As if I am going to spend 30 mins going after all these one ship navies so that they can simply retreat and do it all over again next turn, they will also retreat into deep sea forcing you to go there as well to finish them. Ship battles are extremely boring and tedious and clunky, you will want to auto-resolve most of them, however; the calculations for the outcome of auto-resolving ship battles are stupid. You will always lose ships/have heavy losses to ships even when you have an EXTREME advantage, you then need to send your navy all the way home to replenish it, no auto-replenish for navies.
 
In Rise of the Samurai, the prices for the abilities of agents is absolutely ludicrous. I beat Shogun 2 and RotS on Legendary, not once will you be using agents abilities, they are far too stupidly expensive.

The last big problem I noticed in RotS is needing agents to sit in all the cities you take to convert their allegiance, also tedious, annoying, time consuming and stupid. Without an agent in a freshly taken city you will need an ENTIRE army to stay garrisoned in said city for SEVERAL turns to keep control of the city.

Anyway, other than that; I still enjoyed the game a lot. These things I've explained are just bad enough to ruin the whole experience.

87,28928820,english,"For the uninitiated, Total War is a series of hybrid strategy games where you control a faction in some part of the world and end up going to war with most, if not all, of your neighbors as you vie for power. This is done by building stuff in your cities, and moving armies around the strategic map - you fight other armies in the real-time battle mode.

Shogun 2 is one of the best Total War games overall. I'm not even sure what else I can say about it that hasn't been said a million times - the setting is realized almost perfectly, it looks absolutely great, the music is ear porn, multiplayer is the most involved in the series by far, the campaign map is a marvel of balance (remarkable because it's literally just Japan's mountain passes making the AI maneuver its armies decently), and there's a ton of replay value.

Well, okay, most Total War games have some sort of replay value. Shogun 2 stands out from them by having a believable method of total map domination, because you're not conquering entire continents like in other TW games: you're conquering most of Japan, which was a thing that Tokugawa Ieyasu actually historically did.

There's an achievement for reaching the #1 multiplayer ranking, and multiplayer isn't exactly a spring chicken after all these years, so if you're an achievement-oriented person you should give that a think.

+ interesting era to play in

+ good variety between clans

+ much more in depth since it covers only 1 country (unlike for example Medieval 2 Total War where it covers whole Europe and parts of Africa, Asia and America)

+ great DLCs

+ agents are fun, work like rock paper scissors for each other.

+ ""talent"" trees are actually fun and impactful

+ Avatar conquest was very good multiplayer mode

+ very strategical map - you have many options to block roads, ambush your enemies, raid their properties, sabotage their armies and much much more

+ smaller map actually benefits the game - if you know the terrain you can outplay your opponent with ease

+ ingame encyklopedia is very detailed and very useful

+ diplomacy in this game actually makes sense most of the time

+ Realm divide provides challenge in late game

+ introduction of guns makes a difference

+ can be very challenging 

+ memes

- Yari Wall is OP

- Naval combat is clunky

- some clans are a lot better than others

- I dont like that enemy units can climb walls by themselves, making gates kind of obsolete

- siege units suck (mangonel, cannons are both useless units)

- AI will never go through the heavily forrested areas on map (there are like 4-5 on the map but they will never go through them)

- AI army compositions make no sense 

- Once you understand the game you can cheese it pretty hard

- still not very well optimized (for example if you turn fire arrows on all your units on it will tank your FPS like - 40 or more)

-+ If your daimyo is to became Shogun, military leader of all Japan ....

94,45646136,english,"Let me start by saying that I love the Total War series. I also love Japanese culture and history. This unoptimized trash doesn't do either justice. In fact, Total War: Shogun 2 is literally the worst game in the entire franchise. Hard to believe? Let me convince you.

1) Shogun 2 is completely unoptimized. It struggles on 4K displays, stutters when ""too many"" units are on the screen at the same time, etc. Also, its lighting effects are uglier than Total War: Napoleon's, which came out beforehand.

2) The game suffers from horrendous AI and an incredible number of bugs. Bugs have always been a problem for the series, but they seem to be at their worst here.

3) It's unbalanced. Certain units are WAY too overpowered in this game. A single set of light cavalry, for instance, was able to stand an entire battle against my general, mounted katana cavalry, and two yari ashigaru units. Are you kidding me? In a game like Total War: Napoleon, you can turn the tide of a battle with good tactics, even if you're vastly outnumbered. Here, the game is more dependent on unit types and dice rolls. Give me a break.

4) More on the unbalancing issue - certain clans are doomed for failure. As the Mori clan, I had five clans declare war on me for no reason. Trying to give gifts or forge alliances was impossible, as was ending the wars. As the Shimazu clan, however, I steamrolled over the entire island. This is terrible game design.

5) The music is lacklustre. Honestly, the music has hit an all-time low for the entire series.

6) The game lacks the wealth of content compared to previous entries in the series. Seriously, one or two campaigns are enough to experience everything in the game.

7) Overpriced garbage DLC. Seriously, you're going to make me pay for blood and a handful of unit types? Your greed knows no bounds, Creative Assembly.

3,54185938,english,"No matter how fun this game is there is no denying that this is an obtuse, bloated mess of a product.

Loading times.
From its launch years ago I have gone through maybe six or seven computers and in that time not a single one of them have ever left me satisfied at this game horrendous load times, from starting the game which can take upwards to five minutes to loading save files which can seemingly take ages.

Overworld.
Much of the game is rigid to the point of tiresome and allows seemingly no flexibility in development with the only viable meta being developing farms and moneymaking buildings then slogging forward and claiming new territories  and repeating ad-infinitum so you'll waste nearly half the game building infrastructure and not even playing the parts the game was designed around.

Combat.
The combat is clunky and unwieldy with the computer A.I able to move perfectly and micromanage in such a way that makes it frustrating to fight against made even more so when commanding units becomes a finicky and tedious leaving the only viable option as bum rushing with cheap expendable units.

Redundant and useless units.
Artillery units are bordering on useless in near on 90% of the matches and are completely useless until leveled sufficiently making them an expensive waste of resources.

Gun units unless you are Otomo take 4 turns to produce, can't shoot over units and only have two-thirds the range of archers,  and are only really useful defending which can just be filled by cheaper more useful units, add into the fact that half the time the gunners will seemingly ignore charging enemies because of an invisible dip or bump in the land making any effective use of the gun pointless.

Late game units are also almost pointless to own or use as by the time you have them you either don't need them as you've claimed half or more of the map or you've lost so hard and are against such overwhelming odds that a couple overpriced late game units just get swamped by cheap cannon fodder, this can also be doubly true for cavalry as the cheapest starting unit can counter and swarm something that cost upwards of five time the price and 3-4 turns to make.

Computer opponents.
The A.I cheats and is often not subtle about it, in my time playing this game I've came across several glaring occasions when it is particularly noteworthy.
-Five turns into a game and the computer having a stack of twelve units, the lowest experience of them being level 4 and some being level 6.
-An opponent with only a single territory who after declaring war manages to build an army of 14 stacks from being only two units the previous turn.
the Auto-resolve battle function somehow deciding that my army consisting of two generals, four Yari samurai, six Shimazu Katana samurai with superior weapons and armour and four bow ashigaru would suffer a crippling defeat against a single Yari ashigaru and bow ashigaru, to put into perspective when I auto-resolved I lost nearly half my forces and my Daimyo but when I commanded myself I lost less then five soldiers.

Once your plan is in motion you execute it by moving your forces to conquer territory with the option of commanding up to thousands of units at a time on the battlefield, putting them in formation and carrying out your battle plans such as weak centre into envelopment or hammer and anvil.

Each turn will take careful planning and you must think about the possible repercussions of your moves such as being ambushed while moving an army through a forest, being attacked on an undefended section of your territory, uprising from disgruntled citizens within your provinces, allies turning to enemies or the loss of a key province with all your important buildings. There's a lot of think about each turn which makes each gaming session so rewarding when your plans fall into motion and become successful.

12,54083476,english,"A great strategy game that is a mix of turn-based and RTS gameplay, with more emphasis on the later.

The ""Overworld"" shows the full world map and is turn-based. Manage cities, tax rates, citizen happiness, army recruitment, research, etc. This is also where general army movement is done, combining and moving units from one general area to another. When your forces enter the area of an enemy or vice versa, you get taken to a battle map and the RTS parts of the game kick in. (You can also auto-resolve battles if you don't want to). The turn-based actions are very streamlined compared to, say, Civilization, as all of these mechanics are less complicated across the board. There are only two campaign scenarios available in this version, the base game and Rise of the Samurai. While you can play as different clans, the object of each scenario is always the same. In the base game you control one of several factions, trying to gain control of your local region and Kyoto. Rise of the Samurai is different, has more focus on diplomacy, and I don't really know what I'm doing there.

Total War (as a series) has, in my mind, the best RTS mechanics availalbe. There are no reasources to manage as you do all of that on the overworld. There are no build orders or unit recruitment, because again, you do that on the overworld. All the focus is on the units and how they are positioned. Futhermore (and this is most important to me) you can actually set up proper battle lines for your army instead of having a sloppy clump of space marines or a single file line of zerglings when you order a unit to go someplace. These factors combine to create an RTS that is actually intuitively combat focused instead of grindy attrition where placing a building 10 seconds late could doom you entirely. Unfortunately, the campaign's battle maps are largely the same: spare scatterings of trees and hills for field battles, or a simple single wall fort. There are ways to upgrade fort walls, but most likely you aren't going to be fighting many battles there. The units, however, are quite diverse. Besides simple bow, spear, and calvary units, there are also a wide variety of specialty units including siege weapons, bow calvary, fire arrows, bomb throwers, ninjas, No-Dachi infantry (which is VERY good at charging downhill but is terrible at defending), all at different technology levels and training. 

There are also Historical Battles, which do not have a campaign map but instead focus on amazing RTS scenarios. They feature a lot larger units, incredibly more detailed battle maps, and more varried objectives. If the RTS battles in the campaign mode were this good I probably wouldn't play anything else for the next month. 

While I can't compare this to previous Total War games, I have heard that the AI is smarter in this version. I personally haven't had any problems. 

NOTE: FALL OF THE SAMURAI IS NOT INCLUDED. IT HAS ITS OWN STEAM PAGE AND NEEDS TO BE PURCHACED SEPARATELY, EVEN IF YOU BOUGHT THE BUNDLE.

Some cards tend to stick, though: I can recall Shimazu Takahisa's portrait very easily, for instance - but this is nothing like the afterimages you get in games with repeating views. This means you can play as much as I have and not go crazy (much).
-there are actual strategic possibilities, and the game is interesting enough even if you play it at a level that gives you some edge over the AI.
-the game has not been dumbed down anywhere that I see. This is rare indeed.
-the idea that the game deals with one era only certifies that there can be no such problems as the CIV series has - there you might battle helicopters with catapults, which makes me sprain my jaw.
-turn based strategy with real time battles is definitely the way to go, and TW games have that. No unnecessary stress.

(Here there was a bit where I compare Total War Napoleon with Shogun 2. I think Shogun 2 is simply better. Smoother gameplay, somehow. More believable for some reason. Also better than Empire, or Medieval 2. What's keeping Medieval 3? I hope they'll make it soon!)

What else? Battles are entertaining, the character development system is good, overall a very good game with a lot of strategic possibilities.

The idea of mods is a good one, but most of them (the way I read the descriptions) just change the rules. What's the point of that? The rules are good now. If a professional studio with quite a few good games to their credit has cooked them up, what would make me believe I can come up with better ones?

Just bought Fall of the Samurai, by the way. Seems pretty good: there's even better feel of historical accuracy than in Shogun 2 main game.

All in all, I would give this game points according to the Shimazu loyalty scale: 9 out of 6.

Oops. The diplomacy mechanics get really pointless in Fall of the Samurai, hard setting. The only minus - I guess there has to be one.",1422626115,1563035285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068851657,16,29,221596,0,168480,1597607356,,

23,54011878,english,"To me, this is the best installment of the franchise to this day. First of all, the map is a nice change to the (mostly) Europe-dominated maps of the previous Total War games which in itself comes with many other diversions from what we had been used to. The feudal era in Japan during the Sengoku Jidai period although not fundamentally different from its European counterpart, has key differences  which are very accurately depicted in the game. During that period, the Land of the Rising Sun was scourged with distrust, unrest and constant fighting amongst the rival Daimyos, and this game provides just that. You cannot just rely on brute strength anymore to conquer them all. Diplomacy is your strongest weapon in the beginning, agents carry you through the late stages of your campaign and without these two your chances of achieving victory are severely hampered. This fact, along with the Realm Divide event (a.k.a. everyone hates you and wants to kill you because you are very strong) makes me believe that the developers actually put a lot of effort in making the game more challenging, even in easy difficulty, while making the way in which the game becomes challenging as historically accurate as possible and finally, it shows me that they wanted to deviate from the norm of ""Make doomstacks, kill everything"". No. In Shogun 2, stacks mean nothing if they are not supported by agents, or if diplomacy fails you and you are getting attacked from everywhere. Meanwhile, from the aesthetic point of view, the game looks and sounds beautiful, (as beautiful as war may ever look and sound but you get the point) once again depicting all aspects of 16th century Japan to the highest possible degree, and even though unit pools might be small and a bit repetitive, unique faction traits ensure that you will have a wide variety of possible armies to field, depending on your clan's strengths. I definitely recommend this game to any fan of the franchise.",1562760399,1562760399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035374437,4,1,1977,0,1292,1579196835,,

77,15772503,english,"Shogun 2 and its expansion Fall of the samurai is so far the best Total war game and one of the best strategy games of all time. Great Avatar conquest system in multiplayer. Nothing similar created in other TW games. All those faction systems are not even a bit as deep as  Avatar conquest in Shogun 2. Veterans, skills, creation of your personal army. Nothing can compare with this. Yes it is really rough to new players. But if you have enough patience eventually you will enjoy Avatar conquest like nothing else before. The main negative feature of multiplayer of Shogun 2 in my humble opinion is that CA don't give a damn about this game any more and so they don't put any effort to it to make it better, they don't patch the game. Nothing. As for single player I find it really good as well. As far as I remember it is the first game where food system was implemened. So you get not just money but also food as the resource you always need to check and watch thoroughly. Also I really like coalition system as you grow strong and everyone else are turning against you even your vassals and allies. This feature makes you plan your strategy really caferully trying not to overextend too much. And that's great because for example in Rome 2 you just pierce through your enemies like a knife through butter and no one can stop you in the late game at all, so in the mid game you simply lose interest to game process because of no challenge what so ever.

81,41662221,english,"A truly challenging but thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience. Total War: Shogun 2 has you take control of a clan in feudal Japan as you battle for domination to become the 'shogun'. This is an excellent addition to the Total War franchise.

In feudal Japan, pick your clan and begin your campaign to triumph over all enemies. The turn-based strategy portions of the game have you focus on diplomacy and military movement while the real-time strategy style is reserved for the combat. The combat is fantastic both at land and at sea. The naval combat is certainly easier to learn than in Empire: Total War but I would not necessarily say it was better. The game is very, very difficult so expect to be outwitted and overpowered by the other clans if you are not careful. I found the whole game to be punishingly difficult at times at that was even on the low difficulty settings. The graphics in the game are absolutely brilliant and the environments look alive. The sound is excellent too and really gives it an authentic Japanese feel.

Total War: Shogun 2 is a terrific game that I definitely recommend to strategy game fans and anybody that likes history. Personally, I still like Empire: Total War more due to the setting but the gameplay in both is spectacular. I would have maybe made the lower difficulties easier because I think the game has a very steep learning curve for the turn-based elements. I only have the base game at the minute but will probably get Fall of the Samurai at some point so I will review that separately.

NOTE: If you do not have a high-spec machine, you may be locked out of accessing high graphics settings. You have to correct some hidden files on your computer to allow you to select high graphics settings.

or when my samurai retainers needs to hold a door to make sure no one comes in and steal my hentai collection while in the opposite side of the wall some cavalry was forced to disembark the horse and hold a door with blinking dicks on top of them. God damn those moments is tense.

The DLC factions are very much worth it when on sale, in my opinion. I generally haven't bought them outside them, as I've had enough to do with the factions I had before a sale rolled around. Their new styles or mechanics (the Ikko Ikki are a unique religion and can expand outside of fighting a war with their monks, but are hated by much of Japan, the Otomo are Christian at the start, and already have the penultimate foreign trade port, and almost all Hattori units are unique, having vanguard deployment and can sneak around easier) are all interesting enough to warrant a buck fifty on a sale.

42,52766984,english,"Total War : Shogun 2, is in my own opinion one of the best total war games that i have ever played, while I've only played Attila, Warhammer 1 and 2, Empires, and a bit of Medieval (during my childhood) this total war game gives me a feeling which none of these other, ""TW"" games can produce. 

* I have bought almost all of the, ""DLC"" for Shogun 2, however it is not needed to enjoy the game, but if i were to state one must have, ""DLC"" it would be fall of the samurai (which can also be played without the base game) because of how it welds 2 different styles of gameplay together while keeping base-game core mechanics the same, and increasing general enjoyment.  

Pros
- Great combat, which in addition pulls you into the battlefield, making you the player feel like a commanding officer, just like a  general in command of thousands of warriors. While the other, ""TW"" games have this quality, Shogun 2 is simply at the very top of this category, in my opinion other, ""TW"" games feel, ""light"" in contrast to Shogun 2.

- The levels, upgrades, or tier of units does not determine how strong an army is, to clarify you the quality of units does not determine the outcome of a battle, the way a player uses a unit whether it's good or bad determines the winner. The perfect example for this pro would be the Yari Ashigaru (The first and most basic units you get) could beat any or most cavalry units, samurai units, etc if used right, but could easily still get there ass handed to them if used normally.

- The graphics, pretty good even by today's standards for a game published in 2011.

- A personal preference for me would be map size it does not feel overwhelming to new players and is easy to understand where you need to go, what you need to do, or instantly find action, while some may not like how small the shogun 2 map is or the fact the European powers are pretty much non-existent, I believe it emphasizes combat while not detracting from a, ""TW"" game would be. 

- This game just like it's predecessors, but unlike some of it's successors makes you take risks when constructing buildings in the grand campaign, (More prevalent in the fall of the samurai DLC) i say this is a pro as it puts more weight or value onto the buildings rather than providing positive modifiers for essentially nothing. (I'm looking at you Warhammer)

Cons
- Path finding, this is a problem which you'll face in many other, ""TW"" games and RTS games but it's still a problem nonetheless, This is seen in either siege battles or in large land battles, what will commonly be seen would be units stopping for long periods of time for no reason, running single file through gates, and not knowing where to go inside a fort. (Post edit: sometimes AI ships may ram into walls and do nothing)

- (Personal issue) There is a LONG and i do mean LONG loading time to enter into the game itself, this may not be the games fault and may be due to my own hardware given that i use a HDD to load up this game rather than an SSD.

- (Issue which some users may face) The avatar conquest screen has been known for crashing to some users, after varying periods of time in the main conquest map, after moving your board piece several times, or clicking onto too many menu screens the game may crash for no apparent reason. (Avatar Conquest is essentially the pvp or combat focused multiplayer mode)

- The naval battles are super boring due to it's slow nature and controls which provide a feeling of nothing, as you feel so far away from the actual battle.

- (DLC related con) line infantry from fall of the samurai, cant move when firing by rank while matchlocks with the same ability can, i believe that both should be able to move while these abilities are active, but temporarily disabling the ranked fire until the units destination is reached. (This is a very minor and possibly personal issue) +DLC for clans which have minimal difference to other clans is just plain scummy.

-Verdict-
This game maybe slow to people who play MOBA's or FPS games, etc.... But i believe that if you like RTS without unit creation on the battlefield with only pure unit control and strategy (basically if you like a strategy game) this is probably a game which you should buy as it provides that umpth you want in the battlefield with minimal compromise and some of the best unit balance in the Total War line-up.

Easy to learn, hard to master. Spears stop Cavalry, a good Cavalry charge stops sword infantry, and swords beat spears. A lot of simple concepts and rules, but added together turn this into something amazing, which is why the multiplayer lobbies still host a fair number of players even after all this time. In fact, it's multiplayer where the ""Sun Tzu"" elements really shine, and no amount of single player can match the feeling of triumph after besting a strong opponent after a string of defeats.

I would definitely recommend both the base game, and its DLC ""Fall of the Samurai"" for Total War and strategy junkies everywhere.

8,52367607,english,"Total War is a series I have a love/hate relationship for. On one hand, the games are insanely addicting, encapsulating, and memorable. On the other hand, sometimes they can be infuriatingly frustrating, with cheating AI, and worst of all: The design team, Creative Assembly, are horrible with both pricing and especially with DLC pay walls. Even more so since they merged with Sega. Something about Japanese game companies, I swear, they NEVER lower their prices and they hate putting products on sale. Hell, Rome 2 is still $60 full price, a game that came out in 2013. No one else gets away with that sh*t.

Anyway, what does all that have to do with Shogun 2? Well, I think it was the last Total War game where the price point, total DLC, and core gameplay meet a perfect ratio or value. This makes Shogun 2 the PERFECT entrypoint in the series, with the more classic town development system, yet control and battle mechanics that aren't as dated as some of the older games. That, and to be honest, the Japanese setting is just cool.

So, what is Total War? It's a series that is half political/economic/military development and management sim, set in a turn based gamemode (think Civilization), with the battles taking place in real time where you manage armies that number in the thousands (think Age of Empires or StarCraft). The two modes complement each other extremely well, and you get some of the most immersive, epic (in terms of campaign length), and demanding hardcore strategy you can possibly get (Sorry, the Paradox games like Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings is just too slow and overly complex.)

The core gameplay takes place during the 16th and 17th century during the Waring States period of Japan, where you will rely on peasant armies with some samurai backup. My favorite thing to do though is to deal with the Portuguese and Dutch, convert to Christianity, manufacture guns and artillery, and have the entire country collectively hate me. The goal is to let the existing, declining Ashikaga Shogunate know that they suck and to take their place, all the while proving to the other clans that you deserve to be Shogun and they don't, and if they have a problem with it, then they can step up and die in a losing battle. Awesome game.

The 2 DLC packs take place during the 11th and 12th century in the Genpei War, and the 19th century during the Boshin War, respectively. That means that in the Genpei War one you have little in the way of an effective military and have to rely more on political control, coercion, and manipulation (it's the weaker of the two. Still interesting, just strange and different), and in the Boshin War DLC, you'll have to rely heavily on switching up to rifle line warfare with artillery back up and strong navies, unless of course you want to stay more traditional, and prove that you can shrug off the west's influence without relying on the west's technical modernity and culture. Honestly, from what I can tell, most people prefer Fall of the Samurai to the maingame, even. It is pretty cool, I'd say I like both equally.

Anyway, it's probably one of my favorite PC games of all time, definitely in my top 10. I played even more hours before I got a Steam copy back when the game was new and I was living out of the country. I'd say all in all, I've probably put in around 350, maybe even 400 hours into this game, making it the most time I've put into any game ever. Now THAT is a recommendation.

Protip: If you really think the AI is that weak-sauce, get the Darthmod.

34,52180452,english,"So I went back and have been playing a little bit more Shogun 2 recently and realised I haven't done a review yet.

In comparison to most of the other Total War games , I'll say that Shogun 2 stands out as one of Creative Assembly's best titles, historical or fantasy. The game allows you to take up the helm of one of the warring clans of feudal Japan, vying for ultimate power to become Shogun and have your dynasty rule the country.

The game is still beautiful after many years of being released, down to the unique Japanese style of the art, the haunting music (Jeff Van Dyck was composer, enough said), and the clean/minimalist UI. The immersion of Shogun 2 really captures the feel of the Sengoku Jidai period and reminded me of one of my childhood favourites, Nobunaga's Ambition on NES/SNES. 

Due to the game being limited to Japan, there is a distinct lack of diversity with units and clans. Most of the time, the game play of each clan ends up being similar to any other. Sure, there are bonuses to each daimyo's clan but they are mostly unnoticeable. The beginning of the game seems to set the pace to a much slower Total War experience, with the ease of gobbling up your neighbours. This is when the real game begins. All of your work to establish alliances and creep your eventful way toward Kyoto is rewarded with Realm Divide. This is where the entire country is thrown against you by the Shogun in a last ditch attempt to keep your butt from ruling. Within turns, every last clan will declare war on you and throw themselves against you. Total War.

Multiplayer nowadays is mostly limited to coop. There was a unique and interesting avatar system for playing multiplayer battles but that has mostly dried up now. Still, playing with a friend in Total War is always enjoyable.

Shogun 2, has some other limitations. It has a very weak diplomacy system with very limited options. Once realm divide happens, throw it out the window completely. 

Sieges are very basic. The castles of 16th century Japan weren't like the much large European ones of the similar time. As a result, most of the ""sieges"" boil down to swarms of soldiers crawling up the sides of the walls and swamping the defenders. Both sides peppering each other with arrows. Not much strategy there.

Naval battles were an improvement in some ways over Empire, but the time period in Japan did have a rather limited array of options for navies. After a few naval battles, you might find yourself just autoresolving them.


Overall, the game is still very enjoyable. My ranking below:

Graphics: 8.5/10
Gameplay: 8.5/10
Sound: 9.5/10
Replayability: 9/10
DLC: 8.5/10

Overall: 88/100

A must buy for Total War historical fans. Even if you're unsure of the time period, the streamlined and less sprawling game will enchant you for many hours. The 300+ hours I have already enjoyed are definitely well spent.

35,52176689,english,"Very fun game, more so if you have friends to play with in multiplayer sessions (Land/Sea/Siege battles), the game itself holds the basics of the art of war, where terrain (if you are on top of a hill this will affect the course of the battle and fatigue of troops), climate (rain, fog, snow can demoralize troops), and other tactics (flaming arrows, rifles, cannons, general's proximity & ability) that involve morale boost or demoralizing an army, will influence the odds of every battle. Sure DLC's do help starting players especially in Multiplayer, but even so after a few levels, there are always means to an end, and even losing battles grants you XP for your Avatar Conquest of your general (skills, bonuses, and cosmetics) and/or Veteran Units (with their own skills tree) that are created from basic units.

67,51616422,english,"[h1] Why have I delayed a review for this game? [/h1]

The most out of the box polished Total War to date. User interface, music, game mechanics, and more importantly, challenge. It all blends well into this game. 

The Expansion Fall of the Samurai offers even more substantial content if you're someone who enjoys the musket period transition into rifles as I do. A conflict of tradition and modern ideas arises in Japan with this expansion which introduces new challenges. 

Rise of the Samurai is interesting as well, but it is not for most people as it relies more on campaign diplomacy and different approach to overall strategy. 

Most people complain about unit variety in Shogun 2, but I think the unit variety present is just enough in both the base game and the major FOTS expansion as it gives enough tactical fidelity without it being convoluted with units. There are other total wars for that. 

[h1] Neutral: [/h1]

Lots of siege battles. Personally, it's fine and I find myself fighting both land and sieges willingly. 

Naval Combat in base game is interesting for me but for many it's boring as they were fighting platforms on water essentially. 
FOTS has some of the best Naval battles however. 

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

As with all Total Wars, AI can make some questionable decisions on the battle map. However, this Total War offers one of the most interesting and challenging out of the box. It is up to the individual to limit the cheese factor against it when discovering its weaknesses or choose to exploit it. 

Some minor bugs but offers the most polish compared to other Total Wars

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]

As with any of the Total Wars, you should base your decision on which Time period you are interested in the most. These are not historically accurate games but instead give you the ""atmosphere"" of the time. Go into that mindset and feel the times from there. Learn from other sources. ;) Use these games and enjoy them slowly and you will be rewarded with immersion. Even buggy titles like Empire Total War are still great in my opinion because they offer excitement, strategy, and tactics in Civ-like one more turn format. Shogun 2 and the expansions is my favorite Total War followed by Medieval II and Rome I. To me, Shogun 2 is where Creative Assembly came together and went back to its roots and understood itself best. The newer Titles, (Rome 2 and onward) cannot keep me interested with the uninteresting mechanics. (Example, Tech in Shogun 2 is rewarding and interesting while in the newer titles most bonuses are superficial stuff such as ""+10% melee defense"") 

P.S. I wanted this review to be more detailed and objective as possible. In time, I might come back to achieve this. As of right now and due to time limitations, this is mostly my biased viewpoint and my own opinion on this title and the series as a whole.

Where as other total war games can make the management of settlements tricky, here it is well designed and simple allowing you to focus on the battles which play out very different from the other TW games. This is mainly because the ai engage eachother directly in sword fights instead of just taking it in turns hacking. This can make for a great spectacle as you watch a single samurai cut down man after man.

The biggest flaw is how the campaign is time restricted in a way that forces you to rush rather than play it in your own time. I had to constantly take over new cities to make it just in time.

The DLC for the game are worth the money in my opinion. Fall of the samurai is my favorite. The multiplayer is also awesome although it’s hard to find opponents that are more your level due to the game being almost 10 years old. Due to that reason I suggest playing multiplayer campaigns or battles with a friend. That reminds me: one time me and a friend were playing head to head and he was defending his home province from an attack.

Instead of including the base game it is a standalone with the same launcher, so steam thinks you own the original because that is how it works for every other game known to man- except this one.
Now I have to pay 30$ on top of the 45$ something just for the base game that I actually want to play. Steam marketed Shogun FOTS very deceptively, I thought i might as well get the FOTS for an extra 10$ so i did it, now im out an extra 45 something dollars instead. So 45$ just for crappy DLC that I will never play.

Do i recommend shogun 2? Hell yes!!! If you like strategy/RTS or other Total war games you will love it.
But stay away from FallOfTheSamurai steam deception!

This is the only place I can put my review because steam thinks i own the basegame that they essentially stole from me, but I do not actually(which is my only gripe)- I think they took down the version that i bought because of how screwed up it was otherwise this comment would be there.

11,50373117,english,"Garbage.

RNG and boredom.

Someone is removing all the negative reviews of this garbage game.
But why would they do that?
This game is made by CREATIVE ASSEMBLY, that is already a big reason to dump this title.
So, here we go.

Is it a strategy game? The developers claim it to be so. But in fact we get a scuffed turn-based clicking simulator.

Gameplay: 

Game lacks of mechanics, you literally do only 2-3 things the whole game.
Every action you do is countered by undeveloped AI, leaving you without options to use tactics or strategy. 
There is no such a definition as ""playing"" applied to this game, you just do whatever you can at a moment.

Diplomacy is very back stabby, even if you do everything perfectly, you will be attacked by spies or unpleased neighbours. 
The battles AI is garbage which makes them easier but only when you have numerical superiority. 
With no garrison it's almost impossible to put up a ""resistance"" against 25 stack armies. 
No matter how good you are at controlling your units make sure your troops are not in the minority because you will probably lose.

Battles are boring, unbalanced.

The second you move your army from your capital to take another province or fight an army, war gets declared on you by enemies that you see for the first time. This leads to your capital being immediately taken. 
Can't even try to fight back because it will take unlimited number of turns. 
Once you tend to control your provinces, all of the sudden the rebels popup and some random event with attacking army happens. And now you have 3 fronts. You move for a second to go north and your capital is taken and you are not allowed to fight back. Don't forget that all that time you also get attacked by spies.

Some old whiteknights of this franchise are saying that this game should be hard because all the previous games are almost the same. That is a pathetic excuse.

Graphics are ugly. Game is poorly optimized, lagging at maximum settings even if you are using a modern PC.

1/10

This game is just a very boring simulator burdened with unpleasant tiresome mechanics.
Like most games of Total War franchise or CREATIVE ASSEMBLY products.
Can't Imagine playing this ""game"" more than a couple of hours.",1556469422,1556469422,False,1,0,0.489510476589202881,0,True,False,False,76561197998680878,717,109,1277,0,1277,1516902157,,
12,50358248,english,"Shogun 2 is one of the best in the Total War Franchise, if you like Samurai or the sengoku jidai ( the age of war), this game is definitely a good pick.

The turned based aspect of the game is nothing compared to CIV, but when you can get your units fighting on a battleground that's when the game shine, and it pretty much lives to it's name, is TOTAL WAR after all, and that is what the game is based upon, if you want diplomacy, alliances or anything that isn't war, well don't pick this up, ally’s will most likely betray just because they get an arbitrary number at a point in the game.

Total war games can be great, if they can improve the AI and make it not cheat as much, the turn based game play has still a lot to evolve, but the combat (even though the AI in this mode is still rather poor) is what makes this game shine, and its rewarding to defend a castle while heavily outnumbered.

Shogun 2 is one off the best games in the total war franchise, it just still had all the downfalls of that franchise.

67,49711304,english,"This game was by FAR my favorite for the longest time, but coming back to it after a couple months away, I find that it has been horrifically broken.
In Rise of the Samurai, bow levy, the earliest unit of bow unit will easily beat off naginata attendants (The second level of spear unit) while in a situation where they are being attacked in the back, downhill, and they are winded. If anyone knows literally anything about this game, that situation is basically a guaranteed win between almost any 2 units of the same level. Not to mention your units will seemingly run away at the first signs of combat the second it happens, no matter the situation. Also, war will get declared on you out of the blue by random clans that are incredibly weak and sometimes have no more than three units, not counting their generals.
In Shogun 2 vanilla, I've seen light cav teleport behind my lines and kill off all of my bow units and not ever route despite being attacked on all sides by spear units. Despite the broken combat system mechanics in Vanilla it is by far the most balanced.
Fall of the Samurai my only real critique is that the campaign clans are faaaar too aggressive. I've never really had a problem with the broken system where these clans with only one settlement pump out max stack armies back to back to back, because it was kinda fun to beat them, but in this campaign, everyone seems to be trying to one up the Civilization's Gandhi and they will break long standing trade agreements and alliances just to declare a war that not even they are prepared for.

TW Shogun 2  offers great replayability and variety. Unlike Warhammer, In Shogun there is no OP hero units or monsters, so its all up to whose tactics are superior. This, perhaps, is one and only TW game where tactics matters over units quality.  E.g. you cannot push through spear wall with cavalry no matter how advanced it is, and so on. You can have real epic standoffs against owerwhelming forces if you use your brain (or humiliating defeats if you dont).

The main campaign is meh (IMO), but FoTS(Fall of the Samirai DLC campaign) is a true masterpiece must have with this game.  It has the most realistic RTS lineabttles of 19th century ever.

Ofc, this game is best played with mods. My top-3 must-have list:

1)Darthmod + units for darthmod for both main campaign and FoTS. Adds LOTS of unit variety and makes firearms to have realistic (increased) range.
2)Granary mod for main campaign. (without it food will be a real nuicance).
3)Sinking threshold for both main campaign and FoTS (devs removed ships sinking feature in one of updates for reason unknown. this mod brings the awesomness of dynamic sinking back).

95,49498754,english,"Well, this is the only Total War game I've ever played. I honestly only bought it because I dig samurai. So, keep in mind that I'm a judging this game from a newbie's perspective. First, the graphics in this game are actually still quite good despite the game's age. It can still punish a system, especially if you're playing at higher resolutions with larger units (I'm saying this as a 2080ti owner in 2019). Furthermore, the game unfortunately doesn't provide players with a way to adjust the UI size, so at 4K, the text is almost unreadable. I'm sure there's a mod out there that'll fix this problem, though. I've found that playing at 1440p gives me the best experience, anyway. The text is just big enough and the frame rate hold up pretty well at that resolution. 

Other than that, the gameplay variety is excellent. There is plenty of business to take care of between battles, be it political dealings, trade talks, or providing provisions for each settlement. The battles themselves are a blast and, at times, can require you to really use your brain and think tactically. As someone who had never played this type of game beforehand, I found everything to be absolutely overwhelming at first, but once I got the hang of it, I couldn't stop playing.

Special mention to the FoTS DLC as it totally brought a clash between the traditional melee-bow focused army compositions against the firearm-cannon focused army compositions, depicted as the central theme in the Boshin War. I have only found the tech tree-research aspect of the game rather lackluster, especially with the very small bonuses each research component might bring even into the late-game tech-tree. FoTS also lack more ""individualised/unique"" units to the factions, especially those that could make or break a game (except for the very strong and fairly-early game Choshu unit, the Kihetai, or the Jozai's Yugiketai if not for its' max deployed unit cap).

It's not the most accurate with Hatakeyama's location, sure. It can be unbearable to see your best general breakaway from the clan and declare himself independent. It's the kind of game on higher difficulties that will potentially make you rage hard. Still when you match wits with other players in drop in campaign battles. When all you have are those moments where you see the fact your going to be bled dry from a battle you can't run from and you say, ""Well, I will make them hurt for this loss I have to take,"" you get a rush. When you capture Kyoto and get the Great Guard and the Nihon Maru and start trouncing people during Realm divide, it's priceless. Seven years out and I still come back to this gem of a game. Maybe I feel like a few of the Major Clans are weak (Ikko Ikki comes to mind) do to whatever reason. However for as many hours as I have logged in the series Shogun 2 is my most beloved. The way you can get up close and see your general run down fleeing forces when you don't have any light cavarly is utterly satisfying.

So I've given CA a LOT of stick recently over their newer titles and felt it was about time I gave this game the plaudits it deserves. It's awesome, start to finish captures exactly what I want a TW game to be. I can slowly but surely craft my perfect generals and agents until they become unstoppable, battles are dynamic and always fun. The AI is capable of putting up a significant fight when on higher difficulties. 

The co-op campaigns are good and the game pace is managed very well. 

The technology aspects are good, but with a caveat that if you're playing on lower difficulties there's a good to strong likelihood that you'll win the game before reaching the bottom 2 layers of the tree itself.

The only minor gripes I have with the game are as follows:
 Agents are sometimes TOO powerful. If you haven't been nurturing at least 1 good ninja or metsuke from the beginning of the game and someone else has you will really struggle.
The morale mechanics in battle can go a bit awry. I've had examples of 200-300 ashigaru running away from 50 samurai. Which isn't completely insane, but what is insane is I was assaulting a town.... and my ashigaru decided to flee THROUGH the samurai they were supposedly running from (and still outnumbered 4-1)

26,49047432,english,"Total War: Three Kingdoms is imminent, so I tried to check out the only other Total War game that I got 8 years ago.

Fun anecdotal: Shogun 2 was one of the two games which caused an acute addiction symptom back then where I was unable to stop playing, apart from eating and sleeping.  The other game was L4D2.  However unlike L4D2, Shogun 2 really is showing its age, both in terms of graphics and in gameplay.

I assume the reason the game asked me to install Adobe Flash Player was to play the pre-rendered clips.  Let’s just say I’m not fond of those blurry and blocky low-res videos.  The 2D oriental-styled graphical elements are as timeless as one can expect; and for the same reason, the 3D graphics isn’t impressive by today’s standard as in 2011.

One of the main selling points of the game was seeing real-time rendered units killing each other on battlefield.  It could be a thing, if not for the camera controls are absolutely user-hostile.  Anyone would expect right click on ground and drag mouse, plus the mouse wheel, would be the standard and succinct method to control the camera, but nope; for some arcane reason I’m forced to use WASD keys to move camera, two additional keys to rotate, etc.

I don’t know how I endured this bullshit 8 years ago, but I certainly would do that now, and would not recommend anyone to delve into this madness.

This is mostly personal preference: I often something’s fundamentally lacking in turn-based strategy games.

Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA, it is the sequel to SHOGUN: Total War and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: SHOGUN 2 overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

This is one of the oldest games they have that is still plays as a modern Total War title. The base game is fun and simple enough to learn (for a Total War game). Units are fairly simple to figure out and they fixed the issue of food shortages long ago so it is much more managable. They even brought back the silly assassination videos which is a nice touch. This is not my favorite Total War game, but it is still a great way to wet your feet into the series, especially if you like the Japanese theme. The Fall of the Samauri DLC is also worth getting as it is very different from the base game. More like if they made Civil War Total War, but with more samurai swords.

One thing I would love to see in all the Total War games is being able to use generals and support characters as their own 1-man units like you can in Warhammer Total War.

82,48496021,english,"If you'd like to take only one thing from this review; Shogun 2 is an absolutely beautiful game. 

In my opinion, the strong suit of this game is its art, audio and aesthetic. The game itself plays pretty much as the end-stage evolution of the pre-Rome 2 Total War games, without the army tradition and province systems. The graphics are starting to get a little dated, the character models look funky doing some movements (particularly visible during the generals' speeches when people throw their arms into the air), but in my opinion the art and the aesthetic makes it easy to look past this. The art and aesthetic (for someone uninitiated like myself) seem to be from the exact time period in Japan when this game plays out. Unit cards and building cards all look like art from the period (again, from someone not well-read on this particular subject), and they're pretty to look at while you read the in-game encyclopedia entries on them.

The background music is appropriate for the setting. It's relaxing when you're in the campaign map, and sets the mood before and during battles. I have one minor gripe with it, though: one of the soundtracks before a battle is using a Hang (a UFO-shaped musical instrument), which I found to be an odd choice. The voice-acting is memorable and at times funny, with a somewhat caricature-like japanese accent to the spoken english. 

As a strategy game, there's some learning curve, but is not nearly as steep as with games like Europa Universalis 4 or Hearts of Iron III. The unit roosters are the same for every clan, save for some unique units and special units made available only to certain factions. This is a strong reduction in unit diversity compared to previous and subsequent entries to the series and can be seen as quite simplistic, however this plays out in a strongly rock-paper-scissors manner and I found it to be no less engaging compared to other TW games. 

This game has some DLC's. It's not quite as bad as the worst in the current gaming industry, though I recall there was some resistance to the DLC policy regarding this game. None of the DLC's are vital to your enjoyment of the game, in my opinion. There are two expansions, Rise of the Samurai (covers the time period of ~1200AD) and Fall of the Samurai (Boshin War), the latter of which is stand-alone and is often regarded as the better of the two. Both games alter their art-style and aesthetic, with RotS building- and unit-cards still look painted, although in a different style (fitting of the time period, I assume?), while the FotS cards look like ye olde pictures and portraits. Personally, I found this very tasteful and really drives home the feeling that the art and aesthetic is what makes this game. For me, at least. 

The game came out in 2011 and I think it holds up to today's standards great. If it's worth the full price or just 50% of it; I won't be the judge. The bottom line is that this game is enjoyable, visually beautiful and worth playing.

Thank you for reading.

3,48201437,english,"This game is AWESOME. Let me explain to you my personal reaction to this game, It's like, they listened to someone tell a story about Japanese history, and decided to incorporate details to the game to make each event possible. Want to hold a rivals son as a hostage to secure your alliance? You can do that. Want to marry off your daughter to an allied clan to secure your alliance? You can do that. Want to help nobunaga ALMOST become shogun but then stab him in the back at the very end and become shogun yourself? YOU CAN DO THAT! Literally the only thing I cannot seem to reanact of  the sengoku period, is burning the ikko ikki alive.... Which technically still isn't impossible if you manually fight them and make sure your army is made up of flame arrow archers and fire bomb throwers. 

Okay so genuinely, this game rocks my socks off. especially if you're into games like age of empires? This game is so much better than it in my eyes. Here's the main difference between this game and AOE, You cant build walls in TWS2. :/
You can however, turn any small town into a great city that will make you rich, and once you get greedy and realize thats not enough just like every other daimyo in history? You ""borrow"" more :D. Make alliances to help neighbors also ""borrow"" land from people. Don't be too nice to those neighbors though, sometimes a rich clan walks in and gives them like, 20,000 yen just to betray you and THEY WILL EVERY SINGLE TIME EVEN IF THEY ARE YOUR VASSAL.

Best Game strategy I've found? Use your spy units for basically everything. You might think they're useless because you've got more important katana soldiers to deal with, but trust me, when your ninja kills off a level 5 general and his army headed towards your base you will thank me

I couln't wait so I got Med II, Empire, and Napoleon and played them, modded them, and when Shogun 2 finally arrived I was very happy with it. It is possbily the best Total War game up to that time, and with Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai it has some of the best expansion outside of Warhammer and Warhammer II. If you are interested in the period, or Total War games in general, I'd reccomend checking it out.

Note that it uses the system of earlier Warscape games where most units don't have HP, rather than the system use by Rome II and later games. The battlefields are large and it has a richness in features that were streamlined or eliminated in later games. It does lack the depth of tech tree, and depth of skill tree, and other thing that a Warhammer player would be used to, but overall I'd say it is the best historical themed Total War title. There are still some bugs but most can be fixed with modding, I think in the last patch they messed up naval battle AI, but its been a while since I palyed. 

The game did have the best naval battles with Fall of the Samurai it allows you take command of 19th century steam powered ship, including the 1860 HMS Warrior, and other famous ironclads.

That one really takes the cake though. It is a standalone game, though it was supposed to be an add-on. Out of the whole franchise, it is the best one when it comes to the utilization to the early days of cannon and rifles. 
However, despite how much I can gush over this game, like all Total War games, there is just one thing that can potentially make or break it for you. For me, that is the mulitplayer. Now, I don't play with strangers on these games. Ever. Yet, I love to play with friends. For whatever reason, Shogun 2, base game, or FoTS, just has connection issues.

49,47806155,english,"Honestly one of my favorite games of all time. After playing a number of the Total War games, I've found this one to shine out over the others in a lot of ways.

First off, just to get the bad out of the way first, units are basically a reskin of one another for each faction. Ashigaru are going to be relatively the same for the Uesugi as they are for the Takeda and so on and so forth. You won't find a ton of uniquely designed units, and if that's your thing, then pick up Warhammer instead.

There's no rat people, no lizardmen, no undead. Just men, most of which are reskined for each faction.

Still, I think this is the one that the franchise got right in a lot of ways. Diversity of units is a small price to pay for what you get here, and really, there're still plenty of different units to choose from. Singular units, though reskinned, can still be vastly different from one another based on a number of factors such as your faction, technology level, general and even what buildings you have in the province they were produced in. 

Now, what's good about this game? Well, for starters, if you're a fan of Sengoku Jidai and medeival japanese culture like me, this game's for you. Not many games allow you to take the feild in huge force as one of the leading daimyo of the era or raise a less prominent one to glory. There's plenty of factions, each with their own unique benefits. Navies also feel somewhat meaningful in this particular installment, and if you're crafty, you can manopolize foreign trade completely. 

Most importantly, at least in my opinion, there's a good balance between war and infrastructure in this game which I feel is highly lacking in the titles that came after. The UI i liked far more than any of the other Total War games, and it felt like there were more meaningful buildings to choose from when improving provinces. The heroes in this game also feel a bit more fleshed out, and though it can get annoying later on in the game, there's little cut scenes you can watch as your ninja makes an assassination attempt, or you geisha. 

I really enjoyed this game a lot and highly recommend it. Replayability is great, giving you a chance to play as the guy who kicked your butt in previous game. Not to mention, it's set in japan. Japan! Ninjas and Samurai! Just buy it, it's like $12 for the whole thing when on sale, including all DLC except for Fall of the Samurai. You're going to spend three times that on one hollow expansion for a newer Total War game anyway, so just pick this one up!",1545745723,1545745723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198090464534,209,18,12420,0,11774,1480460440,,
50,47799629,english,"[h1]This game, despite releasing in early 2011, still holds up as a great game today.[/h1]Let that be the first statement I make towards this legend of a game. It still holds up well today so if you're considering buying it, let it be known above all that it is still worth the cash today. Now, I feel I must preface this review with the fact that I'm a newcomer to the Total War series. This is my first game with the title of Total War. So, what do I think? Well, you should already know that I can very much recommend it as I enjoyed it immensely. The amount of viable strategies to crushing the enemy, in addition to the various tactics available during battle, give a surprising amount of depth and replayability to the game. There are so many, in fact, that I won't even bother listing them here. I'm sure you could search Youtube and easily find some tutorials. Instead, I shall focus on other aspects of the game. Now, as a newcomer, it was very easy to know what general direction to go in - Literally and figuratively - after the first 5 turns. I started out as the Shimazu, a clan with increased katana capabilities as well as conveniently residing on a peninsula. I chose them because I heard that they were a good starter clan for beginners so begin your game with this in mind. The graphics (which can make use of DX11) pretty much hold up except for ONE THING. The facial models of the armies and, even worse, the generals are completely horrendous. I'm sure they were outdated even by 2011 standards. However, as the faces are not usually seen during battle, this can be forgiven. The map style of ancient Japan on even older parchment looks ~UBER~ rad, and, once revealed, will show a high-res. depiction of the area which, might I add, is mighty cool! The unit variety is comprehensive and quite dense with many different types of units in existence. However, you will have to construct buildings in your conquered cities in order to be able to produce these units. You will also have to research the unit in order to create the building with which you can produce them. Oh yeah! you heard, there's a research system in place in order to improve your growing empire. It can improve your clan in two ways, military and economy. Both are necessary to an effective empire. This is all just touching the surface on the basics of this game.

The turn based campaign is complex without being bloated by needless elements. The map of Japan is beautiful and evocative with great music. The game achieves a great depth in the turn based campaign while retaining purity of design, which is very rare.  The real time battles are very strategic,  every faction has the same units mostly with a few exceptions, so battles will often be very even and you will have to rely on your tactics in the battle rather than you're knowledge of complex unit rosters like in warhammer. This could lead to repetiveness, but the RTS gameplay is by itself solid and enjoyable so the simple rosters accentuate a strength of the series in this case.

Shogun 2 is not a game that does or aspires to do everything, but it does what it does extemely well.  A very good pick if you are interested in a strategy game or in the Total War series.

This game is less arcadey than the more recent games that have been coming out. As someone who has been playing the series for a long time, I can say I like both. They both have a place. This game is a far more tactical based game. Placement is more important, and if you fire into your own troops, expect heavy losses.  The online version of this game was great too. Great online balance, and the Avatar Mode was awesome. Something I wish would have returned in later games a bit more polished. It was a great idea that could have done wonders for future games.

71,47490206,english,"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story (Japanese: るろうに剣心 -明治剣客浪漫譚- Hepburn: Rurōni Kenshin -Meiji Kenkaku Roman Tan-),[a] also known as Samurai X, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The story begins during the 11th year of the Meiji period in Japan (1878) and follows a former assassin from the Bakumatsu, known as Hitokiri Battosai. After his work against the bakufu, Hitokiri Battosai disappears to become Himura Kenshin: a wandering swordsman who protects the people of Japan with a vow to never take another life. Watsuki wrote the series upon his desire to make a shōnen manga different from the other ones that were published at the time, with Kenshin being a former assassin and the story taking a more serious tone as it continued. The manga revolves around themes of atonement, peace, and romance.

The manga initially appeared in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine from April 1994 to September 1999. The complete work consists of 28 tankōbon volumes, while years later it was reprinted into twenty-two kanzenban volumes. Studio Gallop, Studio Deen and SPE Visual Works adapted the manga into an anime series which aired in Japan from January 10, 1996 to September 8, 1998. Besides an animated feature film, two series of original video animations (OVAs) were also produced. The first adapted stories from the manga that were not featured in the anime, while the second was a sequel to the manga. Several art and guidebooks for Rurouni Kenshin have been published and writer Kaoru Shizuka has authored three official light novels which were published by Shueisha. Many video games have also been released for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable consoles. A successful live-action theatrical film adaptation was released in 2012, with limited international screenings.",1544645739,1544645739,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198237428152,137,20,71,0,13,1585841353,,
72,47484592,english,"I just finished the campaign (a second time? I don't remember playing it the first time.)

The game is very beautifully done, the animation, the artwork, the mechanics, the battles... all very positive. But there are some key choices the developer made which completely sapped the fun out of a normal campaign for me.

1: The time limit. You have 240 turns to win the campaign. You can continue playing after, but you won't win. Compared to Rome, I felt this time limit was way too short, and my entire time playing the campaign felt like I was rushing. This would be fine, if there was the option to change the turn limit or play without a constraint of time. But there isn't, not without modding. That is an option that should be in game.

2: Realm divide. After a certain point of prestige, your clan triggers Realm Divide, which increasingly makes EVERY other clan war you. I had one very good ally, and they warred me after about 4 turns. Everyone else was already at war with me. This mechanic made the last 80 or so turns of my campaign absolutely no fun, and made vassals absolutely redundant. 90% of my time was spent fixing sabotaged settlements, micromanaging every penny, driving off constant trade route raids and enemy raids, and watching every single general and agent of mine die repeatedly to the 200 enemy agents. This is a real issue with the game. I understand it's a challenge, but there is a line between challenge and painful torture. Seriously, I had about 15 provinces left to capture including tokyo, and the entire game just went stale for the 80 turns left it took me to win.

The biggest issue I had with realm divide though was the agent spam. Around tokyo I constantly had more than 20 enemy agents. I could not keep a single general or agent alive or build infrastructure, which completely removed any immersion I had in the game being invested in my ""clan"" or my generals, which was one of my favourite aspects of Rome Total War. Not to mention I couldn't benefit from any generals skills or traits, so I completely ditched generals altogether, and won without them.

Begrudgingly I will give this game a positive review, but I am not very satisfied.

0,47102474,english,"Total War: Shogun 2 is currently the pinnacle of RTS and turn-based strategy games, and by far the best in the Total War franchise. Hearkening back to the series' origins in Feudal Japan, Shogun 2 does more than just improve upon the formula used in previous installments, but instead innovates in all areas. Fans of Total War are in two groups with this game: those who love it, and those who haven't played it yet.

Pros:
- Excellent RTS tactical gameplay with a huge variety of units and abilities available to suit a number of playstyles. Combined with interesting and at many times challenging terrain in order to prevent battles from devolving into melee moshpits, and you have a strategy game in which you truly feel like a Sengoku general.
- Gorgeous graphics. Whilst not the most ""photo-realistic"" in this genre, they are wonderfully styalised and highly cinematic, making replays a joy to behold.
- Expertly crafted map of Japan and surrounding islands, combined with multiple starting points and clans provide a huge amount of replayability.
- Well-balanced Multiplayer and brilliantly implemented ""Avatar Conquest"" modes that make online play even more enjoyable thanks to clan systems and (once again) near endless replayability.
- Detailed Encyclopedia and Historical Battles for those who wish to delve deeper into the history of the Sengoku Jidai period.
- Easy modding capabilities for even further refinement (if deemed appropriate).

Cons:
- Lack of truly meaningful variety between clan units.
- AI suffers from the same below average quality of other installments in the franchise, with Diplomacy sometimes becoming impossible due to overly aggressive AI clans.
- Apart from the two major DLCs (Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai) many parts of the game seem ""lopped off"" in an effort to make more money (I'm looking squarely at you Blood Pack).

All in all, Shogun 2 is a definite recommendation for any fans of strategy games, and it may even be the greatest example of the genre.",1543293578,1543293578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198105748483,91,14,207897,1087,22279.0,1602081093,,

Easy to learn, hard to master.
The game has a nice balance between the real-time strategy, in the form of battles, and the turn-based gameplay, in the form of the top-down map.
There's a lot of different factions to choose them and all of them vary in difficulty, making it so that you have a hard time getting bored with the game. Each one of the factions has special units, perks, and starting positions. The game itself takes place during the 'Sengoku' era in Japanese history where the then current shogun was losing influence over the different warlords in the country and the country fell into a civil war where the warlords fought each other in search of influence and power. The ultimate goal of the game is to take over the capital, Kyoto, and become the official shogun under the emperor. The goal in this game is a bit special because instead of aiming for world dominance, in this game it's more local; you're just trying to unite Japan under your banner.

All in all: An amazing strategy game that has a perfect balance between the two subgenres; Real-time and Turn-based.",1542887639,1542887639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198107522822,314,9,5374,19,1959.0,1600968597,,

it's companies like this that get regulated to the its ok to pirate their works because their marketing department sucks so much at their job they think graphical options are a DLC worthy thing, here i got a new marketing strat you can use it in your upcoming game total war: DLC vs everyone in which the player never actually gets to play start charging everyone $10.99 for fucking seting their resolution to 4k then you hit em with a $20.99(and you double charge your customers, the money you make off of double charging them will be huge, sure you gotta give it back but only to those who see the error and call bullshit) you can unlock volume control and trees because base games shouldnt come with fucking trees for free, shit why not just lock all NPCs as well as all player characters behind a fucking paywall too and fuck it since its total war lets just make the player pay real money for every unit they produce. i'll stopp now because somewhere some marketing dildo is getting wet in the pants thinking all that shit is a good idea and not just someone smart enough to know they should be pissed off about these business practices. fuck i rememeber when you cunts had to print me a manual with nice art and fluff, back when games where actualy something collectable. cheap cunts dont even have to make with free posters any more.

Pros
Decent AI with a couple of issues mentioned below. Good music and graphics, runs smoothly on my new laptop. Just when you feel safe, someone stabs you in the back and declares war on you along with all their allies which keeps it very challenging and entertaining. I also like the realm divide element where the whole of Japan declares war on you after you get too big as prevents you steam rolling through the later game with ease.

Cons
Some units seem to be a lot more useful than others relative to their cost. Ideally this could have been balanced a bit better and I sometimes find it a bit fiddly towards the later part of the game to manage everything. The AI in general is okay although they don't seem to be good at flanking you and on sieges they tend to allow you to decimate every unit of theirs with your archers stationed outside.",1540042458,1540042458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197988957872,154,1,38273,0,29761,1588166881,,

71,45208616,english,"One of the best total war games in my opinion. Really liked how diverse the range of difficulties, events and game play experiences are. Defeat can loom around the corner at any second whilst just one decision can get you victory. Whilst you get caught up in wars and peace treaties you can find your dynasty has died out or an enemy Metsuke has turned all your provinces into christian rebel states. So far I have written a generic total war review. If you hadn't clicked on the title saying *Shogun 2* you wouldn't have been able to know what total war game I was talking about. This is the part that makes Shogun 2  stand out from all the other total war games. I have three contentions. 1. The art style is incredible. Instead of engdulging in 3d graphics for everything to try and make their game look cool and modern CA did a good job of creating 2d art for the game that is just incredible. This is the primary reason for why the game stands the, although short, test of time. Sure the characters sometimes lose all colour and go white in the diplomatic mode, sure the gore looks terrible, but these critiques are the most minor of things. Shogun 2 immerses you with what a Japanese Daimyo would have felt all those years ago fighting on the front lines against overwhelming odds with your loyalties and the loyalties of others still unsure contrasted with the formal, tea drinking art admiring side of being a daimyo that seems a completely foreign reality.  2. History, for anyone who enjoys being an armchair history this game is a well executed version of any other historical game. It portrays perfectly the time period whilst still retaining some of the potentially immersion breaking gameplay aspects. Having the Date clan Roflstomp the entirety of Japan single handedly is fine because it's just the way total war games are, as is having settlements be just empty fortresses in sieges. Personnally what I can't get is having there be one castle and just a couple buildings in each province. Yes having many more buildings per province would become unmanagable by turn 2 or so but why can't total war make a game that is a little less cartoonish in this aspect and properly represnt the Japanese countryside. This nitpick is probably not applicable to most players but personnally this is what I really hate about total war games. I do like how there are historically events that pop up as you play through which is why I recommend playing the domination campaign as you struggle against christian expansion by spamming monks in all your cities where christian has spread like the plague. Personnally when Realm Divide comes along my enjoyment of the game slowly comes grinding to a halt as clans just all declare war on you similtaneously like a group of diehard Corbyn voters when they find out you're a Brexiteer. I was coming up to realm divide with only one ally, the Imagawa clan, who were also the strongest clan, they decided to take Kyoto just three turns before Realm divide meaning my only ally was gone. Immediately I was a small clan in control of just less than 1/4 of Japan with no allies. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. Total War please make a different way of keeping the difficulty up when the end of the game comes along. 3. Gameplay. What sort of a review/mostly positive rant would this be if I didn't mention gameplay. The naval battles are so much more oriented about skill in this game than in others, let's take Napoleon as an example. Naval battles don't rely on the direction of the wind (for the most part) most ships don't use sails. They are oar based. What a breath of fresh are this is. In Napoleon I am hopeless at Naval battles due in part to the fact that I don't really ever have the wind on my side. In this game you don't hold your breath to see the compass thing at the start of a battle. You rarely ever look at it. Each boat has it's own way of fighting which includes even more factors among that. For once naval battles are purely skill based, so much so that you can defeat a hard Ai against overwhelming odds with easy if you are experienced enough. I've only completed one campaign and I failed to trade at all with other clans or even outside nations. I still used my navies for disrupting other peoples trade draining their treasuries through continuously destroying their navies and using my navies to safely transport my armies half way around Japan to attack random clans that declared war on me because a vassal of mine got attacked by a guy who was allied with a guy who was allied with a guy. That brings me to vassals. The Ai didn't make any vassals in my game but the one time when I decided to make one was when this one province kept changing hands between me and the Imagawa and as a result became tactically invaluable due to it's postion but completely ingovernable due to no infrastructure and appalling public order. So I made a Vassal. It makes itself an army they said. It gives you a unit they said. It fights your enemies they said. You don't have to govern it they said. How wrong I was to click Vassal. I had just made peace with a clan allied to the Imagawa who had a border with me just outside Kyoto which I controlled. We had massive armies just sitting on the border not strong enough to attack each other but unable to go and help out elsewhere because as soon as the army left the opposing force could sweep right in. So I made a Vassal of the territory I had just captured. Immediately the Imagawa invaded my Vassal. You can't Garrison a city owned by your Vassal and what's worse is that the Imagawa walking into my Vassal made my Vassal call me into a war against the Imagawa(who I was already at war with) and the clan I had just made peace with. aahhhhhhhhh. just kill me. I had absent mindedly given my ownly heir to the clan to make peace and so my lineage was wiped out because of the stupid Vassal. Just don't. Don't use Vassals even if it seems like a good idea. Land battles are just as good as in any other total war games. Although as you get into late game easy difficulty games you can single out and destroy enemies as their armies are split up and defeat them using only autoresolve in stark contrast to hard difficulty games where the enemy will only attack you when they outnumber you. Each to their own I guess, personally I like a mixture of both styles of play, unfortunately there is no in between mode for people like me. Strategy in the campaign view is nice but needs a lot of experience. They are just so many options. I have -1 food there are lot's of buildings and lots of arts I can master to help me with this. Which should I choose? With just over 40 hrs, not much for a total war game for me but I was just so eager to make this review, I still don't know the most optimal way of getting myself out of situations or even just knowing what buildings to build or upgrade. Economy is done very well in this game although trading could have a bit more integration into the interface to facilitate knowing how valuable trade really is and knowing whether sacrificing many ships to preserve trade is necessary.

76,45180614,english,"Just love this game and all its expansions.  It really holds up and looks nice.  I prefer Empire's naval battles, but the land battles with the Samurai and naval bombardment in Fall of The Samurai is bloody epic.  Not to mention the samurai/yari battles are fantastic.  I prefer the ol' hammer and shock cavalry battles, but learning to use line infantry/gunpowder is challenging and rewarding.  The AI is pretty predictable and especially silly with its cavalry and some questionable movement choices on the campaign map - but oh well - it's still a great RTS/Turn-Based game.  It's a really interesting time period, too. 

History is always important to learn, preserve, and understand.  I know Japan/Asia wasn't necessarily to blame for a lot of the atrocities its people went through in the early history of the East and West.  Misunderstandings and extremely unfair trade deals.  To say these people weren't exploited in the not-so-distant past wouldn't be false, but history has a way of painting us all in a bad light at times.  Sometimes it's even glamorous, guns, bows, arrows, and all - the wild west, etc.  It hasn't always been an oil painting; there has been blood spilled on the canvas, but we are still here and able to thrive/grow together.  Is it folly to believe there won't be war ever again?  It may be like saying winter will cease and the spring flower will always be in bloom.  Still, I cling onto it, [the thought of peace] knowing how much we keep focusing and looking back at our epic stories of heroics and battles won and lost.  Some love war and live by the shadow of a sword without shame.  It is their truth and it is powerful to behold, lest they change their mind and see courage expressed in a differen't way.  The hope is we keep our wars in our games and history books and don't repeat the same mistakes our ancestors made.  Sometimes we must relent, drop our cloak, and follow Old Ben.  We must turn our proverbial cheek and be cast down; to become stronger in a way even the most glorious victory cannot.  It's fun in a game, but there are soldiers out there giving their lives right now defending our home/way of life/standard of living.  I keep asking myself, why does it have to be this way?  Can't we bring them home?  What's holding us back from leaving the past behind?  What sign or miracle are we waiting for?  I think even the greatest commanders, soldiers, and leaders of people and nations ask themselves the same hard questions when they make the choices most of us would be afraid to make.  I don't sit in judgement, as much as I stew with uncomfortahble questions.  

Ultimately, we must preserve others cultures as much as we embrace our own to further cooperation.  If you're rhetoric is racist or you support this sort of thinking, you need only open up the history book, scripture, and see the error in promoting death instead of life.  Diversity is common wisdom, knowledge and essential for our survival.

I digress.  

This is probably my favorite Total War game.  It's polished and full of content.  Hundred upon hundreds of hours of gameplay if you're so inclined. My favorite feature are the agent and general abilities.  The AI simply doesn't stand a chance against the charm and wit of your agents in the field.  General traits and abilities are useful as ever.  They also really focused upon this 'hero' feature in Warhammer I've heard - still need to try that one out, but I'm slow at this gaming thing these days. I hope the newer games also have improved the campaign AI and its choices.  It's not uncommon to see a full stack of men meandering about the map like they lost a set of keys or left their wallet at home.  ""FOR THE SHOGUNATE.... WAIT!  HALT MEN!   THE MIGHTY DAIMYO HAS TO GO HOME FOR A SPELL.  HE LEFT HIS FAVORITE SADDLE AT HOME AND WISHES TO TAKE A LONG NAP.  WE SHALL CONTINUE THIS MARCH AGAINST THE EMPIRE LATER.""  

To be fair, war is hell, and there's a lot of great things to paint and enjoy instead.  Sometimes I think the best kept secret in the world are those little moments when we remember to smile. 
 The rust melts away and the person underneath peeks out and shines for a moment.  Death?  No, merely waking from a dream.  So it goes.

3,45092294,english,"Total War: Shogun 2 is a fantastic grand strategy game in which the player takes on the role of one small, humble clan of their choosing, and working their way to become Shogun of Japan. To do this, you shall conquer your enemies, trade with and protect your allies, spare your rivals and turn them into vassals, peacefully occupy captured cities or raze them to the ground for mass profit, commit terrible dishonerable acts of subterfuge and assassination, show great generosity and fight alongside loyal allied clans, keep to the good old traditional ways or take in the culture and technologies of the western traders... whatever it takes to become Shogun.

But be wary, for every other clan also has their own ambitions and plots, their own schemes to claim their place as Shogun. When the time of Realm Divide comes, only your most closest of allies shall stay at your side, but even then they shall not stay content with what little lands they have been left with. ...Mostly because the actual diplomicy aspect is a bit schizophrenic, allying with other clans along with your own and then declaring war on one of your other allies forcing you to choose between going to war with one and betraying the other, causing you to lose honor, and so on and so on down the daisychain of alliances... Actually, treat everyone as an enemy and leave no vassals, for they too may try to fight against you later on. Allies are temporary cease-fire cases at best.

As for combat, you will start with basic peasant fighters with spears and bow, aquiring bonuses to existing units and developing brand new units entirely through the two tech trees, such as giving the ability to use fire arrows for your archers, new types of cavalry like bow horsemen or katana cavalry, the ability to build and replenish siege engines and near-endgame cannons. Your appointed generals shall keep your men inline and disciplined, helping to prevent your soldiers from fleeing the battle, allowing even the weakest and most cowardly of men to fight like lions, to say nothing of the soldiers who would prefer the honor of death over the shame of retreat. But, battles are not just open field slaughters, there are many siege battles to take part in, castles to storm and capture.

Night battles allow a more crafty general to use the cover of darkness to bring forth ninjas and open the castle gates to allow your soldiers inside, or capture archery towers to rain arrows down upon your foes. ...Or just, capture the whole castle after spending around 45 seconds in the capture circle uncontested, thus winning the battle in that instant.

There's also the choice of waiting on the right weather conditions, such as waiting for the rains to pass and allow you to more effectively use your matchlock guns and fire arrows, or attacking during the rain to deny your enemy the same such advantage, or using the fog to hide your forces for a more effective ambush.

The naval combat isn't a slouch either, featuring boats large and small and hosting large numbers of marine warriors and archers. Smaller vessals best used for quickly entering the fray, whilst larger ships lumber forth and engage in boarding actions against dissabled ships. And of course, being made of wood, this is where that fire arrow ability becomes particularly dangerous, as ships may catch fire and force the crew to either cease combat and engage in repairs, or risk sinking. Late game units may even be equiped with copper plating if the right building is built, or matchlocks if a western power is engaging in trade.

The two tech trees have you decide whether to focus on economy and civic bonuses, or to focus on your military might. Or just, stradle the middle for a bit of a balance, develop both your armies and your clan roughly evenly, it all depends on the playstyle of your choosing.

The soundtrack is wonderful, calm flutes and string instruments during times of peace, tense drums and sharper wind instruments for violent encounters, etc. The artwork for the loading screens largely coming from actual pieces of Japanese artworks, complete with various gameplay hints, famous quotes, or simple poems for the loading screens. 

All in all, I highly recommend getting this game, especially with it's Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai expansion packs. Not quite so much for the individual clan DLC but whatever.

HOWEVER...

This game has a huge bug and there seems to be no way to fix it. It will freeze on the splash screen and nothing ever happens. I've tried a couple solutions I found online, such as deleting the ""modified.txt"" info from the ""C:\Users\Mike\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Shogun2\logs"" folder. But the file was already empty so the problem had to be something else, right? I then tried the idea that is floated around n the web about McAfee and Webadvisor causing a conflict that prevents the game from working properly, but I DON'T EVEN HAVE McAFEE. NOTHING WORKED. I am very, very disappointed.

If anyone has a real fix to this problem, please let me know.

Original (OUTDATED) review below:

I really want to give this game a thumbs up as I wholehearthedly think that it is a great game that deserves every player it can get, yet I can't get myself to do it. The fact is that CA is cheating the buyers.

Avatar conquest mode servers (basically Shogun 2 multiplayer) has been taken down since two months ago, yet CA haven't informed any potential buyers about this. This means that if you purchase this game, it will likely be soely single player or co-op with a friend. The fact that they aren't even hinting about this change on their Steam forum is scam in my book. They also tried to install RedChell spyware with all of their titles. Altough some say it was harmless, I sure think its shady of them to install it without informing the user in no way whatsoever. They have removed it now, but only after the massive backlash that they got from it.

So basically, if you don't mind not having access to multiplayer, go ahead and buy. But the fact that the price hasn't changed a bit to make it fair for people that were too late to experience it is greedy in my opinion, and I honestly don't think CA deserves that extra support until they reimplement it, or at the very least, put a warning on their forum. If they change this, I'll gladly change my review, but as of now, I suggest to wait it out and see if the situation improve before buying.",1531032465,1538209306,True,3,0,0.528186261653900146,3,True,False,False,76561198291114245,135,5,43620,211,15203,1601766283,1537372745.0,"Hi ts, please accept our apologies for the issues you experienced accessing some of the multiplayer features for Shogun II.

Sega and Creative Assembly have chosen their side and it`s not with us gamers. 

They have consistently shown that they are anti-consumer with their poor overall new game quality. They push out sequals as fast as possible and discontinue support for whatever came before, despite glaring issues in their games. They are poorly optimized and polished and serve only as cash cows for the developers to milk for a short time with DLCs that should have been included in the game from the beggining. I`m talking pay to play already in game factions and that sort of shady stuff. Not even new content.

Furthermore, they seem to have caught the SJW cancer that has been spreading around of late and would rather push an ideological/political agenda than create a game for their fans. When called out on this they choose to insult and even silence said fans for daring to have an alternate opinion. ""If you dont like the game either mod or just not play"". Women simply did not, and still don`t, play a leading role in world conficts. Ever. Accept it. The facts don`t care about your feelings.

Also, they add spyware to their games and lie about it. These people feel entitled to your information. So much so that they don`t even think they should have to tell you about it. Absolutley zero ethics from Creative Assembly.

CA said they don`t want people like us, you know their fan base, buying their games. Well heed the call gamers. CA and Total War are done. Their hayday long past. Put them out of their misery and stop supporting SEGA, Creative Assembly, and unfortunatley Total War (the innocent child in all of this).",1538185355,1538185355,False,13,3,0.366519331932067871,0,True,False,False,76561198148310626,61,4,2121,0,2121,1442632426,,

These inbred swamp troglodytes should be ashamed of their very existence. What a pathetic, mewling wimp you are if you are scared shitless of seeing a female in a game?

This cringeworthy behaviour is exactly why women don't touch their little peepee. These obese redneck cucks should crawl back to that shit-stained basement full of piss-bottles and tendies that they crawled out of.

I don't normally do Steam reviews, but seeing these piss-pot losers cry and whine for no reason makes me wonder if they deserve to be banned and shut down. No platform for misogynist troglodytes no matter how they screech.

As for the game, it is amazing. It has the fewest bugs and issues out of the series, has the music is the best of any game set in Japan ever made. The art style is ingenious, it is very beautiful. This game is literally dripping with polish.

Some people worry about lack of diversity in factions and units...but then this is set in ONE country, with clans and troops spread around the area of that one country. What diversity are you even talking about?

That said, the battles are a bit too fast and violent compared to the rest of the series. So if that bothers you, mods are your salvation.

76,44976023,english,"This is a great game and probably one of the best, if not the very best, Total War games. It oozes finesse, style, and has the all the core elements that are sometimes missing from other iterations of total war games. 

I noticed a lot of bad reviews by a bunch of people upset at female generals for Rome II citing its SJW / inaccurate but seem to fail to realize these are just video games. Comapred to other elements of Total War games that have existed since the beginning of the franchise, some historically inaccurate female generals aren't even that bad. All total war games require leaving reality at the door because they all will shit all over known recorded history because depending on a player's choice, history will be completely ripped apart and thrown out the window. Think about what these games allow to happen, you could have the Takeda Clan taking over all of Japan (With a living Takeda Shingen) instead of the Oda/ Tokugawa clans or a empire of Gaul ruling over all of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, or some other random kingdom, empire, nation rising to the top of the world that never happened in real life. Total War games are power fantasies, they allow us the joy and challenge of being the leaders in famous periods of history. So if including some female characters cross the line for you then maybe these games are not for you. There are likely more 'realistic and historically accurate' games out there but I bet they stuggle to be as fun and free as these games are. Because it gives the player so much freedom to recreate history in any way they wish. 

I also just want to point out, CA mentioned that if female generals bother you, just mod them out. Every single Total War game has so many mods that I am surprised if that mod doesn't actually already exist. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I saw so many downvotes and so much immaturity I felt like I needed to say this. I know this probably won't change any minds but I hope to reassure people who are interested in the game that Shogun II is a great game and that you should ignore this recent review bombs as they are not actually reflective of this game and are simply trying to attack CA, and there are other things that you could more rightly attack them for. I don't love CA actually, bad releases on the last few games (Looking at your Rome II), buggy games, too many DLC's (SPARTA IS NOT PART OF THE BASE GAME WHAT?!), etc but this female general kerfuffle is just plain bullshit.

28,44916313,english,"Shogun I TW- opened the door for decent RT battles between mixed armies of Infantry, Missile Troops, and Cavalry.

Rome TW I- opened the door for  the RT battles, WITH, Defense and Assault of realistic wall (Stone Wall), defended Cities.  The cities, themselves have buildings and streets (and by translation), different totals of occupants (people-population-men, women, & children).  Stone Walls were defended from their Ramparts (the top part of their walls).

We the purchasers, the gamers, had the pleasure of throwing articles down upon the attacking bad guys, or assaulting with ladders and rams the bad guys defending the bad city.

Rome I, and the following Midieval TW II, display realisticish worlds, with towns and cities, with POPULATIONS.  Computor Warfare and Conquest reached new heights.  

Now is not the place to mention (but I will), that MTW-II was too easy, and the British with their secure location, and their Longbows with stakes were unbeatable during the Middle Ages.  I won one game while blindfolded - - you get the point.

The Key Point;

After RT-I and MTW-II, the TW developers committed computor genocide, and eliminated the PEOPLE - and their Cities from their games (I'll comment on the awful Rome-II at the end).  In Empire, which targets the dawn era for massive European Urban development, excludes all.

In Shogun II, Japan has no people.  No Population.  No Cities.  All the developers offer are Forts - with wall a soldier can run up on, as if he was on flat ground.  The excuse is that, because of the tendency to earthquakes in Japan, (witness Fukushima's ongoing Nuclear disaster), that only Walls that are not Walls could be built, and certainly not cities.  Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima did not exist.  Truman had no one to use his Nukes on in 1945.  Those who believe that Japanese Forts have walls one can run-up on, thereby leaving no necessity for building Walls -in the first place- and, of course, therefore, cities and their occupants may be eliminated - as well, have not visited Japan.

In Shogun II, and Empire, The TW Developers retreated from the premise of the TW games, that of providing a somewhat realistic experience for the WARGAMER.  They have eliminated walls and cities and populations.  They have retreated from the early excellence that was RTW-I, where to defeat the Romans - as the Greeks, or even the Carthaginians, is a tacky pleasure.  Winning as the Carthaginians is a bit of work.  Play on Hard with no cheating, is quite fun.   The decent balance of RTW-I has not been equaled.

Shogun II has some beautiful artwork.  The Naval battles are decent.  But, one city state may support up to 2 stacks of Troops, that they clearly cannot financially support. So balance in Shogun II is also sacrificed.  The first Shogun, even with its age and limitations, - is much more fun.  Why have the Developers retreated?   My guess is that they saved $money on the development of the game, by hiring fewer Programmers.  They believe that the gamers are so addicted to Gaming, that they will buy almost anything, whether it is good, or mediocure.  Resembles our American citizens on election time.

The elimination of cities in Shogun II, reduces the game to a mediocure RISK.  Risk was, also, much more fun.  Japan without people? - without cities?

Rome II, which contains some potential toward measuring Culture,and its role in Ancient Civilization, is, simply, pathetic.  Only one city in 3 has walls (already constructed), and no other cities may build walls?  Syracuse without Walls?  How happy that would have made the Athenians.

God Bless!

[This review is from a Fall of the Samurai player]

Things I Like: 
- It's Japan. It's Samurai. 
- Weather actually effects things.
- Reminds me of The Last Samurai.
- The controlls for commanding troops are really useful and easy to use. 
- You can eventually make your own faction, breaking off from the Shogunate, for example, and trying to take Japan by yourself without a team victory!
- Music and sound are great and on point. 
- It still has those crappy TW in-game videos that we all love, to show a change or progress in time. 
- The graphics are great too
- Did I mention the Samurai?!?

Things I Don't Like: 
- The time limit to complete the main objective (this might be gone after breaking off from your faction. Will check later and edit this part)
- More units could be added but this isn't essential at all. There is a plentiful variety but I would like some of the same units with different weapons. Mainly just because the Samurai are so cool looking. Just an army of those please!

Diplomacy in Shogun 2 is broken; they made multiple patches that ruined it
Diplomacy in ROTS is quite a bit better; still quite a few logic issues; morale in ROTS seems completely broken; every army just runs away from one another in battle

General: 

Rating: T
Price: $29.99
Genre: Real Time Strategy, Turn Based Strategy, Historical
Time played: 89.9 Hours

Warfare set in Feudal Japan, control the armies and lands of your clan and crush all who oppose you on land and sea. Real time strategy at it’s best. 


Gameplay - 10 

In Shogun II, you take control of one of the 10 clans who are fighting over Japan. A mixture of turn based and real time strategy, you view your lands in the world map and command your armies on the battlefield. In the world map you can determine what needs to be built in each province you control, you only have so many building slots and have to build some troops require several different buildings. You also build your armies and naval fleets from the world map, moving them into conflicts with other armies brings you to the battlefield. Last but not least is your extra units, ninja, monks etc. They can be used against villages/towns armies and generals. Each has their own ability and requirements to recruit. 

The battlefield is where you pit your tactics against those of a AI enemy, you can also auto-resolve the fights, but you tend to lose a lot more troops that way and lose some fights that you could have won (make sure you quick save before doing that).  Each unit has its own level of experience and as they fight they get stronger and better at fighting.   Morale also plays a big role in battle, if you lose too many troops it can cause your men to pancik and flee the battle.  This also works against the enemy so keep it in mind. 

There really is too many things to explain about the game, the battles are real time and can be paused to plan your next move or a bathroom break.  The game despite the name isn’t just about Total War.  There’s a lot more than just the battles, although there is a battle mode, the logistical side of it is quite complex as well.  You have to worry about the different seasons, building up your provinces to support your military and navy, keeping people happy and of course producing enough money for everything you want/need. 



Story -  10

This is the story of the Feudal era of Japan, in all its glory (and gory). It’s historical, although you could change history depending on who you play. 
Music - 8

Nice and relaxing seems to fit the era.  No real complaints. Though I can’t say I remember any particular part of it. 


Graphics - 9

The game is from 2011 but still has some great graphics, not as good as the more recent Total War games obviously but it has still has staying power. 



Controls - 10(mouse/keyboard)

The controls are pretty straightforward and having played plenty of games like this they feel natural.  If might be possible to play with a controller, but i wouldn’t recommend it. 


Repeatability - 10

The game is solid and I never get tired of the battles, as the game progresses and you begin getting more and more powerful units the game just gets better.  You can try any of the 10 clans, each with their own strengths and weaknesses which can greatly change your playstyle. 


Multiplayer - N/A


I tried to play some of the Multiplayer, only got into the Avatar mode and could only play against AI.  Not sure if this is still playable online. 

Initial Thoughts: 

I got this game after already playing Total War: Shogun I and Total War: Rome.  I already knew what to expect but still enjoyed the game immensely. 


Soma Says: 

Ah total war, one of my favorite series. I guess I’m kinda biased since I own most of the Total War games and enjoy playing all of them.  This game is right up my alley, it’s a perfect blend of turn based/real time strategy.  I can’t recommend it enough.

97,44114270,english,"On this green, grassy field he lay. A peasant ashigaru. The cracks of muskets and the screams of men thundered all around him. His yari spear, dropped a few feet away from him, was trodden on by fellow men of Tokugawa as they charged into the fire. He could see the sashimono banners of the hatamoto, who rallied the men in the midst of the smoke. He peered at the defences on that hill. Smoke clouded his vision from seeing the soldiers, but the flashes of their matchlocks and the terrifying yells of their warriors marked out the enemy retainers of Ishida Mitsunari.

Blood flowed like rivers from bullet holes, staining his black ashigaru armour. It oozed around an arrow stuck in his forearm, like boiling tea in a kettle. In pain, he tried to remove the arrowhead. Grasping it with his weak right hand, he attempted to dislodge it from his arm. Gritting his teeth, he tried with all his might to pry out the arrow, but to no avail.

He gave up with the arrow. His arm was going numb anyway. The pain lessened a bit, and the man breathed heavily as he rolled over onto his back. No one around him would pick him up. They were too preoccupied.
The man, the lowly wounded ashigaru, was just one small pawn on this chessboard. It didn’t matter if he died. It did not concern anyone.

All around him, bullets and arrows whizzed like lightning. He could descry the orders of the officers, rallying men to fight to the last, with katanas raised in the air. Alas, he saw many drop from the relentless storm of projectiles, whittling down their armour. On the other side, the man weakly heard the screams of the Ashida, being torn to shreds by samurai and spearmen. 

He had thought he would go down a warrior. When this fight started, he hungered for honor and blood. And now here he lay, dying before ever slaying a single enemy.
“Heh.” he weakly muttered, noting the ironies of death. Of honor.

He coughed a little blood on his neck now, and his mind palsied, becoming more and more inert.

He felt a cold sensation rising in his spine. His breathing slowed. He was no longer jittering from his wounds. He couldn’t even feel them anymore. His strength withered away, and he could no longer keep his eyes open. 

All those sounds, the screams, the slashes, the smoke in his eyes. He didn’t care anymore. Slowly, the blasts all around him, the noise of carnage, faded away as peace, finally, peace, came to him. He started to smile a bit now. He would probably never open his eyes again in this mortal world, and he sensed his spirit slowly drifting to the next. He accepted that.

Maybe he’d join his family in the afterlife now. And see them as they were, before the samurai raid on their farm. When he joined the army, it was out of a desire to avenge them. To slay the ones who took his family from him.
Now, on that green, grassy field, as he withered away, he harbored no revenge. It just didn’t matter to him anymore.

Now that he can finally be with them again.

He could see it already in front of him. Blue, beautiful skies. White, puffy clouds like rice balls in the air. Rolling, green hills around him. A deer, grazing on a few branches from blossoming sakura trees. Just a little bit away, he saw the quaint farm. He saw his family, smiling in joy, and he ran to them through the meadows. He saw his little brother and sister, playing with their bamboo toys. He saw mother, in her kimono, weaving a basket. Father was ploughing the field. He had only to run a little more to be with them now. That little farmstead, so quaint, where time paused at the serenity of life…

But a whizzing arrow over his head brought him back to his senses, destroying his little vision.
A minute passed. And then another. The man was lying on his back, dying, bleeding. Blood drained from his face, whitening it like a towel. But that did not weaken his little smile. 

Another minute passed.
He could hear nothing now. Nothing from anything. He could sense nothing but the placidity of time.

“And now, I shall join you.”
And there he lay, giving a last, deep breath on that green, grassy field.

2,44064877,english,"Alright, I have over 1200 hours spent in this game so bear with me, this is going to take a moment. Long story short, its an amazing game. One of the best in my opinion if you want large unit style combat over the single unit styles of most rts games such as Starcraft.

Shogun 2 has a fairly simple unit structure where there are peasants (ashigaru), samurai, and monks. The peasants basically suck. The samurai are a general upgrade all round on the peasants, and the monks are slightly stronger than the samurai while having peasant level armor.

Its setup in a very simplistic rock-paper-scissors system. Swords beat infantry. Spears beat cavalry, and cavalry wrecks archers. Naginata are hybrid swords/spears so do relatively well in both applications. Naginata samurai also have the highest armor in the game making them nearly immune to missile troops. This versatility makes naginata likely the most over powered unit in the vanilla game.

Mods are great for the game. Ive probably written over a dozen for myself alone from diplomacy tweaks, to unit size and strength modifiers, or even changing the garrison composition of various stages of castles. As you get better you can ramp up the difficulty by modding the game to just about however you like.

As for cons…. This game does NOT use multi threads. Why the devs recommend a dual or quad core cpu is beyond me. The game will use a single thread to 100%, and will use 2 other threads at around 5% each. I assume the dual 5% usage is some background processes because the numbers never spike up. Often times in sieges unit sizes will grow to immense proportions 10,000+ units fielded. You might be expecting that you will suffer terrible frame rates or stuttering. While stuttering may happen if your gpu cant keep up, the bigger issue is the units becoming unresponsive. Unresponsive as in you give them an order to move from one spot to another, and it might take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes for the unit to start moving, and even longer to get all the men back in formation because part of the unit may stand in place and not move with the rest of their brothers in arms. The faster your cpu the less problems youll see from this. I went from a base 3.8ghz to a 4.3 overclock and noticed that the units were still responsive at larger fielded sizes than before, but anything over 6k fielded still result in some delay of response even at those speeds. I personally didn’t mind it up to around 10k where units just straight became so unresponsive, that they had better be where I want them to be the whole fight, because they aint freakin moving for me. If your rocking a 3-3.5ghz 10+ thread…. Well your probably going to struggle to even play with 4-5k men fielded because it wont leverage all those wonderful threads. Avg army sizes for non modded games are around 2-2.5k per army. You can field a max of 2 full armies at a time, and the enemy can attack with up to 4 armies but only 2 fielded max per clan. So if two clans attack your castle and each have 2 army stacks they can field all 4 armies at once. Youd better have your defenders set where you want them because they aint guna respond to commands even at vanilla unit sizes. If you mod unit sizes to increase them like I do…. Well fps will again depend on ur gpu(s) but units will still become unresponsive because of how little it can leverage your cpu.

In conclusion, this is likely my favorit total war game, and favorit strategy game to date. I love the unit style battles. The unit composition and city development is simple and intuitive, but God do I ever wish this game would leverage more of my system so its not so bogged down during those massive epic battles that I love so much. Ill just hope when they finally get around to releasing shogun 3 that it will make full use of all the core and then I can really ramp up the unit sizes to field 40 or even 50k troops in a battle (assuming my gpus don’t explode in a puff of smoke trying to render all that)!",1533982222,1533982222,True,24,0,0.742269337177276611,0,True,False,False,76561198021438425,98,10,93815,0,75484,1597984356,,

It gets really tedious really fast. Your trying to line up your archers while the enemy blitzs you.

So you have to realign again. meanwhile the computer is grabbing its horse mounted guys and swinging the other way so you have to pinwheel to the left and keep trying to rotate your armies to keep lined up. 

Or you're in a MASS battle where all your troops are in the middle. Its a goddamn clusterf!$k. But the enemy still singles out your general and kills him. Slaughtering the morale of your troops.

Realistically, yes. This is what you would expect in war. However, I would also expect a little more competency from my soldiers in war. Like, ""Oh shit, my general is being attacked. The friggen heart and soul of all this. I'm diverting my attention from this fu!#king bowman to make sure my general survives."" Even the trade routes aren't automated. You have to manual ly direct your trade ship back and forth. Its less than fun.

Also the things I wish they could've added was more clans to play: Ashikaga Shogunate, Honma and etc. (I know that the Ikko Ikki and Hattori clans are DLC and I have not played them yet so its up to you guys to purchase them or not) (Also to solve this steam has great mods)! Gameplay is excellent a must have in the Total War Franchise.

Edit: I bought all the DLC and I have to say that its worth the extra gameplay and the price (Except Rise of The Samurai its pretty awful and lackluster) The Ikko Ikki and Hattori Clan Packs are great and fun to play around with.

60,43485393,english,"Overall:  5/5    (Based on Enjoying Total War Style Games)  

If you're new to the series or want to try one out, this one I recommend.  
It's a little simpler to manage everything and turns pass faster than other entries. 


5/5 Gameplay:  
I'm definitely a fan of the gameplay style Total War games bring.  Shogun 2 has some interesting unit features like Ninja's that scale walls quickly and employ stealth on the battlefield.  Siege battles are fun when attacking or defending.  I can't recall if it's the General's bodygaurd or Samurai retainers (Strong Garrison Unit) that fight to the death and will not route.  Those dudes are badass and delivers the feeling of honor the Samurai portrayed.   I like that in Shogun 2 you can move units around without a General and ships are constructed in the province interface when selecing the ports vs needing to recruit in the city exclusively.  

5/5 Atmosphere and Art:  
Shogun 2 gives access to fascinating time periods and atmosphere.  The atmosphere this game generates is amazing.  The voiceovers, art, music, and sound effects contribute well to the overall theme.    

5/5 Performance:  
Game runs great now (1080 GTX) and ran great back then (7850 HD).

This is a vary good Total war game. To this day the graphics are vary pretty with some mods that make it even more so. Units are a little more responsive compared to older games. Navel battle is far better then Empire, however still a bit annoying. Combat has a good feel to it and most units have their place in the game, there's not to many useless ones. Diplomacy is a bit more advanced where alliances mean something. Realm divided is a vary good change making some new challenge to the map. N


However the game suffers from generals being far to soft and easily killable. Agents, as they are vary useful and fun to use are expendable for the most part. Gunpowder is a hit and miss thing with this game, can either do a lot or get your own men killed. Trade nodes are vary over-powered and once you catch most, you are secondly sound with opposition being vary low even in the hardest difficulties. The Tec-Tree is nice but can be a pain to advance at times. A lot of bonuses in the game tend to be worthless or tend to be to small to effect much.

72,43393515,english,"I'd say it's the best of the modern Total Wars, though those games haven't necessarily set a high standard in recent times.

The feudal Japan setting is great; it's an interesting time period — where firearms were starting to come into increasingly-widespread use, but the bushido way still was in full force. The campaign is way better than more recent entries in the series, and it just has that sort of ""arcade"" feel of the old total wars. Very exciting, but the vanilla version of the game has very little unit diversity. In fact, I'd say this game has the least amount of unit types among any game in the series and is a bit too ""rock, paper, scissors"".

It's got a LOT of technical issues. Despite being well over the recommended specs and running the benchmarks, the game engine tends to run like crap and become a slideshow in spots. Setting up custom battles can also be a pain as it will undo your settings if you realize that you want to switch sides or something, and there doesn't seem to be an option to rematch a battle. The game will also keep running in the background unless I exit via the campaign mode; really annoying having to ctrl+alt+delete just to quit a game! Further, it can crash without explanation during replays.

-AI of the other clans is cancer af, as enemies they are your worst nightmare and want you to suffer on the harder difficulties but the ones you are allied with (since the start of the game for example) play like headless chickens.

CA statement: ""Red Shell is a program we previously used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising – it’s not spyware.""

Concern:  Common defination of spyware goes as follow:  Software that enables a user to obtain covert information about another's computer activities by transmitting data covertly from their hard drive.


CA statement: ""It’s a marketing attribution tool that helps companies determine which of their adverts are most effective. It does this in a similar way to other analytics tools by using cookies to generate a unique token from device information, and comparing that with data taken from marketing campaigns and game activations. In this way, the companies that use it are able to see which adverts are more effective. You can find out more about Red Shell here: https://redshell.io/home""

Concern:  Again this fits well with common definations of spyware and its one of the most common uses for such software.  See http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-spyware  as an example.  Red Shell is hidden 3rd party program that the user is not made aware of on installation.  The value of the data or what it is for has no bearing on this.  This also leaves unanswered the question of what Red Shell is capable of and if the third party handling it gathers any additional information that it does not share with its customer.  In an era of information leaks and data hacks this can be important and doubly so since this is software that piggy backs off a different installation.  Software installed without your knowledge is not the same as a cookie that you can block.


CA statement: ""However, while Red Shell was only used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, we saw that players were clearly concerned about it and that it would be difficult for us to entirely reassure everyone. As such, the implementation of Red Shell was removed from all Total War games that previously used it.""

Concern: This shows a clear lack of respect for CA´s customers.  CA maintains that they did nothing wrong and puts the onus of the problem on customers being difficult to reassure rather then on the fact that CA should have sought consent for this information gathering.  


If CA does not think there was anything wrong with this behavior, how are we supposed to trust them not to repeat it?",1530646245,1530646245,False,17,1,0.600496172904968262,1,True,False,False,76561197966115739,639,55,7717,0,7717,1447764983,1530692679.0,"Red Shell is a program we previously used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising – it’s not spyware.

The base game is in my opinion the best part. the fall of the samurai DLC is good, but I much prefer the base. Rise of the samurai wasn't worth the money, it may just be me, or that the base game raised my expectations to high. But I would not have bought it if I had known. The ""clan packs"" are most certainly a fantastic addition to the game especially on sale. For once you cannot use the argument ""should have been in the base game"", because if the base game wants to be historicly accurate, then no, they shouldn't be in the base game. They bring parts of the sengoku jidai which were in the background closer to the spotlight. The blood pack should have been in the base game (aha you see how this agrument fits?). If this game is on sale then congratulations you just got a one way ticket to party central. If this game is not on sale then buy it now or wait until it is on sale. People will whine and complain about DLC's but compared to the other bull that's happening with more recent games this is nothing. I recommend you buy the Shogun 2 Collection if it's on sale because that is a lot of content for a very low price. If it isn't, eeeeeh. Hold off. Regardless this game is fantastic, and it's hard for me to believe it's seven years old.

The campaign changes an adaptes game during you play and with correct submods you will have 100's more unit, 100's regions and about 50 clans... it can get quietly hardcore if you play that  V/H.

I can't zoom in to enjoy the battles up close because you have to constantly be moving around the battlefield to make sure one of two things are not stupidly occuring.  

1.  If your units are on guard so the won't run off after broken enemies when your not looking and ruin your defense.
2.  If your units are on guard then enemies stroll right on by your guys while they just stand in one place!

Lack of warning sounds when units clash to alert you as to when so units are fighting that you can't see because your on the other side of the screen.

Without any mod it's even worse the guys run around so fast and stupidly it's a complete mess.  It just doesn't feel like I have any control over the battlefield as a general.

It's pretty obvious why they don't want anyone to actually possess the game discs anymore, and the lack of a actual manual is sorely missed for controls and unit briefs.  30 Dollars is overkill,  maybe for 5 and play auto battle for a Risk like experience.

Both diplomatical wise or battle wise this game is truly a masterpiece compared to the other games in this field. They fixed the evasive and weak archers which we had in the previous games, they fixed the issue with AI not attacking your settlements (this problem makes the other total war games unbearable) they added honour to make you stay loyal to your agreements. That way you don't go ahead and blitzkreig every clan you can ever find. 
To the ones who expects highly developped and complicated diplomacy that's not a thing you can find in total war games. Total war games are based on battles and ruling an empire. Sure TW has some sort of diplomacy system but it is nowhere close to the diplomacy system in paradox games. So I recommend you to buy paradox games instead of TW if you want to dive in a world full of intrigue. But if you want to lead an army, to victory if you want to lead a charge to the enemy that outnumbered you if you want to build a reign........

50,42636718,english,"So wow. What ab amazing game to start off with the TW franchise. Probably the second best game in the series, only behind Med 2, this game is a strategy gamer's playground. First let's start with the Campaign, where most people will play this game. Pros:
* This game has the single hardest campaign of any total war game, mainly due to the addition of the Realm Divide Feature, which finally makes End game a challenge. In any total war after, Rome 2, Warhammer, Atlilla ect, there comes a point at which you are so powerful you can simply stomp every other faction into the dirt. Not in this game. By mid game you will be one of 5-6 Powerful clans, able to field a mix of Samurai and Ashigaru armies, and by late Game, you will be left to deal with 1-2 other Superpowers. For example in my recent Shimazu campaign, when I finally made it to Kyoto and was crowned shogun, every other clan in the game declared war on me, save for my 4 vassal clans I had put between Kyoto and other clans as a buffer. The mightest of my enemies, the Hojo and the Ikko Ikki, had about 17 provinces each, and many powerful and experienced Armies, while the Mori, who had fled to the island of Shikoku, were harrasing my naval trade lines and causing great stress for my economy. Being put on the defensive by the Ikko and Hojo, I snuck an invasion force of 3 Armies composed mainly of Katana and Naginata Samurai, crushing the Mori and securing my naval ports. However, the Takeda clan, exiled to the island of Sado north of the Hojo, had the Black ship, a mighty Portuguese galleon armed with 24 cannon, which smashed through my naval attempts to land behind the hojo, taking out an entire army and one of my 5 Star Generals. Sending Ninjas and Monks to provoke rebellions in the Hojo's lands to distract them, I turned 6 of my Armies to the Ikko Ikki, Crushing them at their capital of Kaga, and wiping out their mighty Nagninata warrior monk armies. I sunk the Takeda owned Black ship by swarming it with over 3 fleets, comprised of Fire bomb Kobayas, Medium and Heavy Bunes, and even my personal shogunate flagship of the Nihon Maru, which allowed me to land on Sado and kill the Takeda clan. Plowing through Hojo lands from all sides, the final battle came outside the small settlement of Mikawa, where 5 full Hojo stacks met 5 Full stacks of my own in open battle. There were over 10,000 men on each side, and it took 5 battles to finally resolve the war. The AI on legendary is far better than normal in open field combat, and it took alot of effort to match the swarms of Katana and Yari Samurai, who were furiously assaulting my lines under support of European cannon. But I had recently recruited a unit of Shimazu heavy gunners, who broke up every charge into my lines. By the end of the battles, 2 of my generals lay dead, and much of my army was destroyed, but the Hojo lost everything, and with the annexation of their final city, I won the game and estabished my shogunate.
Any game that can make something like that feel real and immersive deserves a 10/10, and the amount of polish on this game is surreal. Absoulutely worth it",1528657868,1528657868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198139940280,16,1,16953,0,4272,1579141537,,

There are no shields, gunpowder is late game in base shogun 2 and there is little to no focus on siege units. Every faction has a role and is distinct from one another. The Otomo (a dlc clan) has gunpowder from turn one, the Takeda has amazing cavalry, the Hojo get improved siege units and the holy firerockets, this goes onn for every faction. The start of each campaign is mostly the same, this changes in the midgame and the lategame where you get access to your clan specific units which are for the most part fun to play with. You get to experience all the different factions and playstyles relatively quickly since the campaign map isn't gigantic.

Pros

- Good game mechanics (at times) 
- Can progress at a nice pace
- Great sound track/effects

Cons

- no AI assistance in handling your own troops, they will happily sit there being executred if you don't step in at all times
- religion issues, if the area isn't happy they just create a massive army to crush you out of thin air!
- the AI cheats at random, I had completed the main game then wanted to take over all areas, well my allies teamed up against me and massive armies kept coming out of nowhere.
- you cant be more specific with the tax as much as I wanted to.

So basically, I've had to quit this game because I can't progress it at all, allies attack me at both ends on land/sea with armies they couldn't possibly have generated with their income and such like, you can block ports or attack buildings and it doesn't slow them down it seems, its a shame as I would have spent hundreds of hours finishing this game in the way I wanted but its purely a waste of time fighting the impossible.......this has put me off the other total wars sadly, a shame as mostly they all get positive reviews.  

Maybe if I quit when the main mission was complete I'd be happy, but I want to go full powermonger mode and take over the island :)

0,41899108,english,"I can't really say that I know enough about the in-depths of the game to speak to that crowd, but I'll give my opinion of SHOGUN 2. The one complaint that comes to mind about the game is the set campaign length, I understand that due to the time period the game takes place in, certain things happened in real life that pushed the premise of the game itself out of the ""norm"" in the sense of how it relates to real life, however it's just a game and I'd really like a ""no time limit"" campaign, but that isn't a huge problem. The game itself is beautiful for when it was made and for the style of the game. I haven't played many of the Total War games, but have played Total War: Rome(barely) and Total War: Rome 2(40+ hours), so playing SHOGUN 2 is still a learning curve for me, but very enjoyable. Combat in SHOGUN 2 on any difficulty, the AI plays generally the same. Learning the mechanics of how to make the AI make moves that benefit you is fun and challenging at times. For example, if you're the ""attackers"", the AI will go for the nearest hill to it and sit there on top. However by positioning yourself in a specific way and ""baiting"" a unit here and there off the mountain you can eventually cause them to do a full push on you or push in yourself even with far weaker units than that of the AI. The multiplayer side of things is fairly ""dead"", I guess it'll depend on when you usually play, haven't played much of the multiplayer myself for two reasons, first being I'm still learning the game and don't want to get curb stomped too hard. The other is the fact that the people that still play multiplayer matches is few and far between, but I can for sure tell you it's not entirely dead and you can definitely still get a match often enough to not feel like you're waiting around for years on end. Has a cool system to it for leveling and what not, customize your own Daimyo and what not, levels and skills. It's a rework of the campaign skill trees and what not. I could go on a bit more about the game itself and some other quirks it has here and there, but if you've played Total War games before you'll probably be able to identify them pretty quickly once you begin playing.",1525664251,1525664319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198126671598,66,6,1329,0,535,1527592329,,

The economics of this game are a little different than last previous entries and may take some getting used to. Specifically, you now have to watch the food supply of your faction as a whole.

Campaign AI is vastly improved compared to previous games, as is battle AI. While not really that challenging on normal difficulty, they at least don't make incredibly stupid decisions anymore. The enemy will actually take advantage of isolated units or flanks in battle now.

The only negative thing I have to say about this game is the naval combat. It is boring due to the fact that most naval combat revolves around parking ships next to each other and boarding them. It's all just a matter of numbers, not strategy. But this is a product of the game's setting and the technology available.

The campaign map is more or less like the other Total Wars, except it is a huge recreation of feudal Japan with only that country in play. However it is not the campaign map that should concern you.

The multiplayer in this game is revolutionary, buy it solely for its multiplayer. Avatar conquest is the msot ingengious item Creative Assembly ever invented, and it is in fact a travesty that it has not made another appearance. What is Avatar Conquest? It is in fact this concept where you customize and name a general, can upgrade them from earning experience, and customize and unlock new troops through the map. The map acts as a recreation of a military map, where you move an idol back and forth to mark where you want your army to conquest. If you win a battle, the province where the idol is on is a place you win, and each province has a new unlockable; be it new cavalry archer or infantry unit, armor for your general, or retainers.

Retainers are a new invenetion that allow you to give buffs to your army, or debuffs to the the enemy army, and this is to better shape your combat playstyle.

Cons

- Requires a MOD to remove the Realm divide

+ Agents can be disabled with a mod.

Cons:
- Metsuke is BULLCRAP. The AI will SPAM THIS TO INFINITY AGAINST YOUR UNITS. IVE ALREADT HAVE A RUINED GAME BECAUSE OF THEM. - These agents deserves to be thrown to the pits off hell/Oblivion, and if was captured as a POW, would be executed on sight. Probably a bullet to the head and buried under unmarked graves.
- Still Unrealistic Realm Divide. - What if I DONT want to invade you, Shogunate? 
- Hatekeyama Clan starts divided and spreads like wildfire quickly. 
- Crappy Historical Battles, in Shogun 1 standards. - Luck based, you will have to be percise. 
- Naval Battles are slow and are uninteresting. - 
- Trade good being from trade points are Bullcrap - esp during Divide.
- Autoing and losing gets a very high chance of a Total Army kill. (WTF)

65,5487240,english,"I remember being 9 years old playing Civilization 4 on my Nintendo DS. It was the first military/political strategy game to really grab my attention and consume my life (as Sid Meier's games have done to many players). But I instantly wanted more; I was quickly off on a quest to find more strategy games. This is how I found the Total War series. I quickly gathered enough cash to purchase the Total War: Rome Anthology which I instantly fell in love with. I remeber sitting there watching that glorious opening cutscene for the first time and hearing that epic music. I played that game religiously and I only wish I had had Steam at the time to record the hours I had invested becasue I would not be surprised if it would be at least double the amount of hours I have invested in the later game Total War: Shogun 2. 
I was around 12 years old when Shogun 2 was released and I also purchased that off the interent and its box is another one of my most prized possessions. After really diving into Rome, I never really found another Total War game that itched the itch I had for strategy games. I had tried Medieval 2 and Empire and didn't really see much to rave over. Shogun 2 is a different story. This game absoluetely blew my mind back in the day and was another one of those games that consumed my life. Playing hours on end daily, deep into the night. This game not only has a stellar campaign and multiple worthwhile DLCs (Although this was the start if CA scamming players with a lot of unit DLCs and whatnot) but it had an active and fun online multiplayer which really changed the game for me. Going back, the graphics aren't as crisp as I had remembered but that's typical of older games. Everything looks and feels very smooth and polished and is overall a joy to intereact with regardless. I am still in love with this game's art style and in game graphics.

I realise it sounds stupid to not recommend a game I have played 175+ hours. However, I just have to. 

On the plus side, visuals are nice and after several updates, the game is rock solid. The time frame is appealing, and one can play several factions.

On the minus side, I will only mention a few of many. Few different units for each faction, which makes replayability suffer. Ridiculous commerce system. Continues previus dumb trend on multiple building locations in a single province, which CANNOT be selected in a single screen, and therefore greatly improves micromanagement...

And the WORST of all, a complete lack of tactical concept in battle. This is a point and click simulator. Choose one of your units, point to an enemy unit and hope for the best. There is really nothing you can do. Each unit is composed of over a hundred Usain Bolts on steroids that can run 400 metres in under 20 seconds, maybe 15 on a good day.

Since half the game is the resolution of battles at the tactical level, I cannot recommend this game.

good things:
- the units were cool and useful.
- the sieges are very fun to play even in custom battle to test how big of an army you can defend against.
- historical battles were interesting.
- even if there was not that big amount of units to choose from the units used were useful and had balanced stats.
- heroes were really good but not overpowered against other infantry units ( except maybe ashigaru but they are useless anyway except as meatshields, holding the enemy at bay in pike wall formation, and against cavalry).
- a lot of castles to choose from in siege battles.
- factions were specialized for different units like Shimazu had better katana samurai and Oda had better ashigaru units.
- the rise of the samurai DLC has a lot more ships to choose from.
- the rise of the samurai DLC has ship battles that are a lot more fun than in the normal shogun.
- the police or whatever they were named were really useful when bribing armies even if it cost a lot.

bad things:
- when you are fighting a siege with a lot of units in the battlefield your units don't want to get onto the walls to shoot at the enemies and if you told them to do that they would just stand there frozen until you gave them a different order that did not involve walls.
- if you wanted to tell your troops to scale a wall in a big battle with many units they will just stand in front of the wall while getting shot until you give them another order that doesn't involve walls.
- if a big battle happened somewhere in the battlefield the bodies started rotating in the ground and it slowes down the performance.
- allies were pretty much useless because they only gathered an army and stood around their own castle until the war has ended.
- if an enemy declared a war against you they will just gather an army and sit around in their own country.
- enemies never disband any troops in the campaign and there might be an army with half of the enemies are horsemen and the other half is archers.
- the rise of the samurai DLC has useless units and a low amount of units to choose from.
- the rise of the samurai DLC's campaign is very boring.
- the ninjas (agents) were only good for delaying enemy armies and killing their generals

Hmmm, isn't that odd? I'm pretty sure I bought ""Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai COLLECTION"", which, as the name indicates, should, as a normal game collection does: The Original Game + Fall of the Samurai DLC's

I unistalled only all the DLC's. Oh, The game still opens, so I do own a copy of the gam?. But it now has no campaigns at all.

I do believe that is false advertising, as in no visible place was ever stated this was supposed to be a standalone and the only place I was able to found the information that that collection was actually a standalone was in an old forum thread and it seems this malpractice has been happening for quite a while.

As Brazil not only has shitty internet, we also have a really shitty legal system, even though I am pretty sure this is clearly a case of ""False/Misleading Advertisement"", it is still pretty easy for me to just ask for a refund and forget about you.

The fun story is, I actually already like this game and wanted to buy it because my brother gave away his original CD copy to a friend years ago and I was really dying to buy it and play again, not any DLC, the game. 

When you are quite a depressive person is kind of a big deal, amirite?

So, if I can dissuade you from buying this game, please do.
Malpractice should be met with a bad review to let others know people have been wronged and maybe deny a bit of the money which there clearly is greed for, to the point of trickery in advertisement.

Over the years, one issue has cropped up countless times: Stability. 

This game crashes, but only during battles. You can't save during battles, only on the campaign map. When battles are sometimes very closely fought and can take up to 30 mins - 1hr, the game crashing at the end of, just after, or while loading after a battle, is extremely frustrating. 

Any game which has such a glaring issue with no solution I can't justify giving this a positive review. For all the great times I've had in this game, however infrequent they are, those crashes always come at the worst possible time, and usually I can't be bothered to play the game again for months afterwards I'm so angered by it. It just totally ruins the game for me. I spend every battle nervous, anxious, in the back of my mind knowing I might be doing all of this for nothing.

Your job is to conquer, and thus unify, Japan, through mostly military might, subterfuge, and assassinations, though having a few vassals helps too. The game is fairly respectful of the timeline and events in the real Sengoku Jidai, including the introduction of personal firearms from the Europeans.

There are inherent problems with the Total War gameplay. In Rome II you basically load up on calvary and steamroll through the campaign. The same goes for Shogun 2 with cannons. 10 cannons and a couple support troops to guard them will win almost every battle.
Because of this I highly recommend upping the difficulty or avoiding that type of play style. Instead of playing to win, play to make things interesting. One of the most enjoyable parts of my campaign playthrough was losing a battle after going through undefeated basically. Coming up with a strategy to take back the land I had lost was a challenge and downright fun. So dont get into the groove with your combat troops. Switch it up to make it interesting.

tax has been simplified so its faction wide insead of being able to set differing rates per city. im not sure if that is new addition to the series or has been around for a while but its a step backwards from the earlier editions ive played. 

 no more retraning a unit to gain better armour or replace lost men they just regain a few casualties a turn. as long as you spread out your losses you can take on even medium sized forces and effectively take no losses as they will all have been replaced the next turn. again i dont know if its new but it takes a big chunk out of the complexity of managing an army

i found it kind of buggy and glitchy. from units not being loaded onto boats to bad pathfinding to parts of units getting killed for no reason. not only that i had a few freezes needing a forced close. 

this is more a nitpic than anything else but it really annoyed me, if you loot a city after taking it you loose honour. honour affects citys map wide and plays a factor in how loyal your generals are. so if you raid 1 or 2 cities you instantly find all your regions getting unhappy and get your generals swapping sides on you. it is such a massive drawback to do even a small ammount of it that they might as well have just not bothered to put it into the game. 

another annoying thing the ingame encyclopedia it has all the dlc included but it does not tell you it is dlc. 
""oo that looks like a nice upgrade to my standard archers, i am supposed to be the archer clan afterall. i think i'll try and make a few of them"". 
after going through 2 new skills on the tech tree making my city bigger to house the needed building and then building it and upgrading it i find out ive just wasted 15 turns and a bunch of money. 

im not a dedicated follower of the total war series. ive played some in the past but i skip some and dont get them as soon as they are on sale, this has felt like a real step backwards to what they used to be. its a pity, ive been looking at the warhammer games they have been doing the last few years thinking i might pick them up during a sale maybe but after playing this im having second thoughts. knowing the dlc is needed not optional and they might have stripped out much of the nuance i remeber fondly.",1519064480,1519064480,False,2,0,0.43995589017868042,0,True,False,False,76561197996718490,240,3,2051,0,1892,1519158495,,

93,39881002,english,"10/10  - Best stragegy game out there. My personal favourite game of all time. 

By far the best in the series, Total War: Shogun 2 represents everything the developers got right before they started to lose track with Rome II and Attila. Without the bugs, complexity and lack of optimization of its successors, and improving on all of the issues from its predecessors, Total War: Shogun 2 has a a simple UI with clear cut and well balanced unit types. It has just enough variety to vary tactics and have progression, but not enough to unnecessarily complicate the game for no good reason. Graphically, it is extremely well put together. The gameplay is satisfying, the turn-based map in conjunction with large, real-time battles make for a very intuitive and fluid experience. 

It's DLCs were a very welcomed add-on that added a new dimension to my gameplay should I so choose to use it. The Rise of the Samurai expansion retains only the core mechanics while pretty much changing every element within the same game, being a very worthy expansion. Fall of the Samurai completely revamps the map and mechanics of the game to reflect the era and it is basically a whole different game. Back when DLCs used to mean something, this was how they were like, and how they were supposed to be. 

This game makes for an excellent single player experience. The difficulty can be tailored to how you want it to be, be it as a game to relax and unwind, or as a challenge to put your skills to the test. 

For those who want more variety, complexity, and/or more options in gameplay, wait for CA to release a better game than what they have been producing after Shogun 2. For those who need more of an adrenaline rush, play the top online games instead, like PUBG. For those who want story, try Fallout. If you enjoy micro-managing finances and logistics, play Hearts of Iron. If you are not a fan of the genre even after playing this game, then there is no hope for you to change your mind. Total War: Shogun 2 is the perfect game for making you feel like a great general claiming land for your own clan and defeating your enemies. 

This is a game I can play until I die. Leave me alone on an island with a good computer and a copy of Total War: Shogun 2 and the only other things I will need in life are water, food and a chance to reproduce.

The. Best. Total War game to ever grace this Earth (So far, that is). 

What makes it fun is the deviation from most major wars or time periods that Total War is usually known for. Even though every Total War game is diverse in it's setting and different and fun units to play around with, this one has Samurai, and has one of the best time periods to make a Total War game about. The struggle for Japan, clans fighting and turning on each other for total domination of all of the country. Although the naval combat is slow, the land battles and sieges is where the game truly shines.

Pros:
- Land Battles and Sieges
- Stunning visuals that still look good today
- Campaigns
- Multiplayer

Cons:
- Naval Combat

yeah, that's about it for me.

TL;DR: The game is absolutely amazing. Must have for any RTS lover.

45,39402914,english,"Probably the most ""perfect"" Total War game there is.

That being said this game is extremely fine-tuned, and the balance between economy, land military, and naval power is razor-honed. The Realm Divide mechanic is absolutely beautiful; in most Total War games, once you blob to a certain extent, the game is basically over; the Realm Divide mechanic triggers once you get too large, and essentially turns all of Japan against you, meaning that instead of a slow grind to world conquest once you get too large, the game consists of you carefully tip-toeing, grabbing the important land, then preparing for the inevitable GO GO GO! of Realm Divide, ending with you capturing Kyoto, and totally avoiding the boring grind of end-game Total War.",1516152102,1516152102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198087647750,233,95,3753,0,1984,1562320412,,

In this gaem you take on the role of a DAIMYO (a super powerful leader of clan).
You take control of your province and produce ASHIGARU (peasants) and SAMURAI (cool badass warriors).
Wage war with other DAIMYOs by commanding the formation of armies in epic battles nandeska. 
You ever saw THE LAST SAMURAI? The battles are epic like that. Press ""N"" to zoom in for full glorious combat camera.
Crush those bakas and claim your waifu!!
If you are a beginner, I recommend the Chosokabe clan. They have powerful archers. 
Also, the Hojo clan has the TriForce so they are strong.
Gomenasai my review is quite short but trust me it's super SUGOI!!!!

Just remember one thing. Don't let your troops run from the enemy because it is a SHEIMFUR DISPREY.

Nani???

CONS
- Realm Divide is annoying. It feels a tacked on mechanic just to spike the difficulty.
- Naval battle is boring gomenasai

TIPS
- Invest in METSUKES and NINJAS they are super sly and crafty.
- Be mindful of the food intake of your empire
- Always trade with friendly clans and try to marry into their family to strengthen alliance
- Scam Load if you are having difficulty
- Always kill routing SHAMEFUL peasants
- A Veteran ASHIGARU is better than a neophyte Samurai
- Cavalry are most effective when attacking from behind. Sandwich them between your YARI ASHIGARU and CAVALRIES.
- Sadly, Tom Cruise is not in the game.",1513694657,1513694822,True,0,1,0,3,True,False,False,76561198073125510,124,17,3034,0,1743,1518273671,,

For dlcs i would say that fall of the samuri is a ok dlc but it is vary hard. As for the clan dlcs get them all of them the ikko ikki is the worrior clan where no one likes them since they dont belive in budisum or christianity and you have to fight your  way to the shogun or the otomo who are allied with outsiders from Eurpe who give you guns and give you a better weapon advantge for a good ammount of the game or the hittori my favorete being the stealth clan with your armies filled with ninjas and ninja warriors you are already freinds with the current shougun and you can almopst act like there protector untill you get tierd of them and biuld up your armies and assassinate the shogun. or play as the normal clans where you can be good with boats archers you could be rich with gold or with resorces you can be diplomic or a warrior. You can go about the game however you want by preforming online battles or fighting AI  and for the online story mode you can create your own cherecter and clan exclusivly for online story mode but it is still a fun thing to do. going back to dlc for a second just so i can cover the rise of the samuri i have not had a chance to play it but i heard that it is good from some of my freinds who do have it.

i would rate this game a 10/10 for it amazing soundtrack and overall fun game. so you can just scroll up to the top of the store page right now and buy this game it is worth every penny just for some more refrence to help you with a review on the game watch angry joes vidio ill even give you the link. https://youtu.be/o5PIIOY2KS4",1513212460,1513212460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198141206156,45,7,6021,0,4167,1590874790,,
42,38273942,english,"This is a sequel to the first game in the series, set in the  16th century Japan. That means you’re only ever warring over the islands of Japan itself. So there’s no global empire to worry about, just a shogun to impress and ultimately overthrow.

[b][i]Total War: SHOGUN 2[/i][/b] doesn’t do anything differently than previous Total War offerings. The main campaign game is split between a turn-based map of Japan, with battles being resolved in real-time unless you decide to skip them and have them auto-resolved by the computer.

[b][i]Total War: SHOGUN 2[/i][/b] is a brilliant reinvention of the series that maintains the epic of scale of battles and yet increases the accessibility and focus.

[b]THE GOOD[/b]
- Stunning graphics
- Great period detail
- Multiplayer

[b]THE BAD[/b]
- Naval combat is boring
- Too much civil management during the end game.

I've only played this game for a few hours and can already game the AI pretty hard with a variety of tacics.  From what I can tell, advancing in difficulty does not increase the skill of AI opponents, it merely gives them a variety of unfair advantages and expects you to play harder to get around them. 
I don't find this particularly fun in a grand strategy game.  I don't like face stomping easy AI opponents that are on equal terms as me.  I also don't like thinking of really smart/clever moves only to have that work negated because the AI opponent is able to cheat.  Unfortunatly that's pretty much what this game is about.

58,35001185,english,"Total War shogun 2 is a stratagie game where you start out as a war lord in Japan, you slowly destroy other tribes and eventually gain the title of Shogun, aka the leader of Japan. And as you destroy more and more tribes the more Shogun starts to notice you and your growing tribe. It's a good game but It's not the type of game you should play when other people are around. I don't mean that in the sense that there is hentai or porn, I mean in the sense that this game is boring to watch but fun to play.

Although I've haven't done it yet, I love trying to take over Japan and become the Shogun. My games generally involved me getting an army of over 1,000 men and them storming the country but they eventually make a dephaset so I lose money then raise the taxes and then there is a rebellion but screw them, I have an army of a thousand people and they have what, two hundred bowmen? I love the style of Japanesse artwork (Not in the sense of anime style, more in the sense of The Great Wave) and their ancient culture, even if they stole most of it from China. The way this game works is amazing, the AI isn't stupid and some times I feel like they are better than me at the game. I remember one time I had this huge battle with another empire and over a thousand troops died and then the warlord of the other tribe was like ""that battle was a tragidy on both sides, the fighting needs to stop."" But I was like ""No"" and I destroyed his empire. 

It's really fun and I would suggest it to anyone who wants to get into the stratgie genere or all ready likes it. It's a stressful game but you can elimenate your stress by elimenating the other tribes.

-Naval battles leave a lot to be desired.

Consider this before buying, and be prepared to bear, since it will be kind of frustrating [read on only if you don't mind knowing game mechanics before playing. If you want to explore by yourself, stop here]. First is a feat called Realm Divide. It's supposed to keep game balanced after having certain number of provinces, because you will be too powerful to the clans in front of you. Got surprised when whole Japan declared war against me first time. This mechanic fails since puts even your allies against you at some point. All good diplomacy work will wither in time. Even weak vassals will turn against you for no reason. Even if you become Shogun before capturing the number of provinces required to make it active, Realm Divide will apply as negative diplomacy turn by turn. It would be cool if you could order those against you to commit seppuku, for example. Or to order allies to hunt your enemies, as Ashikaga shogunate does. Second problem is difficulty on hard mode and beyond. Overall game mechanics do not apply to AI. It will be allowed to have a full navy and/or a stack army while retaining only one poor province, for example. Agents will fail with high chances too. Third is the game exploits needed to win on hard mode, like selling military access, which makes evident that you're playing a machine, and spoils fun.

Basically, this general (who happened to be the daimyo's son) and his army defected because of his overly-ambitious wife. After his assault of the remainder of my army began, he defected back into my army with a troop of archers. We still lost the battle (the other army had two other generals) fracturing the army into two. One is a few archers, the other, well, is the daimyo's son. As the battle began, the enemy never approached him. He was forced to walk out into archer fire, surviving 6 volleys of arrows. Once he survived that, the archers spread aside, leaving him in a one-on-one duel with the enemy general. He then died fighting for the honor of the family he betrayed.

15,36140836,english,"[h1] What is Total War: Shogun 2? [/h1]

If you've never played a Total War game before, you're going to be managing two layers of the game. The first is the map, in which you'll conduct diplomatic actions with your neighbors, construct cities, train troops and set political policies. The second layer is the battlefield, where you'll take your trained troops and generals into battle and hope they come out the other side as victors. 

The goal of the game will be to take most of Japan including the capital. The full campaign and fast campaign change how much 'most' covers, but they're functionally the same.


[h1] Let's talk about the battlefield. [/h1]

Are you the sort of player that really enjoys carefully plotting out where your units should be placed, when they should engage vs hold their ground and look for holes in the defense of your foes to force them to route away from combat? Then this is half the game for you.

In other Total War games, you had a dearth of units to choose from. In this game, all factions have the same units, with the exception of a unit only that faction can create. From better peasant archers to better assassins, there is something each faction excels at. These units form a rock-paper-scissors type dynamic, but more focused than in previous games. Because of this, the battlefield feels like combat resolves quicker than in other Total War games.

There are three types of battles: land battles, sea battles and sieges. Land battles use your land troops, and have you fight to the death or until one side routes off the battlefield. Sea battles are very similar, except they use boats. Sieges have you assaulting forts, keeps and castles in an attempt to take them for your own. While naval combat wasn't introduced in this iteration of the game, this was the first game where it wasn't a chore to deal with.


[h1] What's the deal with the map part of the game? [/h1]

While you'll be cutting a bloody swath on your way to becoming emperor, there's still quite a bit you'll need to take care of OFF the battlefield. From promoting your generals with new abilities to replenishing your troops, there's no end to the things you'll need to manage within your borders.

Of course, that's not where the map ends (unless you've won, then your borders ARE where that ends) and so you're going to need to manage politics to keep allies happy. Unless you plan to conquer Japan alone (which is something you can attempt, it's just hard) you're going to need help. Of course, eventually friends become foes or vassals, but the map screen allows you to manage this as well. I was fond of having lots of assassins for this purpose.


[h1] So who is Shogun 2 for? [/h1]

While all fans might enjoy the game, I feel that this iteration of the series was the best jumping on point for new players. So if you've ever held interest in a Total War game but felt intimidated by the scope of it, Shogun 2 is probably the best place to start.

If only one side of things interested you then you might want to look elsewhere. If you liked the idea of the battlefield, check out other RTS games like Supreme Commander or Starcraft II. If the map screen interested you, check out grand strategy games like Europa Universalis 4 or Crusader Kings II.


[h1] Oh what about all the DLC? [/h1]

So there's a lot of DLC. There are three new factions and while they're not essential, I do think they add a lot to the game.  There are also three unit packs and I feel that they're quite balanced, but they're really not needed. However, if you (like me) missed the unit variety in other Total War games, they go a long way towards fixing that.

Finally the ""Rise of the Samurai"" campaign. If you play and enjoy the main game, this will add a lot to your play time. The units it adds change up gameplay significantly in both the map and on the battlefield. The new factions are very different from the others and the campaign itself takes place at a very different time which is great. This DLC should be on your list of things to get to enhance the game.


[h1] What about ""Fall of the Samurai""? [/h1]

A standalone expansion. It doesn't care if you own the original game, and you're not missing anything if you don't buy it. It's taking place during the 19th century, has a larger focus on guns, and has it's own DLC. That being said, it's highly regarded so if you enjoy this game it's entirely likely you'll like that one as well.",1509370972,1509370972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970789804,1712,88,2273,0,2270,1421787986,,

In my reciepts, I have a reciept for only the fall of the samurai DLC for shogun 2. However, If I go to my steam library, I am shown that I own shogun 2, with the fall of the samurai DLC. However, if I start the game and look at the campaigns, the shogun 2 campaign is locked, and only the DLC campaign is available, despite steam thinking that I own the full game. How? Why? The how seems simple; apparently, when you buy fall of the samurai, you get a stripped-out version of shogun 2, except whatever lazy bastards put the game on steam didn't bother making it its own discrete entity. The why is what I'm still stuck on. Apparently, the people who made the game wanted it to be possible to buy just the rise of the samurai without the base game, the idea being that people who just bought rise of the samurai would then turn around and give them more money for the other campaigns. However, I have no clue how to buy the main game now, since steam thinks I already own it. I could try buying a second copy and using that key instead, but I'm wary of spending $30 on what's essentially a bet on whether that would actually work.

53,35704604,english,"Samurai, Ninja, Daimyo, Sengoku Jidai, Sekigahara, and Japan. This is the beginning of Shogun Total War. The game takes place in Medieval Japan, where the rule of the Ashikaga Shogunate is waning to the arguably more powerful warlords, known as Daimyo. This, however is not the game we will discuss. It's sequel, Shogun 2 Total War, is considered the last great game made by Creative Assembly in 2014. But is this game worth it? Well, my answer is yes, as I have well over 700 hours into it, and today I shall share why that is the case. So stay tuned as we walk through the greatness that is Total War Shogun 2.

The war for control of the Japanese Shogunate has gone on for well over 100 years. In this game, you have the chance to take one of nine clans to greatness with your sights set upon the capital, Kyoto. The obstacles in your way include the great clans and the Shogun himself, as well as his small clans following him. This real time strategy game requires a deal of creativity and luck as the AI have a slight advantage on higher difficulties like the 15% tax increase gained on legendary. 

This is essentially not too bad as it makes the game far more dynamic, forcing you to rethink strategies you originally thought was understandably misinformed, and create a counterbalance of troop stations to meet the demands of the people under threat. 

The buildings and public order situations are nothing new to the Total War games and are balanced for the most part. This was also the first Total War game I played with the skill and research trees, and I say that it was a fantastic inclusion for the Total War series as before this I thoroughly enjoyed the Civilization series for a similar reason. 

The agents return for more death and public order control. The assassin is the ninja,and the special police is the metsuke, and the priest from medieval 2 returns and monks are their Japanese counterpart. The agents are a all useful but not entirely necessary. You are able to manage without any agents; it might be slightly more interesting and viewer entertaining if your armies are unable to move three turns in a row however.

While all of this was basic, I appreciate your time for checking out this video and reading this post. I thoroughly enjoyed all the times I have played this game as there were times I took entire castles with only 4 of my units on the battlefield. The staple real-time strategy battlefield ultimately gave me the most fun. The political game made me feel like it could have been expanded upon, but I was very satisfied in that department overall. The trade nodes located at various positions on the map are a very ingenious way to force me to actually invest in a navy. At no point in the game was I thinking war was impossible, as I knew that sometimes I had to take advantage of my alliances to prepare for a new war in a different direction or against said allies. 

In these troubling times, we must look to our own for victory. These words hold true in all Total War games. But a much better statement is actually from across the sea, “Put your men in a position from wince there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight.” -Sun Tzu The Art of War.",1507941796,1507941796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069405021,112,2,77663,0,42064,1598654332,,

The multiplayer gaming adds a great layer, as human intelligence and strategy makes for far more difficult battles.  Humans can drop into campaign battles, by the way.

The UI is simplified and the graphics are beautiful years after release.  The family and general system is interesting; would have been nice if veteran units could emerge in singleplayer the way they do in multiplayer.

+ many unique units for each clan
+ hero units add to the epicness
+ the DLC are great, especially Fall of the Samurai

- relatively small map. If you want bigger maps TW Attila is the way
- feel like TW Attila is more complex due to extensive family/clan management, unique faction mechanics, diverse maps

82,35271824,english,"Disclaimer - this review is based on SHOGUN 2 - Fall of the Samurai standalone DLC, which I own and played.

If you ever played Total War games, you've probable heard of legendary Shogun, father of the series.
Shogun 2 does a great job reintroducing modern player to 17(!)-years old classic game, buffed on lately introduced mechanics and gorgeously looking graphics.

This game is good in its core, it's really good. Interesting to play, challenging and fun. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but it was truly my childhood dream, to play Shogun together with a friend, and it came true. Unfortunately, I can not give it tumbs up because of how angry I am right now.

If you look into steam forums of this game, you'll find that it's infested with various bugs, such us your units dying without reason, and many others. I'm not gonna collect them here, just describe the ones I encountered in coop with my friend. I've split them into two categories.

Fucking annoying:
[list]
[*]Coop group binding - so imagine you starting a battle, say you take right flank and your buddy is on the left. You set the formations, bind the groups. Now, if you use same keys as your coop partner (ex ""1"") your units will highlight when you press it, but they won't listen for your command, they'll listen to your partner commands. And wise-versa, creating literal chaos on the battlefield.
[*]Dialogue windows (aka pre battle info, diplomacy) randomly opening up for wrong player.
[*]Minor coop restrictions - you can not choose weather when attacking, you can not pursue routing enemy forces, battle just instantly ends. It may sound like something pretty neglectable, but imagine situation where you need to destroy a fleet composed of 1 (ONE) ship. You attack, take casualties and sustain damage, shoot the fucker, he craps his pants, and run. Battle instantly ends, fucker retreats with full health, but you lost some crew and guns. WHAT THE FUCK. Then repeat it 3-4 times till RNG gives you one-shot-kill on him. And prepare to do this A LOT, since AI thinks it's a good strategy to spam 1-ship-fleets all day long.
[/list]
Fucking game-breaking:
[list]
[*]De-synch - so basically expect that at some point your game will warp into parallel universe, where you only think that you play beside your friend, but in fact you play with AI imposing your friend, and same on the other side. Units on global map will be in different spots for you two, composition of armies and fleet will differ, result of auto-resolve battles and so on. At some point your game will stuck, for instance if your buddy attacks an army, and in your ""universe"" that army is out of reach. In this case game will freeze, non of you will be able to do anything apart from forced quit via ALT+F4. Why this even a thing, why in all heavens it was implemented... Fucked if I know. To fix this, you need to take save file from host, and send it to client to override existing one.
[*]Campaign camera movement bug - another random ""surprise"". In short, at some random point your camera will basically stuck. No WASD movement, no screen edges with mouse, nothing. Well, to be fair you still can click on the minimap, but it's... Inconvenient to say the least. And you can not fix it via in-game means. Reload, restart, nothing will help. In order to fix this, I was forsed to use cheat engine to unpack save file and modify it.
[/list]

I don't know what else I could say. This bullshit is fucking horrendous. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this game at any circumstances. It's fun to play. But be prepared to encounter shitload of annoying and game breaking bugs.

Fix your shit CA, you are selling a broken game for more than 5 years for fucks sake.

P.S.: Oh, and BTW, buying SHOGUN 2 - Fall of the Samurai will NOT grant you SHOGUN 2. Steam will say that you own it, but in fact you're not, you still have to buy it separately. Not complaining, just pointing out strange glitch in steam store.

83,35258195,english,"If you're a fan of the Total War Series, then this review is worth reading.

This game is a bit different to what you're used to:

First up, I have a mid-level setup, and the game has a tendency to lag mildly, regardless of which graphics settings you use.
The unit sizes are larger then any other Total-War game I have played, and the soldiers do not fight in formation as a legionary-cohort would, with an emphasis on individual 1v1 combat, making it difficult to maintain a consistent battle-line.
battle tactics also differ, as there is little in the way of tactical formations which you may be reliant on in other Total War games.
In siege-warfare games, you may be used to the enemy either blowing a hole in your wall at certain points, or assaulting them with siege towers, making for a predictable attack which you can properly respond too. Japanese units in Shogun 2 however will instead opt to literally climb a castles walls, making it far more difficult to predict exactly where the enemy assault will land, and forcing the defender to spread defenders liberally across all walls in an attempt to protect all possible attack points. In essence: there are no tactical choke points, and gates are of no consideration and are only used when defenders wish to leave the castle, being bypassed by attackers altogether.

In terms of Gameplay: Shogun 2 has much in common with Total War: Rome 2. Unit control is as intuitive and responsive as Rome 2, with non of the slugishness, glitching around walls or outright refusal to follow orders as can be experienced in Total War: Medieval 2.
There is also far less diversity of units available in Shogun 2, although there are a dozen or so Japanese factions to select from, each with their own skillset, all units are simply recoloured to signify allegience with no faction-specific units.

Shogun 2 is not a bad game, but I much prefer Rome 2 by comparison. The gameplay is however... different, and any tactics you have developed in other Total War games, are not transferable to Shogun 2 due t the unique Japanese fighting style.",1506591441,1506591441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198059412059,40,1,2663,0,789,1599578960,,

8,35014746,english,"SHOGUN 2: Total War is - and is likely to remain as - one of the all-time greatest strategy games ever made.

Now, SEGA hasn't disappointed players with their line of Total War games; they've always been realistic, they've always been pleasing to the eye, and playing a Total War title has always been satisfying. Hell, Medieval II still holds up well despite the weird unit-mushing thing. But SHOGUN 2 takes the cake.

First things first; this game is about Samurai. SHOGUN 2's main campaign takes place during an integral part of Japan's history, in the 16th century following the Onin War. The country's land was held by numerous Clans, all of which wanted their Daimyo to become Shogun. There are two heads of Japanese government at this time - the Emperor, who was more of a figurehead, and the Shogun, who acted as Japan's de facto ruler and supreme commander of their military. In case you're still unaware of why this timeframe is important: Oda Nobunaga's in this game.

The player controls their clan on a military, political and economic level on the world map, which is turn-based like every other Total War campaign. All Clans start with 1-3 territories under their control, with the end goal being to control the majority of Japan, and the province of Kyoto where the seat of the Shogunate lies. Your faction's leader and other leader units like Generals have RPG-style progression, where they gain levels and have big, branching skill trees to suit their role. Not only do generals and the Daimyo progress, but all special units do, like your Ninja, the subterfuge unit. The early campaign is extremely tense, with rivals on every side that are all fighting one another simultaneously. That being said, the Campaign only gets harder the more provinces you hold, as other Clans can - and always do - unite against you to prevent you from progressing closer to becoming Shogun within the alloted timeframe. It's the same formula as every other grand campaign, but I find it to be much more tense, and in turn more exciting.

The good shit's in the real time battles. The devs put a lot of time into making eye-candy battle areas. They're unmistakeably Japanese environments, complete with distant mountains and volcanoes, Sakura blossoms and needless fog. I wouldn't throw Samurai at eachother in any other environment. My one gripe would be that the siege environments can get a little stale after the first few times you do it, making me want to auto-resolve most siege battles unless the numbers are stacked. Speaking of stacked - attacking a fort is WAY harder than defending it, as it should be. In Medieval II, for example, sieging a castle could be really easy at times. I always have to consider my options carefully when attacking a fort in SHOGUN 2. (At least, if you play on any difficulty higher than normal)

When your army clashes with the enemy, the sight is awe-inspiring. Unit fights are so dynamic in this game - always zoom in when you get the chance! Individual soldiers out of a unit of hundreds will find their own guy to fight, with fluid animations and satisfying kills. I play with the blood pack DLC, so whenever I get the chance, I zoom in close to see two groups of Samurai clash in a charge, resulting in a display of needless violence that sprays blood on my screen. Blood stains the grass, heads roll about and men squirm on the ground. Out of all the Total War games I've played so far, the only title that has proved to be as cinematic as this game was Warhammer, which came out YEARS after this game, and even then I'd say it's comparable.

Some people say you have to like Japan to really like this game. I disagree! Samurai are universally cool. Anybody with an adoration for angry men with swords should play SHOGUN 2. This will remain in my heart of hearts as the greatest RTS title ever made for PC.

I was completely wrong.  Shogun is an amazing take on a part of history basically never done in games and it's epic.  The UI and many aspects of the game are based on Japanese art/style and it looks and feels great.  There's something about the battles that feels fluid and intense, and the way individual units fight when you zoom in.  This isn't like Rome, where you can get a formation of pikemen up and become more or less invincible in a narrow street.  There are no shields, a ton of soldiers per unit, and Shogun is all about momentum and mass attacks.  It's different in the best possible way and I'd recommend this to any fan of Total War or strategy in general.

Gameplay is balanced. Multitudes of mods. Gorgeous effects and lighting and an almost cinematic feel. Lots of eras to play in including gunpowder era. AI isn't terrible but it can be updated with mods very very very easily.

What isn't reasonable is to expect me to jump through several hoops, deleting files, clean uninstalling, reinstalling, reconfiguring windows, and sending my system specs to devs who can't be bothered to answer in a timely fashion.

The game is easy on easy, and hard on hard. Sounds like A no S*** kind of statement, but some total war games are on hard full time... Empiiire...

-Japan and it's ""history"" and how it was affected by the arrival of the americans.
-A strategy game where having  pre-knowledge of the scenario can help
-A total war game where the AI actually values allies, nd won't forever hate it's enemies (mostly)
-A fresh breth of air to the seemingly European dominated history genre
-This is a total wr game... with A (limited) presence of the USMC, British Royl Marines... and whatever the French had.
-Good naval battles

37,16232631,english,"A couple years ago I bought this game, as I had previously played Rome, Medieval 2 and Empire and loved all 3 of them. Shogun 2 had some pretty good reviews and when I began playing it, I had some good first impressions on it, but after a dozen hours it really felt like a chore, a drain and an outright boring♥♥♥♥♥tease. I thought it was overrated and one of the worst Total War games to date.

I stopped playing the game for a year and I recently returned to it, to see if my opinion of it would change, and it definately hasnt.

This feels like a watered down, tedious and less entertaining version of Napoleon which in-itself was quite a flawed game, it feels like this because despite the illusion of expansion, the map is very linear; regions connect through very tight and narrow passage ways with only a couple deviating forest routes, but doing any of that really doesnt matter because the AI also blows massive dicc.

The AI is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Empire level stupid, though at least in Empire it was often unpredictable and would pull of really unexpected moves on the campaign map. Like how the Marathas overthrew the Ottomans and colonized Quebec in one of my campaigns.

Its overly aggressive and predictable - you'll beat a faction and within the next 3 turns the new bordering faction will go like 'HUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEER' and declare war on you - on the same turn - sending every single ♥♥♥♥ing peasant with a spear they can into your often superior garrison, and a reinforcing army; leaving thier entire nation completely unguarded.

Playing as the Otomo I took the entire left island simply by flanking the enemy and bumrushing all of thier totally undefended cities.

I suppose the reason behind the enormous garrison is because the Devs knew the AI were moronically suicidal, Banzai-ing directly into the enemy without any forward planning or defending against others.

This becomes evident later in the game where a faction will become uber powerful, dominating a quarter of the map but after doing multiple 'HUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEER' a lesser faction will slip in and take all of thier castles.

No faction, unless they are guarded by a natural position, like the north or the far west will last long enough to reach 12 regions, they will 'HUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEER' themselves to thier own ♥♥♥♥ing grave.

The DLCs are good with the exception of the blood and gore dlc. The other factions and units are dope but arent required to enjoy the game since the base game has a shit load of content. Also fall of the samurai is a well worth side content.

Total War is my favorite strategy franchise. I've played most of the games and it all started with Shogun 2. This entry in the series, unlike the rest, is very simplistic. You can pick it up and learn how to play in just a few hours. Although that's a good thing, it's also because compared to other TW Games, Shogun 2 lacks diplomatic complexity. Japan is controlled by the Shogunate, and if you try to rise to power (by conquering) you are heavily penalized. Causing your oldest alliances, newest factions, and virtually everyone to unite against you. The game is suppose to punish factions for breaking alliances. But if you try to exchange hostages, give payments, or conduct arrange marriages (in exchange for peace), the opposing faction will immediately break all treaties on the very next turn. While still maintaining their former alliances and even rising in power. One of the most broken things in Shogun 2 is the system that allows enemies to generate armies. It doesn't matter if you have defeated your enemy's main force, killed his Daimyo, and crippled his economy. Your enemy will regenerate a FULL FORCE within 6 turns or less. It makes the game impossible to play on any difficulty. Same goes for rebellions. If rebels organize, armies are almost always at the MAX 20 Cards. Not cheap basic units either, powerful specially skilled units. 

 I would recommend a more refined game in the series like, ROME II, Atilia, or Warhammer.",1499091625,1501526651,False,4,1,0.427849471569061279,0,True,False,False,76561198092819564,206,8,11659,0,10456,1557266116,,

25,33856817,english,"The ONLY interest thing about the game is the historical setting. 

The gameplay is a shitty mess: even after having played the game game a lot you can end up with no idea on how to actually play it. 
Considering that when I played Medieval Total War 1 long time ago I found out the same many issues that affects this game I'm compelled to believe that these issues are known and IGNORED by the company behind the games.
Even the great mods out there can't fix all of the pesky problems that infest this game.

So here a non-comprehensive list of reasons to mark  TW - SHOGUN 2 as a very bad game, and why you would prefer to watch a documentary about Japanese History instead.

About the Campaign Mode

- Normal difficulty favours the player economically and economy is all.
- There is no different game difficulty: higher difficulties are achieved by handicap on player economy and boost on enemy troupe stats, and AI being exaggeratedly aggressive on the player, meanwhile lower difficulties are tuned exactly the opposite way. 
- Unit encyclopedia is slow (Why on earth is based on Internet Explorer for ?)
- Economy must be understood clearly to play effectively, however the trading system is obscure.
- Naval battles are boring, obscure and useless: nothing comes out from conquering and holding the seas, just wasted money and upkeep. Even when you secure trade routes it is too costly to conquer and hold it. Even when you do the enemy can simply raid your route or block the port.
- Damages to fleets won't recover over time which forces you to spend even more money for repairs. Also they can only be repaired in a port of your own. 
- Campaign scenario is ALWAYS the same for each faction: no matter what you do you will have no way to ally with the neighbour who is scripted to attack you.
- Advanced cannot created until you have the required building. This usually means holding a trade route or a specific territory (when you will be able to create the building you'll be against the whole nation).  unit/buildings cannot be created until you have the necessary technology. Once you have all these prerequisite you must be able to afford the troupe.
- Streets are the curse of the game. They will be used by both allied units and enemy units to advance more rapidly. When you naively upgrade streets you are just putting a target mark on you land.
- You can NOT decide the leading general (the one who gets more experience) when more are present.
- If the leading general is the Shogun you can't bribe the army, the AI exploit this always since losing the shogun has NO side effect.
- Agents are overpowered and are in fact restricted to the number of 5. for a total of 20 agents who can stop armies from taking actions, incite revolts, kill other agents, assassinate generals, bribe enemy armies.
- Buddhist monk Agents are useless: the odds of inciting a revolt against another buddhist shogun will be too low.
- Castle have standard units that spawn up when attacked and are free of cost and upkeep, meaning that when capturing an enemy castle you will need a greater amount of troupes based on the enemy castle level.

About the Battle Mode

- AI is dumb but so dumb that you might easily win a lost castle defence thanks to AI chasing you general all around the citadel.
- Unit formations are acquired by technologies: Without, your pike-men will never know how to form a square that is not easy to flank.
- Cavalry is USELESS. too costly and easily countered by the easiest and earliest unit troupe: pike-men.
- Flanking and attacks on behind are messed up attacking an advanced with cheap units when having the advantages of 
     -- higher ground 
     -- enemy attacked from the flanks
     -- enemy attacked from behind
   could still end up in losing, cause enemy units will still go down slowly and meanwhile your troupes will lose morale due to high losses.
- Morale system is just a joke: get on early units and morale won't be an issue anymore.
- Higher ground does not affect archery range.
- Units that you forget to move and are attacked by archers will never fight unless you order them to.
- Warcraft III had an ""attack move"" action which was simple and yet effective: go there, if you encounter enemy within range attack it. In this game if you issue a move command on units under attack, they will try to avoid the fighting and will instead get slathered trying to keep moving.

Oda Nobuhide sat upon his throne, wondering what to do next. With the recent defeat of the Takeda, his empire has entered a golden age of prosperity. Yet he realizes he must be careful of his next move, for it may cast doom upon the entire Oda Clan. To the East lie the Hojo and the Hatakeyama, Oda Nobuhides main focus for now. While the Hatakeyama will not put up much of a fight, the Hojo are the biggest threat he knows of. To the West lies the Hatano and the Sakai, who squabble over the territory close to Kyoto.


Than there is the Shogun himself. The Ashikaga Shogunate has grown weary of the Oda Clan's exploits, as his influence will continue to diminish if he leaves the Oda to do whatever they want. Nobuhide realizes the threat the Shogun poses, as all of Japan will unite under his banner to destroy all he has built. Nobuhide's son, Oda Nobunaga, has always awaited the day he would prove his worth in battle, and that day draws closer by the second.


The Oda have tough times ahead, but they will endure. They have always endured, and always will endure.

The game has it's AI issues that come with the Warscape engine (occasionally they can be really immersion breaking in a battle). I wished the battles were longer and morale wasn't so shit. Overall however the setting is great, the modding community have done a fantastic job keeping the game fresh and different, CA brought back cutscenes for ninjas (only agents to have them sadly) which are varied and funny just like in Medieval 2. 

Love the upgrade trees for agents and generals although there are usually just skills that you would default to over others (always focused movement range and personal stats myself)

Really wished if the castle towns were just shitty forts that were attacked our armies could then go after the towns and cities after they were cleared but again there are mods out there to solve that gripe.

And Fall of the Samurai is awesome.

PROS:
*Cool scenes for assasinations and other in-game events
*Simple and easy to use controls
*Balanced units
*Realistic sieges (The person defending a castle isn't OP)
*Ninjas and Metsuke are very fun to use
*Decent AI depending on the difficulty level
*Seasons that change both the overworold and the battle map
*Different battle conditons


CONS:
*Very few people play multiplayer in my experience 
*Only a few historical battles
* Ship gameplay atleast for me was very boring and annoying when i had to get into battles
*Allied AI fighting with you during ship battles tends to mess up and not do anything even after your ships are destroyed, forcing you to concede defeat

The close call battles and killer diplomacy and for real constant war between clans has literally kept me up at night. The religion struggles seem real.

I bought this game back in 2011, I've never had a gaming PC, so I play this game on the lowest graphic and all those things that I will not pretend to know. I am also a casual gamer, that is why I only have 169 hrs played. However, if there is a game I wish I could play all day and without the penalty of having low capacity for the game (I can't play with huge armies, for example), is this. I love it, the fact that you have to go from province to province and capture them or make them your vasals, is an amazing mechanic, not only that, you have to be a political leader as well as a warlord. At first sight all of this sounds and looks simple, but it is not, I you are like me, you will head on to the game, thinking that it is similar to Age of Empires or any base building RTS. It is not, the fact that you have a huge army of ashigarus does not guarantee that you will win against an army of warrior monks or samurais. I know that this review is really simple an has ""noob"" and ""casual"" written all over it, but as I stated in the beginning, this is a review for people like me.

According  to my steam i only have 3 hours, but besides steam i have around 50-80 hours, compared to most people which enjoy this game i am the biggest noob since i dont play this constantly.

Anyways here is a review for this and a bit of a backstory.
So originaly found this game cause of a relative, he showed me lots of games and because of him im into gaming now even he only plays time to time.

So here is the description of the game.
IT IS A TOTAL WAR, this company in my opinion has the best strategy games, and usually follow the same mechanics (plus new ones with each creation) so makes people get easily adapted to the game. For newcomers of this 'series', this is the best choice because it has the simplest ui which helps a lot.

So it has campaigns  ( with different clans), online which is very simular to campaign, custom battles and you can play massive historical battles (it shows HOW MUCH REASERCH they have into these games). The campaign is super good (plus the ui) and each clan has their own strengths and aswell is mostly historical accurate (like Takeda is efficient with cavalry).

Cant say anything about online because i dont play it, custom battles are fun and allows you to experiment certain units before investing in campaign and the historical are interesting and you learn history.

The system of diplomacy (big part of campaign and online which allows you to manage resources and create enemies or allies or others)is easy to understand and intuitive.
Units are interesting and varied, i saw a comment stating its impressive  how many units they created which i agree, but is good.

Objective s and provinces are accurate. Last total war with agent cutscenes (agents are like characters which help you achieve things).
Another favorite aspect of mine of this game is the MUSIC, one of the best of games, you get so into the game specially the battles.

Overhaul, even isnt my favorite game style, its the game which made me a persson into japanese culture and i love it
8/10, totally recomend it.",1499090449,1499090449,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198170494397,58,16,3138,0,200,1599510463,,

It's the most realistic and balanced Total War game I've ever played.[/h1][/u]

[h1]Balance: 8/10[/h1]

Ashigaru are actually as good as Samurai but too bad many new players don't know that.
This is because they have weak stats but that doesn't mean anything. Their arrows are weak but they have more soldiers in one unit so that means that there's more arrows. Monks are viewed as strong soldiers. They have less soldiers than samurai but stronger stats. The only good type of monks are bow warrior monks, as they are really strong. Naginata warrior monks are just naginata samurai but with slightly more melee stats and moderately less armour.

[h1]Graphics: 9/10[/h1]

Excellent graphics for a game that's this old. Even weak PCs or laptops can run this game 30-70fps on medium graphics. The ultra graphics are also very nice and there's also DirectX11 graphic settings.

[h1]Gameplay: 9/10[/h1]

Campaign is good because you are a daimyo of your clan. You are fighting other samurai clans to become the shogunate but you also have to fight the current shogunate in order to do this. The shogunate obviously has a very advanced army. You can buy DLC as well to play as more clans and some of these DLCs also add more units for you to use in avatar conquest ( a multiplayer gamemode)

[h1]Online gameplay: 9/10[/h1]

Multiplayer. There's two different types of multiplayer: Avatar conquest and Multiplayer campaign. 
Multiplayer campaign is straight forward it's basically campaign (this also uses the DLC you bought) and you can also do Co-op campaign or Head to Head campaign. Avatar conquest is basically just online battles except you have to capture dojos on the map to unlock more units.

[h1]Loading screens?: 10/10[/h1]

I know this is a rather odd topic to review about in a game but the loading screens are great. They contain quotes from real samurai and also Sun Tzu. It also has Japanese death poems (my personal favourite) and tips about the game.

89,19890962,english,"This is much like your classic Total War game, though this takes place in Japan. 

Graphics are quite stunning, and the campaign interface is fairly easy to use. I liked that there were less variables to worry about, (not having to think about sanitation is nice) though that's also a personal opinion of mine. Only real annoyance is that the campaign feels fairly repetitive, no matter what clan you choose. 

Battles are fast-paced, but ridiculously fast such as in Total War Warhammer; I find that troops take a much longer time to break than in other games, but are also less likely to return to the battle once they break. The battle interface is clean, and simple for anyone to use. 

Overall, Shogun 2 is a solid addition to the Total War series, it's by no means spectacular, but any Total War fan will enjoy this game.",1450914044,1498264641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198085936635,63,6,24364,0,18128,1553802259,,

Pros:

The Strategy involved in this game is beautiful

Deal with public order and revolts

Declare war on others or befriend them in your time of need

Be a military type Daimyō or one for the People Daimyō

Research War Or Civil Order

see your men have fights and see them fight it out using a variety of weapons

Be a Small time state or go big and capture kyoto

the other states are not pussys and will declare war on you if they see fit

hardcore mode is actually hardcore instead of like Total war Rome 2

Cons 

it was made in 2011 so bad graphics

for some reason your generals bodyguards are pussys

also my fucking katana heros somehow get annihilated by fucking yari ashigaru

but besides that I don't really see anything wrong with the game

6,32447191,english,"What made Shogun 2 great was not a diverse roster... it's basically 1.5 rosters per entire campaign, with most units shared across all sides while a unique unit or two is given to individual factions.

What made Shogun 2 great was not flawless siege design... every single unit, even militia, can climb walls, though this at least means you don't have the infamous '3,000 men throwing torches at a single gate' flaw of Rome 2.

What made Shogun 2 great was that it kept at a narrow focus and paid attention to the details along the way. Cinematic clips for winning... fantastic art for load screens... a map that has meaningful chokepoints, ambush spots, and strategic resources and buildings. Rather than try to create numerous different unit rosters and then sprinkle them across a huge map, Shogun 2 did more with less and paid great detail to what content it provided. 

Rome 2 failed, conversely, because it tried to be bigger than what the developers had time to actually create. This was a mind-blowing flaw, given that Empire failed for the same reason.

Shogun 2 is thus that inexplicable success between two identical failures. Rather than try and have half the entire world on the map screen, Shogun 2 stuck to civil wars in Japan and did fantastically. Rather than have 100+ 'different' units, Shogun 2 had maybe a couple dozen. 

It still shocks me that Empire failed the way it did, then every lesson was learned and Shogun 2 was so good, and then every lesson forgotten and Rome 2 built with the same flawed ideas of Empire. Even with all the changes in the development team and behind the scenes, it's as though no one ever looked at the past and realized that maybe Rome 2 shouldn't be quite so big.

Shogun 2, together with Civ V, represent one of the best eras in Steam strategy gaming of all time, an era running roughly from 2008-2014.

10,24693350,english,"[h1]A strategist that respects his self, must have this game in his library.[/h1]

Harsh words, harsh truth, if you don't have this masterpiece in your collection, [b]you are not worthy of playing strategy games[/b]. Shogun 2, in my humble opinion, is the last completed, balanced and well-made TW game that was released. While Rome 2 and Atilla are good on their own ends, they are miles away from this gem of the genre (not to add they where a bit of a mess upon release).

Shogun 2 takes place in the same time period as Shogun 1, the [i]Sengoku Jidai[/i], the age of the country at war as they said. By 1545, the current Shogunate's power has dwindled, leaving the clans of Japan at each other's throats in a struggle for supremacy. Your task is to increase the power of your clan, expand your influence and conquer Kyoto to become the new Shogun. The Japanese martial culture is a fascinating subject for many people (me included) and it's a wonder to see it in action.

Shogun's armies and maps look astonishing. Each unit has incredible levels of detail, like a demon mask here, a moustache there, a crescent-shaped helm and many more. The soldiers look diverse in a way we never before saw in massive scale battles. CA raised the bar too much, with amazing season-specific effects and splendid work with the textures, especially the rain. The music feels traditional, epic, and downright dashing. It will accompany you in every battle, victory or defeat, fitting the pace of the battle and you might find yourself searching it on youtube afterwards (I strongly reccomend [b]Yoisa, Now and Zen, Ona Hei and more[/b]). It's an orgasm, especially for fans of folk japanese music. The accents and intonations of your advisors and on the map are also incredible, especially in the heat of battle. You can almost see them spittle as they scream [b]""OUR TROOPS ARE RUNNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD! A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!""[/b]

As always in the TW games, you got two phases: [b]the turn-based phase, and the battle phase.[/b] In the first phase, you manage your clan and make your decisions as each season plays out, and in the second one you lead your armies to glorious victory or humiliating defeat.

In the early stages of the campaign, diplomacy is a key factor. Even more so on higher difficulties, where the AI is merciless in its demands both on you and the other clans. It gives them a sense of personality: they can break relationships as easily as they come to you bearing gifts and asking for arrangements. Alliances feel fragile as every [i]Daimyo[/i] wishes to become [i]Shogun[/i], and everyone is enemy to everyone. But your ""trustworthy"" allies are the least of your concerns: the AI will not hesitate tou backstab you and capture your capital, if it finds no resistance. These kind of surprise attacks and army landings on your shores make the game special: [b]you never know where and when an attack will come from[/b]. When it comes to battles, [b][u]just play it on Hard[/u][/b]. In early levels, the AI is too easy to beat, forming small armies and making many mistakes in its deployment. But in Hard, it's a whole new story. The AI tries to flank you with cavalry, it's more aggresive, it bides its time and looks for weak spots in your formation. The game is merciless to you on higher settings, and you must be careful as you wage war against it.

On the downside, as much as I'm trying to find flaws, only one comes to mind: [b]unit diversity[/b]. Buying the DLCs gives you some extra, unique for each factions units, but in the end (and the basic version), every clan has the same ashigaru, the same samurai, the same monks. They differ in attack and defence, depending on the clan's traits. It gets a bit repetitive and somewhat tiring after a while, but I'm willing to look past it.

Shogun 2 is the Total War series at its best moments, and boasts the most outrageous helmets in martial history. [i]Daimyō no tame![/i]

the multiplayer is all about strategy and changes everytime sure theres the same units everytime thats kind of a thing with all of the total war games same units but hey you can get unit pack mods that adds more units in it and i like the general speeches in the game

pros: good strategy good campaing and multi-layered castle different veriety of units (more if you get mods that adds units) different veriety of maps both naval,siege and classic land battles and more if you get map packs on the steam workshop lots of factions and more if you get dlcs less micro in naval battles

cons: bad artillery(theres a mod that adds better arty or get shogun 2 fall of the samurai Fots for short)  problem when matchlocks sometimes not firing when in fire by rank",1496729299,1496729299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198286549364,28,3,26598,0,2472,1585356422,,

Best Total War game every other one after this was not that good i would have refunded Rome II if i weren't bought that one with a cd. and Atilla was just average 

+pros
wide historical era (with dlcs) 
good atmoshpere
samurais and ninjas
realm dvide can be a challenge (i get mostly betrayed)
Fots takes place in 1860 which is the latest timeline for a TW game
good comunuty and various workshop items mods maps etc
good use of agents for assasination bribery sabotage and revolts 
generals skill tree
simplified tech tree but still good

-cons
somewhat easy in the late game for few clans and campaigns
sometimes ai doesn't act reasonably in vanilla there are some mods claim to improve
works poor  due graphics on low end pc and crashes time to time  (now i got a better pc)


extra section for vanilla game cons but gets so much better with mods
extended japan wich adds much more proviences to game i mean vanilla has so few for shogun 2 campaign

40,12428252,english,"This was probably my favorite in the series so far and that includes all titles up to rome II. Love using the range units so in this one it was great to sit back and just rain down arrows on the enemy and zoom in close to them and watch as they got pincushioned. Great details like guys writhing around a bit on the groud with 5 arrows in them before finally dying (though they count as dead and is just for ambience) and seeing the 700 arrows sticking out of the ground , wooden barricades and the enemy was great. Also really loved the little videos they had for assassin actions that are removed in the new ones.   

The things that really drive me crazy in this series of games are 

1. Constant upkeep fee's keeping you from building a super army for fear it will suck your income dry, because it will! I miss having a limited number of forts you could garrison in, and not pay upkeep fee's. 

2. Increasingly powerful garrison armies for defender, which is basically an army that you dont pay upkeep on, it just comes with castle and defends it if its attacked. Problem is you are pretty much always the attacker so its just annoying. In rome II its even worse, you roll up on a town with 3 units in there thinking you have a pretty good shot with your full stack of 20, and there are so many garrisoned units you are given a 0% probability of victory.

3. Imposing time limit win coniditions. I dont like having only until Year XX to win, i want to be able to take it as slow as i like and build up my cities a bit instead of just blitzkrieging across the map to victory. Same goes with battle timer (though there is a feature to turn this off). I would prefer to see the enemie have rations and how much they choose to bring dictates time in battle. 

all in all the best looking title for grand battles out there. Total war games are great fun, my favorite battles always involve 100's of fires arrows raining down in unison or catapults from an older game in series fired over castle walls and right into the middle of that squad now on fire running around screaming lol.",1412892014,1496037783,True,0,0,0.497287511825561523,0,True,False,False,76561197978454468,157,46,9964,0,9964,1471649776,,

What I got instead was an extremely annoying, wonky title where battles were very little fun, units on both sides moved and died way too fast, and lost morale too quickly. The multi-tiered castle-villages were back and it seemed really cool at first, but Shogun 2 actively prevents you from playing the game the way you want to play it, a problem which unfortunately found it's way into Rome  2 as well. 

You play as one of the Shogun's daimyo's, in charge of whatever samurai clan you choose. Everything is cool at first except that the game is very deliberately intended to restrict your expansion and options, using ridiculous arbitrary limits i.e food limits. If you expand too fast, your people starve and you can't afford to build any new units, despite the fact that you may literally control half of the entire country of Japan. At this point, the Emperor will order your death and EVERY clan remaining on the map will instantly attack you. Every clan will march their armies, within 1 turn, even if they came from the opposite end of Japan, straight into your capital. Even if you win legendary, epic victories against them, defending your castle village from hordes of elite units using some crappy ashagaru spearmen, the game will cheapen those victories as it tosses multiple factions worth of fresh 20 stack armies at you until you lose because you have literally 8 men.

Without mods, this game is an abject failure to recapture what made the original good. Even the little things like the cutscenes when you send ninja's out to kill someone lose their meaning, as they always fail. Many annoying things about the game have since been patched and tweaked, but still this game and it's endless army of DLC is a blight on the franchise.

If you don't own the game and are looking for a Shogun Total War type of experience, you would do much better to buy the standalone expansion Fall of the Samurai. It's basically like The Last Samurai the game. It takes place during the Bakumatsu era i.e the beginning of the Meiji restoration, during which the Satsuma Rebellion happened (the inspiration for that movie). 

It features most of the same gameplay and units, without the moronic food limit, and with far better single player and multiplayer mechanics, like being able to transport armies by train to the front lines, become a protector of a client state, and fight battles where you can use your otherwise useless fleets of battleships to provide artillery support once you've cleaned up the sea and can bring them to bay. And you don't need the main game to play it. Still, Shogun 2 is worth giving a couple of tries, if you prefer the stagnant plodding required to gain power ""just fast enough.""",1493534453,1493779722,True,2,1,0.490909069776535034,0,True,False,False,76561197961221174,1813,123,17466,0,8001,1588092092,,

The DLC's can also be tangled in with the each other and the regular game's units when creating a custom battle.

53,30596808,english,"I have played Medieval II, Shogun II, and Rome II for over 100 hours each at least. Each game is spectacular. Shogun II is specatular. Although this review will focus on the bad, it needs to be stated before that to me this game is almost perfect. There are only 3 things that bother me, and really it's only 2 major things. Without these annoyances I would rate this game with a perfect score of 5/5.

There is a part in the game, which to me signifies the change from mid-game to end-game, where you have taken over enough territory of Japan that every single other clan almost unifies against you. This feels like a cheap way to make the end-game harder. All of your alliances magically turn to crap, destroying a huge part of the game to me. Instead of navigating Japan through strategic wars, peace treaties, alliances, etc the game just becomes you vs the world. Although many would plot against you, the entire country wouldn't become one like one force dedicated to eradicating you, moreso then even rival clans. That kills the realism, which is what the Total War franchise thrives on.
-0.5

The game will magically add ""stacks"" to the map, which means that the computer spawns generals with armies out of thin air. As far as I know this is done to add difficulty, but I view it again as cheap. I do not know if Medieval II and Rome II do this, as I have not heard or seen any evidence of them doing so. This automatically makes Shogun II the worst of the 3 games I've played. I am drawn to the franchise because of realism, and as far as I know that there has never been an army that was literally created out of thin air.
-0.5

The family tree aspect of Medieval II is gone. Well maybe not gone, but reduced. This is so minor when reviewing the enite game, but I am a tad irked that this system is not as good as Medieval II's.
-0.1

This game gets a score of 3.9/5.

I feel bad giving it that low of a score, because like I said I feel like it is almost a perfect game. However I hold Total War games to a higher standard, and comparing Shogun II to both Medieval II or Rome II I believe it is noticably lesser than either.

Its a great game that has a diverse number of options to go down whether it be army compositon, diplomacy, use agents, skill trees, etc as the list goes on.  Combat is also fun to watch and not terribly difficult to master as its not as micro intensive as some other RTS games are like Starcraft 2 which is great if you are not terribly skilled (I was Gold on SC2 and then hit a massive skill wall).

All in all this game got me introduced to the Total War series and has caused me to play other titles before and after its release but I still prefer this game above all the rest.

61,30514208,english,"Shogun 2 is, by far, the only decent TW game that has been made using Warscape engine. The AI gives a challenge in the campaign map a big chunk of the time, province development and realm prosperity saw some really nice improvements like food supplies (vanilla and ROTS only), limited building slots, taxation level penalties and trade enrichment. Diplomacy is required to survive and you will be doing more than just declaring/getting declared wars; you need trade as much as taxes. 

There's also an incredible sense of balance for all clans, given that they all have the same units and all clans differ in that some of these units have their name and are slightly more powerful. This is a big no-no for people who have played other titles and enjoyed the diversity that each faction gave; in fact playing with different factions in Shogun 2 might feel repetitive. I honestly prefer this, since Creative Assembly has proven that they tend to make some factions with extremely OP units and some factions with terrible ones when they put too many of them in a game.

Having said this, this game is not perfect. Here's why:

- Warscape engine. Really, almost every negative aspect will be related to this terrible piece of software.

- 1v1 and blobbing. If you've played Medieval 2 and RTW, you know what it means to see your units spreading out, pushing or getting pushed by the sheer mass of bodies they're fighting. Shogun 2 has none of that. You're going to get constantly trapped in sieges when fighting in a gate with your katana wielding masters against 1 unit of the weakest, exhausted of melee units because units do not have mass in this game. It's ugly to look at, and it hinders gameplay.

- Sieges. Supposed to be dynamic and innovative from your usual ""storm the walls and fight in the streets"" approach from the other TW games. But thanks to the blobbing, it's a nightmare to fight and requires constant AI abusing or an insulting amount of troops to get just one stronghold. (lowest of castle level)
- (vanilla-ROTS) Ranged units are like homing missile launchers. You don't even need artillery to capture a castle, just the best of archers who can shoot with god-like precision above 15 meters of stone wall and some decent melee units.

- Lack of a castle-preview mechanic. It's impossible to form a strategy and say what kind of troops/how many would it require to protect a province if I can't see the castle in question.

- AI, although the best of all TW games so far, it's still incredibly stupid sometimes. In legendary difficulty, when defending a siege, they'll keep a quarter of their troops in an area where there aren't even enemies around and let their castle be taken by timer; when attacking, they'll send 50% of their troops to scale the same part of the wall. They also tend to spam useless artillery units (in FOTS, even if they can make Parrott/Armstrong guns, they'll make wooden cannons instead).

- Difficulty settings. Directly connected to the above point; the developers knew that they couldn't make a proper AI that could actually give you a strategic and tactical challenge, so they instead gave them insane bonuses the higher the difficulty. Their troops fight better, their economy lets them have 2 full armies even with just one province. This doesn't improve your experience at all or rewards a master strategist, it just forces you to find more ways to abuse the AI.

- Unit pathfinding and individual AI for regiments is terrible as it always has been. You'll suffer it more in FOTS, where 1 soldier who got stuck somewhere makes the entire unit not able to shoot.

- Terrible optimization. Unless you got an SSD capable of storing the almost 20GB of this game, expect the game to take around 2 minutes to boot and almost a minute to load one battle. Don't get excited, however, because with an SSD these loading times get reduced to half.

P.D.: Almost all of these issues could be fixed if CA just completely botched Warscape and spent more resources on the AI department. But they won't, and they're still developing and releasing games having learned nothing of their flaws. So I heartily recommend this game because, despite it's flaws, it's the only decent modern Total War game you're going to get in years to come. It's fun, in a very casual way. Just don't expect deep strategy gameplay.",1489523955,1489523955,True,15,0,0.667915701866149902,8,True,False,False,76561198093339104,434,49,26156,0,22260,1542329839,,

71,30437396,english,This Game is one of my favourite strategy games. It has a perfect UI that looks very sharp and appealing. It takes you no time to become acquainted with each different aspect. This allows for the player to get immersed into the game very easily. There are eight factions to choose from and each one has its own starting difficulty. So it allows for newcomers and for players who know the series well. The AI is very good on the map but when in battle they can be quite easy to take advantage of. However this can be easy to rectify just by increasing the difficulty setting. Anything over normal makes for an interesting playthrough. The soundtrack and cutscenes are a huge step up from earlier games.

73,30416218,english,"I play computer games since some years. Nowadays, I'm quite choosy when I pick the game to play, because I don't have all the free time I had when I was a teenager. For this reason, I want to maximize my gaming experience, that means (1) playing a very difficult and challenging game, and (2) playing a game that lasts a lot of time on the long run. 

Looking back to the games I've played in the last 10 years, I can cluster them into three categories, according to the number of hourse played before the game gets boring:

- Casual games: less than 10 hours played
- Ok games: between 10 and 30 hours played.

and 

 - The Games: 100+ hours played.

Now, there is no need to say that Shogun 2 Total War falls in the last category, that is The Games. I have 140+ hourse played with Steam connected, but I'm betting to have at least 5 times this value played with Steam Offline.

This game is perfect: hard and punishing on Legendary difficulty, but at the same time incredibly rewarding when you win a battle that was against all odds, just because you are good at the game. Immensly irritating when your Geisha gets busted by a stupid Metsuke, and evilly satisfying when your ninja manages to kill the hatred enemy's daimyo, or your monk incites a buddhist revolt in the provinces of your christian challengers. Let's not speak about multiple and variegate army composition, because I would speak for years.

Virtually every weak point in Napoleon: Total War is addressed, and the game has become better and faster than its predecessors. However...There is one crippling problem.

HATEFUL A.I. I almost felt the computer staring down at me with hate.

The Artifical Intelligence is so damn spiteful that tiny clans will do their best to hit you in the shins even though the retribution will be painful and destructive. You WILL win the game, oh yes, but you will rarely enjoy it. 

A vassal clan will betray and ruin your agriculture buildings, even though they'll be obliterated the next turn for the offence. Even after Realm Divide hits, a.k.a SHTF-Era, your vassals will spread to take over railway territories and NEVER EVER build anything on them, mismanaging as much as they can and wander off just.to.spite.you. and deny you the railroad. And they will do their best to block economic growth and get themselves willingly killed and taken over by the enemy AI.

Just to spite you.

The high speed steam ships mean that the enemy will, kamikaze towards your shores just to deprive you of a trade route or shut down a port, and thus cost you a good amount of coin and time. And since it's the good old ""Mr. No Effort in Micromanagement"" AI, expect the smartest ships to pinpoint your best trade routes and slip past your defenses outdoing NORAD just to hit and annoy you with 10 minutes of repair-intercept work. Every. Turn. Actual Japanese captains would have more self-preservation instincts than the AI ships who know they are going to die horribly. Expect playing Coast Guard vs. Cubans EVERY DAMN TURN.

Same with amphibious invasions. Thank the Gods the provinces have designated disembark-only shores with such an AI.

And the targeting. Sweet God, why would an actual enemy army suddenly surge past my 4 vassals, 2 allies, risk death on sea just to land a huge f***ing force to damage my most vulnerable, rich province, diverting my forces back to desperately intercept, fail, intercept and kill by a hair's length, and spend months to repair the damage?

Mind you, I was approaching his last city and taking the undermanned city made the army disintegrate. I won, but there was no enjoyment, it's like some dirty street urchin from Fikirtepe who hits you in the nuts and runs around, throwing stinging rocks at you until you corner the little laughing gypsy and smash his face so hard he'll land in intensive care. The victory will give you no joy and only loss. (A friend did it, not me)

Strategy wise, the enemy is more spiteful then A.M of ""I have no mouth and I must scream.""

Tactics: Slightly better, MIND YOU SLIGHTLY,  because although the enemy attacks well, it needs to work on maneouvring. So far weak flank attacks by cavalry gets wrecked by some infantry turning and shooting, and the enemy AI goes full BANZAI to get his family killed, his army running away, only to be rebels and damage every bit of your new lands.

I swear, the game crashed when I cornered the last backside-thorn ship that had ruined my trade income. It's as if the AI is malevolent beyond mere programming.

Playing this game is like chasing down demon-possessed evil little children trying to kill you with too small knives, until you either snap from rage and cheat yourself into endless cash (not that it would even help!) or corner the buggers, only them to commit suicide just to deny you the pleasure of gutting some evil Satan's Spawn child from Hell.

This writting is a review about Total War : Shogun2. From the writter's perspective, a thumb up is not enough to promote the game itself for various reasons. This is due to the over performance of the game itself.

Pro (+) :
+ The graphic runs smoothly without any bugs nor glitches to be found in my first 20 hours of playing.
+ The graphic can be easily configured for they provide details on all aspects.
+ The game promote historical value of how a nation is formed, usefull education is still taking place.
+ The details provided about each unit, building, and everything else are provided in its Encyclopedia, without any broken links. The level of attention to details can't be found in any other games yet to the date by the writer of the review.
+ Controls are relatively easy for beginners (The first 2 playing hours gets new players as Normal difficulty players).
+ Autosave feature is active, in case players make messed up decisions.

Con (-):
- The AI(s) can prove challenging even for expert strategist players.
- The loading screen between Global Map and province battle is quite long, but acceptable.
- Censorships on certain parts of the game.

Overally the game is over performing for a discounted price. The writer is recommending this game as ""a must have strategy game"" for all genre of players. Thank you for reading the review and have a good day.

7,30111999,english,"Shogun 2 marked the return of the Total War series back into an era mainly focused on traditional weapons after several games centered around line infantry. Upon release, many people claimed that the series had returned to its ""roots"" despite the usual CA bugfest that occurs initially, though if I recall Shogun 2 wasn't as bad as Empire. I think it definitely helped that Shogun 2 focused on a single culture rather than the huge overarching scope of Empire. 

For me this is the only Total War entry that I can play the vanilla campaign on without huge overhaul mods unlike Rome or Medieval 2. This doesn't mean Shogun 2 is shy of issues and for this review I'd like to focus on the negatives of the game. Shogun 2 utilizes the same engine as Empire, Napoleon, and future TW titles: the Warscape Engine. This engine is terrible when it comes to formations and individual troop weight. More often than not, you'll find your soldiers blobbing up and sliding all over like jelly. The only times these would happen in Rome or Medieval 2 would be when units tried to force their way through a formation of enemy troops but even then there was weight to it. Soldiers pushed back, it wasn't easy to get your entire formation through a wall of troops. There's also the issue of kill animations. Many times your soldiers will engage each other in 1 vs. 1 combat resulting in animations that push the opposing soldier deep into a formation or everyone just attacking one by one. Some people defend this because ""It's samurai, they had honor based combat, it fits the setting"". This isn't an accurate view. During the Sengoku Jidai period these original views of battle were being broken down and mass mobilized campaigns replaced the organized ""honor duels"" of the early samurai. I also have big issue with morale in this game which harkens back to Rome: Total War days when a Roman legion charging into a formation of German infantry would rout them within seconds. Fast combat disallows strategy. This goes against the very genre of the game series but if you look at the recent successes of games like Warhammer, there are a lot of people that prefer this system. 

Beyond these complaints I still find the campaign fun to do and I've finished a few victory conditions for a couple factions, more than I can say for the campaigns of Rome or Medieval 2. For multiplayer I've heard great things about Avatar Conquest but being a introvert pleb I find very few people to play with on that mode. It doesn't help that I bought and played this game past its prime. The only thing I could say that I wished they added to this game is a DLC/expansion that was set during the Imjin War. But alas that historical event still evokes patriotic sentiment throughout East Asia and also SEGA is a company based in Japan.  

Overall Shogun 2 was a worthy entry into the series and resurrected fan confidence toward CA after the perils of Empire. But at the same time it was a foreshadowing of the issues that would pervade Rome 2's gameplay due to its engine. The jelly-like formations of troops could not be justified during the age of Western Antiquity.",1487821870,1487821870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004199954,444,17,13911,0,9643,1593406779,,

Works pretty well in co-op, though you'll be spending some time waiting for turns on the campaign map until both players get used to the game mechanics and interface (then turn times can get quite short).

24,30049329,english,"My main issue with this game is the battels started to become very fast and arcade like.  I say started because this style of battle never went away in the new games.  Basically what I mean is the the battles go way to fast.  They can be over in less than ten minutes which is some what ridiculous.  I love playing battle multiplayer and thats waht I spent most of my time doing in the other games but this made the battles less fun.  They are also based on a rock paper scissors style.  Basically spears beat horses, swords beat spears, and horses beat swords.  Too streamline for people who like nice tactical battles.  However, the streamline easy to learn nature of these battles makes it a good game to start playing the series with.  The battles also look beautiful and the fighting is so fun to watch.  I just wish Creative Assembly would make a more real way to fight battles like earlier.  It wouldn't be that hard to do.  In earlier installments they even had a button to make the battle basic if you did want that but still kept the normal battles a feature.  

Now you may be wondering why I gave it the thumbs up but the multiplayer system in this is so well done.  The avatar conquest is such a good way of doing multiplayer battles.  Also, your units gain more experience the mroe they fight making your abttles more meaningful.  The campgain I felt was also pretty good.  I like the idea of the clans and such.

28,30044441,english,"Greetingsa, my Shōjo and Shonen Aishgarus. This will be a quick feelings infused review from someone who loves to tackle medieval and fantasy typed strategy games. I had played some total war titles. Atilla, Shogun 2, Total War 2 and Napoleon. 
I am told Warhammer is great, as i do love Warhammer i shall get it too, once iget a better PC, and not this silly old  Laptop.

Now to review, and arigatou gozaimas for reading into introductionary line.

Shogun 2 and its DLC titles tackle three different ages of the land of the rising sun, the Japan, in its different ages of Feudality, or to be precise, Shogunate and Empire. 
Rise of the Samurai DLC tackles the years when Samurai warriors were mearly a thing to start, and Naginata spear was something more common than a katana sword. They want to become Senpai.
Shogun 2 tackles the 16th-century feudal Japan, in the aftermath of the Ōnin War during the Ashikaga Shogunate. Many clans fight for ''Emperors'' and Shoguns (the real powers) atention. Senpai notice me or Senpai let me be Senpai.
And Fall of the Samurai DLC takes on the role to represent you with units that were around messing with the last feudal days of Shogun's power, before the Emperor became again the Real Power. 

Or that is, how you actually want to make it. Alternative ends are after all, exactly the point of such games. You are mearly placed into realistical starting positions. Future, is up to you.

Make Japan all christianised? No problem. Create democratic Japan in Fall of Samurai DLC? No problem. 
Political aspect of the game is easy enough but affects the game regardless if you focus on it or not. It offers far less options than Medieval Total War 2 or Atilla do however. Especially in comparisment to later, the Shogun 2 is a shy imotou to her. 

So when you ponder whenever should you buy this game or no, let me help you. The Ai can be really complex even on easy mode. So if you seek challenge, the hardest setting will give you one for sure. For casual players, easy gives enough of brainstorming already.  It is indeed a game worth of having it played. I spent quite a sum of hours playing it, while drawing, while eating and even while cooking. 
No, not that it is a no brainer, but the game's dynamics, of it beein a turn based game, makes it so. 

So if you like turn based game and feudal Japan and you generally want to play something different than is either shooting units only Napoleon or slobered over too much and stale knights - Shogun2 with its DLC's on sale is a definite hit for you! 

10/10 would buy again when on sale. Oh wait. I actually did. And play Co-Op campaign with younger imotou.

The Good:
campaigns never are the same different clans usually rise up and offer different challenges.
My very 1st campaign was as Hatoria (not the best choice fyi) but i grinded it out learned a lot about the mechanics and alternatives to combat.
 the combat is very well structured eg. defences against odds can happen if you do it perfectly if not you are doomed.

The bad:
There is not any i mean if you act like a dick the AI won’t respond to your diplomacy which makes sense unlike Rome 2 where you can basically attack allies without much blow back.

65,29676761,english,"Okay, so first off: I bought this game years ago, for supposedly being the best TotalWar game.
As of writing this review, I have only played one other TW: TW Empire.


This is a good game. No doubt about it. If you want, you can stop reading here. It's well worth 30 bucks. If you don't know anything about Total War, just look it up. They're all the same.

Now, the big question is: [h1] HOW DOES IT COMPARE? [/h1]

If you're anything like me, you love TW games for the amazing potential they have, but you're frustrated by the fact that they seem to screw up the same things, over and over again. It's just.... You know, just.... *sigh* anyways...

Compared to other TW games, this game DOES improve on almost everything. (including common TW problems)

[list]
[*] Nice Graphics. Arguably the best looking TW to date. (Rome 2 blows, same engine anyways)
[*] Different FACES. Not every person is a clone! Instead, there are now about 3 clone varieties. Yay!?!....?
[*] Good Gameflow. The shape of Japan makes it easier to progress, because enemies can't invade from all directions.
[*] decent ANIMATIONS. They actually connect 90% of the time, and look pretty good too.
[*] Nice Units. Simply due to the fact that you have Archers, Melee, Cavalry, Cannons, AND muskets. Just a nice time period, - Compared to Rome (no firearms), or Empire(no archers) - thus, more variety.
[*] Interesting Tech Tree. (Although super imbalanced, as usual)
[*] nice Family management. It's nice to have a family. Makes for fun gameplay.
[*] Nice Japan atmosphere, everything you know from classic japanese culture is here. Ninja, Samurai, Geishas. Music too.
[*] extra stuff. Great art style. Great little movies that show execution attempts, SHAMEFUR DISPRAY!
[*] POLISH, (aka. few bugs, stuff just fits together, high quality feel)
[*] OK AI. That means ok. NO bullshit awful Rome 2. The AI is not retarded. It doesn't fuck up horrendously. Like 50% of TW.
[/list]

HOWEVER..... the game is not the TW you've always wanted. I'm sorry. The TW you've always wanted STILL doesn't exist.

- The AI is still pretty BAD. Just set up your units. Aggro the enemy. Defend. Win. Easy to flank. Stupid random movements. Stupid random charges. Stupid everything. You get the message. Again, I'm sorry. It's just.... *sigh*

- Naval Battles are still BORING. Like in every other TW ever made. The autoresolve is BROKEN for Naval battles, forcing you to battle manually. But then it's really easy, I mean EZ. Still not as EZ as Empire. But still, Boarding OP, as always. Go figure.

- Sieges are sort of boring too. You can just climb every wall, which kinda kills the whole siege thing, IMO.

- Shit does occasionally still happen, although much less frequently. (shit = the usual minor TW shit)

[h1] OVERALL, still a clear recommendation. For Everyone. Iz gud game. [/h1]

The whole Samurai/Japan thing is completely subjective. Like it or not. You decide.

However, it should be mentioned that you CAN acquire a waifu, defend your bloodline, and the game is reasonably kawaii.(cherry flowers n shit) 10/10 would commit seppuku again.

Strategy, strategy, and more strategy, and then you have to figure out how to defeat your opponent.

There is quite a bit here, moreso than just making a huge army to smash your opponent. The Total War series are highlighted mostly by the amazing combat play, but there are intricate and nuanced strategies you must master with trade agreements, political alliances, and economic management in order for the gods to favor your armies. Total War: Shogun 2 gets pretty much all of this down pat and embodies most of what is great about the series.

You can play as a number of different clans, each with their own bonuses and difficulty levels. You must then carve a path through feudal Japan to become Shogun, but be wary of other clans, the Shogun himself, and pirates on the high seas, all of which will pose serious obstacles to your goal to dominate the country. Only the most patient, determined, and steady of hand (and mind) will be able to do what the other clans cannot and take control of the region through sheer military force.

The graphics (and visuals in general are quite beautiful, and its hard to resist the temptation to pause during a battle to see cinematic shots of armed squads clashing dramatically with each other. The game board is gorgeously designed as well. The sounds are crisp and realistic, the dialogue a bit cheesy at times but otherwise dramatic and impressive.

Overall, strategy enthusiasts will love this and will want to play it again and again.

29,29128377,english,"The Total War series has always been quite unique among strategy games, being one of the very few series in the TBS/RTS Hybrid subgenre, that is both turn based and real time strategy gameplay, something that the TW series has always done well. Total War, and Shogun 2 for that matter, keeps the two types of strategy seperate. You play turn based on tha campaign map, and once you engage in a battle the games all switch to RTS. So, how well does Shogun two handle this concept? Well, you play one of several Daimyo, clan leaders, and your objective is to become Shogun by ousting the Ashikaga Shogunate from Kyoto, the capital. Almost every remaining clan will go nuts when you do this, so first you must grow in power and expand your territory, build up your armies etc.

Gameplay:
+ Customisable game length and challenge

+ Very in-depth campaign where you have to manage food supply, construction, recruitment, research, public order, Religion and more.

+ You can do pretty much everything you could want to do. You can charge in with troops and conquer huge swathes of territory, if you want. You can use diplomacy cleverly to win over clans as allies, if you want (just don't rely on them when you decide to move on Kyoto) You can build up huge amounts of money and create a strong economy, if you want. You can cheese your way to power by killing off your rival's family with Ninjas, Monks and Metsuke (Seriously, how can the enemy secret policemen have my monk executed in MY territory?) Any sensible approach to growing in power can be used, and even approaches that aren't.

+ The AI does not focus you to death in the campaign, and go after people they don't like, as you would expect if it was actually 16th century Japan.

+ In-depth diplomacy: You can declare war/make peace (duh), create alliances and Client states, offer and demand most items, such as money or land, offer trade, and even take hostages and sell them back to someone. The AI's likelyhood of accepting depends on how good a deal it is for them, how much they like you, and how scared they are of you.

+ Relationships: You can easily see in the diplomacy screen how much a clan likes you, and a simple breakdown of why.

+ Public Order makes sense. Christian converts don't like you if your Daimyo is Bhuddist, people don't like high taxes or poor level of hygiene etc.

+ Seasons have different effects, for example, in the Autumn you have more food available because it's the harvest, and troops in enemy territory take losses to the cold in winter.

+ Character development trees for generals and agents that let you specialise them. If you want, you can set a general up to be a good defender, or a good attacker, or a generalist, if you'll pardon the pun. Characters also can aquire good or bad traits or retainers, so don't keep a general sitting around for too long, or he may become lazy. At the same time, don't use him constantly, or he may become full of himself.

+ The AI makes sensible decisions most of the time

+ Realm Divide provides a decent buff to the difficulty near the end of the campaign (Be prepared to be backstabbed, a LOT at this point.)

- As with all TW games it gets a bit too easy near the end

- Agents are incredibly annoying and powerful. Every agent has an ability to remove your own agents or generals, and they can all debuff armies. Some can even take over settlements using the power of huge sums of money. The AI's tendacy to spam agents only amplifies the problem, with armies sometimes being permanently locked in place by movement debuffs. At the very least, you can give generals and agents retainers or skills to negate these somewhat, and specialise agents into anti-agent roles. 

- Territory south of Kyoto (to the left) is very linear, with only two long paths because of the mountains in the centre of that area.

- The campaign naval AI tends to simply raid you and run away if you come close, making expensive boats pointless and naval strategy nothing more than a Benny Hill chase across the sea of Japan

The RTS battles:

+ Large scale and impressive battles

+ Easy to learn, hard to master. The battles are based on a core ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" concept. Spears do well against Cavalry, which do well against Swordsmen, who do well against spears. Foot ranged troops do well against anything from range but poorly against anything that catches them *Cough* light cavalry *Cough*. Mounted Ranged are a pain to catch but have low hitting power, apart from mounted Gunpowder but they're the OP exception.

+ Fatigue, Ammunition and Complicated Morale mechanics

+ High ground advantage mechanic

+ Somewhat competent AI that will give a new player a challenge, but struggles against good players.

+ Fun special units, such as fire rockets, ie Rocket Launcher Musket Peasants

+ Weather conditions have an effect on visibility and fatigue

+ SHAMFUR DISPRAY advisor/announcer

+ Very well done multiplayer battles, with a lot of depth in the ""Avatar Conquest"" mode

+ Very well thought out and balanced multiplayer maps, clearly designed with interesting scenarios in mind

- The multiplayer contains a fair bit of cheese, like Donderbuss cavalry, which can kill and entire army on their own provided there are no enemy musket or cavalry units left.

- Artillery is useless except in seiges because they can't move.

- Naval battles are terrible

- The Naval AI is useless

Graphics, Sound and Optimisation:

+ Looks good from the normal view distance

+ You can zoom into the battles and watch your men fight with the enemy

+ Excellent Soundtrack

+ Literally any gaming PC less than 10 years old could run this game. (Trust me, if my computer can run it, your's most certainly can)

- While good looking at a distance, it look kinda meh up close

- It looks Awful on low graphics settings, but so does just about every game.

Misc:

+ Regularly goes on sale with all DLCs for £10 (75% off)

- Blood is only available in a DLC to lower the age limit.

Overall, a very well done RTS/TBS Hybrid, and one of the best in the series. Would recommend to anyone who likes strategy games",1483913855,1483994499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198213386019,21,3,12662,0,2798.0,1587834281,,

53,28965183,english,"Best total war game ever. I was a bit indifferent with the standard Shogun 2 campaign, but the Fall of the Samurai DLC makes this game better in every possible way. If you liked empire total war and napoleon total war, this DLC is an immensely improved version. It's set in 1868, the Boshin War, where the Shogunate falls to Imperial Japan. There are line infantry, riflemen, cannons... Adding on from Napoleon total war, you can use your ships to bombard the enemy on the campaign map and DURING THE BATTLE. It's amazing. Unless the enemy uses it on you ;).
Pros:
The AI is much better in this game than the previous ones. 
All of the ships are steam powered, so naval battles are faster. 
British, United States, and French troops are avaliable to use. 
Your allies are actually helpful, they may fight with you as you all fight for the Emperorer or Shogunate and they hunt the enemy and take regions. The Imperial army is superor because they use more guns and cannons. This also means you may be fighting two different faction armies in one battle, but maybe some allies will be nearby to help. 
If you have a ship in port that is attacked, the port has cannons on the shore to help you.
You can use a train to transport troops over long distances (if no one is blocking the railroad)
When I play Rome total war, I like to play as Rome. When I play Napoleon total war, I'll play as France, usually. This game does not have an obvious choice... The imperials are easier campaigns and the shogunate campaigns are hard. I have more of a desire to explore the other factions.
Management of provinces is very easy... Unlike Attila where you have to worry about food and disease as well as public order... Realistic? Yes, but very burdensome. 
Cannons in this game are a major improvement from Napoleon total war.
The game is all-around good. I mean, I'm just listing noteworthy pros.

Cons:
Autoresolving ship battles almost always results in an unnecessarily large amount of damage to your ships, no matter if you are an ironclad vs a small wooden 12 gun boat.
Garrisons regenerate immediately. If you attack a settlement and kill almost all of the garrison, but run out of time or barely lose and attack next turn, the entire garrison regenerates while you do not... :P (also means your garrison regenerates too, so let your garrisons die first
You have to play fast enough or you will not unite Japan in time. I do not understand the importance of getting done by a certain time, but I had 1 more year left and needed 7 more provinces, so I had to blitz all of my forces to every enemy province. I got the last province in the winter. 
The armies in this game seem to move quite slowly which may be due to the fact that this campaign spans over just a few years.

Each time frame has its own unique units. from early samurai to the well know samurai and generals with their daimyo and to the fall of the samurai and the full use of guns. the vanilla of the game is great and you can put many hours in it and have diffrent play styles for each clan with all of their own bonuses.

76,28828766,english,"It is 5 in the morning. I have been playing TWS2: Fall of the Samurai for almost 10 hours straight. I'd like to provide a summary of my experience thus far.

Having started in Satsuma domain, I quickly expanded outward from my two provinces (the southernmost in the main islands). At first, I was near destitute, and my armies were feeble. However, I had a cause: my clan was deeply loyal to the emperor, and two shogunate supporting clans also called my island of Kyushu home. Thankfully, the barbarians began infighting, and one quickly destroyed the other. As I moved northward, I met two more neighboring clans on Kyushu: the Saga and the Hirado. At first they wanted nothing to do with me; I was poor, and a bit of an upstart. The Saga even refused to trade with my clan. Any form of military alliance was out of the question at the time. However, as the Hirado clashed with a shogunate clan which had crossed the Kammon strait into Kyushu, I began to further develop my infrastructure, rapidly developing my infantry and artillery, and building a firm economic base, all while ensuring my populace stayed happy. Soon, just as I was preparing to capture a chain of islands along the western coast of Japan, I was able to secure my first two proper military alliances (I already had a vassal clan, which treacherously attacked me during a period of military access I had allowed so they could move their troops to attack a warring clan), and my newfound friendship with my fellow Kyushu clans was, to say the least, extremely exciting.

Jump forward a few hours — Having advanced from Kyushu onto the main island, conquering and forming new alliances, I am now the Satsuma Imperial Vanguard. My treasury now contains well over two hundred thousand coins. My armies are undefeated. My allies look to me for direction, all of us loyal to the empire, carving a path through shogunate-held Japan.
 
The Hirado never moved far beyond their two provinces in Kyushu, but we maintain very friendly relations, and their navy is an integral part of our campaign; as it stands, they hold a heavily fortified island off the western coast, from which they launch naval raids, and occasionally send large invasion forces to skirmish with the enemy.
The Saga, on the other hand, took strong initiative. They boarded ships and gained territory up and down the south-eastern coastline, and are currently making an ambitious offensive far in the north, having already captured two provinces from the shogunate vanguard and gaining us a valuable foothold deep in enemy territory. 
I've gained new friends too! The powerful Yamago, whose armies continue to seize land from the shogunate; the steadfast Tokushima, consistently repelling enemy attempts to strike into our territory; the witty Tosa, a valuable trade partner that keeps the Imperial Forces' coffers brimming. All that have stood before us have either fallen, or joined our cause.

As I watch my forces cleave through the enemy, flanked on either side by close friends and allies, I cant help but think to myself: holy shit I need to get to sleep.",1483105722,1483105722,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,76561198043729634,222,3,13227,0,8993.0,1593331818,,

The learning curve is quite hard even for an advanced RTS player like myself, but once you get the Taxes, Political side, and the Battlestage down, and have an understanding of whatcities give you what power ups, it'll be hard to lose, I don't really enjoy online because let's face it, people are d***s, but the offline aspect of the Total War series is simply amazing, if you can manage to beat the computer on the highest difficulty ;).

Once, two great nations lived at peace with eachother, and though they waged war against all around them, quickly rising in strength, their alliance was strong. The Mori, masters of the sea had access to many resources, and would gladly trade those resources in for military support. The Hattori, with a booming economy and vast armies needed the resources to help build up their strength even more, and so, both nations prospered. 

Untill one day,  the Mori broke their truce, invading the Tsuitsui clan, a vassal of the great Hattori kingdom. And so the Hattori marched on, into sovereign lands, capturing three cities until the Mori had begged them for mercy. The Mori posed no threat to the powerfull Hattori, yet still, the latter found it in their hearts to let the traitors live. The Hattori formed an Alliance with the Takeda, and the Mori did so with the Shimazu. Though the Mori still owned 12 provinces, with the Hattori owning only 8, the Hattori's swift guerrilla attacks made sure there was no lord, no daimyo, and no heir left to the monarchy. 

The Mori were cut down like dogs, and the Shimazu would soon join them, As the Hattori marched on the Capital, taking it all in under a day's work, the Takeda and Uesuegi tried to stop them, but it was all too late. 

I was victorious, and declared the Mori to be royal cunts.

17,28614229,english,"The ""best"" in terms of AI and gameplay but in campaign its total trash. Don't bother with alliances in total war games. In this one something called ""Realm Divide"" is just a fancy term for everyone will declare war on you and try to kill you. Even if you sucked up to one other nation the whole game through it won't matter because they will hate you whether you are shogun or whatever. Way to much micromanaging and the AI will actively and obviously cheat at many points but atleast they use ships to land on shores in this game unlike in NTW/ETW where the AI was honestly retarded. 

Don't forget to keep nanbans out no matter what!  They are totally worthless and not worth the Christian bastardization on your Asian Nation. You will just end up with late game civil war.

Its a shame that such a cool games campaign is such shit. Realm Divide mechanics are neither fun and are just overly challenging on fucking Normal! There just to much infuriating about the late game campaign to recommend this one unless you really like the setting. I have nearly 100 hours in the game and I can't beat the campaign. By ""beat"" I mean conqeur all of Japan, since this is how I play Total War games. Was fun ruling the entire world in ETW

I got about 2/3rd of Japan under the Oda banner and was Shogun when Christianity and my panic in needing money and men earlier in the game came in and shit on everything I was having fun with doing.  My entire nation has started getting pissed because apparently Buddhists and Christians just absolutely hate eachother so much that they want to rebel violently against one another. Its just such stupid shit and theres nothing I can realistically do before the revolts will undoubtedly start to come. If I get rid of some divisions of my army the Otomo Homos will come my front but if I do nothing the Christian Terrorists will Terrorize my rear. Im fucked. This is every god damned single attempt I have made at this game, shit just falls apart. The fact the Otomos are just throwing tons of Metsukes,Priests, and Ninja at me and just killing everyone besides my generals makes it impossible for me to fucking do anything about converting the populace.

Its fucked. Theres nothing I can do and this is how every single game ends. Being shogun has no real gain because no one cares that you have Kyoto, in fact that will make them hate you even more. Becoming and allie of the Shogun is also completely worthless because if you hit Realm Divide he will hate you again. Plus he dousn't do anything anyway.

I didn't like it when it came out, and now that its patched up its better but its still a terrible campaign to play in.  Its just not fun after you hit a certain point around Realm Divide. If anything Realm Divide is just an artifical difficulty and is contrary to the game rules before it. Its the ""Shit we can't make better enemies and AI that will actually put up a fight, fuck it fam, lets just make the whole country go to war with the player. I'm sure that will be hard"" Its like boxing with a brick wall, hard.

I'm sure I'll get some smart asses who will say  ""I beat it durr, noob"" or some iteration of that to what I will respond that you probably got lucky.

Right now probably the best purchase of the serie if on sale. Strongly recommend the DLC Fall of the S., back when a Total War DLC was a stand alone game easily worth the money requested. Even Rise of the Sam is not bad at all. Mods are just awesome. Multiplayer wise just the best of the series with a little RPG element on the Avatar conquest just to increase depht and spectrum of choices. No really OP units to date, even veterans are not OP and a lower rank player can enjoy some great win against them if able to properly exploit the weakness of a more experienced but also more expensive build.

- The battles are far to quick and feel arcade like
- The single player feels lackluster although the diplomacy is more fun than the previous titles
- Multiplayer feels extremely min/max based with little creativity being allowed (if you expect to win) which in my opinion defeats the purpose of a strat game like the Total War series.

Overall the game is boring. I even paid for a faction DLC after 20 hours of playing it with my friends in my dormitory hall just because WITH friends on the campgain it is extremely fun to mess around.

2. Get rid of ALL plugins. Including ad blockers. 
3. Reinstall and verify game cache (just to be sure). The game ran for me. And should run for you. 

About the Game:

The units are interesting. The map is beautiful. And battles are fun to watch. Things make sense. You can be outnumbered but still are willing to watch your lone samurai fight to the death because it is exciting. I cannot say the same thing for Rome 2 or any other total war title. 

The cinematics are on point. Rome 2 got rid of agent cinematics. Shogun 2 reach new hights. They are funny. They tell compelling stories. And they are serious.

7,25171873,english,"Easily one of the best Total War games around (if not THE best); To the little details on huge battles to detailed units and just completely beautiful dynamic battlefields (stuff like siege weaponry may leave devastating results). Fantastic artwork, sound and music. The game can feel really fast paced and intense, even though the overview map (the entire map of Japan) is held on turn-based movement. The actual combat may be fought in Real Time (slowest option, as you'll enter the battlefield) or decided by AI (quickest option as you'll only see numbers ticking down). Battles, wars or even territory defenses may be decided by how much you move (or how much you COULDN'T move) your units in the overview map.

Quite honestly, if one is to get into the Total War franchise, this game is a fantastic choice as it'll familiarize the player with the Total War mechanics (in general, like how the overview map is handled) and it'll introduce its unique quirks along the way (specific Shogun 2-bound mechanics, like the turn end time jump).

In short, this is a title for those who like a mix of Turn-based movement and RTS-style combat, as to not mention the historical period. Even though it achieves its 5th birthday as of this writing (and with Total Warhammer out) it is still a very memorable game.

P.S.: Don't forget to get Fall of the Samurai expansion pack, not only it changes how the RTS is played by an entire new way (either via Singleplayer or Multiplayer) it also adds boasting rights (defeating a well armed 'Modern army' or 'Fall of the Samurai army' with a 'Traditional Army' or 'Shogun 2 vanilla army').",1472257655,1480029010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198033936857,509,4,7894,0,2950,1525017582,,

38,27064699,english,"Hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I honestly cannot come up with anything to say about this game that would detract from the expirience except the minor imbalance when it comes to naval units. Having a navy in the base game of Shogun 2 isn't very important and usually doesn't dictate much of anything. That being said, Shogun 2 offers an immensely enjoyable gaming expirience. While it may seem daunting at first, Shogun 2's game mechanics clicked for me quickly. Now I could explain the economics, military and political aspects of the gameplay without breaking a sweat. It all just makes sense. The graphics are stunning, the voice-acting is superb and the amount of freedom you're given as a player is fantastic. The expansion that the game does emphasize is Fall of the Samurai, a fairly big step away from Shogun 2's main body and into an almost entirely different style. While I can't say I lean either way on the DLC I can say that anyone who enjoys Shogun 2 and the other Total War games would likely find Fall of the Samurai a very enjoyable expirience on top of the base game. This is also, to my knowledge, the first Total War game to natively include a co-op campaign playable at launch and a customization system for generals which is fantastic. I can't reccomend this game enough but there is one sticky issue. I think Steam's price is a little ridiculous. I'd reccomend anyone who wants to purchase Shogun 2 for the least amount of money possible go to G2A and purchase it via their website. G2A can occasionally have problems but honestly it's around 5 dollars on there last time I checked and I can't say that giving Valve any more money than you absolutely have to is something I condone.

My hours played speaks for itself. 1,020+ hrs played and I still come back to this game. Rome II has been out for almost a year and I just couldn't get into it the same way.

I love the 'family tree' feature in this game. Being able to look back at the end of a long campaign, with my Daimyo(clan leader) now 53 yrs old, having started the game when he was 18, it's a great feeling. To remember the past battles, close calls, the sacrifices etc.  It really helps build that immersive connection, so that you actually care about your clan and your armies.

Like all games, this one isn't perfect. The multiplayer could be better. I'm a big stats type of guy with a game like this, and I really felt like the end of game stats weren't as informative as they could have been. For example, when you look back through the history, it says ""Won battle on this date"", but that's it. I wish it said which general and included all of the stats for that specific army, etc.

If you've never played a game like this, you're in for a treat. Obviously, like every other game you spend money on, you should watch some youtube 'Let's Play' videos to see what's really in store. 

The top-down strategic view is nicely done, coming from the Civ series, it wasn't hard for me to get used to. Having the option to enter the battles in 3d is just fantastic. These battles can be absolutely epic and it's a joy to watch them unfold, especially when you're the underdog.

Now to be honest, I got my ass handed to me during my first campaign. I didn't read any tutorials and I jumped right in without paying much attention to some important bits of info. The starter clans differ in difficulty, for starters. Select auto-management for Taxes at first, this will help in not becoming overwhelmed as you add more cities to your clan's dominion.

That's all for now. Grab this game if you're a Civ fan that has always dreamt of actually entering the battle in 3D!",1405727692,1479932574,True,3,0,0.558919191360473633,0,True,False,False,76561197961318203,959,3,64779,0,60398,1557375531,,
68,5820926,english,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the height of Creative Assembly's time with the Total War series. Shogun 2 takes the ideas and lessons they've learned from the previous games, including the mistakes of Empire and Napoleon, and have ironed them out to a playable level. In fact, it's more than just playable, it's absolutely amazing. The base game pits you as the leader of one of many clans during feudal Japan who are all striving to become Shogun, the military ruler of Japan. You have to balanced your budget while making sure your people are fed and expanding your territory by conquering your enemies and making allies. Each clan has their own unique traits which you can use to your advantage while taking on the current Shogunate which adds a lot of depth and complexity to the strategies that you can use. Where this game falls short are in a few bugs and one of the two dlc expansions. The biggest complaint that I have about the A.I. in this game is that, being a Total War A.I., it is a bit on the derpy side. Enemy armies will randomly break formation and mill about from time to time, the enemy general will occassionaly try to take a heavily defended settlement with a tiny force, and cav units will always turn and fight if even just one of them gets caught in melee while trying to disengage. It's little bugs like that can make you get frustrated at the game, but not enough to make want to stop playing.

As far as the dlc goes, The Rise of the Samurai was massively underwhelming. All it really added was some new unit types and some new abilities for agents. Otherwise, it was essentially the same map as the base game and didn't change up the gameplay all that much apart from siege battles no longer always being in a castle and being a bit more like sieging small towns in the older games. Despite that disappointment, however, Fall of the Samurai is fantastic. It adds in ranged units, such as line infantry and better variations of it, while still allowing you to build more traditional armies comprised of katanas, yari, and bows. The different time period and different kinds of units completely changes up the gameplay and the strategies of the game, and is arguably more difficult simply because of just how different units can be from faction to faction based on their allegiances.

Shogun 2 is an exceptional strategy game that is supported by it's powerful atmosphere as it enters the Sengoku period. It's soundtrack also attempts to tie in a Japanese cultural theme, while also sounding a bit interesting. Graphically, I think the game also looks pretty decent. You're given the objective of taking over Japan in it's days of constant war, to become Shogun. You'll be able to make allies with clans that, historically, would have fought you to the death, like making allies with the Uesugi as the Takeda. There's even a multiplayer campaign mode you can play if you want to conquer Japan with a friend, or against one. It's also quite immersive, thanks to the way the game presents every detail, such as a general's speech before battle, which changes as they grow more experienced.

The game follows the premise of total war, strategy becomes key in most battles.
The rules of the game are simple, break your enemies on the battlefield. 


The main goal isn't to kill everyone, but to be victorious and conquer. You can even watch the carnage on the battlefield, as the melee combat's visuals have greatly improved in the series. There's even naval combat, which also has some immersive details, like the sailors singing a song as the row towards the enemy, or burning the enemy ship and even boarding them. There's a lot of strategy, both on and off of the battlefield. In battle, most of the choice belongs to you, as your men won't give themselves orders. Off the battlefield, you will be making deals with other clans, you will be betrayed by allies, or you will betray them, and you will make unlikely allies in times of war. You will also trade with anyone because you will be poor after everyone tries to murder you. You'll revive clans that have been defeated by conquering their homeland and making them your vassal. You may even be defeated yourself in an attempt to overthrow the Shogunate.

As the player, you are given absolute control over how you secure victory. There is no hand to guide you, other than your own, and you decide everything, like army composition, the strategy you employ, and how you plan to stab the others in back. There is much depth to the many aspects of the game, there's even an encyclopedia that explains the many things about this game, including the history of certain units, the function of skills that may be used in battle, and other various literary material. 


Now, let's get into detail about combat. 
It's fast paced and rewards decisive actions and quick strategic thinking, so there's a ton of micro-management.

Well, unless you pause the game, but then again, there's still a lot of decision making.

The UI makes it easy to understand the strengths and weakness of individual units, so you won't need to do research off the battlefield. Just hovering over the unit tells you what characteristics the unit has, so even novice commanders can play new units to their strengths, and many units provide interesting mechanics that expand on the gameplay. For example, a spear wall neutralizes enemy charges and is particularly deadly to cavalry, but it is incredibly vulnerable from the rear. Nodachi samurai have a lethal charge, but they can't hold out in a sustained battle, and katana samurai are powerful anti-infantry all-rounders. Naginata samurai are heavily armored and are strong against cavalry, but are slower than other units. Ninjas can use stealth and throw bombs, making them perfect battlefield assassins.

The terrain and weather makes an impact on the battlefield too. If it's raining, fire arrows won't work, and more soldiers will slip off the side of castle walls when making a siege. Trees can conceal enemy forces, or perhaps you can use them to set an ambush. Gunpowder units can't fire over terrain like arrows can.

Morale plays a huge role in the Total War series. In fact, it might be one of the most important thing in the series.
Units with low morale will rout, causing chaos for an army. Psychologically breaking the enemy is key for this reason, as it could lead to defeat or victory, as it has in many real battles. A good commander knows when and where to strike, and how to do it as well. This is where that extra layer of complexity comes into the game. A decisive charge, for example, doesn't just kill troops. It breaks the troops in the unit when they see their friend get butchered. When a whole unit routs, other units watch in fear. A good commander exploits that knowledge. He doesn't just break them one by one, he tries his best to break all of them, and under the right conditions, it's very possible. Conditions that [b]you[/b] can set up. 
Now, combine that decisive charge from earlier with a barrage of gunfire to the enemy, and then, combine that with the fact that you've just ambushed and killed the enemy general, and finally, put everything you have at the main force of the enemy and return victorious as you cut down the cowards.

[h1] Welcome to Total War. [/h1]

( End of the review for Total War: Shogun 2. )

Below, I will briefly discuss the DLC, which should help you decide if you want them or not.

[h1]DRAGON WAR BATTLE PACK[/h1]
It's about the legendary samurai Saigo Takamori, and you get to live his famous battles.
Saigo Takamori was probably one of the most influential samurai of his time, so if you're interested in the Boshin War, check out this guy on the internet or something.
Anyways, this DLC isn't worth it because it is only six battles. You're better off with just getting Fall of the Samurai, because Fall of the Samurai comes with this anyways, along with a campaign and multiplayer.
In terms of length, it took me about 3 hours on very hard, if that means anything to you.

[h1]Rise of the Samurai[/h1]
In my experience and opinion, nowhere as interesting as the base game and Fall of the Samurai, as those two were simply more interesting eras, personally. It's just that the Sengoku period and the Boshin War were far more unique in terms of history. However, the thing is, if you prefer melee combat with bows instead of lots of gunfire, you may enjoy this over Fall of the Samurai. There's also a bigger emphasis on diplomacy, so there's a lot of political stuff going on. Agents are also different, and provide a different gameplay experience. Consider this DLC if you hate guns and love political intrigue.

[h1]DLC Units[/h1]
Now we can move on to the 'Unit' DLC packs. Those, in my opinion, are quite ridiculous. Instead of adding extra unit variety in the base game, CA decides to put these units as DLC. This is why some people consider the game's multiplayer to be pay-to-win. Now, can you win without any of the DLC? Absolutely. I've beaten plenty of Fall of the Samurai avatars and heavy DLC Shogun 2 armies with the base game, before buying the DLC, but you get a lot less options when it comes to strategy as you don't have the flexibility that the other guys get. Now, is the DLC worth buying for pure 'fun'? I would say so. The units are more fun to use and generally they add a bit more spice to the game, even if you aren't playing multiplayer. However, it's still disappointing to see that this is where the Total War series decided to go all-out with the DLC milking, and it has gotten worse with every other release.",1478458400,1478458400,True,14,0,0.600611329078674316,0,True,False,False,76561198064605819,627,40,20809,0,17242,1593839639,,

Some people write in the reviews, that this is the strength of SHOGUN2, it does not change much, but does some slight improvements. I agree with that.

But in the end I played it a only few times and it rather bored me already.

5,26414404,english,"I want to start off by saying that this game is amazing. One of the best strategy games I've ever played and, that's saying a lot. I specifically purchased Shogun 2 over any other Total War title because of the campaign game modes and because I have a strong love for Japanese culture and the Sengoku Jidai period specifically. It is well balanced, has strong core mechanics and the game modes are a pleasure.

Ok. So now that is out of the way... I honestly cannot recommend this game because it is broken and the people in charge of fixing it have zero intention of doing so. Five years later we have two expansions but the game still crashes at random intervals. Some people can't even start the damned thing.

Even if you can get it running long enough to play, good luck reading any of the text. Even at 1440x900 all the in game text looks incredibly pixelated and some of the characters will bleed into each other making it almost impossible to read certain things. If I didn't know any better I would honestly guess that this is some sort of terrible console port. But, it's not. As much as I hate to say this, the way the game runs now and with the price they are charging it's really little more than a scam. You pay $30 for a game that you can only play for five to ten minutes at a time.

TL:DR:Final Thoughts:
After five years the game has two expansions but is still nearly unplayable and there's no word from the devs. It is incredibly fun for the five minutes you'll be able to play it so maybe pick it up if it ever goes on sale for $5 or something. Otherwise it's a complete waste of your money. Pick up Attila instead.

6,26394440,english,"First off, let me get the cons out of the way.

There's a lack of unit variety. Every faction will come with the standard spear, sword, and bow units.
Some special units can be worthless, and a waste of time to work up to.
The AI is a high improvement over Empire, but it still has flaws. In battle, it will always try to flank your units or go for your general. This can be used to your advantage, if you're smart enough to catch them, but otherwise it's a nuisance.
The map might not be a lot, in comparison to the Europe-central Total War games, but thankfully, there are mods to fix this.
There's an imbalance in the player's growth versus the AI's growth, on the campaign map. You might capture three or four settlements, only to see that already a fourth of the map is painted in one clan's color.
To add to the imbalance, the AI can capture and hold at will, without any penalties. The player will incur penalties when they capture cities.
Pretty much by the end of the game, everyone will hate you, and there's nothing you can do to convince them not to.
Castle battles can be boring, and an assault can be more frustrating than fun.

Now to pros.

It's the most solid Total War game to date. It's the perfect example of strategy, and it truly emphasizes that aspect.
Every clan has added benefits for various units. The Shimazu clan, for instance, has better Katana Samurai than any other clan.
A MASSIVE amount of modifications that are beneficial for the game, especially at the time of this writing.
Agents are very useful, can be improved to your liking, and are not problematic, unlike later Total War games.
The lack of unit variety means battles are more dependent upon skill and strategy, which is perfect for a Total War game.
It is satisfying to overcome the odds of every Japanese clan breathing down your neck after you take hold of the Shogunate, and watch that sweet victory cutscene.
The AI can pull off some game-ending moves right under your nose on the campaign map, if you're not careful, adding to the difficulty.
The DLC is actually worth it, and it's not as harsh a policy as later games are.
Multiplayer, even though I have not played it, has been the most well-received in all of the Total War franchise.
Various improvements for ranged infantry that put it way higher than Empire.
Much friendlier game to enter into the series through, than Rome II or Attila.
Diplomacy is at its best in this game, allowing for marriage, hostage exchange, and setting military access or embargos.

If Rome II feels like a step down in the series, or you're a newcomer to the whole idea of Total War, then step right up to Shogun II.",1478145295,1478145295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998499011,365,13,21803,0,16145.0,1598143755,,

The strategic map is pretty with a great interface to help you avoid ""losing"" units and armies like in previous versions. Playing through the main campaign is a challenging treat. 

Once. The biggest problem with Shogun 2 is the lack of variation between the factions. Each plays very similarly and is largely comprised of the same units. I suppose it's historically accurate considering the much smaller theater of Japan (versus Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia in Medieval and Rome games), but it really squashes the replayability. Additionally, having such tighter objectives makes it a much more linear Total War game. You can approach the capture of Tokyo in any order, making and breaking alliances along the way, but with a smaller landmass, minimal unit variety, and a singular objective, you'll have seen pretty much everything in your first playthrough. 

All told, it's a great game and a lot of fun. The graphics are solid, it runs well, intuitive UI, competent AI.

It takes one full year of no military to keep order, no buildings to entertain and keep my citizens calm and sky-high taxes to enrage the population in all cities to revolt.

56,25915327,english,"I played this game for the free weekend not having the kind of hardware I would have liked but I can't forget the experience for certain. It was large scale battlefield tactics depicted with artistic realism like I'd never seen. Don't go by my hours as I did play this from another source as well not tracked on steam and it was incredible. Don't come into this game expecting Mount And Blade or Civilization. That's not what you're getting here. You're getting the strategic battles at the division level that marked the Edo era of the Japanese feudal era and beyond. A civilization that along with Sun Tzu's Art Of War perfected battlefield tactics and an entire honor system based upon skill, honor, will and most importantly, the Budo and Bujutsu. Sometimes referred to as the Casus Belli in the west but not to be mistaken for the public opinion because Japanese Budo much like the Tao, is not based upon what people think of a warrior. It is based upon what is right and the warrior's ability to comprehend it and sacrifice based upon that concept.

So take to the battlefield with that attitude in this strategy game and you might survive battle though it is a strategic game in which the principles of the Art Of War apply at the tactical level to battles already in progress apply. The graphics are pretty but not the entire selling point here. As the Daimyo or Shogun it is the use of resources, the understanding of the Bushido and the flow of energy on the battlefield that will determine that. Great mystique and gameplay. Great history but there is something subtle going on under the hood here. It is the way. The Budo. Will you be savages or will you simply be, letting the Budo and Bujutsu mould you into a formidable fighting force. Stategy and tactics are words, and cannot describe the flow of battle and that's precisely how this game feels. 

I absolutely recommend this game for stategy buffs drawn to Eastern philosophy and warfare tactics. It is another SEGA masterpiece and that is not a paid advert in any way. It would shame me and SEGA to lie in such a way.

Otherwise, it's yet another hallmark of the decline of total war.  The AI is awfully bad, worse than Napoleon and Medieval.  It's horribly predictable and bugs out at the slightest hiccup.  

Siege battles are ridiculously buggy.  The climbing wall mechanic was an awful idea.  

AI can walk straight past your armies on the campaign map, even though you can't do this to them.  Also as is tradition in total war games, agents are a huge pain because one guy can block an entire army's attack if he happens to be standing where they wanted to fight.  

There are a myriad other ""features"", but the game is overall fairly frustrating.  The only upside is it was the first game to have a working co-op gamemode.  Fighting against your friends is fun... but as I mentioned, sieges are still a pain due to climbing wall mechanics.

- If you really like samurai and ninja, you should get this game.
- If you like Hand to Hand combat, you should get this game.
- If you like excellent graphics, you should get this game.
- If you are a shameful display, you should get this game.
- This game is cheap especially when on sale. You should get this game.
- The Era is awesome.
- The game is highly optimised
- This game is like porn, once you start you would never stop. 
- I dyed my hair purple, just fyi XD 

Cons:
- The developers are never gonna ever edit any bugs that are still left.
- The community is slowly dying.
- The AI is abit stupid, but it would also mean as you get experienced with the game you would become better because you know how to exploit the AI.
-  I Still cannot win LEGENDARY!

Every player of course will stop to laugh at the Oda with their superior peasents what chance would they have against superior samurai. Wait they won in history? Shit me.

You must do this as apparently your people have never seen the rest of the country as its all a map, wow my people dont get out much. Naturaly your new map doesnt have room for the names of your neighbours so they have to go. Then you might as well meet and beat with the new neighbours. Before you know it you might as well become Shogun. Then all of Japan declares war on you and each of the left over clans can apparently summon a stack of full rank samurai. Then you die and start again. Not to mention your ninja who after assassinating most of japans daimyos gets converted by a monk. This guy never had doubts about murder but now?

8. hold out

10. The stack is all max rank samurai

11. WTF 

12. Your army is beaten 

13. See all your 140 sons killed in the battle with their shitty bodyguard

14. watch as enemies march on your Daimyo

15. Your men are retreating my Lord 

16. SHAMEFUR DISPRAY 

17. quit and see the 8 billionth Japanese death poem

40,11972712,english,"Before I go anywhere let me say that Total War Shogun 2 is a beautiful game. My greviances are few but valid.

 The first is the absence of any form of matchmaking for the competitive matches. When I say matchmaking I mean that if I'm a one star rank I expect to be matched with another player of the same rank (maybe one star above). That way its still a challenge but its still fair because you have the same men they do. What I do not want to see is a one star player with access to only small army sizes (limit of 5000 gold) and basic infantry units (me) being matched against a max level player who has access to mounted rifle and foot rifle infantry whos stats far overshadow mine. As well as all the other ""modern"" units found only is FotS.

 My second issue is with the AI and campaign setup. You can pick any faction on the board even an ""easy"" one and regardless of your choice your outcome will be the same: defeat. Why, you either run out of time (the most common occurence as your starting year is 1545 and you have only until the year 1600 (I think) to finish the game. With only 4 turns per year (one a season) you only get 220 total turns to win. Or you expand fast enough and get most of your provinces but your income dries up because, for some reason, unlike Rome II your recruitment buildings don't provide garrisons, with the exception of very few, which leaves you with only one way to keep your towns safe, train more troops, troops who will do nothing but sit in your back towns and eat your income until you're forced into the red and see all your money drain away. This of course isn't including the AI which will ally with you just to declare war on you two turns later or break their trade agrements the next turn. The AI is also immune from all negitive public order penalties. They won't have food shortages, officers loyalty won't decrease, and towns will never rebel. (keep in mind this is on easy) These goodies are reserved for one person...you the player. 

So if you want to get ripped apart play Shogun 2 if you want even a remote chance at victory try ANY of the other Total War titles.",1409789216,1471971208,False,1,0,0.435692399740219116,0,True,False,False,76561198092374170,106,28,11467,0,9417,1565388128,,

66,24984479,english,"Me and a friend started up a coop campaign. I was the Takeda and he was the Uesugi.

After we started the game he reminded me (because I hadn't played the game much) that pretty much every unit in the game had a spear and my focus was cavalry. foooooook


So I start the rise of my great empire like any other great empire by sending off one of my two generals to die in a hopeless battle to remind me that literally everyone in Japan has a pike so why the fuck am I still using cavalry.

Undaunted by the loss I decide to fortify in my province of Kai. I begin training some Ashigaru and upgrading my stables and lands. My Uesugi ally does the same, except he isn't stupid like me so he actually has an army. Inevitably the clan he starts at war with enters his lands. But then winter sets in so they decide to leave cause they can't handle a few snowflakes.

A few turns later and my ancient enemy of like six turns has been conquered by my ally's ancient enemy of like five turns and they declare war upon me. That's alright Takeda shall stand strong. Too bad my other ally, the Imagawa, decided they don't wanna be friends without benefits anymore so they fuck off. That's alright I didn't need them anyways. I still have my ally at Uesugi and his vassal.

Well when shit hits the fan, it hits the fan hard. The Hojo, my southern neighbor, seeing my decimated army as a weakness decrare war. Fuck. I am now surrounded by enemies so I decide I'm just gonna be a bitch and hide in my castle. In a few turns the Hojo send an army to my border and I prepare for the worst to come.

However, they change their mind and decide that fighting me is too hard so they go pick on my ally's vassal and they get wreckt n shrekt. And to make matters worse the Anegakoji have invaded Takeda lands to the north and are pounding on the gates of Kofu.

The Daimyo has decided enough is enough and sallies out of the castle to meet the Anegakoji. While their army attacks the castle, the Daimyo's son, Yoshinobu, leads the cavalry out of the eastern gates and surges before the enemies rear lines crushing their archers, killing their general and delivering a crushing blow.

With that army defeated we prepare to face the Hojo horde that is bound to arrive from the east. However news has arrived from the Uesugi. The Anegakoji to his west have invaded but were ultimately crushed by their army. However to make matters somehow impossibly worse it would seem the Ikko Ikki have taken over Etchu and are now waging war against the Uesugi, all seems lost.

And yet from the jaws of defeat comes victory and survival. The Uesugi have decided that they are going to abandon everything in their captial and assist me by taking Shinano to my north. I say he's bloody mad and going to lose us the game. He says that it's ingenius and to shut up.

Regardless I have no say in the matter and can only watch from the edge of my seat in terror as two armies appear on his border as soon as he leaves his capital undefended, one from the Anegakoji and another from the Ikko Ikki. It would also seem at this time that the Hojo have decided to invade Kai and an army appears on my eastern border.

First to the fight is the Anegakoji to the southwest of Uesugi. They are torn asunder and retreat back from whence they came. But now the Hojo attack Kofu and I must prepare myself. The Hojo arrive at the city having torched the valley behind them my Daimyo gives a heroic speech and decrares we shall take no prisoners.

We meet them on the open field of battle. My Yari Ashigaru, who form the center shall be the bait for my trap, charge the enemy head on uncaring of losses. They strike the enemy with the force of a tidal wave and yet it seems that it barely put a dent in their line. But it matters not, for my Katana Cavalry have arrived on the enemies left with the Daimyo's son to destroy their line. And yet even they do not have enough of a force to rout the Hojo. So I order my Daimyo to attack with the two thirds of the Takeda cavalry.

Cutting through the enemy like a death star through alderaan we completely destroy the Hojo army with barely a hundred fleeing the field of battle. However it comes a great cost with nearly all of our horses killed and half of the Ashigaru dead, it is a pyrrhic victory in every concievable sense of the word.

However we do not despair. Our Uesugi allies have taken Shinano to the north and somehow retaken their capital from the Ikko Ikko army that had captured it. And so we begin to rebuild our force and in time advance through the valley to the east intent on returning the favor to the traitorous Hojo.

After reaching the border we spot the enemy army on a range of hills to the north. And so we advance upon them our cavalry yet again giving us a glorious victory. However terrible news has come from the west. The Imagawa sensing that our capital is undefended decrare war against us. And so the Daimyo's son races back to Kofu to save the city.

The Imagawa are at our walls before we know what has happened. But it seems that Yoshinobu has arrived with the Takeda cavalry just in time. With the Daimyo leading the defense of the city with a small Ashigaru garrison, some given to us by our ally Uesugi, distract the enemy spearmen at the walls while our reinforcements come in from behind. Looking to be a repeat of the earlier siege I begin to celebrate but then realize that those are indeed hundreds of spearmen charging at my cav.

Taking but inflicting heavy casualties upon the Imagawa I pull my cavalry back to the east gate with barely a total of thirty living. However, upon cresting the hill I notice a massive horde of enemy Yari Ashigaru approaching. Deciding that I'm going to go out on fall of the Samurai levels of badassary I charge the enemy with my thirty horsemen.

Miraculously the very first unit my horsemen encounter on their charge it the enemy Daimyo. And after about ten seconds of fighting he is slain. This causes the enemy army, which is about 40 times larger than my horsemen to shatter and rout. Amazed my Daimyo charges to save his son n friends from any remaining foes.

Having lost nearly my entire army in the battle I decide to be a bitch again and watch the Uesugi. My ally has once again abandoned his captial, which once again is under immediate threat of invasion by the Ikko Ikki. He conquers a towny held by an enemy I didn't even know he was at war with and runs back to defend his capital just in time yet again. MOFO is a lucky sonovabitch.

Destined to be eternally stuck in my capital the Hojo are attacking again and it seems the Imagawa aren't far behind.

I defeat the Hojo army in the open field yet again with my cavalry taking minor losses and fall back to defend Kofu once again.

But this time was not destined to be like the others. Yoshinobu, like a well practiced routine, takes the cavalry to destroy the enemy from behind. Everything is going well enough to plan. Enemy archers, dead. Enemy spearmen, fighting but losing at the east gate. Enemy cavalry dead from a prolonged engagement.



Somehow, t'would seem. The enemy general, by himself and himself alone, has snuck into the castle and is now twenty seconds away from ultimate victory through pure bullshit and luck. But no, I can make it! I order all of my forces inside to banzai the general and retake the tower. Beginning their charge I can only watch in desparation then horror as I realize they won't make it. With barely ten paces between my troops and the enemy general the timer reaches zero. And I lose my only city.",1471484871,1471484871,True,22,36,0.651668727397918701,4,True,False,False,76561198110767235,264,30,4126,0,2408,1592881006,,

On the down side, I have had some bad experiences with the fleet battles (no surprise). Also, the automatic resolving of battles can sometimes be a little stupid resulting in a vastly outnumbered force commits seppuku instead of defending their fort.

There's a great amount of unit variety, and there's fun additional features such as espionage with ninjas, which helps make each campaign fun.

I personally am a combination of a multiplayer and that last category. The multiplayer is *%?$ and they seem to have adopted a more of an avatar system which means that the player must work long hours to do anything other than a Yari Ki spam army comp.  The modding for campaign seems to be in abundance with all sorts of modifications available from Steam Workshop. But I disliked vanilla Shogun 2! Just didn't suit my needs. But when on a last hope I would get at least some of my money's worth I got FoTS and JESUS that turned the game into the best game I've ever played for that last category-thingy!

The thing that made me drawn in and attached to this game more then the others were the traits you can choose for your generals and the tech trees. The family tree is also in this game which is a huge plus for me. The combat is smooth and ambient.

48,24285495,english,"I fell in love with Rome: Total War in high school and have been a follower of the TW series ever since. I'm also generally interested in the Sengoku period of Japan, and so this game scratches that itch like no other.

If you haven't played a TW game since Empire, you should know that the intricate and frequently convoluted ""traits"" system for named characters like generals, spies, and clergy has been significantly dumbed-down, sometimes for the better. No longer do you have to move generals out of your starting cities for fear of them picking up the ""Bad Tax Assessor"" traits simply by virtue of your starting cities having low population (and thus, low tax income). Character traits are now chosen by the player when a character gains a level (for generals, by winning battles, for agents, by completing missions), and they are all positive, giving bonuses to many things. This eliminates the frustration found in Rome where you basically needed two classes of generals, one to lead armies and one to govern provinces. The Chivalry/Dread mechanic from Medieval 2 makes a sort of return, with each general having a Loyalty score and your Daimyo having an Honor score (the more honorable your daimyo, the more loyal his generals). Honor is decreased by looting captured cities and not coming to the aid of allies in war. Honor can only be increased by use of a skill point at level up (up to a certain point) or making a rival clan a vassal of yours (which is actually possible in S2, unlike previous TW games where the computer-controlled factions refused to accept even the most obvious defeat). 

Each faction has some unique benefit and units, with some being more useful than others. For example, the Hojo clan can build castles more cheaply than other clans, making them good defenders, while the Shimazu clan are known for their skilled swordsmen, recruiting and maintaining Katana Samurai for less money. While the unit rosters are quite similar to one another in the base game, the styles used by each clan make playing as every clan a distinct experience. DLC adds the ability to play as unusual clans like the Ikko Ikki, who follow a unique sect of Buddhism at odds with conventional Zen, and the Otomo, who benefit from embracing Christianity by making good use of Western-style guns.

The religion aspect of the game is relatively simple: apart from the Ikko Ikki, every clan is either Buddhist or Christian (Catholic, presumably), with the vast majority being Buddhist (Shinto is mentioned, but doesn't really play much of a role, since Zen Buddhism was widely embraced by the samurai class). Depending on who you play as, religious revolts can be either nonexistant or an almost constant hassle, as trade with Western powers will introduce Christianity to your lands in exchange for powerful firearm-wielding soldiers. You use your religious agents to convert enemy provinces to your religion, demoralize enemy armies, inspire your own armies, and bamboozle enemy agents by forcing them to question their beliefs. 

Espionage is handled by ninja, who act as spies, saboteurs, and assassins. Their skill trees allow them to specialize in one of these fields, and they get the added bonus of short FMV films of them going about their missions. Success will give you a front-row seat to a cunning attack on the enemy general, and failure will get you a hilarious (though often fatal) view of the ninja's incompetance.

Speaking of soldiers, the relative homogeneity of the clans gives rise to a familiar pattern with units: swords beat spears, spears beat cavalry, cavalry beats swords (with outmaneuvering and charging from behind), spears beat cavalry, and ranged attackers plus enough distance can shred anything. While some might find this tiresome after a while, I actually like getting the chance to refine the tactics used for a given army formation. There are also highly-specialized units like Kisho Ninja, Naginata Samurai, and Fire-Bomb Throwers that you will get occasional use out of, but for the most part the tried-and-true strategies hold fast (hey, samurai were usually pretty traditionalistic, what do you expect?).

The AI of the game has been drastically improved since Empire, though not always fairly. AI-controlled factions will attempt naval invasions and tend towards the aggressive side, though astute observers will notice that the AI tends to create enormous, expensive, and highly-experienced armies from nowhere. Having a minor clan suddenly garrison its capital with an army of 2000 samurai which it couldn't possibly afford is quite common. Some people like that for the challenge it presents. I for one don't like the AI having advantages via cheating, but that's what mods are for, and there are plenty of mods to address virtually every aspect of the game.

Finally, there is one sticking point that a lot of people who otherwise love the game hate, myself included. The goal of every campaign is to become Shogun. The current Shogun doesn't like the idea of anyone else usurping that position, and so once you have a certain level of fame (increased by conquering land and winning battles), the Realm Divide happens. The Shogun declares you an enemy of the state, sort of like in Rome, except here, every faction in the game starts to hate you even if they've never met you. Your trusted allies might stand by you for a little while, but they inevitably turn on you. Even your vassals, who you allowed to live just to prove your generosity, will attack you in short order. The prospect of the middle to end of the game featuring an unavoidable, endless, economy-killing war turns a lot of people off. Sure, it's Total War, but coupled with the AI being able to spawn free-upkeep armies and navies out of nowhere, it comes off as a real ""screw you"" to the player. You're being told to be always focused on conquest and expansion, while really you should have been focused on building up your economy so you can be self-sufficient, all while under a time limit based on what length of campaign you selected. It can wind up being very frustrating.

But again, there are mods for nearly every aspect of the game. And for a tactical game about the Sengoku Jidai, I know of very few that give the epic feel of Shogun 2. It has its flaws, but I love this game and keep coming back to it.",1468368295,1468368295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999474668,349,1,16989,0,14715,1588027834,,

6,24001082,english,"Shogun 2 is an amazing game. The vanilla game is a blast, especially if you *sigh* buy the blood pack. Not a big fan of having to pay for my ultra violence, but it is worth it on sale to watch your little minions hack each others limbs off in a spray of food coloring.

The clans all use pretty much the same troops (with some minor differences), but have pretty good differences in perks for each clan. How you expand and push your advantages is up to you, and diplomancy isn't half bad. Some of the DLC clans have extremely different playstyles, which makes for a far more interesting campaign.

Rise of the samurai is a nice throwback to olden Japan, where your troops are almost purely peasant levys and not the armies of pure samurai of the vanilla campaign. Your samurai are far more valuable, like the knights of the middle ages. And when they engage in warfare your samurai earn considerable respect. Where the game falls kind of flat is the war of the different factions. Unlike in vanilla where each clan is it's own side, in ROTS you instead fight for one of three factions trying to win over all of Japan, and it becomes somewhat confusing who you should support and who to slaughter at times. Some of the units feel very underwhelming, and the special characters don't feel as tight as the vanilla campaign.

Fall of the samurai however... oh my. The game enters what many have mentioned is the ""Era of Tom Cruise and the defence of the mighty sword of Japan!"" You enter a civil war between the Shogun of Japan and the Emperor of Japan. Western half is 'mostly' in support of the Emperor, while the east supports the Shogun (there are exceptions of course, and people can jump ship if they feel their side is losing). Your naval combat is pretty fun, with steam boats on the way towards a semi modern navy, and while your army will likely include rifles from the civil war era of the USA, they sadly cannot fight worth beans in melee. This allows for a yari formation to essentially slaughter your line troops if they manage to close.

Makes for alot of fun battles. Rifles are not the amazing tool you instantly expect them to be, proving that a warrior with a spear and courage can kill someone with a rifle who has none. Cannons make a solid showing, starting out as wooden cannons that amaze me that they don't simply blow up, moving towards proper heavy cannons. Naval warships are also vastly important as they can provide naval bombardments, giving you solid artillery support when attacking a settlement or enemy in the open if you have a fleet close enough to shell them.

This makes having at least a decent naval power essential for attacking strongholds, as while yes you can send your troops to rush the forts... you likely will lose tons of troops to entrenched rifles and spears. If you have played Empire/Napolean... don't expect your tactics to work here. While yes there are alot of rifles here like in those games, you have to treat your riflemen like archers of old. You cannot storm a keep with these men, instead leaving that side of the load to your spears/dismounted cavalry.

If you get this game, and don't want to sink a ton of money the vanilla game is a blast. If you want to try out FOTS, understand that it is a standalone expansion meaning you can buy it without having to try out Shogun 2. The multiplayer is also a blast, and as you level up so do your troops.

Get this game, will give you many many many hours of enjoyment.",1467419318,1467419318,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999571966,683,56,13569,0,7367,1592295995,,

Pros
- The game has an authentic array of units at its disposal
- The campaign is so realistic than anyone who controls Kyoto shall be involved in the Realm Divide wherein all the family clans in Japan will become your worst enemies
- The best thing about Shogun is the agents. Why? is because they can make a difference in the game like Sabotaging Armies, Committing Arson and Assasinating Generals and Faction leaders. Aside from that they can administer settlements and apprehend spies from other factions
- The movement points that you can build a railway to easily transport armies across Japan
- The General can rally and inspire wavering troops that are falling back 
- Lastly offcourse no Total War game would be complete without the battle. The battle has a new animation system that you can even see Samurai decapitating enemy warriors and blood splurting all around the battlefield.

Cons

This means that you can make crazy battles; I created a battle solely of ninjas and generals, for example, which was entertaining. The units have different tactical formations and powers that you can use, and the individual soldiers have been recreated with great detail.

The weak part of the game is - as always in CA games - the AI, especially when it comes to diplomacy... I guess the battle AI has improved a little since the absolutely terrible one in Empire TW, but nonetheless it is nothing to write home about.

The multiplayer Avatar Conquest game mode and the possibility to play co-op multiplayer campaigns is brilliant. A down side may be that the waiting time to get in a battle in Avatar Conquest is a bit too long for my liking.

Another thing I dislike is that - just like in Medieval 2 TW - I think gunpowder units are underpowered because of their poor range and reload rate and always get massacred by those primitive archers -_- ...

On the other hand, I really like the agent system which they improved a lot since earlier titles. Also, the naval battles seem to be fun and more easily playable then in Napoleon TW for example. I do have a few concerns with naval battles, but not big enough to mention them. They are mostly ok.

All i can say is, i didn't know what to expect from this game.
So let me start with all the good stuff:D
-So we have some kinda smarter AI, even at times when they aren't smart its amusing to see them flail and fall on it's face.
-The campaigns are pretty damn cool, this has to be one of the first TW games i've actually enjoyed playing camp.
-THE GRAPHICS, HOLY HELL. Now my computers pretty terrible, so i'm surprised i can even get it to high graphics.
-The voice acting, well what do i say other than, SHAMEFRU DISPRAY!
-So glad to see AI soldiers actually attempting to fire over hills and such. Although i do miss the moments where your soldiers fire into the dirt.
-Pretty cool multiplayer system, althought matchmaking 0_o. Pls, i don't want to be put against lvl 1 shogunates
-Naval battles are pretty unique, especially fall of the samurai. Love the first person.
-ALSO WHALES, THEY HAVE WHALES 0_0 OMERGOHD WHALES!

Bad stuff :(
-To be honest, the cutscenes could be better. But i enjoyed laughing at the rigid clothing of the emperor as he waved his arm around and the constant shocked look of some of the characters.

Overall its a pretty damn amazing game, didn't think it could beat Napoleon (until i found the guns then i started blasting samurai all over Japan) 

Oh did i mention that there's actual WHALES. It's good to see some fish in the ocean, oh wait sorry, i mean mammals in the water.

49,23118108,english,"This is actually not a straightforward ""I hate this game"", I don't like it and I'm recommending that people NOT buy it, but I have my reasons.

I don't like streamlined games, I don't like games designed to be quicker and smoother - I'm talking about games like Age of Empires 3, etc. Shogun is not [i]necessarily[/i] guilty of this, but I [i]do[/i] think that they have engineered the game to happen quickly, at a breakneck pace which creates a cinematic, action-packed campaign, and I just don't really like that.

Empire: Total War is the iteration of the series that I famously (if I was famous or at least noted) think got the most things right (the combat is just a bit more repsonsive than RTW), and one of the things it certainly got right for me was the pacing of the campaigns. The status quo was allowed to exist, sometimes for many turns consecutively, if you so desired.

In Shogun 2, the status quo means death. Factions fall like leaves in autumn, and mega-factions rise in their place, and if you have not been rabidly slaguhtering foes at the same speed then suddenly you will come up against titanic armies and war declarations out of nowhere. You have no time to build up coherent economies so you can't raise the troops to repel armies that rear end you at one end of your over-stretched empire while your main force is at the other end.

Not only does this damage your chances, it also damages the chances of your opponents, as more often than not you will find provinces severely undermanned that u can just waltz in and conquor.

Maybe I'm not good enough at speed play. Maybe I can't wring every last bit of economy out of regions that I'm apparently expected to put well into the black within two turns. Maybe, really, I just wanna sit down, shut up and smell the blossoms for a bit, instead of charging across Sengoku Jidai with a katana clenched in my teeth.

Frankly, to me, it seems that this game is seriously over-hyped and is far from being the greatest ever. I cannot in al seriousness believe that this is even considered a strategy game. I have played this game with mods and without and nothing seems to be able to fix the great underlying problems that this game has. I can praise the games graphics, I can praise its UI etc. I cannot praise, however, the battle gameplay. About 3/4 of the time that I spent in a battle is mainly fast forwarding through my army's positioning, trying to find a good position etc but none of this matters because in the end, all battles are reduced to maybe 5-7 arrow volleys and then a mad charge of the entire army and pretty much everything devolve into a mess in a matter of seconds and it is over shortly after, the actual battle lasting less than 10 minutes.. I have not been able to play a single battle where this is not what happens. There is absolutley no tactics by the AI. Very rareley does it attempt flanking, preferring to simply charge its calvary to the center of my line. Perhaps the only smart thing the AI does, but it does with such an annoyingly frequent and predictable frequency is to head to hills and simply camp it out there. ""Smart move,"" except that it is easily countered by having missile superiority. I routed around half an army just by shooting at the stupid hill camping AI, because it simply refused to leave its hilltop, expecting for me to charge uphill. That was playing as the Chosokabe. Frankly I have derived no enjoyability from this game. The best I can describe the battle system is as a reskin of rock-paper-scissors with a few wild card. Sword beats Spear. Spear Beats Cav. Cav beats sword. Archers beat anything and everything if it doesn't touch them, otherwise they beat nothing. I really tried to like the game, but I'm done trying. Maybe I just suck at Shogun but can somehow adapt to the tactics of the many other factions of Rome 2. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and that's why I can't seem to win a battle without losing over half my army. It wouldn't be so bad I suppose, if the AI losing an entire army had any sort of impact, but seeing that in 4 turns they already spammed yet another full stack, any victory I'm able to scrape is entireley pointless... Much like every attempt I've made at liking this game.",1462824018,1462824018,False,0,0,0.457380473613739014,0,True,False,False,76561198055892380,193,10,2413,0,1404,1495693555,,

Nota: 10/10

Bem, o que falar desse jogo ?! Sem duvidas o melhor lançamento da franquia Total War !

O jogo se passa no século XVI, Japão Feudal, o pais vive em uma guerra tornando o mesmo dividido entre clãs , no modo campanha, durante a seleção de clãs no qual deseja jogar existe uma grande variedades de clãs, todos com seus pontos altos e baixos. você pode escolher um clan que seja muito forte em cavalaria, mas a sua infantaria possui armamentos inferiores, você pode escolher um clã onde as construções são de pouco custos, mas o preço para treinamento militar é superior

Seu objetivo ?? dominar o japão !

estilo de jogo? RTS

Ja tive contato com todas as outras franquias de Total War, mas tenho total certeza que SHOGUN 2 foi o que se destacou pelos seguintes motivos : 


1° Desempenho gráfico 10/10
2° modo história 9/10
3° excelente temática
4° Sons 10/10, muito realista durante os combates, e fora dos combates
5° dificuldade estratégica 10/10

O jogo me chamou bastante atenção na parte de IA, muitos que ja jogaram outros Total Wars sabem que alguns deixaram a desejar no quesito IA, Empire Total War; Total War: Rome II foram sem duvidas para mim um fracasso da franquia, mesmo Rome 2 vir ser lançado muito tempo depois de Shogun 2, acaba perdendo em quesitos graficos, IA, Campanha e outros motivos. IA de shogun 2 realmente funciona. é possivel aproximar a tela e ver o combate de perto, você percebe nitidamente a interação de praticamente todos os NPCs, ao contrario de Rome2 e Empire TW ficarem perdidos no mapa, congelarem, nao receber comandos. sem duvidas a CA apostou muito alto na perte IA do jogo e acabou dando muito certo !!

Pontos Fracos :

1° modo multiplayer, o jogo foi lançado a anos e nunca chegou srv oficial dedicado a Ámerica do Sul
2° modo campanha em certos pontos deixam a desejar, turnos muito lentos, questao de distribuição de alimentos nas cidades

Bom juntei um pouco de informação que tenho do jogo, espero que ajude para que qualquer jogador tenha interesse em comprar o jogo

Another good thing is that the AI tries to make big threatening armies instead of several small irritating armies as in Medieval 2, Rome 1 and sometimes Empire. Another thing that makes the game very good an more realistic is that it is hard to keep up several big professional armies if you don't have much territory.

Combining beautiful graphics, scheming generals, awesome multiplayer, and deep strategic gameplay with countless small details that fill it with historical flavor and drama, Shogun 2 is one of the most captivating strategy games ever made. 

You can take charge of any of the major factions of Japanese feudal history, from the mighty Oda to the more delicate but well positioned Tokugawa clan. Any of the clans could rise to take the position of Shogun under your leadership.

I would also highly recommend you to get the two main DLC for Shogun II the “Rise of the Samurai” and the “Fall of the Samurai”, as they are stand alone games in there own right adding a whole new level to your gaming experience. 

To finish I'd like to say this game is possibly one of the best RTS's I've ever played, the attention to detail is impressive and the tremendous replayability make the game a must have for any gamers library, enjoy hours of entertainment with Total War: Shogun 2.

Intel releases a chip every year; in a tick-tock system. One year they will reduce the node size, the next year they will optimize their new chip. It seems like this is what SEGA is doing with the TOTAL WAR francise, SHOGUN 2 (when Fall of the Samurai is taken into account) is pretty much the optimization of their new node size which was Empire.

[list]
    [*]Positives
[/list]

If you enjoyed Empire I would highly recommend this game especially the Fall of the Samurai standalone (guns are fun and that's why Rome II wasn't). The game has improved on almost every aspect that was in Empire that it still has in the game. Multiplayer is good, but sometimes buggy (not game breakingly).

[list]
    [*]Negatives
[/list]

However the game isn't perfect, comparing it to Empire the [b]scale[/b] that I personally enjoyed so much naturally wasn't there. You obviously don't colonise the Americas, or India, instead you're stuck on Japan and a few surrounding islands (China would have been a nice addition to colonise) however this is to be expected from the time period and location but just keep that in mind. Secondly the [b]economy/ building[/b] in SHOGUN 2 is dumbed down, which I found to be a major letdown simply due to my playstyle, you have no growing towns, you can't change what a town does (actually there are no towns at all, only resources which you can extract; farms, harbours, and various resources such as minerals, crime dens, etc). It seems like they've moved a lot of what was once in the towns to the cities, which is honestly a shame. There aren't the same ""national wonders"" as Empire had (where you could only build one per faction).


[list]
    [*]Verdict
[/list]

4/5; The game is very good and enjoyable, everything it still has in it is done better than in Empire save for a few relatively minor critisisms.

*EDIT* After playing some multiplayer with a friend I have changed my review to not recommended. The game is extremely buggy and crashes constantly regardless of the time and effort taken to prevent/fix the issue through loading prior saves and not replicating the circumstances that caused the crash. SEGA and CA need to fix the game. Saying that it has multiplayer should amount to false advertizing.

The diplomacy, the ninjas, the family tree, the ambience, music and feel of the game blew my little teenage mind and I have been in love with the series ever since.

So, 10 years later and Shogun 2 comes out. I was excited by the trailers but apprehensive due to the underwhelming experience of Empire: Total War. But like the loyal Creative Assembly fanboy that I am, I bought this title and have been playing the crap out of it ever since. 

Because let us be honest, it is one of the finest games they have made to date.

Pros:
-Cool fights
-Epic battles
-Samurai swords galore
-Strategy and stuff
-Ninjas

Cons:
-Unrealistic duels
-Very limited unit roosters (In vanilla)
-Character skill trees (unless you are into that sort of thing, you sexy freak)
-Limited settlement development (why does my city only have 3 buildings? Can't someone rent out their living room so we can set up the gambling den in there?)
-No city battles (Probably because as mentioned the cities only seem to consist of 3 buildings)

However, .... Work and Family life hit in and for a few years couldnt play as much, Empire and Napolean pretty much past me by, I kept buying  them all as and when they went on sale, beacuse I knew one day I might get to play them again! (Sorry ""Game Horder"" alert!)

That day has come, I've played when I could on and off over the years, but this week I managed to knock the bottom out of Shogun 2, and its quite frankly awsome!

Also I thought that the naval combat on here was beautiful and intriguing to watch (imo). So if you are looking for a good strategy game, then I would recommend Shogun 2 (or Rome 1 which is my favourite strategy game ever).

44,21769571,english,"I was on my way to become the Shogun of Japan. Many allies along with rivals were fighting against each other to claim that throne, however, I was one who liked to attack from the shadows and sabotage from within. I trained my agents in the art of sublety and manipulation so that they can do their tasks without fail. 
After having the first clan to declare war on me for not trading my goods with them, I started on my conquest from then and there. Clan after clan, I destroyed them on both the frontlines and within. Although one concern was in the back of my mind; the notification kept popping up year after year, a son/daughter was born. I was misunderstanding these announcements, since I, the Daiymo of my clan have not been home for years because of my campaign. As a sign of betrayal of my wife, I executed her and the sons and daughters who followed after. My clan soon was frightened of my actions and all dishonor was shown. I, however, needed a country to conquer. I made deals with Europe and was granted superior ships and cannons for attacking castles. I bribed my enemies with hostages of other clans to marry in if I was granted freedom of travel on their lands with wealth in my pockets. It wasn't until half of Japan was on fire until I claimed the title ""Shogun"" for my clans name.

The experiences and playstyles are endless!  

In all seriousness though here is my actual review....above was just my promotion of the game..

I could never get in to any of the other Total War games.  I played both Rome 2 and Empire a bit, but eventually stopped playing them after a game or two.  I find this game way more fun to play and I think it is way better to look at.

Here are some reasons why I think this is the best newer Total War game..

-Balance.  The other Total War games can become confusing with the huge amount of other units...It takes way too long to figure out what counters what.  In this game, it is quite simple but still complex at the same time.  Horse beats archer, archer beats soldier, soldier beats horse...this rock, paper, scissors forumula makes it easy to pick up and learn.  There are still other units that add complexity, but for the most part you can rely on trusting this simple formula

-Design/Graphics.  Rome 2 might look slightly better in terms of polygon count and effects, but not by much.  This game looks better overall though!  The Japanese artwork and music throughout the game really helps to immerse you.  Everything else looks nearly identical to the new Total War games, but this runs better and has better performance.

-Decent unit movement, control, and COLLISION DETECTION!  One of the main reasons I always got sick of the other Total War games was because it always felt that you wern't in control of your units or armies...A group of 40 soldiers, essentially acted like one unit.  This game still isn't like other RTS games where you have control over a single unit...a single unit is still considered an army, but this concept has been improved and is actually better than it is in Rome 2.  Sending in a group of 30 or so soldier in Total War games was always lame...the individual soldiers would kinda just walk around the enemies not doing anything and every 5 seconds you would eventuall see one of your units hit someone with a sword.  This is only really a problem with melee units, but its a really big problem because it make it feel like your units arn't fighting right.  Its still an issue in this game, but units are much more likely to engage eachother in battle and not just walk around not doing anything.

-The expansion!  Usually expansions in Total War games or other RTS dont really change the gameplay that much.  The expansion in this game almost turns it into a whole other game!  Without the expansion, you are just using mainly archers, sword, horses, and other simple weapons....but by installing the expansion you upgrade the technology of the Japanese by like 500 years!  This is mainly because Japan was feudalistic before the arrival of western powers...The introduction of such different weapons and technologies would seem out of place usually, but in this historical context it makes sense!  It really changes the game a lot, and it makes both versions of the game fun to play.

Way better than any other Total War game I have played...which is medieval 2, empire, and Rome 2.  A great game which you can always come back to!  Tons of cool MOD support, like one where they add tons of blood and decapitations!  Awesome!

56,21680345,english,"To begin with, this is perhaps one of the Semi-Recent Total Wars that is deserving of a proper and postive review.

Think of a time when CA was innovative with each of their titles (Yes including Empire) and when DLC was actually worth buying for a total war title. 

Shogun 2 in my opinion remains as one of the best Total War titles, and I would recommend this over Rome II anytime. Not that Rome II is not fun, it just doesn't feel as innovative as Shogun 2 is. Shogun 2 set in Fedual Japan has a very straightforward Rock Paper Scissors mechanic for the massive battles. Yet, it is one of the hardest battle styles to master in my opinion, not because of the diverse nations, not because of the unit power ups, and not because of overpowered special units. The game is hard because each unit counts and can mean the difference between being conquered or conquering, I still find myself having the hardest time against a large stack of units in Shogun 2 than Rome II.

Shogun 2's campaign although not as extensive as the whole of Europe or the conquest of the New World, Shogun 2 is one of those games that will make you manage each province with specific priorites and strategies. Sacrificing a province in order for it to become a gold powerhouse while another province builds your katanas and cav, makes you ponder as to the desicion in order to become the shogun and conquer Kyoto, and if your ambitious enough Japan.

And even with the games age, this is still beautiful, even the loading screens are easy on the eyes and give you an even more realistic interpretation of the Medieval Era of Japan. CA worked around the forced combat animations that made each unit look as if they were each a Samurai Soldier that trained with their blades before the battle. 

This game is not a SHAMEFUR DISPLAY rather it still stands as a beautiful, tough and fresh turn base strategy game. 

CA and SEGA should both take the time to go back and listen to the gamers, people responded well with Shogun 2 not because it was the newest total war title, but because it was nolstolgic and fresh. The DLC is worth buying, the base game isn't ""incomplete"" and battles are fun to play and watch.",1457328523,1457328523,True,3,0,0.551401853561401367,0,True,False,False,76561198046737915,192,7,8054,0,4771,1590863278,,

Such dilemmas include, should you have specialized settlements, some military, some economic. Should you amass a thousand Ashigaru (peasant) spears and bows? Or a few hundred Elite Samurai, trained in the ways of the horse, sword, spear, and bow? Should you adopt Christianity, and gunpowder with it?

Good

1) The game allows you to do whatever you want with your empire. If you want to set the Takeda Clan's land on fire, you can. You want to assassinate a general that is pissing you off? You can. Do you want to be a cold ruler and kill your own subjects if they disagree with you? You can (With consequences). Do you want to build a huge trade empire? You can. You get the picture.

2) It looks good, not amazing compared to today but back when it was made people were like ""DAMN!!!!""

3) All combat in the game was animated using real-life sword masters therefore it looks amazing

4) Large scale battles. While on the campaign map you control your empire, but when you go into combat with another army it is a whole different story. You have thousands of soldiers (all animated, and looking unique) fighting each other at one time with cavalry charges, gunfire, arrows flying everywhere, and even mortars in the later stages of the game. While this is going on you have the morale factor, if a regiment sees allies routing, starts loosing a lot of men, is set on fire, is surrounded, or if the commander dies they loose morale which leads to them being less effective in battle and if it gets too low they will break (They will run away for a short amount of time), and if it gets worse than that the unit will be shattered (They will run from the battle and can no longer be controlled).

5) Meaningful allies. I found that in most of the other Total War games your allies don't help much or all out betray you all the time. In Shogun if you ally with another clan and start a war with another clan, they will amass an army to help you. They may also trade with you or give you military access to their territory.

6) Familty trees. You have the ability to arrange a marriage with another clan if you have an unmarried woman in your family. As time progresses new family members are born and after a few years in-game they become adults ready to marry or command an army (Each have their own skills, disadvantages, and personality). You may also adopt generals into your army and make one of your best family members your heir (It is chosen for you in most Total War games).

7) Huge map. Shogun 2 features a huge detailed campaign map filled with cillages, mines, docks, farms, etc. There are also 25 - 30 clans to dominate on the map each with their own buffs and weaknesses.

8) Naval battles. This is the first game in the series with naval battles. Basically you have a fleet of ships with a certain amount of archers and infantry on each ship, each ship has their own speed and strength of their hull. The battle either ends when you set the enemy ships on fire using flaming arrows or bomb throwing ships, or by boarding the ship and letting your infantry fight (This makes the crew surrender on the enemy ship if you are successful, adding a new ship to your navy).

9) Avatar conquest. This is the main multiplayer mode of Shogun 2. You create a general, create a banner, name your faction, and invade territory on the conquest map. You also build your own army, and if a unit sees a lot of battles you can make them veterans allowing you to color, name, and upgrade them. You attack other players using the army you created and are ranked on the leaderboards.

10) DLC. There are multiple DLCs that add new units to the game, and one that makes it bloodier. The two large DLCs are Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. These are based in different time periods than the base game and add new units, factions and a new story.

11) No real noticeable bugs that I can think of

1) At times units will loose morale and run even if they were about to win the fight

2) Some units in the game are unbalanced and can easily destroy most of your army



Well now that you know the good and bad about the game hopefully you have decided on whether or not to buy it.

As for my rating I give this game a 10/10

Unfortunately the game injects complete randomness in with possibly the worst diplomacy I've ever seen in a game. Random occurences that are meant to provide some variety instead become punitive exercises if you refuse to cripple yourself. 

Most importantly, diplomacy is absolutely atrocious. Virtually everything in the game hurts your reputation with others, and it is virtually impossible to reclaim lost reputaiton except through turn upon turn of idleness or gift-giving. You can have a faction break their trade agreement with you, and then discover that their perception of you is hurt by a broken trade agreement - one they broke themselves! Being an ally LOSES power - this means that years of staunch alliance with marriage agreements get worse, not better. Everything diplomatically is on a clock to getting worse, meaning that playing a game where you use combat and diplomacy to advance yourself is impossible. Virtually the only possible strategy is to make few friends, and just conquer and make war and not try to interact with anyone, because no alliance will ever truly help you.

The campaign has some many flaws... First of all the siege is not siege, its a bunch of soldiers invading a mansion and thats it. They climb walls and burn the gates making it impossible to win by destroying siege weapons... well actually this is another thing, you will barely need a siege weapon and its even more rare to see one.

Armies completely disappear if you conquer all cities of the rival faction. I exploited that so much. For example a clan had an army stronger than mine, so I simple avoid them and got their city by their backs and they were gone (complex strategic plataform? guess not).

AI cheats a lot like having unlimited ammo, get ranked troops and troops magically.

Family doesnt exist on this game, so it doesnt matter if you kill enemy's general, and techs... well fire arrow is a tech ¬¬. You need to go science to make fire arrows(?) and its totally a need (you will find yourself always researching that path first just to take the fire arrow).

Factions that are not even showed on the map declare war on you, they are not even close to you!

Campaign map design is also meh. Most of the time you can only go two directions: back or fowards.

No officers or governors, something that were in on previous games.

""Conquest""
I love the map of all three era of Japanese history. Also each era are protrayed from the vibrant and lush ""Rise of the Samurai"", to a war torn and beauituful base map, and to the gray and industrial look of the ""Fall of the Samurai"". The whole mechanism of the game is perfect. They perfected their formula from their past game and added new feature to make the game have limitless lifespan. The political system is easy enough yet satisfying. The feeling of having a powerful ally then all of the sudden a war was launch against them. Do you want to take part of a war that will only help your ally gain more power, do you ignore them and break the alliance, or do you strike back at your ally and conquer them?

Combat
The combat is very diverse yet fall back on one simple game we have been playing all of our life. ""Rock, Paper, Sissors"". However the way they did it was amazing in the combat sequence. Remeber strength in number and this applies here. Even the weakest unit in number can take out a elite unit with ease. with over 20+ units and each faction have it's own unique troops It's a blend of diversity. Shogun 2 has been said to have the most advance combat AI in difficulity. The easier mode are prone to mistake and static formation while the harder level are a snake lying in wait.

Overall
This is a history context game but don't treat it that way. Treat it like you are a warlord conquering Japan with your faction.

Sieges:
Often times in Medieval 2 I feel that defending a siege is much more fun than attacking, but since most of the time I'm the besieger it feels like a bit of a chore, especially when attacking a city with many enemy troops in it. 
In Shogun 2 imo being the attacker of a siege is equally as fun as defending, since your troops are able to destroy/climb walls and gates without slow and cumbersome siege weapons (I realize many people like this but I prefer quicker and more fluent combat). So since siege battles are more fluent, it feels more rewarding to pressure your opponent at certain areas of the battlefield and immediatly see the results, no matter whether you are attacking or defending, while still being a decent challenge for both sides. For me it feels like playing the water temple, except while being able to move much quicker!

83,20355979,english,"It's beautiful. Utterly beautiful.

   But for me, the AI just ruins it. In battles, units need to be micromanaged incessantly to stop them from doing the most insane things. Tell a unit to retreat from the battle, and they'll strike out in a random direction, most often straight into an enemy unit. Order your men to storm through the open gates of a city, and they'll insist on climbing the walls instead. Bowmen refuse to fire at enemy units who are obviously in range. Cavalry trot along slowly alongside enemies you've ordered them to run down. I can do without Swooping Crane formations or whatever; I just want a big, red 'Stop being a freaking lunatic' button.
   And in the campaign, any strategy that involves diplomacy or trade is rather pointless, because you and the AI play by different rulesets. There are people out there who say that it's necessary to give the player a real challenge. All the power to them; if they want an option to give the AI a helping hand because they're experienced RTS players, there's no harm in that. But my experience was that AI cheating made a lot of tactics pointless. For instance, strangling a clan's economy had little discernable effect, as enormous armies still sprouted from bankrupt factions. I'd come up with plans that involved forcing AI armies to leave recently conquered cities, which I assumed would result in rebellion (because of the resistance to invaders mechanic), but it turns out that that doesn't apply to the AI at all.
    So in a weird way, the ramping up of the difficulty forces you to abandon tactics, rather than encouraging you to be cunning. In the end I always revert to building up the troop-producing facilities in a couple of weaponsmith-equipped cities, and churning out enough Ashigaru to just overwhelm the AI.
    I think Creative Assembly has just worked out a reliable formula, and has no intention of really getting their act together as long as they don't have to.

The level of depth that this game has in developing your generals, mixing units for different situations, and overall strategy is just phenominal. On top of that the game is gorgous and the music is awesome.

My only gripe with this game is the amount of DLC that should have already been in the game. Most of this stuff was available not long after release if I remember correctly and should have been in there day one. Wouldn't have hurt Creative Assembly or Sega to delay the launch to have added them and put some more polish on the game. Goes on sale pretty often though so you can buy the whole thing for around $20 or less if you are patient.

+ SHOGUN 2 is Creative Assembly's return to form, with all the gameplay of the original Total War Shogun brought to modern day.
+ Is a damn good looker all around.
+ Plays very well if you are a veteran of the Art of War, or a newcomer to battlefields of Sengoku Japan, with expanded unit mechanics and tactical choices open to the player, like time of day, weather, and more.
+ Strategic layer has more options to enact one's plans for control of Japan over previous installments.
+ Fall of the Samurai expandalone expands the game to a whole new era of Japan, where old meets new.
+ Has samurai and ninja.

- Stumbles in performance even on beastly hardware. Certainly one that was future-proofed even for 2015 era hardware it seems.
- Has some issues with middleware usage, like the use of middleware for their in-game encyclopedia.
- Strange balancing issues throughout the game make it an odd game to play in the high end.

BADness of this CA cesspit.

1. The AI is trash, all CA titles try to boast about improved AI. The only real improvements are the graphics, which they use to hide the fact that the AI is garbage.
2. Increasing the difficulty just nerf's the human players Incomes while buffing the AI's income. It does NOTHING to improve the AI in ANY way.
3. Castles are useless. What is the point of walls when all of the Japanese are apparently master mountain climbers?
4. Gate houses can be burned down by infantry, then it leaves the castles wide open. You should have to use siege equipment to break into a supposed stronghold, but hey, who knew the Japanse were all capable of climbing so well.
5.Cavalry is useless. Forget the fact that that the starting peasent spearman are erm, spearmen. Doesn't matter so much when the AI runs with mostly Katana Samurai later on which brings me to the next point.
6.The enemy army composition. It's not so bad, except the fact that the AI can support bigger armies of samurai as well as afford to have a large fleet AND upgrade all of their buildings. Meanwhile, Im struggling to support 6 samurai units AND upgrade my farms/markets/castle's Etc...All while trying to scrape together enough money to support a fleet.
7. Diplomacy. Diplomacy? Diplomacy?!? I'd say it's a part of this game, but it isnt. Forge a trade agreement with your neighbor? Doesn't matter, DOW's on you the turn after. AI think's you are expanding too aggressively to control 4 provinces, well, they have only taken 6+. Never met that faction until a ship sailed to your coast, land's troops on your coast and DOW's on you the next turn. Get's a hundred times worse with higher difficulties.

The good you ask? Well here it is:

1. The graphics is a plus
2. The reintroduction of family tree's, not that that matters since MTWR2 removes them, but at least they tried.

If you do not already own this game then...

SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!!!!!


On a more serious note though this game is definately a very good Total War game. It allows you to engage in honourable battles in the open field where you can condemn thousands of little pixelated soldiers to death, or you can use dishonourable underhand tactics on the campaign map to stab the other factions agents and generals with initially terrible agents repeatedly, until they go 'poof!' and disappear from your campaign.

However the game is seriously lacking in unit variety as all the units are samurai this and samurai that, though it is to be expected as it only focuses on fuedal Japan. Also the naval battles are INCREDIBLY boring, all you have to do is get a bunch of fire bomb ships and set fire to everything. Personally I really enjoy the naval battles in Total War and its a shame that the Shogun 2 one is quite bad (probably worse than Rome 2 naval battles where you just ram everything). Also there are no mercenaries which sucks as I really love hiring mercenary armies in my other Total War games just to diversify my armies more.

Overall a very good Total War game. Probably my third favourite Total War game after Medieval 2 and Rome 2(I only got Rome 2 after Emperor Edition came out so I never really experienced the problems with the game). I definately recommend that you buy it if you like playing strategy games and you are a fan of Total War.",1451242435,1451242435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198147988559,32,9,3502,0,235,1461431198,,

-This game looks great and requires low specs
- This game has UNIT COLLISION so when two groups fight they dont become a big ball of mess like they do in rome total war 2 
- The ai have tactics they dont just sit around like they do in rome total war 2 
- The ai will fight each other and destory each other 
- Lots of units to battle with like always
-It has better fire effect compared to the latest total war game
-If you zoom into the battle it has better 1v1 animation 
-The ai is alot better compared to the latest total war for example the cannon unit on this game will aim at the enemy in their pov and shoot at them compared to total war napoleon which is supposed to have better firing has worst shooting ai as the cannon units shoots into hills 
-The game has cutscene which the latest total war game doesnt for some reason

Pros
-Ai in this game is acutally really smart compared to Rome
-You can play the campaign with your friends( which is the best part because Rome constanly crashesir freezes when your friends leaves or ending turns)
-You can create your own general or avatar they call and fight other players in your conquest
------------
Cons
- Players in shogun 2 nowadays not very many people online
-slight bugs but not big deal 
-When you ally other factions, they don't help you which is really pain in the ass( not unless you play fall of Samurai campaign which had lots of improvements from Shogun  2 campaign
-Rise of Samurai was dissapointing

(updated)

I have owned Shogun 2 since the release and it has undergone some major overhauls in that time, however, one thing has stayed the same throughout: The game is great.

I will say this right away, for some people this game is not their cup of tea; if you do not like strategy/management combined with Turn-based/RTS then this game is not for you (Any de-sync issues that originally existed have been eliminated, and even if an issue does ever crop up, the host call always share the save file to fix the issue).


However, if you DO like Turn-based/RTS, I cannot recommend this game any higher. 
This is hands down one of my FAVOURITE strategy games of all time; I have had some epic battle moments with this game and I quite enjoy the RPG/planning elements on the campaign map. I've known people to play this game purley for the battles. I would recommend getting some mods to improve AI/balance/gameplay, such as Radious or Darthmod (whichever you prefer; personally I use Radious as there are many different versions).

Pros:
+Excellent turn-based/RTS elements
+Choose from many different factions each with their own specialties and flavour (more with mods or DLC)
+Compatible with many different PC system specs
+Online Multiplayer + Campaign Co-op
+Very high replayability
+Tons of mods to allow for greater customization / tweaking / balancing
+Blood & Gore DLC: 'Watch as your samurai stabs an enemy Daiymo in the gut then slices his head off as he falls to his knees'  :)


Cons:
-Campaigns can potentially take a long time; do not forget though you can always auto-resolve battles to speed things up
-None


Overall, I have very few gripes with this game. After playing it for so long I can say for certain if you like a mix of turn-based/RTS games, you will fall in love with shogun 2.

Some things are annoying, as in silly AI, unbalanced odds at higher levels (instead of a smarter AI, but that´s normal), and a few other minor issues (for example diplomacy doesn´t really make sense, most times).
Those were the cons.
The pros are so many I just don´t have the energy to list them all, I will however name a few of my favourite features, namely an interesting story - as straightforward as it may be, I still appreciate to learn a bit of history - and the aestetical qaliti of the game. The menus are elegant and look really good. No fancy effects here, just quality illustrations. If you, like me, have a bit of familiarity with Japanese art, you´ll appreciate the style of the drawings: it´s pretty well done, and adds to the feel of the game.

Shogun 2 is in my opinion tied for best Total War game with Midieval 2, with it's own particular strengths. Shogun 2 has hands down the best AI, campaign + campaign map, and pitch battles of anything in the Total War series. It relies heavily on using intelligence to outwit and outmaneuver your opponent rather than strength to win the day. Commands are smoother and forces more reactive than ever before. The sea battles are nice, although they feel a bit like an unbalanced minigame much of the time.

If you are not already a fan of Total War and are thinking about trying this franchise out for the first time, I personally would recommend trying Rome Total War(the original NOT Rome 2) first and then moving on to Shogun 2 or Medieval 2.   Shogun 2's campaign even on easy or normal can be punishingly difficult especially in the late game.  There's a mechanic called Realm Divide in Shogun 2 which pits every other faction against your empire after you expand to a certain number of territories.  If you are not prepared for it you will lose every time.  And even if you are prepared, you might still lose if you manage it poorly.  Any of the three Roman factions campaigns in Rome Total War will be a LOT more forgiving.   I felt less discouraged learning how to play Total War that way.

I usually love the Total War games. However, Shogun II is not that good. Primarily the unit upkeep costs are very high. This allows the AI clans to overrun each other and become huge early in the game. Usually a nearby clan will have 10+ provinces while I have 3. Also, citizen unhappiness is a real problem, forcing me to keep large forces in newly occupied towns until the citizens are happier. Meanwhile the huge clans just get larger.

I guess things my get better as one plays but currently it is not that fun.

Medieval II, Empire and Napoleon Total War games are much more fun.

Shogun II has potential but is just a little shy on being fun. I do not hate the game but there are better games to spend time on. This game is almost good.

Also, the game has older graphics and is difficult to get running. Adobe Flash player 11 is required forcing the user to uninstall Flash 19, currently needed for the internet. Many players have great difficulty getting Shogun II to even run.

42,19409724,english,"To me, this is the pinnacle of Creative Assembly's Total War series.

I started playing the Total War series from the first Rome: Total War onwards and I've loved it ever since.
And Shogun 2 is at the height of all the effort and skill of Creative Assembly's development team.

As with all Total War games, you have a Campaign Map and a Battle Map.

The Campaign Map is stunning and has a good representation of Fuedal Japan, with varying different factions battling for the title of Shogun.
The UI is simple, yet effective. It has what you need and doesn't clutter up your screen with irrelevant information.
You're able to control armies and navies of up to 20 units and send them to wage war against your enemies.
Your agents are useful in distracting and disrupting your foes.
You're also able to level up your Generals and Agents and assign them skills and traits which make them more effective in battle and in the actions they take.

The Battle Map is where this game shines for me. Tactics are more prevelant than brute force, making you think on your feet. Though the enemy AI is lacking, there are mods that tweak this.
Each battle feels visceral, with yours and your enemies Samurai dismembering one another. Seasons and weather will also affect your units.
And my personal favourite season being Spring. Nothing more poetic and beautiful than a deadly skirmish as the Cherry Blossoms fall.

As I mentioned very briefly above, there are a multitude of mods to implement, if you so desire.
From tweaking of enemy AI, different unit skins, rebalancing of diplomatic relations to complete overhauls of the game's systems. There is something for everyone.

Aside from the base game, there are also two main expansions. Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. Both of which will take up as much time as the main campaign in the base game.
I personally prefer the Fall of the Samurai, it is most satisfying when ambushing a unit of rifle carrying infantry with a supposed meagre katana carrying unit. Causes utter devastation.",1448967733,1449219115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198009963350,248,4,20856,0,19511,1565180895,,

59,16407725,english,"So, at just under 700 hours I feel like I can finally review this game properly. As of writing this we've had Rome 2 and Attilla, and the new Warhammer is under way too, but until that gets released and we can get a feel of it, Shogun 2 remains the pinacle of Total War so far.

I'll try to split this up for ease of reading:

Animation - The animations in this game are simply the best we've had so far. From crossed blades to beheadings (Only with DLC I think though) to men drowing on their own blood on the floor, it all looks so real. Admittedly you can see how two people have to awkwardly shuffle into what seem to be ""combat lanes"" and their  can be clipping due to this, this only takes a second and afterwards the fight is very fluid. Men will cheer when they rout a unit, your general swanks along cockily as he walks towards his foe, infantry lower their spears when they're close enough to charge... Its all done very well. On the campaign man, generals will pull out chairs when they run our of movement, and agents will act of small gestures and do an action when they level up, such as a ninja dropping a smoke bomb. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lack this attention to animation, especially in fights, where combat animations are hard to see or very short. Overall, the animation of Shogun 2 is very in depth, if not without its occasional clumsy moment.

Combat - Using a smaller amount of unit types makes combat a more strategic affair, as unit abilities and stats are easier as you will have access to the same units. The game uses a easy to remember but hard to master formula of sword beats spear, spear beats horse, horse beats bow and bow beats sword. On the surface this is simplistic, but your katana samurai won't last long running uphill into a spearwall. This means that each unit type has its advantages in certain situations, for example bowmen seem to be alot better at attacking a fort than defending, but they can still fit into an overall formula. Gunmen are the awkard exception to this, as at times they seem to beat everything due to their high morale shock, while at others they simply refuse to fire fast enough or fire at all, rendering them useless. Added to the mix of unit types are unit tiers, with peasant (Ashigaru), samurai, monk and hero units being respectively better yet costing alot more. This means that a balance must be struck between rather weak but cheap peasant units and more hardy samurai, though at a later point ashigaru are basically useless due to the player having a large economy. Hero units are rather unbalanced, being able to take on whole units before dying, but they are certainly not invincible and die very easily to ranged units. While there are not as many exciting units as Rome 2 or Attilla, the balance is alot better, though expect to see lots of spear ashigaru in the majority of your battles.

Graphics - I run this on max, and I have to say that it still looks pretty damn nice. On lower settings however, the game looks pretty dreadful, but this then again what did you want from low graphics? Take a look at the community screenshots to decide for yourself, but I think the game looks very nice. Rome 2 suffered from always looking bland IMO, while Shogun is full of life and colour. From a short distance the graphics get abit blurry, but I guess this allows it to run smoother, and by abit blurry I mean that specific detail can't be spotted, but maybe this is just me being picky. Each person in a unit usually looks different, though Rome 2 and Attilla have more face variations. Unit clothes are nice and detailed, with monks, samurai, ashigaru all looking very different and ofcourse all the different subgroups such as bowmen adding more diversity. Naval battles are quite bad at times though, as holes are blown in the ships you can see water just awkwardly clipping through, but again this is me being picky. Overall, very nice.

Sound - I don't know much about sound so this will be short, but the music is entertaining and can make you feel engaged alot of the time. Its not something I'd sit and listen to in my free time, but it fits the setting very well. One of the songs was even used by the Japanese in the Sochi olympics, so I guess it must be good! The narrator is amazing in my opinion, especially at the start when he shouts ""The reign of the old shogunate... IS OVER!"". Battle sounds are well done, and the choking sounds even managed to make me feel sorry for the troops every now and again.

Multiplayer - While not much of a fan of just playing battles, Shogun 2 has a clan system and tournaments, so if competative play is your thing you got it! You can conquer provinces on a special multiplayer map by beating other players, which then unlocks new units for you and advisors that give bonuses. Personally, I feel like this aspect of multiplayer ruins it, as a starting player is going to have a VERY hard time beating anyone expect other new players as they are locked to basic peasant units with no buffs while higher level players have hero units and buffs such as being able to see your deployment, Multiplayer is far from fair, so if you're new a hard climb will be infront of you unless you boost, which kinda sucks for people who want to level up legit or just play for fun. On the positive side, you can do large battles, seiges and naval battles online, and the maps are well made. One AMAZING aspect of multiplayer is the ability to make your own avatar and customise him from lots of armour sets unlocked by doing the steam achievements, winning multiplayer battles and conquering regions. You can choose his banner, colour and abilities, so if you've ever wanted a daimyo called Sam Peggle who wears fabulous pink and can personally tank an entire army, you can go for it! This character customisation is the only thing that makes me play multiplayer, as otherwise I find it too unbalanced, but the prospect of new armour is too good a reward! Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lacked this aspect, which is a great shame. Finally, the entire campaign can be done in coop, and unlike Empire and Napoleon players can battle the AI instead of forcing the other player to be the opponent or auto resolving, which made coop for me. You can spectate your friends battles and they can gift you units mid battle to use to keep it from getting boring. The only problem is that you are stuck between coop or vs, so in coop if your friend on the other side of the map gets declared on you are FORCED to help, but in VS all you need to do is hold their capital for a turn, meaning you can just rush through their entire empire ignoring everything. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly didn't fix this.

Campaign - Final part now, sorry if I've bored you! The map itself I find quite interesting, if not unbalanced in a way; In the south you have islands which can be heavily fortified and used as a powerbase, and also brings in naval warfare. As you get closer to the map it gets more messy, as each province can have 4 bordering provinces to be invaded from unlike the south. East and North are full of huge provinces that take ages to cross and have little need for a navy. It is alot easier to play near Kyushu as you can't be invaded from the west as the map ends, so you can focus on pushing right, while clans like Oda or Hattori will always be surrounded. Diplomacy seem off to me, with Rome 2 making more sense. Allies will randomly break all their pacts with you, neutral clans will attack or factions on the opposite ends of the map will delcare on each other. You have a family tree mechanic which is nice and reminds me of Medieval 2, and this creates a roleplay element as characters get traits and followers. When you are powerful enough all the clans unite and declare on you, which is a fun challenge as usually in TW games at this point you can't be beat by single clans, though its damn hard! The building mechanic isn't as good as Empires, but its clearer and more refined.",1434340418,1448994471,True,12,2,0.596481144428253174,2,True,False,False,76561198019466481,272,10,55898,91,41647,1601040536,,

I'm absolutely lost when it comes to the rabid fanatacism a lot of people have for this game, mainly due to the fact that it's missing a lot of the innovations of its brethren.  All the forts look identical, the tech tree isn't even worth including because of how shallow and un-fleshed out it is, the AI is even worse than it was in Empire, where it at least knew how to ambush the player.  It's like they took 3 steps back from the series, looked at everything they'd accomplished and said ""Yea, better make a worse game"", and stripped everything down.  Every fort fight is identical to the last one, there is literally absolutely no variety to them except *GASP* if you managed to slide an agent into one of their forts, he can unlock the gate for your army so they don't have to climb the walls and lose close to half of them!  Combine that where every single faction has exactly, and I mean, EXACTLY the same units as each-other, *unless* you buy DLC (at least with Empire, Medieval 2, and Rome, the DLC added MORE unit diversity that was already there, it didn't force you to buy a bunch of random DLC packs that gave your armies something unique about them).

So why is that such a big deal?  Well, let's say you look through the factions and find out which one suits your play-style based on where you start out, and the over-all bonuses you get....Hmmm, okay, the Mori look good, let's pick them.  Now let's go into battle...Oh hey, they have the same exact unit structure as I do!...Now imagine that same feeling happening to you over and over again for the next 10 hours.  While I understand that it puts an emphasis on tactics over unit composition, the tactics falls a bit short compared to all the other total wars because of how it's designed, in terms of the speed of combat, how heavy the counter system is, and how repetitive the AI is.  Occassionally the AI will do something different, but that feels less like the AI is adapting to the situation, like in previous Total Wars, and more like it's going through some sort of routine.  And when you take away unique units to each faction, it takes away a lot of the reason to pick a faction based on unit bonuses since you can just counter-pick them anyway.  While this could've been designed in such a way that it works, where you have players using advanced tactics to ambush, hold, and counter the enemy, the speed and design of battles/combat is done in such a way that it discourages this.  And when you ARE doing well, and conquering territories left and right, the AI just straight up quits.

So what does the AI do?  Flat out just sends a random death-horde your way.  How did they get that many units?  Who the hell knows.  Because Shogun 2, unlike the other Total War games, LOOVES to cheat.  Where-as in the previous games it was hard to tell if a death-stack was spawned by the AI, or actually built up, mainly because the unit structure of those big unit stacks were so odd and usually poorly built, but in Shogun 2, the death-stacks are filled with the same units, over and over again, and when you compare that with the ACTUAL armies being fielded, that aren't cheat-spawned, you'll notice the difference.  They do this because they know that if you move too quickly across the map, which is EXTREMELY limited compared to nearly ALL the other total war's, that their ""game"" would end so abruptly, and would offer so little challenge, that you would say ""this sucks!"" compared to their previous releases.  So they force the AI to cheat, wasting your time even longer.

Which brings me to my next gripe, the map size.  Maybe Japan was a large map size back in 2000, when the original Shogun released, and maybe unit variety, sieges, and all that stuff that Shogun 2 is missing in comparison were all very limited when they released their first Total War, but it's 11 years later.  If I wanted to play Shogun 1, I'd go back and fucking play it.  This game could've at least come with a Korean faction, where they could've had the player hopping from island to island right at the tip of South Korea, vying for control of trade, and even mainland control with the Korean military, but no, they went the safe route.

Lastly, the multiplayer...The god awful multiplayer.  While the customization of ones multiplayer avatar and unique units is an interesting concept, they have done nothing with that after this game.  On top of that, the only way for you to unlock other units in multiplayer, besides the very basic starting units, is to win battles and capture territories, which means you'll always be at a disadvantage because other players who have been playering longer, closer to the release, have more units unlocked, more unique units with bonuses (oh yea, did I forget to mention that?  You can level up your units online and increase their effectiveness...Because that's not broken!), and if you bought the Fall of the Samurai DLC, you might as well just exit the match since anyone who bought that is just going to spam rifle-men over and over again!  Gee, they really thought this through, didn't they?

Overall the game is bland as all hell, offers an extremely simplified and bare-bones portrayal/simulation of Japanese military and combat of that period, and the multiplayer mode, while interesting, lacks the polish and balance to keep you interested for very long (if at all).",1448916788,1448918947,False,4,0,0.464681744575500488,0,True,False,False,76561197979961681,807,129,636,0,636,1350543600,,

-The graphics feel complete unlike the newer games, this is in my opinion the best looking game in the franchise.
-The depth is a LOT better than the newer ones, this is not simplified down, this makes Rome 2 (have not played Atilla yet.) look like a joke. 
-Combat. That's what a lot of us are here for. The combat is a lot more balanced from what I've seen in other games. While it doesn't have the giant unit roster that the first rome had, this one is still enough to keep you entertained for ages. 
-Diplomacy actually feels like a challenge to keep everything in check here, you have to be VERY careful when picking allies or enemies. Even the most dependable clans might turn against you if you have good relations with their enemies and do not support them in their war effort.

I'd give this game a solid 10/10, which I don't think I've ever given a game. It is just so solid, and it runs so well, and it looks too clean to not give it that.

I know some people enjoy this type of gameplay and the mastering of it, but even on easy the AI can be quite aggressive in steamrolling you with a ""stack of doom"" army and the learning curve is pretty steep so you will have many failed starts before even getting close to victory. From reading online, apparently once you figure out the AI they're quite easy to beat, but due to the slow pace of this game that still requires many hours of time investment. This is the kind of game one can really get into which is great if you like it, but it is not very approachable for a more casual player.

12,19146144,english,"The best Total War in years. Lets's start with graphics shall we, I honestly can't find anything wrong with the graphics of this game because they are fucking beautiful for 2011. Like soldiers making the correct mouth movement when they talk and rain dripping off of a soldier's helmet. Great attention to detail, like unique battle animations for soldiers fighting and soldiers are able to gang up on an enemy to kill them faster. Music is fast paced and great, especially victory music, its so damn catchy and makes you feel good that you actually got a victory. Voice acting is like butter on toast (I think they hired some real English speaking Japanese people even though that sounds racist), in all my hours i havn't found a single bug, loading screens are a bit long, not an improvement from ETW and NTW, (where in those games loading screens were incredibly fast and it didn't have to go to a loading screen to get to the menu, but in this game, you do have to sit through a load screen to get to the menu). Diplomacy has slightly downgraded since the last Total War, like how you can not trade regions, but it's cool how it has little cut scenes for the diplomats instead of floating heads like in the two previous games. Speaking of cut scenes THERE ARE ACTUALLY CUT SCENES, I mean yes the advisor still takes you around the map but the cut scenes add depth, for instance when one of the great clans is destroyed there's a video of the daimyo of their clan commiting Seppuku. Also more easy to under stand research, simple trees of either Bushido (war) or way of Chi (civil research). And you know how I was talking about depth, well you actually feel like a leader, you can assighn generals to be commissioners of war (for 2+ recruitments slots and less up keep) or for finance (which will get you more money), more RPG elements like generals having custom traditions, skills, and personalitys. Also they brought back the general speeches (when your general give a cut scene speech in the beginning of each battle, skipable if you dont want to hear it). My final verdict......

There isn't much twitch gameplay such as Starcraft-esque games in TW series but having good micro definately makes a big difference on the battlefield, though the overall the gameplay is more focused on tactical decisions both in battles and in the overhead map, where atleast 60% of your time will be spent. 

The only downside to this game would be imo, that the harder difficulty AI's simply get harder by pure cheating, creating huge armylists out of thin air and gaining tons more resources than you per turn even when they do not control anything.

The music is a bit off for me. Mostly must be because i prefer game with epic soundtrack like AC:Ezio series, Arkham City or the final fantasy series. I am not saying the soundtrack is bad, it is just not that remembering like the games I mentioned.

Total War and every game in the franchise is a hybrid strategy game, having a turn based campain map and a real time battle portion when attacking or defending and most of them are historical periods of time before WW1 (latest i think was the Napoleonic Wars) I think it would be a better idea just to list them Compared to Rome 2

What CA got right
Formations dont instantly break
Can have multiple generals in one army
AI is smarter (example- if you used your whole army to attack a single unit the pathfinding would send them accross the map, while Shogun 2's AI will have them all attack)

Got wrong (still not a lot Mainly just athstetical issues)
How the game predicts how outnumbered an army is isnt very good
If you started on Rome 2 or later could be confusing

Overall this version of Total War was not too bad in fact it is my favorite out of the franchise, i thought it was worth the 7 dollars I spent (because it was on sale is why I got it so cheap) Overall my score is-

Cons:
1) Multiplayer Rigged (People leaving the game just went they are about to lose, no penalty)
2) Emphasis on their version of Japanese History (It's not bad but they need to include the Korean Invasion at least)
3) Interface easy yet complicated for new user 
4) Hard to master this game for new user

I logged 150+ hours for this game. Entertained by how rich the game graphics then and how entertaining to improve your family samurai and line by providing more real time action and strategy. 

Consequences to every plan and move you make on the planning stage and on the field. Motion captured movement for the samurai gives a stunning display. 

Is it a worth buy? Yes, even for new users you will enjoy it. Engross yourself with many hours of game play. Just put in the effort in understanding the game. Losing the first few times is alright. That is the beauty of playing the game, a game that uses the art of war.

22,18038417,english,"I have in my games library no fewer than 5 Total War games. I truly love the early versions, especially Rome I, but I've played many hours on almost all of them. It took me a little while to get into this one, and it's expansions, but I have to say that I'm now hooked. Definitely in my top 3 Total War games. Its the perfect blend of the old and new, in my opinion. I loved the family tree aspect of the early Total War games, and here we see it coexisting with a game that feels most familiar to more recent Total War releases. The graphics are lovely. The music is fantastic. Voice acting seems great, not that I speak Japanese or anything. Unlike other Total War games, the generals speak in their native tongues for the pre-battle scenes. Kinda cool. Naval battles are the best I've seen in one of these games; you aren't overwhelmed by different controls, which at first threw me off being so used to Rome ii, but its very easy to control your ships by clicking on the map and the few buttons you do have to choose from, mostly for special attacks and such. I've felt naval battles to be a major weakness in many of these games, and I don't feel that way (yet) about this one. I'm still fairly early into the game, so I don't know anything about any aspect of the late game, but I suspect that it follows the usual Total War trajectory. 

All in all, if you like Total War games, I'd be amazed if you don't like this one. This would probably be a decent game to introduce you to the franchise, likewise. If you're a strategy fan you'll most likely enjoy this one. Especially if you're in the mood for some Eastern flavors. 

UPDATE: I have now beaten the base game, with all of my above predictions holding true. Usual (fun) Total War trajectory. I'm now enjoying the subtle differences in characters, units, and game play of the expansions ""Rise..."" and ""Fall..."". Still enjoying the naval combat. It seems like the computer is a little more ""bright"" in this game. I often find that, when playing the computer in strategy games, there is no room for Real strategy, because the computer is just going to barrell right at you with all it's strength, no clever feints, no subtlety. That still mostly holds true, here, but I've found I'm able to employ more strategy in battles in this game because there is a small amount of variation to the computer opponent's strategy. I find this most satisfying, since I've always missed the spark of human intelligence when playing the computer. Now, don't get me wrong, battles are still relatively easy so long as you aren't terribly outmatched, but the slight variation in the computer's strategy makes it much more interesting. Economy is also functioning in this game, unlike ""Empire:TW"", which I also loved, and which this game definitely tops.",1442281557,1445053020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064818115,103,16,4774,0,3836,1536636422,,

This is embalanced.  The markets should not use food to upgrade.  And if the castles are going to require that much food to upgrade them, then the farms should provide more food.

Uninstall everything McAfee from your computer if you want to play this game. Seriously, save yourself the trouble.


My personal experience with Shogun II was unpleasant to say the least. My fiancee and I were playing Medieval II and decided to look for a Total War game that has mostly stable co-op multiplayer, and Shogun II fit the bill. So, we both bought our individual copies hoping to play together but her copy was the only one that seemed to work (my copy would get to the legal splash screen, followed by the cursor switching to the arrowhead and an immediate crash-to-desktop). I spent the next day-and-a-half trying to troubleshoot Shogun II so I could finally play, but nothing was working - I requested a refund. A couple days later, while doing research on Total War games that had multiplayer (and actually worked) and on alternative fixes for Shogun II, I stumbled upon a YouTube video, where in the comments section, someone had a very simple fix that many people reported being a valid solution: uninstall McAfee Web Advisor (I can't remember the exact name, I apologize if that's wrong). 

In hopes of this fix being the right one, I unistalled the program, bought Shogun II again, and ran it. Bingo, it worked like a charm. Turns out that the Web-program-thing blocks the encyclopedia that Shogun II uses, crashing the game before it even starts. A day later though, everytime I tried to play, the same crash would occur except McAfee's website popped up. I just uninstalled the whole thing.

Gameplay wise, it's stable for the most part. It can be buggy at times, but I haven't encountered anything game-breaking yet. I play with my fiancee most of the time, and I haven't noticed any serious issues with multiplayer. All factions are pretty well-balanced with each other, each with their own bonuses such as superior katana samurai, monk-warriors, naval units, archers, spearmen, etc. The framerate seems to be fairly stable on both the campaign map and on the battlefield with my current laptop (I'm using an Inspiron 15 5000). It doesn't have the best graphics card ever, and the game will only allow up to medium settings, but I don't really mind. Multiplayer can be fairly laggy though, with 1-5 seconds between hitting enter in chat and the message actually being sent. Movement on the field can be the same way, and can cause some issues - such as not being able to move spears quickly enough to counter a cavalry flank. Basically, the lag can be detrimental at times, both for planning out your next move, and when trying to battle on the map.

Overall, I give this game an 8/10.

2 Major complaints:

Combat. This is dumbed down beyond belief. It plays more like starcraft than total war. Units are very responsive and quick to respond and die very fast. I don't even know why they included a morale system because the gameplay of the combat has totally changed. 

No retraining. This is the biggest pet peeve that I've got with this game that mods cant even fix. There is NO WAY to retrain units. Yes, units replenish automatically on the world map but if you build a unit with no upgrades and get the upgraded building for it later on, there's no way to do anything about what you've already got.

Some minor issues:
World map is incredibly simple and dumbed down compared to EmpireTW and M2TW. 
No unit variations. Every faction gets one unit with upgraded stats. There are ""Hero"" units that you can get one of if you're willing to pay DLC for every single one of them.

This game was not worth playing. 
Cool samurais though.

85,18205321,english,"Best of the recent-ish Total War Games, but just starting to show some of the bad DLC practises which came in Rome 2 and Attila.

Pros:
- Easily replayable, and actually using your factions specific traits can make them fun and diverse.
- Lots of cinematics to go with the story of your bid for the Shogunate.
- Fall of the Samurai is hella fun and adds a lot to the game.
- Hero units feel like heroes. They ****ing butcher everyone else.
- The voice acting is great. There's a lot of passion in it to help deepen the immersion. (THIS IS A SHAMEFUR DISPRAY!)
- Being able to recruit new generals from the rank-and-file if they lead an army to victory in the absence of an actual general is cool.
- Gunpowder units are well-balanced in the base game. They require excellent tactical manouverings to actually do well, but if you get them into a good position, and prevent them from being engaged in melee, and stop them from hitting your own troops too much, then they will rek all shiz.
- I like the tech trees, they're real frickin' nito. And the encylopedia has some nice little history tidbits for each unit.

Cons:
- THOSE ****ING LOADING TIMES, SRS
- Rise of the Samurai doesn't really do anything for me, I find it dull compared to the base game and Fall of the Samurai.
- It's honestly easier to play exactly the same for every faction; lots of yari ashigaru to pin your enemy in place whilst bow ashigaru (or bow samurai later in the game) do all the killing.
- There is no unit variety; even the factions unique units are just the same as everyone else for the most part but with higher stats (there are a few exceptions), and the rest of the armies are exactly the same but for their colour scheme.
- Defending a castle is laughably easy, which rather goes against the history that the feudal Japanese preferred to sally out and fight their foe on the battlefield.
- Attacking a castle is extremely hard, until you get the long-range bow troops like warrior monks or daikyu samurai. Then it becomes easy.
- Actually using your generals in combat is always a last resort; since most of all armies have either yari or naginata, your general will get slaughtered if he gets into combat for the most part. You can dismount them of course, but that weakens them anyway to a degree. Again, kind of clashes with the reputation of the lords rarely if ever shying away from getting into the thick of things.
- Gunpowder units are borderline haxx in castle defence. Unless the Date are attacking, dem Bulletproof Samurai are pretty coo'.
- The food surplus system isn't great. Kind of annoying at times. FotS removes that though.

It's a great game though, despite all the flaws I list; I personally am just better at picking out the bad bits I feel.

Lazy programming, or programming that tries to compensate for crappy computers, make the AI engage selected enemies (selected few by the game) in a group. If the enemy is within firing or melee range but those ""lucky few"" enemies are not, your units will not engage.

If the enemy group is within firing range but the few selected enemies that the game has chosen randomly are not, your archers will not fire.

If the enemy group is merged with your melee units but the few selected enemies are separated (typical when they run away when broken), your melee units will run away from the merged enemies to chase after those few far far away. Since the ""chosen ones"" are selected within a enemy formation, your melee units will run to and fro from one end of the map to the other, and get exhausted needlessly.

The lazy rule is, the ""chosen ones"" must die before the computer will randomly select another ""chosen one"", who must die before the next one is chosen. Sounds good on paper, but is terrible ingame.

The programmers also did not know how to make the AI about face, so if u were engaged from the rear, and u want your formation to turn around, they will run and run and run and run and run and run and run like they're stupid instead of just turning 180 degrees.

The AI is weak in battles.

The decision to limit agents to 5 is nonsensical.

Still, I must say that the saving grace of this game is the fact that it is moddable, and if one can overlook (or get used to) the poor AI, then the game is fine.

Cons:

-Loading time is a bit longer than other Total War games
- Unit diversity isn't too great (no clan specific units), but even then it has had little impact on my enjoyment
- Opposition Metsuke and Ninjas are incredibly frustrating to deal with
- A couple of glitches, mostly naval based (enemy units being able to use fire arrows in rain yet you can't, enemy ships getting stuck on edge of map preventing boarding)

37,17956352,english,"I am the Daimyo of the Shimiza... I think. 

I'm not sure, we're just the ones who wear green and we're less likely to betray each other, which is good enough because we are extremely similar to everyone else on Nippon, the great land of Japan. We fight the same, eat the same, use the same weapons, if we all didn't agree to strict colour codes, it would be chaos.

After hundreds of years, we have decided it is time to have a civil war. We're not too sure why, but it seems right. Some bloke turned up from Denmark, handed us Japan's first gun, and that was it; time to declare war on each other and decide who will be Emperor... No, not that, we're just going to fight for the honour of being the guy who fights for the Emperor. Okay then. Thankfully, everyone got the message and we all decided it was a grand old idea.

So I began by sending out my son and two of his best mates with 400 blokes to the nearest town, where we had an honourable of 500 vs 45 men. Naturally, we won and peacefully looted the place, and paid the locals to pick up a spear and help us do it again.

Our neighbours were honourable men who promptly got eaten by some nobody clan nearby who in half a year managed to have seven provinces; I had two. In the winter of Japan, we fought a great battle; a whole 700 people took part, a great size of blood and glory. I gave a speech in Japanese; naturally I can't speak a damn word, but rather than learn the language, life conviently provided subtitles so I wouldn't have to try and learn it. As we fought, I had an advisor shout at me in stereotypical Jinglish about the honour of my family and soldiers. We lined up, we ran at each other, and I sneezed. As I looked up, the enemy had broken and run and my advisor was now screaming at me about the honour of our win. Alright then.

I asked if we could develop our technology, to allow us an advantage. My advisor told me I could either research how to stab better, or I could research some poetry and make everyone feel happier about me ruling them.

We went with the stabbing route. They'd give some flowery prose about honour and balance, but it was just how to better stab people. My population was unhappy? Stab them. Clan unhappy? Stab them. Enemy unhappy? Stab them. We went for... Total War!

Now, war is waged not just on the battlefield, but also by cloak and dagger. We began to hire people with a certain set of skills, skills that make life difficult for our enemies. First was the ninja; after we decided to build an entire building just for him, he agreed to work for us. He began to open gates for us, but then we realised we can just climb up the hill of dirt that is our castles. Then we asked him to sabotage buildings, but then we realised we would have to repair it later. Then we asked him to kill the other leaders; after only 10 years of constantly getting caught and showing us the comics later of how he did it every single time he failed (and he only ever did the same thing, again and again), he began to kill with semi-regularity. The new recruits? We forced them to stay on the gate of each town and look for suspicious people.

Then we hired the metsuke, or the police guy. After we had to build him a whole building for himself as well (not wanting to be second best to the guy in pyjamas), he then leaves the town (and not needing the building anyway) and spends him time sending monks to jail, and telling people to quiet down when they complain about the fires and stabbings. All in all, not a bad investment.

Lastly, we built a Temple and the monks came; they had the special power of making the enemy feel a little bit bad about themselves. Ultimately, we just had them sit in towns were foreigners came. You see, if you wanted the guns, you had to get the Christianity as well (Americans, amirite?), so we had the monk walk behind the Christians and refute everything they said, seemed to do well enough. We remained sufficiently Buddist, and in the spirit of Buddism, we continued our war.

During the war, we began to trade with other countries. Now, we had an ally trading with China; they said no. ""But we're friends?"" Yes, they replied, but if you want us to share trading with one of the biggest countries in the world, you'll have to declare war with us. ""But you only have one trade ship, how can you possibly be trading with all of China? Why don't you have Beijing, and we have Shanghai?"" HOJI DOESN'T SHARE TRADE! So we went to war for some silk.

After about 30 years of conquering, making vassals, having those vassal betray us, re-conquering vassals and burning them to the ground after learning our lesson, we eventually conquered Japan. Just in time for the Americans to conquer us later in the expansion.",1441805972,1441805972,True,111,389,0.776339113712310791,11,True,False,False,76561198008697279,289,38,2043,0,1940,1508394602,,

56,17883764,english,"Shogun 2, my personal favorite Total War game, and probably one of the best titles ever published by CA, along Medieval 2 and Rome 1. 

The game is absolutely fantastic. No more. There are flaws, but the game gets almost all aspects that made the Total War series into what it is and executes them in an almost perfect harmony. You start controlling a Daimyo in the Sengoku Jidai era of Feudal Japan and is up to you to make your way trough rivals, missionaries, rebellions and even the Shogun itself to bexome the Supreme ruler of Japan. 

Now why is this game so good? 

Because it is the epitome of polish, everything seems to flow naturally, like the stream of a river. The strategic map is very well done, it creates chokepoints and natural obstacles so you will nedd to fight certain enemies to control vital regions, which also makes for excellent defensive positions to hold. There are three types of agents( actually 5 if you include Geisha and the portuguese Missionary), and their rock-paper-scissor way of interacting is perfect. The Ninja is perfect for infiltration, sabotage and assassination, and excels at eliminating Monks. Beware of the Metsuke, they may buy off your Generals, kill Ninjas and bribe settlements. The Monk may seem harmless at first, but leave one alone and you may have a full rebellion deep inside your territory, and that can be your downfall. 

Unfortunatelly not everything is perfect, as the map design tends to promote siege battles regularly, and sometimes agents fail much more than they succeed. Fortunatelly, having a level 6 agent means you have a BIG advantage over your opponents( level 6 ninja and their generals will fall one after the another like maple leaves on Autumn).

Now the battles.... What can I say regarding them that anybody else hasn't said better than I? I can only say that even after 900 hours of gameplay  leading your Samurai while they charge shouting 'Banzai' still gives me goose bumps. Units are very disciplined and will often fight to the death of you have a powerful general and high morale, which enables Epic Last Stand situations. Siege Battles may become tiresome, but are very good nonetheless, because they are sometimes quite challenging, for example, try taking Kyoto without Two full-stack armies to see what happens, specially at hard at very hard.

There sooooo many things to talk about this game, but if you want to know what I'm talking about, simply play and you'll see.All things considered, BUY this game.

71,17818641,english,"I am at a loss on how popular this game is. Even old school Total War fans of Medieval 2 and Rome 1 often praise this game. In my in depth review, Ill pick apart WHY I feel this game was a disgusting imitator, that managed to fool alot of people.

The biggest problem with this game, is the mechanics of the new engine. The ""warscape engine"" or ""Total War 3"" engine, whatever, it doesn't have collision detection. Units will pair up with the closest dancing partner, and then begin to crunch numbers on if the unit will hit, damage, kill, miss, block ect. What made the Total War games great was that it HAD collision detection. Units were physical, walking, fighting objects in the game world. If you take that away, their just images that are shadow boxing. It becomes BLATANT when you start fielding cavalry. Instead of bull dozing through the first few lines of men, you can literally see them stop in their tracks, and glitch near the opponent running to the side, and they will begin their stylized play acting fighting... its not very immersive.

This takes out so much strategy, in how you should align your armies, and instead replaces it with.... Rock Paper Scissors. Thats right, spear men beats cavalry. Cavalry beats swordsman. Swordsman beat spearman. So strategy in this game, has been reduced to that...

Lastly we come to the factions and units, something I am baffled more people dont address! Without paid DLC, nearly ever faction plays almost identical to the rest! There's some math that makes farms more productive, or Samurai swordsman stronger, or monks stronger... but everyone's using a very similar roster! It would be like playing Rome 1, with only Roman Units... how boring would that be? The answer, Shogun 2 boring.

If none of this sounds like it bothers you, well it does everything else well. Sound, the UI, the way the AI thinks and does diplomacy is actually well thought out.

80,17767794,english,"9.5/10. Shogun 2 is by far the best and most balanced Total War game. All of the games have their strengths and weaknesses (often glaring), but Shogun 2 has the least weaknesses by a long shot. 
It's a pretty game with a lot of depth and strategy. I played the vanilla game (non-modded) for about half of my recorded hours and I played DarthMod for the remainder. DarthMod fixed everthing, except for the trade system. The battles are intense, and the siege missions are fantastic. There's nothing better than the rush of victory after holding a castle against a superior army. Likewise, catching a stronger faction with their pants down and sweeping up half of their provinces in a single turns is equally great. The Fall of the Samurai mod is icing on the cake, as it is essentially a completely different game. I played Rise of Samurai for about four hours... it's pointless to get unless you really like crappy units and that period of Japanese history. 


The only real downsides to the vanilla game are the insane diplomacy system (AI abandoning long-held alliances, which result in immediate destruction) and the completely broken trade system. Trade agreements disappear for no reason, causing a drop in your honor despite you having nothing to do with their dissolution. Usually some explanation is giving that your home ports are at full capacity when they aren't. Unfortunately that sort of shoddy programming has plagued The Creative Assembly since day one. I still remember the day I beat a half stack army with two units in the original Shogun due to balancing issues. Good times. 

In short, buy this game whether or not it is on sale. It's fantastic. The Creative Assembly have yet replicate the success (in terms of gameplay and overall polish) of Shogun 2, and I doubt they will again after the catastrophe that was Rome 2.

My ranking goes like this:

Shogun 2
Medieval 2
Rome

Rome 2 Emperor Edition
Empire

One of the best RTS games ever and certainly one of the highlights of the Total War series.
Features 3 campaigns:
1. The ""original"" campaign takes place during the late medieval, at a time when the first contacts with the europeans are made. The old military leader has lost his power and a number of various japanese clans vie for the honour of being the new one. Although the units throughout all factions are more or less the same (only some few units are totally unique, most of them from DLC's) they get faction specific bonuses which give your armies a direction in which to go for in recruitment and strategy. Features peasant soldiers, the legendary samurai and ninja as well as more modern gunpowder units.
2. The Rise of the Samurai campaign takes place during the early antiquity, showcasing the rise of the samurai class as opposed to the previously usual peasant and levy armies. One of the great clans is amassing more and more power through their family ties with the emperor. This eventually leads to a conflict over the controll of the powerless puppet emperor between the great clans of the time. Your goal is to either defend the emperor as the ""ruling"" family or ""liberate"" ('MURICA!!) him from their fangs.
3. The Fall of the Samurai campaign takes place during the modern age and shows the total modernisation brought about by the westerners and the ensuing ""fall"" of the samurai as a class, seeing that levied armies with few training can now simply outgun years of sword and bow practice. The conflict that ensues, fueled by western intervention, is one between the supporters of the shogun (traditionalists that where forced by guns from the westerners to modernize and trade) and supporters of the emperor (those that think that the shogun betrayed Japan by dealing with the westerners, despite that they are modernizing far more that their shogunal counterparts in order to win the conflict).",1440793711,1440793711,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198049028347,154,18,5087,0,1228,1591033951,,

Shogun 2, where to begin. This game is a gem if you are either a fan of Japanese warfare history or a huge fan if epic scaled battles. The campaign is a load of fun, after playing a few turns I always find myself wondering where to go next and how to balance my military and economic development. 

Both the building of my provinces and the conducting of real time battles are a pleassure to do. Nothing beats the sight of entire units being bombarded with a rain of flaming arrows in slow motion.
Sadly the naval AI doesn't do so well when on the defensive and is verry easy to trick.
Another sore point for me is the lack of depth in diplomacy and to oh so infamous real divide machanic where everyone turns on you even if they have been your closest ally for the entire game.

The good news is that most of these cons can be migitated with mods from the workshop, adding a bunch of mods that are in your flavour can truly makes this game shine and eat away your time like it's nothing.",1439458904,1439458921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995480115,142,3,14604,0,12263,1463342222,,

76,17475975,english,"I have been a fan of the Total War series since I was a young kid and have always loved it. Total War: Shogun 2 has been no exception. The game has a ton of high points but also a few things that they could have done better on. First off, probably the thing this game does best is its style. The artwork, text and soundtrack really draw you into the Japanese theme. It may seem like a small thing but to me It made a huge difference. The second best thing about this game is that its relatively simple compared to previous Total War Games. In the past Total war has had hundreds of different units; many of which did more or less the same thing. In shogun there are at most 25 different units but each one feels unique and the game as a whole feels much more streamlined. The only two things the game could work on is that there is way too much DLC to buy that really didnt add all that much to the game, and that the Seige Units were relatively useless seeing as you could just have your troops climb the walls to the fortresses. But other than those 2 things, this is genuinely one of the Best RTSs I have ever played.

Update 4/08/2015

Okay so after researching for one week, Windows 8 does not let you tweak non-plug and plug in drivers in the device manager. This is essential as the game clashes with AOD driver 4.1 and AOD driver 4.3. Running a Command Prompt to show ghosted drivers wont solve anything - you will get batch file (fuck you message appear on the script). Also this game was badly programmed to have over 100000 issues where people online say constantly that the game crashes. Seriously I have never heard of such a recall of problems for a pc game. Shogun 2 has flown under the table with the amount of threads and people shouting this game doesn't work. 

So we got 2 issues 

Windows 8 - Fails
Shogun 2 - Terribly programmed

Don't give me any excuses and say it was programmed well too. If wolfenstein 3d still works, this should be able to as well.

Update 5/08/2015

After Reinstalling the game, it now works after I had to reinstall windows 8.1

Yea I must be a lucky boy or maybe it will just f u c k up on another day.

This is a revolutionary game delivered perfectly by ""The Creative Assembly "" and is one of the best ""total war"" games in the ""total war"" series by my opinion.
it has outstanding grapichs for it's time, with beautiful animations.

Blood & Gore DLC is a must have for this game. it takes a top star game and polishes it. 

Multiplayer with your own avatar is a new thing for the total war series and it's the best thing ever. it's really a shame that they havent added it before.

9,12522913,english,"This game is a perfect example of a total war game done right. The game feels very polished wether that be the sleak graphics in battle, agent videos, or the neat menus and tabs on the campaign map,  everything comes together very nicely. Unlike most previous games in the series, the campaign ai is aggressive and can easily end your campaign prematurely if you make to many enemies or neglect diplomacy which is a welcome change.  

Diplomacy has been improved greatly with the campaign ai generally making sensible decisions( e.g. they will usually accept any terms when close to being destroyed, allies will often offer money to assist them in wars, or offer to assist you in wars in exchange for helping them in their own)Allies  are easily the most reliable in the series and will normally not backstab you unless you are allied with a trechorous clan, have become weak and failed to maintain good relations, or triggered realm divide(more on this later) , and have even occasionally send troops to help you in battles which is a refresing change. 

The co-op or versus campaigns(when no connection issues are present) are a complete blast, cordinating attacks with your friends and building your empires together is satisfying and a very enjoyable experience. While it is unrealistic that you will both have armies in every battle, it is possible to give friends in the campaign units under your control in both the campaign, and on the battlefield allowing participation in eachothers battles, regardless of faction and distance from one another.

Now that we have spoken about what is good about the game, I will now discuss the main problems, the battlefield ai is hit and miss. Sometimes the ai catches you by surprise  with clever use of flanking, or whittling you down with massed archers when it has missle superiorty, on the flip side the ai is prone to getting careless with it's generals, or playing far to passively on defense allowing players to take the initiave. It's most noticablely bad in sieges, where it often deploys it's troops akwardly allowing them to be dealt with easily( e.g. leaving it's archers completely undefended) and will climb the walls every time, even if a gate to the castle is wide open, causing their troops to take uneccessary casualties and morale loss. Unfortunatly though bad ai is nothing new to the total war series and  may stay this way for quite some time, however if this concerns you you may opt to allow a random player to take control of the ai armies on the campaign map to offer a (usually)greater challenge.
 
A lot of people are uhappy about the lack of variety in the clans, while each one has it's own unique specialty, and often gets a more powerful and cheaper, variant of a certain unit type, they do all use the same units(dlcs add some unique units to each faction, as well as one or two factions with many different units) although personally this doesn't bother me to much as playing to the factions specialty allows each clan to play differently offering a unique playthrough each campaign. 

Finally one of the biggest issues in shogun 2 is realm devide, this mechanic happens late in the game when you take enough provinces. This causes the shogun to fear your power and declare you a enemy of the state, the result is diplomacy is thrown out the window, and inevitably all factions will declare war on you, including your allies. This mechanic is not implemted well and can often feel unfair, although mods can change the way realm devide works allowing you to easily keep your allies and friends after realm devide allowing for a much more enjoyable experience.


Some people may feel intimited by the setting of the game or the flaws that i have outlined, but i can't stress enough that this game is a easily among the top total war games in the series, and in my opinion is vastly superior to it's successor rome 2. There are ways to deal with most of the games flaws which i have outlined above allowing you to take full advantage of the many great features CA nailed when making this game. 

Wether you are a total war fan that has not purchased shogun 2, or someone who is interested in the franchise or strategy games in general, i can't recommend this game enough.

22,17269885,english,"A good addition to the long series of Total War games and probably the best. The combat is easy to understand but hard to master. The AI can be a bit dumn at times, especially on the Fall of the Samurai when you put them on the wall, but is reliable and all the clans in the campaign are well balanced. As you expand you never feel too overpowered and it is easy for a small clan to take a couple of your regions behind your back, this is possibly due to the similarity of a lot of clans' units. I would count this as a disadvantage as there doesn't seem to be a lot of unit variation compared to others like Rome and Medieval 2, however unlike these two there aren't a couple of really good nations that are basically easy mode. A couple spring to mind; Rome in Rome 2 and France/HRE in Medieval. Sea Combat is not too interesting in the vanilla game and improves in Fall of the Samurai. One thing that I dislike is how easy generals are to take out in a battle but they really sway the odds if you want to just auto resolve, forcing you to fight the battle, which can be off putting if you wanted to quickly take  a city with a small, elite force but the Generals simply get in your way; even though the backup units are just ashigaru.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a Total War where all start with a small empire and then you expand at your own pace, it also gives it replayability as the attitude and size of clans changes everytime.",1438108337,1438108337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198032643738,212,5,4040,0,3047,1558028482,,

24,17263204,english,Fun game 9/10. The only flaw? Not as versatile as the real Boshin War troops. No civil war events. Better if it had those like the Ikedaya incident. These are events that ignited more opposition towards the shogunate. Giving policies to a region like in Total War :Rome 2 may make it a more fun experience. The mechanics of the game are more based on strategy as the Japanese have no means to protect themselves from projectiles such as shields by manipulating melee troops to overwhelm and surprise infantry with guns and muskets. Capturing settlements know to have traded with foreigners for muskets should give your faction a boost in guns. Great game tho.

Rarely does a game, strategy or otherwise, keep me coming back and replaying it over and over.

It keeps things basic enough with the units while still making room for more complex strategies to try out when your more familiar with the game later on. The atmosphere and design of the game are probably its strongest assets, with rich detailed infromation about every possible facet of the game and a soundtrack that really gets your war blood pumping while at the same time allowing you to contemplate on every action that has transpired.

92,16928856,english,"Simply put, the single most polished game in the entire series.
Few bugs, for a Total War game anyway, beautiful presentation, and a strong rock-paper-scissors counter system that makes combat tactical. The fast pace and shieldless soldiers also makes combat intense and exciting. The AI is still quite bad at times, but they actually try and unite against you when you grow too powerful, instead of letting you steamroll unopposed. The campaign map is smaller than other Total Wars, and far more focused- you have a central objective; control the Shogunate. This means that you feel like you're actually working toward a goal instead of simply conquering territories because you can.

However, what Shogun 2 has in polish, it lacks in Polish (heh heh)- since the only European group in the game is the Portuguese- and lacks in scale. The small map is easy to learn and helps with focus, but it's criminally tiny compared to the multiple continent conquests of Europe, Asia, and Africa of every other Total War game. There is also very little differentiation between factions. Some DLC factions are unique, but most factions have the same unit roster with minor bonuses here and there. There are no unique units for the standard factions.

Shogun 2 also has the most unique and interesting expansion- Fall of the Samurai combines the melee combat of Shogun 2 with the musket warfare of Empire/Napoleon, and adds in all new 18th century technology never before seen in the series.",1436287377,1436287377,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False,76561198086036772,67,7,10051,0,4491,1503336414,,

PROS
----

- Game has the ""feel"" of a Total War game (Lel)
- Shogun 2 is Historically accurate when it comes to Clans and Clan leaders.
- Graphics are amazing
- Music is all either FROM the period or INSPIRED by the period.
- Many clans as options to play as
- Family tree (unlike some of the ""other"" TW Titles)
- STEAM WORKSHOP for new maps, soldiers, graphics, everything!
- Battles are fluid and your soldiers do not glob up in a large circular mass.
- Has a first person option to view the combat up and close! (Though it doesnt exactly look amazing)
- THREE campaigns with all the expansions. ALL with different units, factions, and story.
- Unique and upgraded Multiplayer System which is slightly buggy but can be fixed.
- Multiplayer includes multiplayer CAMPAIGN

CONS
----

- Not everyone likes the setting of it being in Japan
- AI in higher difficulty ""cheats"" by spawning in armies at times i've seen this. (There may be a fix on it on the TW forums or in Workshop but I did NOT look ) 
- You MUST pay for expansions
- They have faction packs to unlock factions, even though you can get those factions and much more for FREE in the workshop.
- Soldier AI don't always pick the best route to move in combat which becomes a problem.",1344567204,1436174932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198032121090,314,7,17636,0,7189.0,1588227128,,

The Good:

The Total war formula, a turn based grand strategy where battles are fought in real time.  Unique and very addicting.

I liked the atmosphere of this game, the music, the graphics, makes you feel samurai-y.

Very good soundtrack, as usual for Total War.

They finally added in multiplayer campaigns, even though this is a negative review, this feature is a step in the right direction for the Total war franchise.



The Bad:

Most boring Total war I've ever played.

All factions are the same.  They use the same units, just different colors and slightly different stats sometimes.

I bought and played all DLC's, played both the online avatar conquest and coop campaing (only once, because it is practically dead now).
All the singleplayer campaings are awesome and the playability is really good.
All campaings will give you large amount of play time even playing on short campaing (I only played on long, but I can tell that even the short one is at least 30-50 hours of gameplay), but the first campaing, Shogun 2, and the Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai were my favorites due to the style of gameplay and technology already available, since the campaing Rise of the Samurai is supposed to be set before both, and they diverge in the gameplay because you don't actually need to capture the settlement to make it yours in the Rise of the Samurais (the allegiance system). What I was more excited about was the historical battles you get to fight, really amazing how they made that so every ramdom battle turns out to feel like you were reviving the Japanese's past fights (at least for me).
My only complaining is about the multiplayer, it is true, I didn't play much of the avatar conquest, but from what I played (2-3 hours) it was a real shit, and the coop campaing could be really awesome, but as I said, it is dead now...

Well, maybe not as brutal as I'd like. I wish there was more blood and limbs getting hacked off. I want to look at the aftermath and think ""Sweet mother of Mary....What have I become?"" And then promptly run down the surrendered men trying to run to their wives.

OK, so battles are awesome. What isn't awesome is the diplomatic scenario. I'm like a US General defending against ISIS. These guys throw themselves at my fortresses over and over. I don't have an issue with it because my people are patriots and pay 'Very High' taxes to keep the Commies (I mean Imperials... oops) out. Long live the Shogunate!

But seriously, it's gettin annoying. Battle after battle they fail to secure my fortress. They can't just starve me because I have an expeditionary force which I send forth for that situation. I tried to form a peace but they refused. My allies won't join me. Basically I'm like the Shogunate's little bitch and everyone else is just developing their economies.

42,16801522,english,"In this review I will be going through the base game and the two other expansions individually to make you decide what products you should get. First I’ll start with Shogun 2.
Shogun 2
Total War: Shogun 2 is the Seventh game in the Total War series, and the Sequel to the Original Shogun: Total War, which was the first game of the series. Taking place in Feudal Japan following the middle Ages, you can play as one of several warlords, or factions, whose job it is to take over and unite Japan under one ruler. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, Economic, Political, and militarily. There are several DLC's for Shogun 2, including; Rise of the Samurai, Fall of the Samurai, The Dragon War Battle, as well as several downloadable clan packs. Unlike previous games in the series, Shogun 2 takes place only in Japan and not Europe or the overall world as a whole. SHOGUN II offers the best polish, balance and innovative multiplayer system of all Total War titles, arguably the best in the series. The immersion created by Shogun 2 is far greater than any TW title. In the battles, each soldier looks and acts like a real person: they walk and charge with different animations, and they all die in different ways. The stylized UI and player cards, beautiful scenery, and music add so much to the feel of the game. It's just so good. A perfect score composed using many Japanese instruments to convey the mood. Overall the soundtrack is very enjoyable. It makes you feel that you actually in that time period fighting against other clans in Japan. I really enjoyed the hours I spent in this wonderful game. Though shogun 2 is more in depth than the original it is just as addictive game, and it’s a lot more stressful than Civ5, but just as hard to walk away from. If you like grand strategy, giving orders to your regiments on a tactical level mixed with historically accurate factions, environments and equipment, this game is definitely for you! The battle AI is much improved as well. I can't really use Empire:TW as an example because I don’t own it, so I'll use Med2. The battle AI attacks head on without delay when on the offensive, defends smartly when on the defensive, and knows when to pull back and regroup. One small complaint I've found in the battle AI is from time to time the AI knows when I tell my cavalry to attack a bow unit and the bow unit starts’ running before my cavalry even gets there. It's like it detects the attack ""click"". When I tell my cavalry to move to behind the enemy bow units instead of clicking on them to attack I get the surprise attack I wanted to begin with. Another flaw is the AI that is not too amazing (Not awful either though) are some of the lesser points of the game The AI is very keen on plundering your lands, which ends up being more of a pain in the...Rear end than entertaining as you have to repair -yet another- farm and hunt down another four units of spearmen that ran past your defense and just keeps running away from you. It does mean that you can't really sit in your fort all the time and let the enemy come to you, but in the end you don't really gain anything aside from a headache from hunting down all the little armies running through your land. Luckily there are river crossings and mountains you can stand by to block most of the enemy from getting through. Although it can be improved with DarthMod which I recommend to anybody who wants to buy this, and they use cavalry quite well to surround you and get behind your lines. They know when to attack vs. defend on a hill, and support weakened units with reserves. The Great Avatar conquest system in multiplayer is a great touch and is SIMLAR TO NOTHING CREATED IN ANY OTHER TW GAME. All those faction systems are not even a bit as deep as Avatar conquest in Shogun 2. Nothing can compare with this. Yes it is really rough to new players. But if you have enough patience eventually you will enjoy Avatar conquest like nothing else before. Also I really like coalition system as you grow strong and everyone else are turning against you even your vassals and allies. This feature is UNIQUE TO THIS GAME and makes you plan your strategy really carefully trying not to overextend too much. And that's great because for example in Rome 2 you just pierce through your enemies like a knife through butter and no one can stop you in the late game at all, so in the mid game you simply lose interest to game process because of no challenge what so ever.
Almost every aspect of the game is done the way it should be, battles, sieges, clan system, agents, diplomacy, heck even naval battles. You will have plenty of choices and options for your empire and they are all meaningful in some way. You can embrace the new western technology and get yourself some guns, take on Christianity or stick to the old ways, eventually becoming the ruler of Japan. All of this comes with you being able to manage your entire clan - Build your holdings, expand them, train units and send your military to where they're needed and command the battles yourself. Naval battles of ancient Japan (Floating castles and archers which adds a UNIQUE TOUCH) are an interesting thing, with entirely new tactics to learn - Which you can do yourself. You can lead your clan from humble beginnings to glory, personally commanding every battle on the way there. Watch those forts though - They may look simple, but they are not to be underestimated. Attrition and seasons add a nice strategic layer: you can't always afford to starve out cities but storming them will always be costly. I also like the weather mechanics like fog which greatly reduces visibility, while heavy rain diminishes the effectiveness of missile troops, such as archers or gunners, thus requiring the players to adapt their strategies. Also, as in Napoleon, armies standing on enemy provinces during winter season or fleets far from the coast suffer attrition. The campaign mechanics, such as the family tree and events you can encounter, really make you connect with your leaders. I also like the idea of generals being used more to help other units on the battlefield compared to them being used more as cavalry. 
Now on to Rise of the Samurai
In rise of the samurai players take on a brand new and independent campaign for Total War: Shogun 2 set in 12th century Japan. Set 400 years before the dramatic civil war depicted in Total War: Shogun 2, the ""Rise of The Samurai"" campaign is based on the Gempei War, a conflict between six legendary clans of the Taira, Minamoto and Fujiwara families. One flaw I have is that I don’t like that the first towns you get don’t have castles in them which makes them harder to defend, but that’s more of my problem just being used to some sort of castle like in shogun 2, and not so much a dig on CA. Also I thought the agents were perhaps a touch too powerful, Sou's in particular can unleash some devastating rebellions while I also never seemed to lose any agents (apart from Monomi) to failed attempts? New agents are hired through such new structures as the barter house. To unlock these, Rise of the Samurai specific arts trees must be climbed. Creative Assembly has thoroughly Genpei-fied almost every aspect of the game. I enjoy how this game adds the UNIQUE prequel story that’s not in other TW games
Now on to fall of the Samurai 
 It’s the 1860's and Japan has opened its ports to the outside world such as the United States, France, and Great Britain in to heavily influence the game which is UNIQUE. The play off between traditional sword and bow unit’s verses the emerging gunpowder technology creates an experience that is UNIQUE to the Total War series. I also like that in this expansion happiness seems more like a problem to me because some buildings increase modernization which citzens hate which is UNIQUE.

A very fun, intuitive game, and, just like the other games in the Total War Series, a wonderful addition to your steam library. *The Game takes up a lot of spoace, so please remember that it may take some time to install this game ( Approximately 16 Gigabytes)",1435592650,1435592650,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198163618796,52,15,1209,0,64.0,1471411337,,

I have sunk hours already into this game and I feel it still has things to offer, you cannot lose money on this purchase if you enjoy this genre. 

So far I’ve played the normal Shogun 2 campaign and the Fall of the Samurai campaign, personally I like the Fall of the Samurai battles a bit more because of the more modern weaponry, but I really miss the general’s speeches before battle which I thought were awesome in Shogun 2. Putting my personal preference aside on modern weaponry, I would say the standard Shogun 2 is a fantastic experience. 

Outside of combat, I felt the game was pretty average, diplomacy really is basic, and your family tree though cool to see doesn’t have that generational feel to it I started to wish for. So far, the AI is a bit frustrating for this game. Your allies cannot for the life of them hold their territory most of the time, you more often than not find yourself in an increasingly hostile map because those that naturally would ally themselves with you are eliminated rather quickly. Near the end I felt like the game became my clan vs the-rest-of-japan, which is pretty obnoxious.

38,16514621,english,"Total War, what a series. While recent titles have been... subpar... there was a time where the series was considered one of the best. With titles such as Rome: Total War, Medieval 2: Total War, and the origianal Shogun: Total War, Creative Assembly made what I and many others consider the best strategy games of all time. However, of all the games in the series, one stands well above the others. That game is Shogun 2. While I still play the others often, I probably play Shogun 2 more than the rest of the series combined. It is a true masterpiece.

Pros: the game has great visiuals. Even zoomed in all the way, the character models look great. A lot of that detail is lost when you're actually playing the game, but it's always fun to zoom in and watch the 1v1 battles going on within this huge battle. There really is no feeling better than trapping your enemies and then watching arrows rain down on them. Every battle makes you go back and forth between feeling 100% in control to being helpless. It's a rollercoaster that never gets old. There are quite a lot of things to do off the battlefield. In fact, I enjoy the game most when I'm moving my units accross the world map, knowing that in 3 turns I'll conquer a whole clan. Plus, the financial system is pretty good to, if pretty simple. This is also a game that has good DLC. It isn't as good as say maybe Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon or Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare but they offer plenty of new units that are different enough from the original game's units that they require a new strategy to use and deal with. Plus there are new maps (not a big deal, but still nice). Plus, it has a GREAT multiplayer. While most strategy games have pretty bad multiplayer (with a couple obvious exceptions) here it is maybe the highlight. It's pretty complex and I don't want to explain the game in a review, but if you're interested there are some videos on YouTube that'll explain it. It also has one of the best mod communites I've seen in a while. Darthmod is a must have if you want a bit of extra realism. 

Cons: longtimes have often accused this game of dumbing down the Total War experience, saying that you don't get the total idea (get it, total? ba dum tis). While technically they're right, I'd say streamlined is the better word (I think that the game feels more focused because of the simplification, but it's still NOT a simple game). Still, if you are into micromanaging every little detail, this game is far simpler than other games in the series so maybe you'd like them more. The other thing is that the diplomacy in this game is pretty bare bones. It gets the job done well enough, but compared to other games it is really lacking. Also, ship battles are awful. They make up a TINY ammount of the game and you can auto-resolve them so it isn't that big of a deal but still would have been nice.

You are a cowardly tactical commander controlling a vast army of your chosen clan behind your computer screen. In order to succeed, you must be capable of micromanaging units on the field and at sea. Flanking, positioning, and fortifying are all important; terrain is another useful concept to be aware of. You must also manage resources, form alliances, betray friendships, and troll others to obtain your goals outside of battle.

The multiplayer games take ten times longer and look like they are slow motion becasue the cespit of demons who play this game run windows 95 and have bug filled computer cases. If you buy DLC for this game you win in every multiplayer game, To seal your victory just buy ""Fall of the Samurai"" because bringing a gun wait no... a fucking sniper rifle (Foreign Marines) to a sword fight is a great idea.

I don't play Fall of the Samurai because I'm not a faggot and found that hills are my closest ally which I can't say about my teammate who spammed cavalry and just ran directly into a line of rifleman. The more I played this game the better I got at squishing the westerner scum. Whenever I charge my men into rifleman I could feel my inner Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai come out of me I would also sense Katsumoto's hand rest upon my shoulder as he was proud that I kept to his old age customs.

Even with all the problems with this game for some reason I couldn't stop playing it  - 10/10 

Ps. Some guy said I have a prototype army I'm not down with the lingo but that sounds fucking sick

Ps.Ps. I'm bored of this game now so I don't play it I just wanted to write a review becasue I was bored

92,16212773,english,"NOTE: This review is for the ""Fall of the Samurai"" DLC for Shogun 2 Total War

Overview: This game has given me the best Total War experience thus far. Nothing NEEDS to be changed to make it a better experience. While the battle pace is fairly quick and most line units are generally annihilated upon contact, mastery of battle takes time and patience. Diplomacy works the way it should. The tech tree is easily laid out. The UI is easy to understand. Everything was well put together and strategy is certainly required to effectively conduct your domain. 

Pros: 
          Addictive immersive large scale naval and land battles. 
          Effective UI and control.
          Diverse array of units and factions with mostly their own attributes.
          Decent AI strategy on harder difficulties. 
          Working multiplayer experience.
          Easy to grasp concepts and warfare.
          A great overall civil war strategy
Cons-or Considerations for improvement: 
-AI strategy on lower difficulties is simply too easy.
-Battle Pace is a little fast for the hardcore strategist looking for counters and flanks, late game battles generally result in massive numbers of casualties in very little amounts of time making grand or large scale battle strategies difficult to pull off before primary forces are either routed or the enemy is destroyed. (then again this only adds to the pressure of forming a quick and effective plan and could very well be considered a pro by most total war fans)

-Balancing the artillery... I don't know about most fans, but I greatly fear AI armies with 4 batteries of guns (even if their core army is nothing more than a levy. A single gun battery can be the winning factor in multiplayer games where your opponent is running on lower settings (smaller unit sizes) but the battery still contains 4 guns, so same firepower but less targets to rout...

Other than that, if you get shogun 2, GET this DLC pack, excellent add-on.

5,16110400,english,"TL;DR: Amazing game even in 2015 and totally worth a try.

I have played Total War: Shogun 2 for a very very long time. I originally had this on release but I bought that at gamestop and never had it on steam. A while back I lost the key when I needed to install on a new computer. Got it on steam and I already have 250+ hours into it again. This game is literally a masterpiece. Over the (estimated) 1k hours I have put into it, I have never played a strategy game that had fit me so well, and here is why ( I hate formatting so screw the fancy stuff).

Gameplay: SHOGUN 2 itself has amazing gameplay. Like others in the Total War series, the gameplay is a mix of turnbased map movement campaign mixed with RTS battles when you engage an enemy. On the other hand, if you hate RTS games you also have the option of auto resolving all of the battles in the game. This however isn't nearly as polished and sometimes leads to the deaths of armies for stupid reasons. When not in battle, on the map you also have to deal with a lot of strategic choices. Diplomacy is huge, especially on harder difficulties where the AI can screw you over  and wipe you faster than you can blink. You can talk to other clans you have discovered to find good trade partners, allies and demand things from other clans, even if you have to threaten them. All clans have different levels of integrity and ambition. If you ally with a someone with terrible integrity, expect them to turn on you when you are off fighting battles. You also have a technology tree that you can advance for new things over turns, with quite a few options but at the same time not too many to overwhelm you. If you feel like you want more, there are tons of mods that completely redo the way the skill trees work, and even diplomacy. When it comes to actual fighting, the game is very realistic (minus those crazy bugs I was talking about) and as a RTS, lives up to the name with great praise.

Music/Audio: 10/10 definitely. The audio in the game was mostly made from scratch by creative assembly and sounds amazing with the atmosphere of the game. All of the music in the game was made by people who study such music, and trust me, it sounds absolutely amazing and is a perfect fit for the game. I believe Creative Assembly has a video on it.

Other Things: There is multiplayer campaigns and co-op is extremely fun with a friend who is dedicated to finishing a campaign with you. Head to Head campaigns are also quite fun but Multiplayer as a whole was not ready when it came out and has quite a few issues that needed polishing. While multiplayer is still extremely fun with a good friend, it could definitely use a few fixes, that aren't coming since the game is now ancient. The AI at harder difficulties has stupid scalings. Instead of being smarter they get a super steroid to their stats and better units faster. It is a unbalanced game at that point, but still amazingly fun. If you ever REALLY want to do a Legendary Campaign, I would watch Cosmic Contrarian on youtube. He doesn't do guides, but watching him play gives you a very good idea on how to manipulate ai and deal with the difficulty.


Overall I would say definitely buy this. It has it's faults. But for anyone interested in Japanese Culture or RTS games, this will definitely be a fun experience. Just wish they would make a Shogun 3.

This game becomes even better when you play with mods, radious mods will make life so much easier, and guns become insanely strong in shogun 2 especially when defending castles. Also try out the other interesting player made campaigns like Sekigahara (to play as Hideyoshi) or Morning Sun (To play as Korea, yes Korea. China is also playable although only in custom battles.). Expanded Map Campaign for the normal Shogun 2 map is also very good.

Getting Fall of the Samurai is also recommended especially if you like the 2003 movie The Last Samurai.

42,15917077,english,"Total War: Shogun 2 is one of the best Total War games ever made. It's sad to see that many of the great aspects of Shogun 2 were never incorporated in Total War: Rome II. 

First of all, Shogun 2 makes a fantastic effort at portraying Japanese culture and brings about a type of mysticism in the game regarding their culture. The game map is beautifully detailed and colorful, and allows you to play anywhere on Japan. You are given a wide variety of factions you may choose from, and how you play after that is up to you. Of course, domination over the Japanese mainland is your end goal, but how you reach that goal is up to you. You could opt for betraying your allies and becoming a ruthless warlord, or makes strong alliances and co-dominate Japan with other factions. The choice is yours.

Military battles are great and the unit variety makes gameplay very interesting. It also increase the strategic use of your armies. Alongside that, the AI isn't too shabby. It is common to have insanely dumb AI in Total War games, but Shogun 2 does quite a good job at handling this.

There are many other elements in the game such as family trees, agents, general management, building management and more. I think it will be best for those who love RTS games to try those out rather than read my babbling. Trust me, Total War: Shogun 2 is a charm among RTS games.

43,15910299,english,"Total War games are like 2 game in one, first you have the part that play a bit like civilization on the map, complete with building various things in your cities and invading others. Once to armies meet however it plays like an RTS such as  Command and Conquer except you only have what you brought to the fight in you army(s). The fighting of units itself is well done and based on the era of time the game is based on as Total War games cover various time periods, from ROME to Medieval to Feudal Japan in this case. This one however takes the cake. The AI is good and smart, various and rather well balanced factions, tactical choice of weather or not you wanna trade for guns but if you do, can alter your clans religion making others hate you, etc. If your only going to try one of the Total Wars series I highly suggest this one. The campain time limit can be a pain, but you are free to continue playing after it passes no matter the outcome. If you feel you can't or simply don't wanna play alone. grab a friend and have a go at the co-op campain or head to head campain or the multiplayer battles. If your a fan of strategy games that actually require strategy and not as much speed then give this a try! It can be a bit pricey for some, but if its goes on sale it becomes pretty cheap. If memory serves I got it and all, but one DLC as a collection for around $15 (Only missing Fall of the Samurai).

Everything that makes most Total War games so great - epic campaign and battles.

Aspects I don't like include:
All soldiers on foot being able to burn down every castle door in the game. Where did every soldier get hundreds of torches? Why didn't the defenders soak wooden defences in water before the assault, or even stockpile water to use to fight fires?
The generals magic abilities - e.g. at the click of a button turn dirty, sweaty, fatigued soldiers who have been fighting uphill for a full hour into magically refreshed soldiers capable of running a marathon. These abilities belong in an arcade game, not a Total War game.

Sometimes your troops won't come off of a defensive position and you can no longer control them, they are just there for good.  Or, your artillery just decides he has had enough and runs to edge of map or into the enemy troops while you are helpless to watch.  

Looked it up, just seems to be par for the course when it comes to this game, every single one of the problems i came across has been complained about relentlessly on the forums and review.  I can put up with a buggy problem here and there, but after spending an hour on a mission and watching your only artillery run away on a siege mission completely screwing you over, its a little disheartening.  

And to think, they have released not 1 but 2 new games since this, both being heavily criticized about being released way to early with bugs and issues aplenty.  Thought I was getting a pretty good deal picking this one up on sale, especially after putting a pre order on Rome 2 and being less than satisfied.  Reality, C.A. just made a few bucks off of their shoddy crappy incomplete game yet again at my expense, and thats gonna be the last time.

1. Naval battles are awful. I found myself completely ditching all naval forces unless absolutely necessary.

2. AI is annoying once you are deemed ""Legendary"" status. At this point every living AI tries to kill you. It felt like a really cheap way to make the game artifically harder so you wouldn't win. I actually have lost two campagins specifically because time ran out from me fighting everyone or they simply overwhelmed me.

3. The economy and religion aspect is tough. Once you become a large nation everyone and their mother is demanding food or trying to start a revolt because the region isn't your religion. I ended up having to house tons of troops units at various cities just to keep them from revolting for over 10+ turns. Even then they sometimes were never happy. Eventually you learn to just expemt taxes from the regions that will never quit trying to rebel and hope you have enough money for other stuff. It's damn tough keeping everything under control and defending yourself and trying to take things over before the time limit is up. This aspect also made the game feel artifically difficult.

Other than that I really liked the game and recommend it. It's a good buy for $30 and will keep you entertained for at least 50 hours or so of gameplay.

37,15430529,english,"Welcome to a Luke Approved! review.

First off.. Rome 2.. is a different can of worms we shall not open today : ) 

I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Shogun 2 is by far still the best Total War game yet released. Having played all these games since the release of the first Shogun, It is nice to  see the series to come full circle - and what a circle!

Medievil to Rome was a big step for this company, the orignial Rome Total War being a strategy masterpiece for it's time, encorporating a new 3D graphics engine to the series and new features, further expanded into Medieval 2 and the add-ons of that era for the series, with the original Rome still being the pinacle.

And then came along Shogun 2. What a beautiful package. Yet again a new graphics engine and more depth to the features that stayed true to the original Shogun. The artwork is stunning, the story telling style is very inkeeping with the orients and the expansions: Rise and Fall of the Samurai gives the best Total War experience yet.

In my opinion - Empire and Nepoleon took a different path and were nice to see some different mechanics, making more use of firearms and stationary guns.. But is was lacking the depth and mysticism of Shogun 2, even the naval battles in Shogun 2 are more appealing down to the diversity of the vessels and the more responsive mechanics.

Here in Shogun 2 the developers have done a great deal to frame the emotion of the theatre of war in the orient. From the cherry blossom falling from the trees and cascading accross fields of vibrant flowers, to the harsh contrast of sanguine blood against a tundra.

Buy Shogun 2 and be happy to own a masterpiece!",1429361861,1429362034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042934396,309,9,11402,0,7540,1577970188,,
38,15187392,english,"THe last TW I played to death was Medieval 2. I played Empire and NTW briefly but got bored. That being said, here's a few reasons why I think this game is a winner.

It looks amazing even 4 years on. Not just the battlefield graphics, but the effort they put into music and aesthetics which makes Shogun 2 really unique and immersive. The campaign map is a serene mix of handrawn maps and little 3D communities and towns, forests that change colour in the autumn, fields that freeze over in the winter.  Everything is represented as drawings and paintings. Units communicate in Japanese. It's polish like this that shows CA went the extra mile.

On the battlefield it also looks amazing. The individual choreographed fights among thousands of detailed soldiers is incredible, I've never seen anything like it before in a strategy game.

AI is decent. Not amazing, but not brain-dead either. They use cavalry quite well to surround you and get behind your lines. They know when to attack vs. defend on a hill, and support weakened units with reserves. However I've found they're too quick to charge into battle even when they're at a disadvantage. EIther way I get a good challenge.

There are very clear advantages/disadvantages between unit types, terrain, weather etc. so you can quickly formulate tactics and strategies.

Campaign-wise, I find it's the same old as previous TW games. Attrition and seasons add a nice strategic layer: you can't always afford to starve out cities but storming them will always be costly.

I really can't think of any major problems with this game. 9.5/10.",1428076583,1429328720,True,3,1,0.545871555805206299,1,True,False,False,76561198000121884,61,2,1808,0,1346,1589518640,,

I will be honest though, as someone who was new to the series even the easiest difficulty setting can be brutal if you're not careful. Ruling over Japan takes alot of planning on your part. Where to attack next, who should I ally with, who will I steamroll to add to my territory? All these questions should be in your head because unlike most games I've played every single choice you make can either set you in the path to becomming shogun, or getting your territory taken over from all sides because you expanded too quickly and made too many enemys.

This game will reward you for doing things that make sense, and punish you for doing things that goes against the general rule (like cavalry charging into defending spearmen)
+ During real-time battles (which you can pause), you can use simple strategies such as taking and defending high-terrain, flank attack, forest ambush, or just plain head-on battle of attrition if you have superior units.  It's really rewarding when you are using simple strategies that you think will work, and it works out.  When things don't go well, it's really easy to understand what you did wrong (usually, battle of attrition with similar strength gives you the worst outcome).  
+ The overworld management game is simple as all you do is build up your military units, select next thing to build on your tech/skill-tree, build buildings that affect your attribute multipliers on military units, and position your units to attack and defend.  Economy is also dead simple as all you do is set tax rates depending on provincial happiness.  Politics is also simple, as you only have about 10 options to choose from that affect how others behave toward you.

The Bad:
- The load times.  Even on SSD, things take forever to load
- Graphics and system performance.  It's not the best looking game in the world even to 2012 standards, but it struggles.  Only single core on your CPU will be utilized, and framerate drop is noticeable.

Overall:
Even if you are not a great strategy gamer, you'll have some fun and challenge with this anyways.  I can see how awesome this game can be when played against a human-opponent.",1428463897,1428463897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197982586428,444,8,4356,0,4227,1528715810,,

The RTS combat depth of this game is like something out of a LOTR film.  Mechanics include: Ship boarding, burning ships, castle sieging, hill charges, and troop morale.

Speaking of troops.  In this game, I feel like each individual soldier is counted.  For example, with archers, rather than getting in range, shooting at an enemy unit, and having a % chance to kill a random soldier in the unit; every arrow launched has a path determined once it is launched, and if that path happens to intersect with a soldier, then the arrow will hit someone.

90,14861932,english,"This game has been out quite a while, but needless to say, it is one of the better releases of The Creative Assembly in a number of ways. I have played every single Total War that came out and I must say, Shogun 2 is one of the most streamlined and polished games that The Creative Assembly has produced.

Sure, it's not ground breaking like Rome: Total War but this game took the franchise to such a high level that Rome 2 paled in comparsion to it, though Rome 2 is not a terrible game in its current state.

The graphics are top-notch, though there are some times when I feel that the soldiers do look a little too glossy at times, there is no doubt that they look good. The only thing that rivals the graphics is the animation. Though realistically speaking, most ashigaru battles  during the Sengkoku Jidai consisted of giving the men a spear and standing in place while poking their spears forward, or swinging their spears from above their heads to the ground, I rather prefer the animations of the units to reality.  When unit formations break down and battles turn into one-on-one contests of skill, it feels like you are watching a movie.

Siege battles are messy. But that has been a problem ever since the early total war games. Heck, it's been a problem in the history of war. Sieges are always messy.

The battlefields are amazing as tthe terrain changes with every passing season. Though this has been true with almost every total war series, the way they depicted the seasons, including the occassional sakura petals in the spring, or the leaves in the summer that pop out of the screen adds a good effect, especially while your general or daimyo is giving his speech.

Battle AI is capable enough though they sometimes throw their general away in battle by leading a suicidal charge against your men. Also exploitable at times. Campaign AI is decent enough as well, though can sometimes be passive at times, and downright lobotomized in other times. But during realm divide, they get really aggressive.

The interface is really streamlined when it comes to the battle, though I find the unit cards a little bland for my tastes. Battles are a bit quick, but what can you expect when you give peasants weapons? They break rather easily, compared to their samurai counterparts.

The campaign map is beautiful, though I sometimes wish that I could visit my city, like in the original Rome. The tech trees are streamlined, though I think it's a bit too simplistic. Diplomacy is still broken. Realm divide can catch you off guard. The family tree is excellent. I think they took a page right out of the BBB mod back in Medieval 2, where you can give your generals offices.

Family members and generals are really integral to building your empire. This is one of the best parts of the game, and in my opinion, whzg makes it better than Rome 2. Your generals can easily sway the tide of battle if used and positioned correctly.

The best part of this is how focused the game is. Sure, it isn't as epic as conquering Europe and the New World ala Medieval Total War, or Rome, but what makes this a remarkable game is that Creative Assembly shows you evolution of military tactics and weapons in Japan, from the Genpei War, to the Sengkoku Jidai, to the Boshin War. And that, my friends, is the purest essence of a Total War game: taking the gamer on a journey of the evolution of warfare albeit in a limited setpiece.

As a strategy fan, this game is a must-play.",1426235243,1426235243,True,0,0,0.499848514795303345,0,True,False,False,76561198054361370,225,12,20896,0,6626.0,1563694646,,

92,1099222,english,"Shogun 2 is the greatest Total War game ever, and one of my favorite games of all time. If you don't own this and are into strategy games at all, I very highly recommend it.

Shogun 2 offers a more refined and polished experience than any other Total War title. The base game is set in the Sengoku Jidai, beginning in 1545. Shogun 2 examines warfare in fuedal Japan more closely and accurately than any other game, with an array of samurai, ashigaru, monk, and European units.

The DLC campaign, Rise of the Samurai, takes you back to the Gempei War, beginning in 1175. Units unique to this time period are used, including early samurai, levies, and sou. Most noticeable in this earlier form of Japanese warfare is the complete absence of gunpowder, the relative newness of the samurai class, and the loose unit formations. Rise of the Samurai is an experience unique from that of the base game's campaign, and is definitely worth purchasing.

Fall of the Samurai, the standalone expansion to Shogun 2, is set during the Boshin War, beginning in 1865. The explosive rise of the modern era in Japan that began with the end of its isolation ignited a civil war between those dedicated to the cause of restoring the emperor to power, and those who remained loyal to the Tokugawa shogun. Warfare during this time period features extensive use of rifles and artillery, as the time of the samurai class approaches its end. Traditional units are still available, and useful, to recruit however.

All three campaigns for Shogun 2 offer unique experiences that warrant multiple playthroughs. Shogun 2 also features excellent multiplayer progression, through experience unlocks and a unique veteran unit system, and features multiplayer matchmaking, as well as two player online campaigns. All of the DLC for Shogun 2 is worth purchasing, though some may wish to pass on the unit packs. The faction packs offer unique factions unlike anything else found in the base game, and are definitely worth purchasing. I, myself, would recommend all the DLC, as the units included in the packs are fun, unique units.

Shogun 2 is a masterpiece RTS/TBS hybrid, and showcases epic, historically authentic samurai warfare unlike anything else.",1315077302,1426216907,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561197986692396,375,9,22954,0,19042.0,1598679432,,

0,14815092,english,"Shogun 2 is a fun, fast paced and exciting game to say the least. The multiplayer is great, the campaign is great, the units are great and the varying factions are all great. Shogun 2 is the second version of the shogun series and one of the newer Total War games. It is unique in the use of its DLC to expand on the base game and features other great unique features that older Total War games lack. Now, although medieval Japan is not my variety historical period I loved the look of the game and got into lots of information about it before buying it finding it to be worth it. Sadly my system is not the best at running it but in playing it I've enjoyed it, especially the multiplayer for what I could run smoothly. With co-op systems, avatar general and army building combined with leaderboards that can be attributed to Steam groups the system is a great improvement to the Total War games before it. I personally stuck to the multiplayer for most of my playing period with the game unlike in previous games where I stuck to the single player nearly the whole time. Multiplayer alone would still make this game good. Unit choices are another really great aspect which works with the varying factions too. Their is even one on the president! I won't give you any clues on what its called though. The other great thing about the game not mentioned yet is the graphics. The general look of the game is great despite my poor specifications which shows that it is great beyond what I considered already good as higher specification computers will have an even better sight. To summarise the good points-

- Improved multiplayer
- Good DLC that works well improving on the base game
- Great graphics
- Interesting and varied number of units
- Unique and original factions
- Great Campaign
- Great Historical battles with huge clashes and great explanations to them

Now to the bad. The game is hard to run for me and since my system is alright I would say it may be an issue for some others out there. Lowering the quality of the game helps, but the single player can lose the nice look due to the game struggling. Also, from what I saw, the early mulitplayer battles are awful if you don't have riflemen as they are incredibly over-powered.  The DLC, although improving on what the game offers greatly is a bit unfair at times to those without it. Without DLC its hard to beat armies who have them and since most players have already got high in the rankings late entries may find the first ten to twenty matches a bit of a slaughter on them. I got some riflemen and soon found I was the one slaughtering others which became fun though, so it worked out! To summarise the bad points-

- Over-powered DLC at times
- Specification is slightly too high for some lower specified computers.

So the game is great despite its obsession with paying more on upgrades in and out of the game to make your experience more pleasing in combat I would easily score this game a 4/5, 8/10 or 80%. It shows Total War games to be improving in many aspects and is definetly a great strategy game overall.",1425943149,1425943149,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198057025113,44,11,402,0,402,1417903776,,

While it suffers some from the engine, nothning like Rome 2 does. One of the games main advantages is the lack of units. The two starting units, yari ashiguru and bow ashiguru are usefull even in end game, I prefer to have most of my army made of theise to units, even if I can afford full samurai armies, But that just the historian in me. 

Much better with well balanced few units, then a huge number of useless units. whats the point of having 500 units to chooce from when you only ever use 30 of them. Most units in Rome 2 will never be used. The small diffrences between the clans is enough to create a good mix. If I play as Takeda, I will use lots of mounted units and early. 

My main beef with the game is:
1. Random crashes in battles, annyoing and can ruin a good campaign.
2. AI does not build historic armies, on easy, most units in ai armies will be ashigaru, but from normal and up, just a few turns into a campaign. you will meet samurai armies only. It ruins the emersion for me. There should always be more ashigaru then samurai....!

It contains a ton of content and additional available content that is actually worth playing. The base game gives you the playground of Japan during Sengoku jidai (the Sengoku period), known as the Warring States period of Japan. It's your clan's job to become the supreme ruler of Japan, and your task to become the Shogun of Japan! You lead battles and manage the empire. This is a game that gives you tons of content: and that's just the base game. There are two major DLC campaigns: one is Rise of the Samurai, which takes place many years before Sengoku jidai, where you try to get your clan in a position of power in a similar way. However, things are different: soldiers fight with more primitive weapons and your agents are different. The other campaign is Fall of the Samurai, which takes place after the events of SHOGUN 2's main campaign. As the British and French influence on Japan increases, a war between the Shogun and Emperor starts, and your clan gets to pick a side. Support the Emperor, the Shogun or try to unify Japan under your own clan's rule in a wicked expansion that gives you modern units and completely overhauls the game, but in a more major way than Rise of the Samurai did.",1403991236,1424642623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006783493,947,37,2896,0,2842,1560068309,,

A mixture of RTS and tactical turn based strategy, the Total War games grasp me in a way that the Civilization series never could. Shogun 2 brings plenty of new features to the franchise, but what really brought the game to life for me was the combination of traditional melee units with gunmen. In Empire, building melee units beyond cavlary comes across as a mostly pointless endevor. Medieval 2 was a game of horesys. Shogun 2 is the game of mixed armies. Using a combination of cannons, cavlary, archers, gunmen, spearmen, and samurai comes across as one of the more diverse experiences in the Total War universe. Large-scale decisions, such as how to tech, choosing a large standing army or greater economic technologies creates an interesting experience where your decisions outside of combat directly impact your battles.

FotS also brings along a few interesting gameplay mechanics. Railroads allow you to ferry troops across large sections of the map in minimal turns, while naval barrages against land units and structures mean that your navy recieves more use beyond that of anti-raiding parties.",1424425201,1424425201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002308111,317,13,26617,0,14057,1578243150,,

-Battles quite smooth and fluent (more than rome 2 actually);
-Samurai! (ok, this is just because I love Japanese history and culture);
-The skill system for generals and agents, which is even better in FotS;

Cons:
-The units are almost all the same for each clan (I would like to see more special and unique units);

Some, like Rome: Total War, are great, with a continous development and a possibility to actually conquer most of the ""world"". Others, like Empire: Total war, are too difficult and slow, making expansion take forever and always leaving you exposed no matter what you do.

Total War Shogun 2 has the perfect combination of continous development and difficulty. At the easy setting, you can more or less steamboat through the entire campaign, and at the hardest setting you have to plan your every single move. Personally I mostly play at the normal difficulty, where you get some opposition and have to be a bit tactical, but still see some development and progression in every other turn.

As with any Total War game, there's a high replay value, as each faction offers you a new challenge, with only the end-game becoming seemingly similar. Once you've played through this game a couple of times, I recommend getting the expansions: Fall of the Samurai & Rise of the Samurai, as these will further change the gaming experience and tactics that you have to use, without changing the difficulty (as did the expansions to Rome: Total War, which made that game unplayable).

For those familiar to the TW series, YOu will be happy to know that the original Shogun has come back and come back with a vengence. For those unfamiliar with TW, this is a total redo to the first in the TW series. Which ever you are in temrs of the series, you will be happy to know there are very few bugs, and none that are game breaking. The mechanics work beautifully. The AI works (this has been and continues to be an issue in past and present titles.) 

This is a grand strategy game. So it is slow at times... most of the time. The real fun is in the battles. Throwing hundreds, even thousands of men into the meat grinder. The Multiplay battles make this game truly great.

There are 2 expansions, a prequal that goes back several hundred years and really focuses on the samuri. The other goes forward in time and shows the power of modern units, gunpowder, canons that do real damage and rarely miss and a realy fun unit with the gatling gun. Watch your opponents die quickly if they decide to charge head on.

This game has the most hours on my account of any steam game, and at the time of this review I have all the other games beat by ~100 hours.

The down side to Creative Assembly games is the nickel and dime DLC. None of it is really needed and would even avoid the prequal expansion ""Rise of the Samuri.""

Overall, I love this game, One of the few from this series line that I continued to play beyond the 1 year mark.

This game is ridiculously resource intensive; AMD CrossFire support has been broken pretty much since day 1, significantly hurting performance.

The campaign AI is terrible, as bad as the original Medieval Total Wars - it CHEATS blatantly by giving itself free resources, and makes irrational decisions for its factions with the sole purpose of dicking you (the human player) over to create the illusion of difficulty.
The ""Realm Divide"" mechanic is just bullshit - simply hand-waving a lot of fundamental game balance just to artificially ramp-up the difficulty.

The modding community is solid - although these are just band-aids that patch-up the feckless and lazy design decisions the devs made on the game proper.

On the plus side, the game's pretty, the setting is entertaining enough, and there's an obscene amount of playtime to be had if you can ignore the bullshit.

The combat system is great as it has been in all Total War games. Strategies and analyzing and reacting to situations are key to winning. The new castle sieges add a new element to this franchise. Storming the walls is more tricky then one might think it would be with archers picking off melee units, it turns into a ranged battle until one side gets weakened enough for your melee troops to take to the walls. Another element Total War introduces is a co-op campaign. You have the option of trying to unite Japan with your Pal or going against him and fighting to the death till one of you end up on top.

Game is VERY deep and fun. Diplomacy, trade, Special agents, variety of technology (Arts) to research, and units to employ. You can even manage your family--designating heirs, having kids, etc.

The heart of the game is the tactical combat on the battlefield which I was at first concerned about being an almost exclusive TURN BASED player. But, you will find that with the pause feature it is manageable and even enjoyable. This game would actually be lessened by making it pure turn-based combat (something I shock myself in saying). Not knowing what every single unit is up to at all times  is the nature of the army vs. army/nation vs. nation scope of games in the total war series I find.

Great game. Very addictive. This will probably encourage me to try others of the series as this was my first.  9/10 (a 10/10 FOR ME would be something entirely turn based, but again that's not this kind of game anyway nor do I ask it to be).

I abosolutly loved this game, but am unable to compare it to others in the Total War series.

Although meny fans of the Total War series love it for its battle ground engine which has you comanding armys in real time on the battle field, i ended up using the auto battle function and ignoreing that aspect of the game, as i did not enjoy it.

I do however love empire building and this game excells at that, as you battle to concour Fudal Japan from other compeating Clans. This is no small feat either as this game is challenging and has no problem letting you lose very early on if you make the wrong move.

I recommend this game to anyone like my self who enjoys empire building, or is a fan of the Civilization series of games.

Play the Campaign: Dominate Japan and become Shogun, rewriting the history of the Warring States Period.

Total War: Shogun 2 (Fall of the Samurai) has answered my question. And the answer is: ""Hai!""

It's so fun! Seeing Japanese shoot each other, especially with artillery and gatling guns! And when you see a bunch of spear-weilding Japanese rushing an enemy Japanese rifle unit, and get mowed down, oh man, it feels so good! Like an angel has come down from Heaven to bless my soul. There's this inner peace unlike any other when I see, like, 5,000 Japanese dudes unload on each other until they're all dead.

46,13736749,english,"Shogun II was the last well polished game released by Creative Assembly before they decided that giving a bunch of brand new Devs complete and utter power to the franchise name was somehow a smart idea (I suspect meth was involved by this decision) 
Shogun II and Total War are in a genre not many style'd in its own right, it mixes two genres practically seamlessly, Grand Strategy campaigning, with an expansive map much like Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis IV, and a real time strategy element that has you commanding your army(s) in battle. It's not like other real time strategies where building one unit is quite literally one unit, or three units (Rise of Nations did this) that decrease in power as the life bar diminishes. Building one unit can mean anywhere from 100-300 units in that one unit card depending upon what unit type it is (These unit numbers are changed through the use of mods of course.) 
So here goes: each Total War prior to Shogun II had its strengths and speeds in terms of how it was as a game. Shogun II Total War's strength lies in its polish. To date, Shogun II is the most polished Total War game currently out there. The glint of wet armor as you play on a map where rain is the main factor, the little lanterns used to keep light in night battles, The way a drum is played as your men walk to their inevitable battle. Everything just oozes polish about this game, because everything is so well done in detail, it's impressive not to marvel about it in the slightest. 
Balancing isn't much of a issue either, since all the factions to choose from are more or less the same with a specific strength variation of one or two different units. This gave the developers of the game a lot of time to polish everything else, every little detail that just makes the game so beautiful.

The orginal Shogun is quite simplistic and rather dated now, in terms of the things that newer Total war games have to offer, however my love for that game did lead me to buy Shogun 2. 

And I've not regretted that decision. 

Shogun 2 is by far one of the best Total war games I've played. It takes everything that is good about TBS games and adds to it;

~ Weather conditions play more of a factor in battles, adding realism. Thus players need to adapt better strategies when deploying troops. 

~ Naval battles have been expanded and mechanics are much improved from Empire. 

~ The overall feel to the game is improved. Clans and Generals seem to have different personalities which enhances your intrigue for the game. 

~ The Campaign map on Empire, I felt was too large and I personally seemed to get bogged down with watching things such as finances and overseas settlements than actually trying to dominate the map. 

Shogun goes back to focussing on the ""War"" element, that made Rome and Medieval 2 so popular but it adds more in depth realism where it's wanted most; battles. 

~ Creating an avatar and unlocking units on online multiplayer keeps your drawn once you're through with campaign.

By far one of the best games I own. Must buy for TBS gamers and Total War fans.

And that's just the base campaign. There is a Rise DLC which puts you in the same situation about 400 years before the base one. And then there is Fall, which adds a LOT of gunpowder weaponry and modern tactics, and deals with a short period that lead to the modernization of Japan (and indirectly to the Japanese Empire of WWII).

There is also a multiplayer game that can be fun, though challenging in a different way.

Kinda pointless.
It's hard to point to exactly what is wrong with this one. For being set in such a traumatic period the setting is dull. Alternate history where no matter what happens it changes nothing because the differences between the factions are negligable. It's a tiny map and each faction has the exact same objective so you'll be doing the same things in each playthrough. This makes the  gamepaly repetitive. The units and cultures are generic to all factions with only slight variations. The samurai units are so grossly overpriced you can only justfy training them to have a prettier army. 
The AI does not exist. Spawned stacks of troops march towards you in response to your progress. This provides the exact same experience each time you play with only slight variations. Tactically the ""AI"" responds to your mouse clicks rather than actual troop movements in a most unnatural way.
Naval warfare is extremely unexciting. Nearly all engagements, even with overwhelming force, are inconclusive draws that end when one side decides to leave the itty bitty map.
They did fix seiges which have always been broken in the series, but they did so by basically getting rid of them, all walls can be climbed and seige weapons are so rare you're likely to never see them.
I understand that the multiplayer is good.

87,12566039,english,"SHOGUN 2 TOTAL WAR REVIEW:

Shogun 2 total war does achieve beyond its predecessors by bringing the rts game up to date with the others that sweep the market today. I was really surprised for this game as it brings a great multiplayer experience to the table. The visuals do look impressive as you see thousands of samurai sweeping across the hillside as their armour shimmers and vibrant maps that gives your eyes a treat to look at, it is probably the best atmospheric total war that i have ever played. The game takes place in japan around the 16th century, rival clans battle it out to become the shogunate who is the head of power in all of japan, there are clans including Takeda, oda, shimazu and alot more. you will also find the Tokugawa clan which in reality, became shogunate around that time. Personally shogun total war has been polished and it has been a long road since the first shogun. Even though shogun is impressive, it does lack the inteligence of the ai, i can tell you that they have been improved it quite a bit but it still has some issues like random armies trying to invade you with only 1 unit and others like cavalry charging at you but then when they are 5 metres away, they decide to dismount. Complaints aside, this game is great. it has a great setting and it is just empowering when you have thousands of samurai and spearmen charging into battle. This game is amazing, i recommend it and it is more fun when you are playing with friends and teaming up to crush you opponent. SCORE: 9/10

SHOGUN 2 FALL OF THE SAMURAI REVIEW:

Doesn't it feel great when you are mowing down hopeless wandering samurai that are charging  at you with gattling guns. Yes, i am talking about the dlc for shogun 2 total war, fall of the samurai and as the name suggests it is the time when western nations pour into japan and tred on its original traditions of war. This time was a very interesting part of history as western nations fueled Japan up with the latest technologies in that time like gattling guns, rifles and gunboats. now look what they have become today, an industrialized modern country. The game starts off around the 19th century where feudalisation in japan has  flourished. Nations like Britian, France and America fuel  Japan with these technologies to make it become a superpower. The new dlc brings the game up to the point where it is close to modern day, you will see things like torpedo boats, gatling guns, and powerful field artillery which can destroy any melee unit. you will also get to try out units like the royal marines, shogunate imperial infantry and imperial infantry whcih remind me of the guys from the last samurai which is a great movie that is in the same time period. the campaign map gets a new visual look, this means you will see railway systems going from each town andmore modern buildings in the cities. clans again fight for the soul of japan and it is cool seeing the tradtitonal part of japan fight with the modern side. this is a great dlc and i recomend it if you like to see explosions and smoke.

One day you realize you're at that point in life where you really can't afford to spend too much time dawdling on games, but now and then you find your hobby clawing its way back. When you find it's ""that"" particular game eating away at what little free time you have, you know it was one of the few that was worth picking up.

Shogun 2 is that bane and joy in equal measure. Not enough agents scouting the campaign map? An enemy army is on your capital's doorstep more often than not. Place your traditional units on the other side of a steep hill? Force the enemy modern rifle infantry units up on a tiring march... only to get reamed for never being presented an opportunity to fire before going into melee.

In some ways the game is not beginner-friendly. The tutorials leave a lot to be desired and you're left looking for other avenues (the wiki is a good first stop). I will say this: Once you're into it, [i]Shogun 2 delivers some of the most satisfying experiences I've had in this genre[/i]. I find myself watching the same replays repeatedly; from the enemy point of view as they split their cavalries into my flanks and into hidden spear walls, and again from my perspective when I force the bulk of the enemy force to wedge itself into a killzone.

If you're one of ""those"" types, I think the most rewarding experience to reap out of this game is watching that strength bar run all the way from almost completely red, to fully yellow by the end of a heroic victory. I'm ashamed to admit I hide the majority of my playtime by going into ""offline mode""; replays are the ultimate ego stroke.

Having said this, I will not completely lavish it with praise; the game does have issues. It suffers from a thoroughly confusing honour system. At times you'll wonder if your allies will see you as dishonorable and strike your flanks. You're considered a ""backstabber"" for attacking a clan you've given safe-passage to... after it declares war on you and its army is laying seige to your city.

You're never entirely sure what counts as ""line-of-sight"" for your artillery units, right up to the time to deploy and attempt to fire. The arrow markers on the campaign map indicating your army's movement can also be misleading. On more than one occasion I found an army stopping just short of a city that was about to go into unrest. To be fair, I was taxing at the maximum every other turn, but it was very hard mode, so my sin is absolved!

Aside from that, this is a solid game. Especially if you have friends to play with on multiplayer. Some advice: As with any online game, just have an idea of what you expect from each other first! Don't force demanding play times and everything should be kept civil... unless you've included a blood and gore mod. I recommend grabbing this and the FotS DLC. I'm not saying you [b]should[/b].

28,13041792,english,"First of all, I haven't played all games of the Total War franchise, only Medieval 2 and a bit of Rome 2, but Shogun 2 was the best so far. Its really captivating and its one of those games which can tie you to your chair for hours and hours, just like Anno 1503. I'm not bad at strategy games but I think that even for strategy newbies this game will be easily understandable and enjoyable.

Pros:   

-The setting. Feudal Japan is cool, Samurais are cool, Ninjas are cool, being Shogun is cool.
-The graphics. Ok, the map is not the eyecatcher here but the battles are. The details are amazing and you can follow each samurai until his death.
-Intuitive control and UI. Its impressive how easy to understand this game is. The principles and priorities are clear, you don't have to search for anything and the interfaces for diplomacy, trading and all that stuff are well done.
-Sound in general. Wether its the effects, the music or voices (the japanese accent sounds great), everything feels right.
-The campaign. Its pretty long and its full of surprises, you can always do something in a different way than you did before.
-The characters. I'm talking about the generals, daimyos, ninjas, metsukes and all these people. I got pretty attached to them and it was exciting to see how they grew with the time (plus the skilltrees are awesome).

Cons:

-After you've finished the big campaign, there ain't much to do, you can go for the DLC's like Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai, but if you want to play the campaign again I noticed that you don't get any more clans that you can play, like in Medieval 2 for instance.
-Sometimes you have to repeat battles (if you mustn't lose them) and it can get pretty frustrating after the 17th try.

I highly recommend this game and if you enjoy feudal japan and strategy games, get this game. Now.",1416672465,1416672585,True,71,4,0.833909094333648682,3,True,False,False,76561198061957310,260,7,13540,0,7905,1581532309,,

Things to point out: 

Strategy/Replay - The three major expansion all offer something different. A different story with a different kind of game play - from deciding if your focus is monks, samurai, etc (rise of the samurai) to deciding on traditional units or modern units (fall of the samurai). 

Graphics/Crashing - I hear a lot of people with issues in this regard. My older computer (that was once a ""top of the line gaming computer"") hated running this game. It gave me tons of issues. My new computer has not run into a single issue yet. So details aside it is likely your computer that is to blame for the crashes - try not to let your ego ruin your chance at liking this game.

Gameplay - No matter what campaign you are playing this game offers so very much. You get to pick skills (for direct or general style combat), setup family/clan aspects from assigning titles, who your heir is or even adopting generals. Your army is very customizeable and you can cater to your personal liking (Ranged power for defending/attacking cities but beware of ammo running out, melee power houses to charge into enemies or a more tactical calvary/cannons/naval support. You get to forge actual alliances (unlike in things like Civilation where anyone can turn on you any minute) that strengthen over time with trades, marriages, helping in wars, military access, etc et. 

I am some one that will probably never be satisified with any strategy game because I want to customize everything. Everything. This game could be improved but what it does have is many of the things that any stratedgy fan (RTS or Turn based) will love.",1416426437,1416426437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031490181,138,2,32059,0,9540,1576984417,,

38,13000874,english,"Ive played all of the Total War games, and I have to say this is my favorite one. Japan is, of course, not as big as some of the other places Total War games take place in (see Rome 2 huge map) but it doesnt feel small, and the relationships with other clans in the campaign map can make or break you, also there is a wild card called Kyoto that can crush you early on if you make them mad, and eventually you can capture it. The fighting is also very interesting, and I would actually recommend the blood DLC because sometimes you will want to zoom in on the 1v1s the unit AI automatically go to, put on the slow motion mode, and watch a display of skill samurai versus samurai, or a charge of ashigaru and see people get impaled and lifted off their feet. Unlike the other Total War games, this one doesnt have sheilds. You may have mixed feelings about this, but ultimately it just means ranged is more effective and strategy for this game must usually be done differently. The maps have a lot of terrain you can take advantage of, so that's a plus that replaces sheilds if used correctly. If you are not a fan of the artillery in other Total War games, there is very little of it used in this game, unless you get FotS because then you pretty much bought a game based on gunpowder.

 The multiplayer is more fun than the traditional; choose units, fight. In Shogun 2 you pick your army, after some time playing, from veterans that you have leveled up, that have their own skill branch and that you can specialize to fit specific needs and change the color of their uniforms (my entire army is pink), including your avater (general (mine is pink)) who can specialize in swordsmanship, bows, or just being a commander. There are also buffs and debuffs, and more units you can gain and use in multiplayer through a small slightly interactable map of Japan. This kind of multiplayer certainly isnt for people who hate investing time or getting slightly wrecked at lower levels because the veteran system/buffs allows higher ranking or people who have spent more time to have a large amount of veterans. You may also be discouraged by the FotS players if you play the traditional style Japanese units, which I do. I learned just to suck it up and adapt my tactics.

The campaign is the most fun, as it is really focused. At the start you can make alliances and grow in power. Once your big enough, you start the civil war where everyone is against you providing a fun late game challenge I felt other total war games lacked. The atmosphere is spot on, but troop variety is limited so the different factions only have 1-2 unique units. 

The multiplayer is also the best out of the Total War Series, allowing for co-op campaigns and a clan focused completive multiplayer where your army levels up and you can customize them.

Pros:
Good graphics
Runs well
Fun multiplayer
Good single player
Days Of Playtime
Extreme detail on models
Good (ish) A.I.
Workshop addons gallore
instant multiplayer: no dedicated server download needed.
Naval and land combat.

Not completley historically accurate (although that dosn't affect the game in any way.)

This game has had some of the most amazing moments in all of the many games I have played, like one samurai retrainer fighting off 26 yuri arigahsu, around 200 units fending off 600 units and causing my clan to win the gmae, and many other things.

31,12529304,english,"I have fond memories of the original Shogun and, despite its flaws, kept up with the TW series until Empire when I parted ways. When this came up in a sale I thought I'd give it a go as I'd heard it was something of a return to form and I thought it would be fun to return to the days of charging samurai. And to be fair the charging samurai are still fun and obviously look better than they did in the original Shogun but sadly that's about it.

What let's this down is the AI at every level. On land the enemy AI can put up some resistance but if the forces on each side are similar you'll usually win. The passivity of units, yours and the oppositions, is what kills it for me. You have to micromanage your supposedly highly trained samurai so that they turn to face a unit that's flanking them. Or to attack a unit that's attacking a nearby unit instead of standing around like idiots. They're may be occasions when I'd like a unit to stand fast no matter what but unless that's an explicit order from me, their general, I'd prefer them to default to doing their job when the opportunity presents itself.

At sea it's even worse. The default behaviour of the enemy fleet is to stay at anchor and let my fleet come to them. A particularly bad tactic for a trade ship being attacked by two navy ships,

Presumably to compensate for this at the strategy level the AI is essentially simple. Whatever you do they all hate you and sooner or later will attack. When they do this your economy will usually tank so you'll be short of resources reducing your strategic option to grinding down the endless attacks and hoping they run out of reserves before you do. The odd battle like this can be fun but after a whle 'grind' becomes the operative word and boredom sets in. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the likes of Crusader Kings II, where you can have a rich and complex set of relationships between and within countries, but when I see clans at the other end of the Japan that I've never interacted with in any way have suddenly decided to go to war with me (ignoring more lucrative targets closer to home) I just roll my eyes. CA could get away with this kind of brain dead behaviour back in 2000 and the original Shogun but there's little excuse for it now. Whilst the complexity of CK2 would be overkill you should get the illusion you were a part of a living world where the other actors have goals of their own instead of all just existing to provide an opponent for the human player. 

In short, if you see this in a sale and enjoy the charging samurai side of the thing enough you'll probably get your money's worth but if you're looking for something with any kind of strategic depth then move along, nothing to see here.",1413574025,1413574025,False,1,0,0.441934108734130859,0,True,False,False,76561197970384566,136,3,3014,0,304,1459724023,,

60,12430844,english,"Released on Steam in March 2011, Shogun 2 was a long awaited game for by fans who enjoyed the first game and fans were not let down with this installment in the series. I had pre-ordered this game and paid full price, I was only upset that a few short months later is dropped to half price. Otherwise the game is very addicting to play.

The game story takes place during 1467 to 1477 where all the nations in Japan came to war, a war that involved the Ashikaga shogunate and the territorial lords. The result of this massive power struggle three individuals would emerge who would unite Japan under one rule. You play one of the warlords who is to dominate the other clans and rule the whole of Japan.

Those who are familiar with the Total War series will know what to expect in this game, but for those who are looking for a medieval Japanese strategy game, like me, will probably find this game overwhelming at first.

I found this game difficult to get into from the start and learn what to do. The tutorials really help with the controls and how to do things in Shogun 2. You need to build, manage your clan, scout and war. When it comes to fighting another army you can let the game auto resolve it or you can go into battle mode.

When you are in battle mode fighting another army, you will find yourself in a whole new mode, commanding your forces and setting up how they will advance and what formation they will be in. I really like this mode because its interesting to see how your battle is actually going and how you will react to the fight. The game holds allot more, sea battles using ships, storming castles and ninjas.

There are cut scenes during play, such as when you send a trained ninja out to assassinate an enemy force. You will get to see a successful attempt or one where the ninja fails.

The tutorial at the start to help you learn to play is very helpful and the Japanese geisha girl voice is a nice touch to help you learn what to do. 

The multiplayer portion of the game requires you to join a Total War Shogun 2 group and then you get to view a map of Japan and place your avatar on. Beyond this I haven't figured out how it plays out as there isn't any option to go to a ground to ground battle or auto resolve it. I am sure its something simple to do but I haven't been able to figure it out.

Overall the game is hard to understand how to play and takes some time to learn. The multiplayer side I found very hard to understand and troublesome to figure out. I do enjoy playing it but its one I have been able to put down and wait a long time to get back into. I think I will have to give this another try sometime soon.

I haven't gotten to the point of dominating all of Japan or anything but I do like the whole game because you get to fight during a most interesting time in Japans history and that period is a time of Total War!

79,12386174,english,"Let's be honest here two minutes:  Shogun 2 really wasn't that great. Except for the fancy graphics, it didn't feel like much of an improvement over the good old Shogun-the-first.  And even though I was happy to come back to some interesting melee fighting, I found the battles to be not nearly as slick as they were in Napoleon: TW.

Hopefully, it seems that CA has decided that, after releasing a kinda lame, or let's say boring game, they'll polish it with a second version/stand alone that not only fixes the issues, but improve everything. T'was the case with Napoleon (vastly superior to Empire), is the case with Fall of the Samurai (vastly superior to Shogun II) and will hopefully be the case with Attila TW.

Fall of the Samurai (FotS) lets the player choses a side during the Boshin war, that opposed the Tokugawa Shogunate to the Imperor in the late 1860's. An era just as interesting as the Sengoku Jidai, as Japan is at a crossroad: will it stick to its old, medieval, feudal ways, or embrace modernization, with the help of - financially interested - westerners?

That setting makes for a very interesting game. You can either chose to field armies that would seem right in the place in Shogun 2, made of Samurai and knights, or modern forces, with fast-firing canons and line infantry, french or british mercenaries... 

Chosing modernization will give you an important advantage, tech and economy-wise. But it also makes your domain harder to rule, as the samurai caste opposes the reforms. Unlike Empire and Napoleon, where the ""clamor for reform"" was merely an issue, it becomes here a fundamental factor, as your population can quickly get rebelious as you build more factories all over the place. Overall, I'd say the campaign is much harder than that of any previous TW game. Not only unhappiness can get really high really fast, but economy is also much complexe. Trade doesn't bring in enormous amount of cash, while taxes have to stay relatively low as long as your people aren't content. Plus, the AI seems a whole lot more competent, regularly launching amphibious invasions with real armies (a first in the Total War series), and setting ambushes every once in a while. Mind you, it is still mindlessly stupid most of the time, but a bit less stupid than it used to be.

As your clan evolve, so does the campaign map: villages and towns grow bigger, trains start linking provinces, smoke and pollution surround your factories, Ironclads replace the good old wooden ships... It is great to see the (huge) map of Japan evolves as turns end. And as a bonus, you can try and establish your own republic, giving the middle finger to both the Shogun and the Emperor.

But, nothing is perfect and this FotS is no exception. My main issue with it, is that there's actually little reason to stick to the old ways, despite the happiness bonus: not only will your economy and research rate suck, but so will your armies. Even veteran samurais will get absolutely trashed by armies of line infantry supported by heavy guns. To add the insult to the injury, traditional units are just as expensive to recruit and maintain as modern ones. If you could attempt to swarm the opponent with cheap armies of melee specialists, I feel the balance between the two ""ways"" would be fairer.",1412584622,1412584622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005636407,264,16,5709,0,5655,1450552489,,

26,12283640,english,"Fun ,thoughtfull, enhancing on old gameplay while increasing diversity. I would have enjoyed the ability to include factions and landmasses from the east coast of asia and the other areas surrounding Japan that could affect it. Russia, South east aisa, china the polynesian and oceanic areas. But beyond that It's effective and varied gameplay which is cool.

I have been victorious through tactics with agents and generals alike. Each factions adds a different style to your combat conquest which is cool. It would have been nice to create your own faction since the movies are almost interchangable with content, and you could use create your own opening movies based on the assigned qualities you give to your faction.

 The only issue i can find beyond that, is the same with other tw games, which is, at a certain point diplomacy is useless, which albeit is somewhat honest of their perspective on global politics, but for a game it carves out a very entertaining route to victory. Getting your enemies to fight against themselves, setting up vassal territories' to create a territory cusion agaisnt enemies and having them be loyal. once you are a big enough threat, everyone wants a piece. But that isn't historically accurate or realistic regardless of design. 

If you have overwhelming power and are next to a faction that has no power and you provide them with their stability then it makes no sense that they would turn on you because of a weaker force that controls kyoto (or whatever considering the other games) considers you a threat. Even if you argued that they are joining together to fight your ""evil empire"". Why are their alliances permanent and your alliances feathers in the wind.  Especially if you are between the smaller faction and kyoto(or whoever) and could wipe them out without a second thought. If you had that power over them, they would do pretty much whatever you pleased. Hence the vasal state.

 How would they know to strike back. Who tells them now is a good time to revolt. I control their borders, how do they get the message to attack from the other remaining powers big or small. Why dont they consider their survival when bitting the hand that feeds you. Why don't they consider your ruling if you are making them a vassal. I see no reason why diplomacy should get the shaft like this, it is a form of war.

While i do appreciate a challenge and perspective that the game may be trying to give you on taking the shogunate, it seems like they are missing the point of being a real power. You don't just conquer or buy your way to victory. 

You misinform, please and beg, push and argue, lie and steal, relieve and pursway. And if none of these tactics are viable because the moment you hit critical mass its all or nothing. Then you're basically wasting a lot of our time because no matter what; it comes down to all vs you anyway.

So yes, your a threat, sure, and of course some people make an alliance to try and stop you. No problem. But your telling me that the faction that was a rebel group that i conquered on my second turn and turned them into a vassal to relieve the waste of money it would have been, is going to side with my enemies? For no reason? especially when I have a full army waiting for my enemies to attack the vassal, right next to it?

Im sorry, thats just not logical.

 And what about the ai for you public?

 Sure you can say you lead the army to the doorstep of Kyoto. 

But will your people stand with you after you've killed half their family that lives in the other city you just conquered? 

Or will they depose you and put their own form of government seeing the game of war the land and the damyio's have turned into.

Will the disease created by the overwhelming ammount of dead bodies created in the last years stop you in your tracts or will you find a cure. 

Does the storm prevent you from traveling through this area at this time or doesn't it. 

Have these territories given in to your demands or become so in awe of your leadership and then they relieved themselves of their leaders  Or did you capture the damiyo's son and start holding hostages till the damiyo gives in.  

Did you create rebels through money, fear, lies,  power or inspiration.
Are you a reckless tyrant or a masterfull leader? and to what degree?


Now their are some of these things in the game. Flooding, pestilence, disease and rebellion. But it does not feel like a real problem most of the time or happens so infrequently it seems rather unnecessary. 

Diplomacy is generally a front which bothers me, but to be fair i have yet to find a game that allows 
for a realistic alliance strategy. Which is bothersome because the game has a viewable point system for diplomacy, it just seems as if they are breached or changed so often that you can rarely have a brother or sister nation. Which is again unrealistic. Sure there are lots of powers who are on and off again in diplomacy, but their are also some nation relationships that stood the test of time, and were either joined by marriages between the factions or trade and military benefits.  

I enjoyed the rise of the samurai simply because you can conquer without conquering with the law officials. You can technically bribe almost every city.

 But why only bribery?

My point is, If you are not given the ability to conquer and maintain you empire in diferent ways and you don't have events that can acutally affect the entire area with a dire rammifications to the whole. 

Then it hardly can be called a total war strategy game, It can be called a territory war strategy game, and you might as well take the ""boring"" or ""pointless""  political or diplomatic strategy out of the game entirely; Who cares about trade rights if your going to have to conquer them in ten turns?

Who cares about disease if you have no doctors or healers to do something about it . Shouldn't disease be something that can halt you completely like the black plague did in the rome and medieval.

Who cares about destruction without something to deal with it, say engineers. Shouldn't bridges be destroyed or rebuild, should not snowstorms make certain places not only deadly but impossible to pass?

 You might as well just add a first person mode to conquering because then at least you could try to control some of the conquering personally and it would bring the variety you are looking for.

Dont get me wrong. Their is no other franchise that gives me so much pleasure with rts battle simulations, I love the combat.  it's awesome and the designers are always looking to streamline it and make it more enjoyable, that by itself deserves the play through seriously, personally i can watch boiling oil melts troops in a siege for hours on end in the first rome. Seriously, it made it feel like an actual battel field with consequences for every military action"" you wanna go through the gate without conquering it first, okay let me melt your face off"". Defending attacks is one of my favorite gaming fantasies so let me make this clear. Rome, Shogan1&2, medieval1&2, and even empire, are all enjoyable mass combat arcade simulators. 

But I still think they can improve and add variety and different modes to the world strategy part of the game.

So if you want a TOTAL war strategy game, then you need to account for and add the problems that conquerors had to account for and the tactics they used or could have used in face of said problem. Or else its just a war game and all that matters is which side of the island you start on, and which way you accumulated your first twenty territories. Which is cool! 

It just seems half finnished in the respect to their franchise name. Total war.

p.s I would have easily been happier with longer single player campaign modes for all of their games.

53,12267701,english,"As soon as I finsihed Installing the game and saw the opening cinematic; I knew I was going to have a fantastic time playing  Shogun 2. I had always wanted to play a strategy game set in the fuedal Japan era.  I wanted that game to be very Authentic and realistic and I got exactly that in this game. If you are familiar with Total War games then the mechanics should feel very familiar. If you are familiar with any other strategy game, Shogun 2 will feel a little overwhelming at first but there should be no problem to gain the feel for it. What I loved about the game is that there is a fantastic balance between economy, politics and action. You are a Daiyamo set out for a conquest to rule the capital Kyoto, Japan and become Shogun. There are multiple clans you can choose from starting from different locations of Japan. Also, each clan has a certain professioncy bonus depending on which one you choose. For instance the Chosokabe clan is specialized with better archers. All archer units have a bonus in acuracy with the Chosokabe clan. You can gain allies in your campaign or gain enemies in your goal for Total War. The map of the Japan is laid out for you and certian areas are undiscovered until your army has traveled to that part of the map. The economy is set up depending on what you spend your expanion of buildings or your spending of growing an army. Each provence has a different or smiliar buildings as other provinces and you can choose to prosper the economy or piss off and starve your population. By upseting your people, rebels will rise against you and try to over through you and your army. I found myself putting many hours into the game and loving every minute of it. The details is what really drew my attention. The battle scenes are what really make this game unique. You start off by positioning your army in any formation you choose or customizing your own. Once you have begun the battle, you have full command of your army and set them anywhere else on the map. Depending on the climate or surrouding are, your army can have an advantage or disadvantage. If you're placed in a forrest of trees, the opposing force will have a hard time landing arrows on you etc. I loved the animation for every single unit during a battle. Each unit and person has a different animation when they are attacking or being attacked. You can win a battle even though you are out numbered. There was a point in the game where I had a full conquest of japan. I had to split my army in two because of the mountains in central japan. One army on the northern passage and the other on the southern passage. All clans decided to stop me at the northern passage and I couldn't recieve reinforsments in the south because of the mountains. Wave after wave the northern army had to fight and eventually my men started to fatigue greatly. It was the final wave and everyone was exhausted. As they met the enemy forces in battle a skull icon appeared on my armies profile. I looked to see what it was and it meant that my army was going to fight to the death. My mean fought fearlessly and this allowed the enemy force to retreat with fear. Thus I had one the battle and continued my conquest. If you are a gamer who wants to lost in a world of feudal Japan; expereinced the role of the samurai and achieve the ultimate status of a Shogun. If you're a fanatic for any real time strategy game or if you want to try something totally new.  Buy this game. It is well worth every money and time. I found myself putting 6 easy hours one day where I have nothing to do. Enjoy!",1411858255,1411858255,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031868512,494,7,7269,0,6218,1557193054,,

I love this game so much. There is a pretty big learning curve when it comes to the game structure if you've never played total war and finicky camera and unit controls but it's so worth it in the quality of the game experience. The diplomacy is brutally unfair at times - but as I've dug through negative forum reviews and the few responses CA's put forth, I've begun to side on their side for certain things argued as a bug. E.g. Having trade routes with enemies of your allies can cause sudden backstabs or penalties to your clan's honour by huge chunks being labelled ""Dishonouring treaties"" causing the whole island to not trust you by default when you didn't do anything but click next turn. It's frustrating, but when you examine most scenarios they do tend to make sense. Then there's the realm divide, but you'll find out all about that. It's just an incredibly difficult and rewarding game. I haven't dared venture into multiplayer, so I can't account for that side of the game.

88,12233929,english,"Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a strategy game set in feudal Japan, and is a turn based strategy game. The game has two major mechanics I will get briefly into here. After you have chosen your clan you will see a map of Japan, and where you have your units and town. This map isn't the entire game by far, but here you have an overview of how you run your lands by building necessary building for your war effort, diplomacy and gathering resources and researching technology. You will also have a family tree where members can grow up to be leaders or the women can be wed to form alliances or make them stronger. Basically you govern everything from this map.

The major strength of this game is the battles however. When you enter a battle you will enter the zone from the map you are either attacking or defending, and is where the game gets more complex for strategy fanatics. If you have 80 men attacking you will see 80 detailed men on your side in formations you can change, and the same goes for 1200 men which make battles huge and impressive as you see them battle it out. The various formations and approach you can make is extremely fun, and even the terrain and weather has an affect of how everything will play out. This also means you can win despite being severely outnumbered if you somehow manage to use the terrain to your own advantage. Generals also play a huge role here as they give better morale and can add buffs to units as well. 

There are also many units in the game, and this is not counting the DLC's out there either.

The most focus is actual combat and RTS in the armies fighting, you can possibly win, with your Army in a Blitzkrieg tactic with just Ashigari troops alone. Or build up a strong army, having lots of up-keep costs.

Here this is impossible you have no chance of having influence on making a strong Clan as it means to be a clan.

98,11768194,english,"Its official, Creative Assembly cannot program or design their games correctly.
I loved this game. Almost everything about the tactical battles to the strategic campaign map. Everything just fits together so perfectly right up until the point where the ai sends dozens of trade ships around to raid all of your trade routes and close off all of your ports (even if you have entire fleets inside them) who always retreat when your fleets catch up to them. There are so many little problems with the game that simply ruin the experience.
First of all, the naval portion of the Sengoku Jidai campaign is abysmal. As I said, once you defeat an ai’s main fleet, they will pester you with a never ending stream of small ships to raid your trade routes and even carry invasion forces just large enough to take one province on the opposite side of japan from your armies. The naval battles themselves are also terrible too. Once you order a ship to board another ship and said ship gets into range, it will slowly inch into position while the enemy ship peppers it with arrows/fire bombs/canon shells. I am not even kidding when I say that if you are unlucky it can take several minutes for your ship just a couple of yards away from the enemy to board them. Also, my ships seem to spontaneously combust and instantly surrender for no reason, so there’s that. The Fall of the Samurai campaign seems to fix allot of these issues, but it still has the problem of the idiotic path finding.
Second of all, religious agents such as monks and missionaries are overpowered. Once they get to level five they become basically immortal and you (or the AI) can send them all over the map inciting revolts and converting any agents that dare enter their visual radius. If you start the game as the Shimazu and you cannot eliminate the Otomo clan before they get a level three or four missionary, then its game over. You simply cannot make a ninja who is capable of assassinating the missionary before getting converted and you cannot handle the massive number of revolts that missionary will throw your way. 
Finally, the reason I rage quitted the game once and for all is that in my latest campaign I had a city with a full stack army inside of it and another full stack army just outside ready to reinforce besieged by three full stack armies. I was ready to attack them but the army inside the fort could not attack the besieging army (which is something you are supposed to be able to do in case you were wondering.) The besieged army could not even reinforce another army even though the besieging army could reinforce. I had a metsuke patrolling around for a ninja and he could not find anything, nor did I receive a sabotage notice. None of my highly skilled ninjas could even interact with the besieging army. I have looked up this problem online and others have had it. So basically all of the dozens of hours I poured into that campaign where pointless because of a stupid design decision/bug, great. 
Mind you this is all coming from a guy who put in almost two hundred hours into the game and read many guides online on how to do well, so don’t you dare give me any of that “git gud” bull crap. I did not even have a problem with common new player grips such as food shortages and the realm divide.
Overall good game with a few small problems a dozen or so hours down the road which completely nuke the experience.

13,11736541,english,"I cannot believe that its been over a decade since creative assembly first introduced me to the original shogun. Back then I was very much into the Japanese  Samurai films. Until then I had never experienced a battlefield RTS like Shogun. It gave me many hours of enjoyment seeing hundreds of soldiers and cavalry battle it out across the Japanese countryside. Today of course the TW series as come a long away and gone are the sprites from the original game. I've played all of the TW series up to Shogun 2. What can I say other than a big WOW. The Samurai theme had always been my favourite so to see it gloriously updated for shogun 2 has pleased me no end. They have also removed some of the complexity of the recent games but kept in all the good bits and more. The developers must have refined the game since release as well because I couldn't get it to run when I originally purchased it over a year ago. Even on my aging rig I can squeeze enough out of the settings to make it look good and still run at a good frame rate. I salute them if they improved the games optimisation.

The game itself has a ton of content including the single player campaign, historical and custom battles. As with the more recent titles there are also naval battles. The campaign map looks beautiful and very accessible. During a game your general and clan upgrade with experience giving you a multitude of development options. All the other elements are there such as finance, construction and special units.

To top it all there are also some DLC's and a couple of expansions which will add even more hours of gameplay. In my opinion this is a superb update to what was then a ground breaking original.

This is easily my favorite Total War, and I installed Windows on my mac, so I could play it and a few other games that arn't on Mac.  The Mac port is pretty good, but not perfect.  For some reason the 'Fall of the Samurai' campaign is missing on the Mac port.  And also, there is noticeble drop in framerate when the battles start to rage.  I just switched to Windows now, to just make sure my memory wasnt bad, and it runs perfect on there(Highest Settings, no drop in framerate)(keep in mind, I am using the same hardware).  I don't want to say its unplayable though, I think I spent about 4 hours on it on the OSX version, and its still a blast.  Because lets be honest, when you are commanding your troops, you arn't really zooming to watch all the details, you are watching the banners, and blobs, and bottle necks in the terrain, etc.  I would still recommend it on OSX.  Feral Interactive (the dudes that ported it to Mac) may have optimized it for newer machines perhaps?

48,11575822,english,"Total War : Shogun 2 is a great game with a few small problems. 

The game looks very nice, the campaign map with all provinces changes its face in each time of the year. Mountains are snowy, water splashes, and you can see rainbows there and there around streams coming down from mountains with occasional eagle flying around. In the battle the units have great details, their armor and weapons looks reasonably real. Also each battlefield takes its looks from the place on the campaign map where the battle is taking place which is a great achievement! If you attack army in a forested area near a mountain these will be in the battle. If there is a castle town nearby, or river, this will be in the battle.


The campaign itself features many great things like the Civilization games do, you administer your towns, you research interesting ""techs"" and advancements which are reasonably historically accurate and if you are interested in Japanese history they can lead to many hours of interesting wiki reading.
All clans, their provinces, their daymios are very accurate, they have the right names, they start in the right provinces and they have even mostly the historically correctly named sons and generals. 
During the gameplay you uncover the face of Japan which makes your conquest all the more rewarding and makes you want to try to play as different clan next time. There are some differences, mainly in the  starting location of each clan, and some perks like Takeda's better cavalry or Date's better No-Dachi Samurai.
The battlefield gameplay is what makes Total War games so unique, you command your army in the high level, but if you zoom in you can see scirmishes between single men in the units, arrows are flyhing, katanas are cutting through flesh, etc. It allows all the interesting battlefield maneuvers, lke flanking, hiding, charging with cavalry, there are no limits to what you can try to do to outsmart the enemy and crush his army. Last but not least the morale aspect is greatly implemented, peasants units (ashigaru) are very easily shaken and will flee if you do not have general nearby or if they get charged by cavalry in their backs. Samurai units will most likely fight till the last few men before running away.

There is  quite steep learning curve to this game, especially to master the battle, even after the basic concepts are mastered, it takes a long time to be able to stand up to experienced player in PvP or even beat the game on harder/hardest difficulties. Still, the progress in learning the concepts is rewarded with greater victories against bigger armies and even wins in PvP parts of the game.

The only problems game faces is with AI of your opponents, at times AI does things which you know human would not do, even though you will make plenty of mistakes during your first playthroughs too. Further problems come from not perfect ballancing of units which leads to overpowered armies of single units (spams) in multiplayer, there has been some patches, but it will most likely never be perfect.

I would definitely recommend this game even today while it's over 3 years old. If you like Total War games, it is a must have. If you like Japan and want to know more about its history in Sengoku period even more. If you would like to try some strategy game you did not play before it is a sure pick.",1407338163,1407363656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005684219,93,16,7717,0,5261,1509394595,,

Summary;  Total War: Shogun 2 is a game with Decent but flawed AI, horrendous CAI tag teaming (AI clans gang bang you on Hard, Very Hard, and Legendary unless you pussy out and play normal/easy,) terrible AI handicaps where the AI is magically always rich (a fact that made gaming news,) poor unit balancing (Hero units can win against 10 to one odds and people with Fall of teh Samurai can kill everyone else without it, cause guns are OP to the extreme,) and poorly done game modes (Avatar Conquest is a game mode where you cap provinces on a chest board, play MP battle to win them, and are limited to junk units, and few unit types till you level up which is impossible if you can't find another underprivileged newb for those privileged with FoTS and higher rank opportunize off lowbies and auto win.)  You can really tell CA is getting lazy with optimization, bug fixing, and realizing full development potential (facts that are FULLY evident in Rome 2 and halfway here.)  There's some DLC whoring as well, with people getting FoTS just to roll over everyone else without it, and DLCs doing little more than unlocking clans that already should be unlocked.

The naval combat in Shogun 2 is the best RTS naval combat simulator of its class. FOS DLC added great content (gladly pay for that expansion which adds an all new campaign and many new factions, troops and so on.) The naval combat gets cannons and armor. Artillery and guns on land is a nice retreat from melee and archers. There is something very fascinating with line fire combat. 

Sieging castles feels a bit awkward at times and sometimes the AI won't surrender when they should. I had an enemy army of 2000+ down to its last 20 men and they wouldn't run away. Other times they run away before getting close, a few arty shells into their ranks and the entire army flees. 

It is good fun, my hours speak for themselves, I have beaten all three campaigns with nearly all the factions. I have played online, fought the historical battles and even tested my computer by pitting armies of 10's of thousands against each other...this game is solid.

The battles in Rome II are allegedly tweaked to make them more ""decisive"", but what's the point when you can overrun your enemy witth stacks and stacks of high-end units? In this game you have to balance the garrison troop and the field troop, which limits your ability to concentrate a large enough army to effectively human wave your enemies to death or risk losing a chain of castles by a backstabbing ""Ally"".
Also, the family tree system and the councils system. Who wouldn't want a general with a crucial 10% bonus to movement range with a post in the council? Who wouldn't want a joint father & son campaign which adds to the immersion?
The economy system is certainly the best because you do not simply take hold of a lot of provinces and get a lot of money. Managing trade nodes, protecting your trade routes from bandit, rebels enemies forces... you name it

7,11254111,english,"Total War: Shogun 2 is, in my opinion, the best game in the total war series. The game has a very great ""arts"" tree system, which can allow you to mold your clan based upon certain attributes and strategies; not to mention the building tree system and the clan's bonus's system which allow for even more specialization of a clan.

I love the setting, fuedal japan creates one of the most war-filled yet somehow peaceful settings that one could possibly choose. The family tree system makes it all the much better, allowing for you to have some sort of connection with your family and military cabinet; although I have commonly found myself adopting a general who is 10 years or so older than my daimyo.

The fall and rise of the samurai expansions make the game so much better. Taking place in the other two most violent and fractured civil wars the island of Japan has endured. 

Now, here's something that I've seen a lot of people have a problem with: Multiplayer.
I see no problems with multiplayer other than the fact that the gempei lords seem to be under the same category as the sengoku lords, even though they're further apart from eachother than the Sengoku Jidai (Main campaign) and the Boshin War (Fall of the Samurai) by about 300 years. My other complaint is that it allows you to pit a FOTS and a Shogun 2 army against eachother, making a clear disadvantage for the Shogun 2 army if the FOTS army simply uses guns and cavalry, effectively allowing people with FOTS to check the ""Mixed Avatars"" button and suddenly be able to grind points off of someone who has technology that is 200-700 years older.
Other than those problems, multiplayer is amazing. Build up an army of your liking, and then pit yourself against a random opponent who does exactly the same thing. When the battle starts, it's a battle of wit and a battle of who can make the most effective army based upon their favorite unit type and strategy (It's all about those polearms, baby.). Ocasionaly, your oponent will have the upper hand (You rely on cavalry? Well, the enemy uses yari. You rely on yari? Well the enemy has swords. You rely on swords? Well, the enemy uses cavalry/naginata.) which doens't really assure victory for them; instead, it makes combat more exciting becuase suddenly you have to use only strategy to take your enemy down with your now obsolete frontal assault units; distract and charge enemy cavalry with swords, use spears to create a deadly to charge wall around your archers, flank spearman with your cavalry while your archers fight them close up with swords; there's always a way to victory.

Never played a Total War game? Shogun 2 is definitely worth checking out. If you're a fan of other strategy games like Civilization, Risk, or even games like Rise of Nations or AOE, I'm willing to bet you'll quickly become enthralled Shogun 2's conquest of feudal Japan. Although the game is a bit complex, within moments of starting your first campaign you'll be introduced to your own advisor who will guide you through the world of Shogun 2. By the time you destroy your first enemy army and capture their city, you'll be hooked.

Pros:
Graphically looks wonderful. The rain effects on soldiers are wonderful, and the 1 v 1 skirmishes, while restrictive to looking like a duel between gentlemen, look great in action.

45,11051878,english,"After 2010's Napoleon Total War we return to the land of the rising sun in ""Total War:Shogun 2"".

In this game we play in Japan that is made of fragments in goal to be the next Shogun.
The creators decided to leave the gunpowder behind and enter the era that started the Total war series without sacrificing game mechanics or pure entarteinmant.

Total war Shogun 2 is a fusion of real time strategy and turn base strategy,player take place as a clan leader and general,alterning between the empire managment and develop armys each turn and the real time battles where the player take control of a real time battle on a 3D battlefield.

With the tutorial and the campaign players will be able to play some historical battles aswell as custom battles.
In the campaign mode players will be able to pick one of nine clans and another one that is included in the speical and collectors edition each with its straights,weakness and diffculty level,players will be able to choose from short,long and domination campaigns depending how long you want your game to last.

In the game the player oversees the development of settlements,millitary production economic and technological advancement and unlike the last total war games where all the economic buildings were scattered around the area in Shogun 2 you can manange everything from the region capital,its much easier to manage your city without looking for the building of each village on the map,instead it scattered in the map but can be controller in the main city of that area in the detailed campaign map.

players will be able to engadge in diplomcay,political menuvers and speical agents to get the upper hand, There are ninjas that can assassinate generals,monks that can turn enemy soldiers to your soldiers,a speical agent that can kill other agents,the game adds a mini CGI to show the agents performing their jobs.

A huge add to the game is RPG bits,every general,unit and agent have their own personality,Generals and agents have speical skills that gives them speical abilitys,players will be able to unlock new and speical abilitys as the level up and gain experience,players will have to put their generals and famliy members in different positions in order to keep them loyal,you can exchange them for hostiles or even arrange marriage with other fuctions for millitary alliances,allowing players to use more famliy members much more.

The battles of Shogun 2 involves large scale clashes between armys that meet in 3D battlefield based on the place they met in the campaign map,on the beginning of battles players will notice that the opening speeches have returned aswell as wait for a change of the weather to send out the troops,sieges are different in this game,there are few objective points spreaded around the battlefield that give unique boosts during the battle,instead of the Europian forts we see now Asian castles with few tears so the focus of siege battles put less focus on wall defenses and more focus on battles within the castle and when you capture the castle a 2 minute clock will begin and if the time ends you will win.

Players will be able to play navy battles again with unique Japanese ships resembling floating castles with are mainly powered with men rather than wind,there are some cannons but most sea battles relay on boarding on enemy vessels and shooting fire arrows,also,the game provide new mechanics like shallow water that can give advantage for shorter boats.

Shogun 2 recived a welcome overhole in the multiplayer elements,it features battles with 8 players and a multiplayer campaign involving competitive and coopertive mode with 2 players,in the multiplayer campaign players can be grouped in different clans so for each clan a player assume the role of the clan leader and the others take command of the army,the clan leader has the ability to direct other players and assign the rewards based on loyaltiy and performance,intruducing clan politics into multiplayer.

If there is one word to describe Shogun 2 it would be: Amazing
Everything from the charcters to the units,stunning envirements,campaign map and the Japanese traditional backround music show how much effort CA puted into making this one of the best Total war games of all time,even through no many people dont know about that time in history who doesnt like Samurais,ninjas and classic hand to hand sword fights?
With the great grapics,fights,AI and multiplayer Shogun 2 is a high point for the Series.

Just having a monster army doesn't cut it here.....if you're a dodgy general or your troops are poorly trained and armoured it's still possible to loose to a superior general with less but more experienced troops. I loved the use of the imfamous Japanese 'dirty tricks' buffet......ninjas, gesha and the like. I found using these assets were ever possible really gave another dimension to the game.....nothing like using a monk to start a revolt in an ally's territory, thus being able to take the province without breaking protocol....and protocol, diplomacy really works nicely in the game and has importance. Geshas are great for seducing enemy generals....I always go for the 'son and heir'....that's gotta hurt ! So there's many ways to take territory......many ways to skin rabbit. 

   Japanese military history is one of the very few scenarios were all the generals have more or less the same tech and training levels available to them. If you win a battle in Shogun it's generally because you've out stratigised the other guy....not because you've got the ability to call and airstrike while your opponent only has bows in return. One of the only other parts of history were both sides have much the same kit available is the American Civil War.....fitting that an extension has been created for Shogun......much the same parameter odds : Now with the addition of ROTS and FOTS an gamer can immerse themselves from the beginning to the end of what was once a proud and beautiful part of human history.

56,10988577,english,"This is an awesome game. However, here are some tips to give you the full experience:

Get good sound system, preferably head phones, with great bass and depth. I swear I can feel an earthquake whenever I start a three thousand man charge and my enemy initiates a charge of the same scale.

1080p is not bad, but I imagine a 4k monitor would be so much more noticable on a game like this compared to a FPS or RPG. Frankly, this is one of the few games where a 16k monitor would be worth the investment. Obviously, this is expensive and not necessary, I'm just making the point that in a battle involving 14000 men, it would be nice to see the whole battlefield

The AI is both incredibly smart and very stupid at the same time. For instance, during naval battles, if I was severely outmanned, I could play ring around the rosey around an island and watch their ships get caught on the island, where I can pick off the single ship that managed to keep up with me. On the other hand, and this really amazed me, the AI reciprocated this tactic against me. I had attacked an enemy fleet with brute force as I had an equal or superior fleet, and I set ablaze or otherwise forced surrender of all but one enemy ship. This ship then literally kited ME and very nearly picked off 2 or 3 of my ships. All the while, I was chasing him expecting him to make some stupid illogical AI mistake, and it never came. I noticed he was circling and it seemed he was not about to make a mistake, so I sent a ship infront of his path. They collided and he lost all his momentum, and then I was able to box him in and finally kill him.

The large scale land AI seems to be fine and doesn't act very different than I would. They tend to put archers on hills, and even try to redirect my melee force and make pockets where calvary is to be sent in to crush my archers. However, they tend to be impatient if they are on the offensive and put themselves in chokes that I've set up with the land around my armies. I don't suppose there was any way around that though, that was the only way to get to me and as my archers were at higher elevation he couldn't pick me off with his archers

Small scale AI, as in a unit by unit basis, could have room for upgrading.

It has very well done animations in combat, the atmosphere is well done, it has some nice attention to detail...but all past TW games allready had this and were MUCH better. Creative Assembly is doing worse each new game they do. Rome Total War 2 being the most clear example.

Shogun 2 has one big problem in my opinion. Its way too hard. Unless you do things in a strict order and following advices from other players, you will end up screwed. This leads to a repetitive play style were you cant try new stuff or play in different ways, like Medieval 2 (my personal favourite) allowed you. Make a mistake, and youll pay for it...a lot. The realm divided feature is the most stupid TW feature ive seen to date. It basically punishes you too soon and too fast for becoming strong. Once you become famous, prepare to be assaulted by ALL the other nations in an attrition war were youll end loosing (unless you have followed the ""meta"" way of doing things) due to how the AI ""cheats"" creating full armies and besieging you with agents. (You cant counter agents from other 10 nations at the same time). Even on EASY mode its hard as hell if you dont follow the same paths people suggest to win. Battles are also too fast. I suggest you get some mods to slow down units.

This is the best total war, its only problem being that I do not like the time period. But it is still my favorite total war. This was done 6/25/2014, and Ihave played every total war except shogun 1(top 3 for me are shogun 2 >medieval 2(pretty bad UI,great systems) > rome(combat is probably more varied in rome but shogun has good combat/amazing campaign).


NOTE: both expansions have the same issues and strengths of standard shogun unless noted otherwise

=<Standard Shogun 2>=
Set in feudal japan, nations use the same basic units but it really doesnt feel old because of the flavor your generals, agents, and just overall setting. Graphics are great, sound is great, game engine makes melee combat look good(unlike in rome 2, I think the lack of shield combat makes it work)


+Agents are interesting and insightful,and have a great upgrade system
+Good mix of siege and open field battles
+combat units stick to a ""Type > slight bonus"" style of variation, meaning it is pretty easy to tell who is good against what, and still have enjoyable special units(hero units, national specialties)
+All units are useful the whole game- yari ashigeru can win you 
+Good choice of teams for COOP(I played with the DLC though)
+AI is best in series(only in sieges can it wig out and be dumb, otherwise it is all legitimate moves)
+diplomacy is reasonably fleshed out daimyo honor system is really cool
+flavor. Everyone has flavor- your daimyo has a particular style, agents are easy to get attached to
+ lots of interesting tactical choices, and the map is small enough that conquering 4 or 5 provinces is a big deal.
+ bug free! Just dont try and do anything on your buddies turn(you can read tooltips and stats, but dont change policies on anything)

- loading times, still pretty nasty- turn timers are fine though.
- AI is reasonably derpy in sieges, but works great on open maps
-Game engine(warscape) handles only single combat and all animations are between 2 people.
-I dont like samurai, its a personal preference



=<Rise of the Samurai>= A campaign set at the rise of the samurai(WHAT A TWIST!) where early game is mostly filthy peasants running around, and late game everyone is a samurai archer- I thought it was okay(has some good mods) but it was my least favorite of the 3 campaigns due to the lack of national choices(3 teams). 

+made for 2 player coop(3 choices for ""teams"")
+3 team choices means that you are guaranteed to have giant wars with them


- I did not like the progression of the units: you go from arrows being great because nobody can field more than 1 or 2 armored samurai, to entire stacks where you have just samurai, because why not.
- 3 team choices feel very similar, not so great replay value


=<Fall of the Samurai>=
Starts with petty muskets and ends with mightly rifled barrels for your sharpshooters. This is my favorite way to play shogun as it actually gives me something the game engine is good at, as well as something we barely ever see in other games: line battles! Other than total war and mount and blade, I cant think of any good musket era games(paradox games dont count; unrelated genre). 


+Warscape engine made for ranged combat, looks great
+boat combat is actually fun and navies are interesting
+Artillery in first person is just peachy
+great balance between muskets and melee: early guns are terrible and yari ashigeru can walk right through it
+tech tree provides unit progression on both sides of the tree! madness!

-Choices for nation are very ho hum, you essentially pick ""the left side"" or ""the right side"". This makes coop kind of bleuarg for starting area choices.
-maybe too many siege battles? could be personal preference/playstyle though




=<Final thoughts>=
No matter which of these three you get(skip Rise unless thats your cup of tea), you are getting the best of total war. Shogun 2 on the whole has an interesting campaign that the AI can challenge you in(agents, province build choices, diplomacy), battles have AI that works! looks great and still has a lot of tactical positioning. And along with the classic total wars, Shogun 2 has the feeling of being attached to your nation: the daimyo honor system combined with actual diplomacy, fleshed out traits and family tree, general somber/serious tone, and visual differences between all factions really makes me(someone who does not like honor and samurai and cherry blossoms) really get into the game.

[b] Pros [/b]

+ Graphics: Shogun 2's graphics are only beaten by Rome 2's, and only by a tiny margin. The animations, the effects, and the environment all serve to further the immersion.

+ Replayability: Even when you finish the grand campaign, you can still do more. With ten clans to choose from, you can easily play another fun campaign.

+ Mods: Even if the vanilla game becomes boring, you can use mods to enhance your game. From maps to more provinces, there are tons of mods out there.

[b]Cons[/b]

- AI: The AI is lacking in some respects. If it can't beat you, it will just spawn another full stack army and come after you.

91,10560279,english,"Total War Shogun 2 in its vanilla mode and on its single player campaign to be a very well made game with its own annoyances. 

What I enjoyed most of all was its setting during the period and invited me to look up and read up on it. But it does encourage your own path given its strategic value. The building maitenance in this game as you gain more territory is pretty well thought of and developed. The economy is also based on this, trade with allied clans, and resources. Which in my view makes your military might that much better. The units of said military are pretty nuanced in their own right and each army requires their own needs and balance. Melee, spears, archers, cavalry, and sometimes seige engines. This takes me to combat out in the field in Japan. Hills, rivers, and so on so forth create advantages and such as does the weather but this adds another dimension to the tactical field and strategy depending on the army you face. Seiging the towns are quite fun and requires a bit more developed and fine tuned mode of doing things. Next comes the non-military units like ninjas, Metsuke, and Monks. These come in some of the better uses such as Ninjas and Metsukes to cripple enemy armies and halt them buying you time to form up and get ready.. Agents actually do something very valuable here. Graphics in this game is highly detailed on my machine and does look very beautiful and as good as it can be. Helping immersion.. 

The things I felt indifferent about were not many in this game except for one thing.. That one thing being Naval Combat. Naval Combat I felt was just plainly something I had to do and could easily just auto-resolve. It is deeper than some I have played in other strategy games. But still I felt meh about it.. 

The two things I felt were a bit baffling were the AI and Diplomacy.. I have heard that these two things were pretty consistent problems in the Total War Franchise. I too have noticed them and took advantage of it when it cropped up. But it did kill the immersion I had when for instance I was backed into a corner and screwed up the finishing blow did not come in immediately and I was saved by my previous actions dragging back up in.. Diplomacy is always a curious thing and it behaves like a sort of crazed luny.. But there is a mod fix that makes it better to a degree. 

Overall I say as a Total War noob and a Strategy Game casual player pick it up.. The time period is interesting, the immersion is good enough until the AI acts odd. Economics is good and well done and combat is well done as well..",1403261725,1403261725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198093831543,53,7,23977,0,14286,1553731252,,

It has decent graphics, meh AI, a great UI, cool mechanics, awesome clans and much more! However, the diplomacy is pretty damn bad (at least for a beginner like me). Even with a moderate chance of success for an agreement, the other clan will ALWAYS say no (At least they did for me) or will want you to give them thousands of koku for a fucking trade agreement! WTF is up with that? Not only this but once you capture a single province (just one), TONS of clans will start declaring war on you for no fricking reason! And get this! Every time another clan breaks relations or an agreement with you, it makes other clans hate YOU instead for ""not respecting agreements"" or other similar BS. Vassals are a pain in the ass and are the biggest backstabbers on the planet, and allies BARELY help you with wars and they just sit on their ass and watch as doomstacks of 20+ units from  5 different clans steamroll my fucking provinces until it's game over! Also, Multiplayer's a bore since I can never win 'cause everyone is a 10+ star player with annoying-as-hell Roman names such as Mark Antony, etc.

On a lighter note, this game has lots of detail, the battles are awesome when 2000 men aren't unfairly attacking you, I like the natural beauty of the game, and I really love the dlc such as Rise of the Samurai and I love the quasi-realistic mechanics of  Shogun 2 and the Mastery of Arts.

41,10257561,english,"If there is ONE game every PC owner must have, the flag bearer of the PC as a platform, no experience is better than Total War: Shogun II. The scale, detail, and strategic and world buidling content is without equal. 

Our story is set in Feudal Japan, during the 'Sengoku Jidai' or 'Age of the Warring Country' period, during the 16th century. Western trade (and weapons) have found Japan. Long story short, the old Ashikaga Shogunate (Military leader, serving the figurehead emperor) has grown lax, and varous clans start to rebel, plunging all of Japan into all out Total War. In this time period you can: 
a) fight various historical battles with set unti types and sizes, attempting to relive history as it was fought.
b) Fight other players in multiplayer modes, utlilizing the vast array of units
c) (most importantly) Take the place of one of the warring clans, and conquer Japan through diplomacy, sabatoge, and war.

In this single player campaign, you choose one of the almighty clans, and attempt to take control of the captiol, Kyoto, and install yourself as Shogunate. You must fight your way there, of course. Each clan has bonuses, from the Chosokabe's elite archer, to the Hattori's deadly ninja. Regardless, you must ally with or defeat all, and march on the capitol yourself. That shall be a very long and difficult road, however. (Seriously though, this game is HARD. Even on easy, I've only beat it once out of the 3 campaigns I've played. The AI is intelligent and ruthless.)

Step one, research various Bushido and Chi arts, to master your military tactics and unit variety, as well as stabilize your economy, agriculture, and religous practices. Christian (gunpowder units) or Buhdist (elite warrior monks)? Bettter build some naval forces, because trade with the West and Asian mainland brings unheard-of wealth. Your capitol could use some new roads and farms, and maybe a Sake den as well to get some of those elusive Ninja, or heaven forbid a Geisha. Diplomacy helps too, from establishing inland trade routes, creating tight-knit military alliances, or simply extorting money from weaker clans. That enemy Monk is getting annoying, I do believe that Geisha you found earlier should... End his preaching. (And watch a nail-biting mini-movie that determines your success too!) Didn't honor the gods, and the goddamn volcano erupted again. Crap, Buhdist revolt, Wakko pirates attacking shipping routes, ninja assassinated your son, mass hunger in your capitol, and the Shogun decided you're a threat after all, massive 20,000 man army of Samauri knocking on your gates!

Fans of civlization will be right at home, as Shogun features complex management of your clan, Military and cultural research, complex economies, and diplomacy. The game cannot be won through cultural or scientific victories, but Muskets and badass Shinto-Buhdist Naginata warrior monks sure help. Manage taxes and marriages, religoin and public order, trade and expansion. But this isn't civlization with a japanese cover, oh no. 

You see, this is Total War for a reason. For instead of sending 3 attack 4 defense crossbowmen againt 2 attack 1 defense barbarians, you must defeat the enemy general on a Real Time Strategic battlefield. Remeber those Naginata Warrior Monks that you bought? Time to put them to use. You assault the enemy general at night, to prevent reinforcements from his nearby city. 500 spear weilding monks, advance under the 'guard up' order, sneaking through the forests supported by lethal Chosokabe bow samaurai. A warhorn sounds, the enemy have spotted you! Columns of enemy Samauri shout bone-shivering warcrys, and charge into your columns of spearmen, in a fearsome Banzai charge. Your monks raise spears, and you zoom in close. Beautifully modeled individual soldiers run to their deaths, shouting and waving their swords. Waves of infantry crush against your spears, eventually forcing themselves in between, and the enemy begin to hack and slash their way to your monks, exceuting them in fully motion captured duels. But the Shinto buhdists refuse to break, and their morale remains high. The supporting archers let lose with fire arrows, lighitng the night sky, and sizzling down to the opposing mobs of men, burning whoever they hit. The lines remain locked in furious melee. Another horn sounds. They enemy have fallen for your trap! From behind, triangles of heavy horse smash into the enemy Samauri, sending men flying, jostling the remaining into the spears of your monks. What follows is slaughter. The enemy die bravely, but all fall one-by-one. You take the city the next day, and put it to the torch. You have lost too many men for too little. 

Only in Total War can you go from managing a city, to fighting in a brutal close up battle, hour to hour. Engagements are dependant on terrain, season, and have weather effects. (Attack a city in the winter, and guess where you are going to be fighting.) On the field, you must manage formations, unit types (swords beat spears, calvary have great charges, ect) and morale. Unit abilities like the Yari Ashigaru's spear wall, Chosokabe bowmen's fire arrows, and No Dachi's banzai spice combat up.

So how's it run? Beautifully. The campaign map is charmingly scaled, and quite well textured. The japanese art style is very unique, and very eye pleasing, truly immersing you in various grave edicts. On the field, unit detail even down to the single man is astounding. You can see rain running down armour, men breathing heavily, and the blood coating your generals sword. The battlefield terrain is again, well textured, with various buidling dotting the landscape, changing the flow of battle. Unit clashes are heavy and powerful, and sword clangs and battle cries very well recorded. And just too top it off, a superb and appropiately mournful and heroic japanese score immerses you even more. Be warned, Shogun II is VERY CPU intenisve, as each solider is his own AI. With upwards of 1000 men in 'small battles', you'll be needing a monster rig to run this beast at ultra. Luckily, unit sizes can be reduced, and even at medium, the game is still quite beautiful. 

So in the end, you get a masterpiece with incredible art and musical assets, slick and authentic presentation, incredible detail, mind blowing real time battles, and an addictive economy and empire management. At the forefront of the library of games that show 'what a PC can really do'; Lies Total War; Shogun II. Absolute reccomendation.

57,10186258,english,"Total war Shogun 2 is a beautiful strategy game that really allows the player to be immersed in what is one of the most overlooked periods in ancient history. Shogun envelopes you into 16th century Japan and challenges you to control some of the strongest families during the Sengoku jidai or age of war. The challenge that is posed against you is to overthrow the shogunate who has betrayed your family , therefore striking you to pursue unifying and controling Japan. With the highly acclaimed single player which contains the Civilisation style turn based gameplay to the real time strategy from the likes of Command & Conquer and competetive multiplayer, you will never be stuck with nothing to do. 

The multiplayer incorporates a unique personal avatar system that was introduced in Napoleon total war and has been reworked, adapted and enhanced within the newest total war title. The user has an avatar which can be created and edited from the start of the multiplayer experience. Throughout the multiplayer battles and through gaining single player acheivements new items for your general can be unlocked to make your leader dominate the battlefield with his new shiny greaves . Upon winning matches you start to conquer the area's of Japan, allowing for seperate unlocks to units and retainers (buff cards) which gives the multiplayer some replayability and continuinity.

80,10068088,english,"It always bugged me how in some past Total War games (Medieval, Medieval II, Empire, Rome) the enemy had a habit of cowering behind the walls. They thought their puny walls would keep me out. They were mistaken. But there was so much I thought got lost in siege after siege after siege. The only times I really would find armies out and about is if they were headed someplace. Maybe they were going to a new home, maybe they were coming to die in front of one of my castles. And a lot of times the stacks were small, more like skirmishes than epic confrontations. This has not been my experience in Shogun 2. The Samurai do not hide. The Samurai wait in the field for you to present yourself for murder. Not only do they wait in the field, but they all wait there. I've found that most wars I have with clans are one battle affairs. They throw everything they got at me, so I throw everything I got at them. Winner take all. Sure, there's some small garrisons to deal with but if you break a clan's main force, you've broken the clan.

I like this a lot. It seems far more epic than drawn out struggles. I've found the politics to be more satisfying than previous games, and the land battles to be the best of the series (note, I haven't played Rome II).

If I have a gripe, and I do, I hate the sieges in Shogun 2. Attacking is no problem, but when you're defending the AI gets all wonky and wierd. I dread having to defend castles, so sometimes I just don't bother. If the enemy wants it they can have it, but my Daimyo is coming just over the hill to wreck their whole world presently.

On the whole, I recommend it. It has a glaring annoyance for me but that's not enough to put me off the game because the rest of it is as close to perfect as I've seen Total War get.",1399695884,1399695884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198009388216,143,6,1706,0,1706,1399515796,,

Pro: research allows you to focus on economy or improved warriors, trade better, better diplomacy, good challenge,  good cinimatics,  good battles.

Con: feels stressed for time,  buildings consume food which is bad as you have to choose between better defence and buildings and ballance with farms, the cities just feel less personal as you don't go from 2000->6000->12000->24000 people in a city to get better stuff so the cities are not as good and you care less about them since you don't have to work as much to upgrade them in terms of waiting for the population to grow. In rome and medieval2 you can get a really great city with lots of buildings that you can zoom in on and say ""that is a awesome city lets see what the maxed out buildings look like"" but not as much here becasue of limits.

87,10054203,english,"The Shogun games are the odd members of the Total War series for me - I was first exposed to the series with the first Medieval, and never played the original Shogun. Furthermore, I'm much more familiar with the history of Europe/Northern Africa/Asia Minor than I am with Japan, so coming to this game with familiarity with the mechanics but less familiarity with the history it was based upon, in many ways the game just didn't seem to *click* with me.

Like all Total War games, there is a split between a turn-based strategic campaign map and a real-time strategic battle map. Each turn is one season of a year, with each season having different benefits to various aspects (happiness, recruitment, etc). I thought this was a nice touch, and was pleased when it got patched into the next game in the series, as well. Rather than straight stat improvements, generals and special characters have ability trees that you unlock as they level up, which allowed for fun specialization of those units.

Beyond that, I'm not really sure what all to say - it is a mechanically sound and nice looking game. I like how the map looks when it hasn't been revealed yet. I enjoyed myself playing it even if some of the changes (how units can invade during sieges, for example) were choices that I would have made. Ultimately, though, I realized that a lot of the fun which comes from these sort of strategic games is the investment which you yourself are able to put in, and without the historical knowledge to serve as a base, I simply found myself far less interested in the games and their outcome than when I played other games in the series.

90,2524367,english,"Epic Total War-ness.
Pro's: 
1. Better AI (though not so in Fall of the Samuri), esspecially in the campaign. The BAI can be a bit dull at times but if you play on Legendary they'll skillfully wipe the floor with you. I'm not kidding: this is probably the only Total War game I've acctually LOST A CAMPAIGN in. For Total War Vetrans, that's not just a challenge, it's a massive humbler as well: BRING IT ON IKKO IKKI!!!!!!
2. Sea Battles: Not as hard to control as in Empire, but not as dumbed-down as Rome 2. Epic effects (particularly in Fall of the Samuri), the ability to sail in inland bays, bombardments of coastal cities, and MINES (!!!!) combine to create something truly amazing. 
3. Graphics: As always a Total War staple, but epic all the same. 
4. Really Awesome Ninja Duels: The absolute pinnacle of Total War theatrics: watch ninja's drop from trees, come out of nowhere, throw grenades, plead for mercy, get run down by Samuri.... Once again: if you've played Total War, you know what I'm talking about. 
5. Funny Cutscenes. 
6. Multiplayer: Campaigns and such acctually work now, the ""conquest"" mode is quite addictive (allowing the customization of unit skins, abilities, and all that...), and ussually lag is absent from the equation unless you get some idiot running with wi-fi (unlike the horror of Napoleon multiplayer, desyncs are rare and stuttering rarer). 
7. Bigger battles: though unit sizes and army caps remain still the same, you can now command up to 40 units (a ""large army"") on the battlefield. 
8. Realm Divides provide a welcome challenge. I, unlike other TW players, welcome their ferocity, though they may be a con to you, I'm not really sure, I personally consider them one of the more brilliant features of the game, providing for some really interesting gameplay just as you're about to fall into that ""rolling ball"" of conquest which so desperatly lessens interest in other TW games. 
9. steam workshop: maps n' mods galore, though I haven't yet figured out how to use the TED editor. 
10. Rise of the Samuri and Fall of the Samuri provide welcome unit variation, but for a price, which is one of the cons. 
11. More aggressive CAI: true, this is kind of covered under the ""AI"" section, but passive CAI was so much of a problem in previous TW'S, I feel it merit's it's own number. CAI will now conquer at the pace of the player or faster, esspecially religious fanatics like the Ikko Ikki, who litterally terrorize Japan, including the player, into submission. Try playing as the Hattori on Legendary, you'll see what I mean. 
Cons: 
1. Not much unit/faction variety: though the map is large, multicoloured etc., there really is no variety to the men you're facing. Sure there's plenty of units per faction, but every other faction has the SAME units, aside from a few specialized ones. Not exactly a detterent if you look at the number of hours I've spent at this, though it does contribute to a bit of strategic boardom as the game lacks the traditional encounter with new cultures as your faction expands. 
2. Terrible Fall of the Samuri AI: just as a prequisite, that DLC is well worth it, if only for the myraid of Civil war maps and the multiplayer, as well as one or two epic campaigns. Other than that, you'll soon find out that the standalone expansion has some of the worst AI in Total War history. Though not bad in it's own right (it's tactics are essentially the same as Shogun 2, which has a damn good AI), FOTS enemies tend to Banzai charge in a style that would have been terribly effective in Shogun 2 but, aside from the occasional well-placed Cavalry charge, leads only to friendly fire and certain death in the 1860's environment of the expansion. 
3. Diplomacy: though much improved from games like Medieval 2 (where this action was essentially useless), Shogun 2 diplomacy still needs work. Though an ally will declare war (manditorily) on your enemies, they will seldom acctually help you, and more often than not betray you. Playing this last weekend, I acctually found myself missing the ""non-aggression pact"" and ""set alliance target"" options of Rome 2. However, Diplomacy isn't neccesarily worse than in Shogun 2's predeccessors, it's just not much of an improvement either, which is kind of a dissapointment. 
OVERALL: 
A brilliant enstallment to the Total War series and definetly worth it. Addictive, fun, and challenging, (as well as eye-popping), the flaws of this game are easily ignored as you trample your enemies from the annals of history.

10,2511939,english,"Total War's most focused (or limited) game sees the series come full circle from the first Shogun. In terms of personal preference, this game is somehow the most balanced in the series whilst also being the least enjoyable. The small unit roster, whilst accurate, leads to repetitive gameplay, and the lack of diversity between factions means the game can get dull. However, the solid battles, wonderful design scheme, and engaging core gameplay mechanics make for a decent game. 

The Fall of the Samurai Expansion pack, on the other hand, is the most fun thing Creative Assembly have released. The unit roster is diverse, thanks to influence of Western Military advisers, which leads unusual units as well as ironclad dreadnoughts.  Naval artillery and the addition of controllable Gatling guns completely revolutionise the Total War battle system, being some of the most entertaining features ever placed into a strategy game. Railways increase the speed of armies when navigating the limited topography of Japan. This game also has the best multiplayer put into a Total War game. 

Overall, a focused effort in distilling the turn based genre into its core elements that is in the end let down by a niche and uninspiring era. Fall of the Samurai, however, highlights some fascinating pointers as to how strategy games could portray the modern era.

14,9954087,english,"Strategy - The game play is one of the most satisfying strategy games i have played. this game will keep you thinking at night on how to repel the enemy invasion or how to attck the enemy efficiently. or trying to get that vital alliance to intimidate the lower powers from attacking you all at once. 

Map- the map is turn based, you can build buildings like sword schools, forts tenples etc. to give your army espesific units, or a fort to change the ties of battle. you will manage your army movements and handle diplomacy within your turn. you can do as much of this as you want or not want to do.

Battles - the battles are incredibly addicting. they can be fast paced or very relaxed and slow, you can pause the battle any time to think or do everything real time. challenging yourself to make a quick decition. seeing the actual army fight in there is amaizing. the animations are very well done. i reall recommend the blood dlc. adds a little more of animations and realism in my opinion.


The cons - im being picky with them. but i have to say them also.

The diplomacy can be very derpy sometimes. you can have your enemy outnumbered 5 to 1 and offer them peace so they are not all slaughtered but it doesn't matter to them they will suicide march to you to die.

and small ai loops that can be easily broken by giving them a command.

PROS
 
-Amaizing strategy
-Great combat
-Beautiful and detailed polish
-Map gameplay

CONS

-Derpy diplomacy
-Minor AI loops

It was really a turning point in my gaming career, and not only in that.
It was the time where my interest in japanese history, especially the Sengoku Jidai period,  
was beginning to grow....and i was also looking for something fresh in the RTS genre beyond
Blizzard's Warcraft serie which was the start of my pc gaming period.

And i wasn't disappointed: Shogun Total War was really the beginning of a new generation of
RTS games which i've followed and loved up to recent times. And i was thrilled and excited
when i heard about CA's decision to create a remake of the first chapter in the saga.

Shogun 2 Total War is exactly what i was expecting: a re-imagination of the old Shogun TW
plus the gameplay, graphical, UI and tactical improvements developed during almost a decade
of new installments.
Not only we have back almost everything that made the first chapter great....but Shogun 2
also managed to improve what, due to technical limitations, was impossible to do at the time:
adding new minor and major clans (in the first TW there were only eight), new provinces while
at the same time ""nerfing"" those agent units like the geisha who were game-breaking overpowered.

After the ""debacle"" of Rome 2... i think Shogun 2 will remain the symbol of what TW really meant
for me and for the older fans of the serie.... and also one of the most solid RTS of recent times.

Leading thousands (THOUSANDS) of men into battle and watching them flow over and around obstacles while they fearlessly charge into certain death has never been so inspiring in a video game! From an economic standpoint, the campaign is complex. One season you may be prosperous, in the next a neighboring province sacked your farm land, blockaded your ports and cut off your trade! In the blink of an eye your certain victory can become a defeat! Any one can lead soldiers, but paying them, repairing their equipment and replenishing the ranks cost money!

Creative Assembly revisits the Sengoku period of Japan with Shogun 2: Total War. The game feels like an extension of their previous title Napoleon: Total War with the faster paced movement, morale effects, and some AI elements, but in the end delivers a fresh new Total War game you’d be more than happy to sink your teeth into.


Gameplay

The heavy focus on melee troops will kind of throw you off if you have been playing a lot of Empire/Napoleon, but the same rock/paper/scissors tactics will apply here. Typically there are three types of units you’ll see in a battle. Spear/Sword units who do all of your fighting, Ranged/Archer units for supporting your battle lines, and Cavalry units that can flank and take care of the supporting units behind the front lines. These types of units are then broken down into quality (Ashigaru or Samurai), and unique versions (Matchlock, Cannons, Bow Cav, etc). Combined with a standard set of battle maps to play on and plenty of castle sieging, things will start to look and feel the same after your initial play through of a short campaign.

Sieging in this game is also handled differently. Do you know how Japanese people got past a Castle’s walls in the 16th century? Ladders? No. Grappling Hooks? Nope. Siege Towers? Uh-uh. They scaled the walls with their bare hands and climbed that shit like a man. All units are able to scale the walls. Troop disposition and location of attack is more important here since your men will suffer casualties getting to the wall (archers), climbing up the wall (falling off), and then fighting garrisoned forces inside. Burning down a door presents a more direct way of getting inside, but also a nasty choke point for the defenders to trap you in. Also, Castles can be upgraded to provide more tiers of walls to go through, elevation changes, little moats with a handful of places to ford across and Towers to help fend off attackers.

Castle Sieging brings out a fault of this game early on, since there’s only one battle map per Castle tier. So if you fight a Tier 1 castle in one province and then go next door and siege another Tier 1 castle, they will look exactly the same. Standard battle maps are also limited in selection and you will start to recognize them early on. This is kind of disappointing since this has been an issue in the past games. You think they would introduce some sort of map generator/randomizer by now.

Elevation plays more of a factor now since units charging uphill not only move slower, but suffer a penalty to attack doing so. This means battles are mostly focused around or on top of a defensible hill. Shock units (units with a high charge value) are also more effective in this game, able to decimate and route units within seconds in some situations. Battles play out faster so you’ll have to adjust your lines quickly and use your General frequently to provide morale boosts. Babysitting troops will make it hard to watch the awesome new highly detailed units and brutal fighting animations.

The naval stuff isn’t as good as the old Empire or Napoleon ship battles, mostly because you’ll be fighting with arrows. Essentially, there are boarding ships with a greater amount of Samurai to board with, Ranged/support boats with faster ships, and unique gunpowder ships that toss grenades and mines. There are a few canon ships in the game and the dreaded “Black Ship” with 60 cannons but it’s mostly just alot of boarding and surrendering, nothing very explosive like a proper 18th century ship battle. Not exactly a fault of the game, just the time period.     
   

Graphics

Speaking of which, the graphics engine is reminiscent of Napoleon: Total War. There are prettier fire and smoke effects, but the big push was made in the detailed units and fighting animations. You can see units intricate armor and weapons they’re equipped with. The fighting animations are exciting to watch (alot of dudes get stabbed through the face). The lighting and shadows are done very well and weather effects do not look cheesy. There are alot of fog effects and clouds sailing through the skies which adds a nice atmosphere to the setting.

The 3D Campaign map with a moveable camera is a welcome addition, but not necessarily needed or useful. Using it just makes me lose orientation of the map, so I hardly bothered rotating the map at all. It was only useful selecting some troops hidden behind some one else’s flag.

Multiplayer

A heavy focus was put into multiplayer for this game as there are plenty of features to choose from, a customizeable and persistent character you can level up with, and best of all, a Co-op Campaign mode! The latter is fully featured and plays out like you would expect, essentially a single player coop with another person. The battles can be fought between you and your partner, you can gift him units on the battlefield to control or if he is the reinforcing army, he will take control of his own forces. There is an adversial campaign mode as well. I experienced a steady flow of glitches and bugs during an online coop relating to the campaign map and not being able to finish my turn, and also not being able to join a coop game at all. I hope that these will eventually get ironed out.

AI

The AI have been improved some since the last Total War game, but you'll still witness the random cavalry unit charge all by itself straight into your lines, awkward unit placement, and little focus on out manuevering your lines or flanking period. I was happy to see that the AI can form proper battle lines for the most part and it is also able to determine the best defensible hill to perch upon. You'll be glad to hear that the General doesn't charge into certain death as much as he used to, but he'll dismount and siege a castle's walls if he is the last unit left for some reason. I guess honor before death right? With that said, the AI has made some noticeable improvements but not all is perfect. Although having the option to have Drop-in battles is nice, it's just an excuse for poor AI to be present in the game. It would be nice to have an AI that would try and flank you every once in awhile.

As far as the Campaign Map goes, the AI does a decent job there as well. Allies are involved more when attacking an enemy, the AI does a good job on moving armies together for support, and also not sending in smaller sized armies to attack you. On the higher difficulty settings there is some noticeable cheating going on with the AI being able to afford lots of Armies even with only a few provinces.

Shogun 2 is a solid release for the franchise, no game breaking bugs, a nice change up in the style of gameplay, and a different setting besides war torn America and Eurasia to fight in. I'm glad they chose to revisit Shogun and implement what they have learned as well as new technology into it. If you're looking for a new Grand Strategy game, give this one a try.

You can make your general into this living samurai buddha on the battlefield becoming your armies most powerful soldier if you dare to gamble and use him so or you can have the clan revere him as a living treasure raising morale, taxes and happiness with just his presence (recommended to use a nice mod to give your generals cooler portraits and its perfect).

Multiplayer is cool, except for when they added Ashigarus (peasants) with swords and now the peasants can overcome the samurai even though samurais should dominate the battlefield.

Some cons with the campaign is that you will have to go through a lot of sieges, every province has a castle and it does get annoying after a while climbing the walls of so many castles.

The battles range from defending castles against sieges, ambushing large armies in forest terrain, and using the cover of night to attack a lesser prepared army, all the way up to having massive armies charging across fields in a head on collision or large navy fleets at war on the sea (the naval combat was much more fun than I was expecting).

Its battle engine and graphics are amazing for the time in which the game was released, and I think they're even better than Rome 2's.

Personally, I`m very attached to this kind of strategy games, from the more simple - but with beautiful storyline - C&C: Red Alert to the later Tiberium Wars. I`ve never played this kind of turned base strategy game until I decided to buy TW: Shogun 2. 
I must say this was a truly good choice: the graphics are spectacular, the story is a little bit ""simple"" for a strategy game (""take command of your clan and make the Daimyo Shogun of Japan"") but I assure you you`ll be very busy trying to make that so! 

I find very interesting that the game truly tries to adapt it`s gameplay to the principles of the Art of War; you`ll have the option of a direct attack with an army, the indirect approach with agents (monks, ninjas, metsukes and the Geisha) and with diplomatic and economics ways to achieve a dominance with your neigbours clans. 

For me this is the closest simulation game you`ll find in the Art of War; every character will gain traits if the are active, passive, with low loyalty, all will be a reflect of your Daimyo`s honour.
There are a few more surprises awaiting for you in the middle of the war (or the diplomatic relationships with other clans), but i just recommend you to try it, explore it for every clan point of view and develop naval a land campaigns more sophisticated with every try.

Total War Shogun 2 is overall, a very solid experience.  This has been my first Total War title and as such, my review is not tainted through the comparison of this game to any of the games in the TW franchise which people tend so frequently to do.  First, I will run through (very briefly) the pro’s and con’s.  I have chosen these based on elements (absent or present) commonly found in most strategy titles.  This should give all your strategy gamers out there a chance to stack this game up against your other strategy titles.  There is also a section of neutrals and warnings.  This section provides elements that could be seen as either pros or cons depending on what you as a player enjoy.  Hope this helps.

-------------------------------------------
PROS
1.	Near seamless blend of turn-based macro management and RTS battle sequences.
2.	AI is relatively advanced and can be extremely challenging on higher difficulties.
3.	Steep learning curve that forces new tactics and strategies with different difficulty settings.
4.	Extremely well detailed environments and unit animations.
5.	Co-operative campaign mode is very enjoyable to play.
6.	Provides a game that feels relatively fresh each play through due to the real time battles
7.	When playing co-operatively, players can “gift” control of units to their partner in real time, allowing both players to share in the battle experiences every time.

------------------------------------
CONS
1.	All of the various clans lack diversity concerning units they create.  Units are the same across all clans, merely receiving bonuses in certain areas depending on the clan that is creating them.
2.	This entire game takes place in Japan, meaning players must play though the same provinces over and over again.
3.	Co-operative campaign only allows a maximum of 2 players to take part (host plus one).
4.	Economic development is fairly limited and rudimentary; lack of depth here
5.	Tactical prowess in real time battles is not as developed as it could be.  Generally, the player with a higher number of units wins the battle, despite geographic location.
6.	Naval battles are a complete snore-fest and not worth the time of actually fighting them.
7.	Some units are nearly worthless or so situational in nature that they can rarely be used effectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------
NEUTRALS AND WARNINGS
1.	This game is EXTREMELY lengthy to play.  One campaign can take days to complete.
2.	Higher difficulty settings seem to border on the absurd.
3.	Drop-in battles can be enabled by the host which will allow other real players to play battles for AI in single player and co-op modes.
4.	Learning curve is steep and new players should take baby-steps when learning this game for the first time.  Play the tutorials, then play a single player campaign on EASY and start with an easy clan like Hattori.

-------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Over all, this is a very enjoyable game for the strategy gamer.  While it blends both RTS and TB styles, it falls short of mastering them both.  The turn-based macro management (economy, unit selection, movement, and trade) falls short of the complexity of games like Civilization, and the real-time battles sometime seem unnecessarily simplistic.  The strength of the game, however, lies in the real time battles which allow the user extreme levels of tactical control much in the style of Company of Heroes.  This serves to keep the game fresh for much longer than would normally be the case.
All in all, this title presents an interesting hybrid of grand-strategy games (Risk, Axis and Allies), turn-based strategy games (Civilization), and real time battle sequencers (Company of Heroes) which is very satisfying to play—just don’t expect all of these elements to be as powerful in sum as they were in part in each of the other titles.",1394318082,1394318127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084529762,170,46,3994,0,3993,1418506284,,

Good game, nice graphics, entertain.

Pros: As all total war series is very fun, and make you stay hours in front of the pc.
Cons: 
There are a lot of technologies that are unable to use because the camaping end before you learn all of them.
After the 3rd campaing it  the same again, even if you change the clan, its 90% equal than an other clan..

Again, good for a cuple of campaings but after that it start to be boring.

- Understanding what each building does or chains to easily (it took me a few games to get it right)
- Not knowing what building to make keeps you from getting the right units as early as you can in the game.
- The time table to win the short campain is VERY challenging
- Takeda clan never wants to trade with me....... WTH Takeda!?!?!
- There always seems to be SOMETHING that makes your Dynamo dishonorable, and everyone hates that.
- some diplomatic solutions just plain don't work, I've tried to give children away as hostages so many times, nobody want's my kids!  they must all be brats.....

All in all I love this game.  I've played it a bunch just solo.  I can't vouch for any online play however so those experiences may vary.  I hope you pick this game up and check it out.  Enjoy!

While this is still true, many people lock up with indecision or simply don't care.  Which is why I'd recommend that if you also lack the ability to make decisions, allow me to make this one for you.

Total War games are similar to Civilization games but with a real-time strategy element for battles (which you can auto-calculate if you must, but generally your troops do far worse without your guidance unless you vastly outnumber the enemy).

So if Civilization is your thing, and you like RTS, Total War is their lovechild and it's beautiful.  And Shogun 2 is extremely well polished, and a great entry-level game to start off your addiction of being an armchair general.

Favourite so far has been Medieval 2, but this is as you would expect more advanced and polished, and feels more difficult. They've taken out agent spamming, you cannot disable the ninja cutscenes and money is much tighter

The TW traits common to all their games are here too

There's the initial zerg rush, you have to achieve critical mass by conquering ""rebel"" provinces fairly quickly, otherwise the other clans will appear over the horizon to stomp you flat however good you are and how easy it's set. There's also the ""brake"" mechanism. Instead of the senate or mongols/timurids, it is a matter of time before all of your enemies declare war and even your alliances unravel

The real stinker to this ""realm divide"" is that no NPC faction seems to trigger it. They can have conquered have the map, but if you even gain a single tech advance, boom; you better be ready to fight everyone

-----------------------------------
Base Game Review;
_________
Graphics: 9/10
The game looks great on higher settings, and pretty good on lower.
_________
Audio: 9.5/10
Realistic sound effect paired with Japanese speeches and battlecries creates an exciting mood.
________
Story: 6/10
The game has no storyline, as you can do whatever you wish. However, it is based accuratly on the Sengoku Peroid of Japan.
________
Length and Replayability: 10/10
A single campaign can take 100+ hours without bordem. Co-Op campaigns are also available.
________
Gameplay: 9.5/10;
________
Campaign Map: The campaign map is turnbased, so you can take all the time you want thinking. Armies are displayed by figures that march across the map. Units can be hired, tech can be researched, deplomacy can be reached, castles can be built, and wars can be fought. This is essential for the base campaign, and you can play singleplayer without ever leaving this via autoresolving battles. It is increadibly indepth, with many, many options.

Battles: Here is where tactics come into play. You control your army in real time, and watch as the battle progresses. The thought and realism of these battles is astounding, from morale, to fatigue, to the effects of charging down a hill vs up one. The terrain can be your best friend, or worse enemy, and you can win seemingly impossible battles through shrewd choices, and exploiting enemy weakness.

Campaign and Battle AI: The AI is smart enough on the main map to pose a challenge, and competent in battles. It should be noted that a skilled player can predict many of the AI's choices. It should also be noted that changing the difficulty does not change the AI, only how strong your men are vs theirs.

Multiplayer: Here is where you can really test yourself. You can fight other players in battles of wit, or engage in a multiplayer campaign with a friend.

________

To sum it all up, if this game goes on sale- Buy it.

70,8798262,english,"WIth the release of Total War: Rome2 being.....a ""little"" crappy, is it time for the gaming community to forget about the Toal War franchise? hell no, whilst Shogun 2 isn't as new as Rome 2 it is better in every way. 
In Shogun 2 the game takes place within the Sengoku Jidai period of time within Japanese history, a time when thousands of soliders fought and lost their lives in one battle amongst the thousands of other battles. 
Shogun 2 has a really good variety of clans to choose from, each with their own bonuses, these are shown as stat bonuses or reduced costs for certain units but often the best part about a lot of clans are the territorial positioning, with the southern clans having more trade points than the nothern or central clans. 
Of course having more trade posts leaves you open to naval attack, so keep your navy strong if you plan on sailing trade ships to the trade points near the island. 
Another thing to consider is how far away the point is from territory you own, as Soliders and the navy both suffer loses at winter if they are not inside their own territory, this means that as well as staying close to provences you own, you have to tacticaly plan out when to attack, it's best to attack somewhere right after winter, if you don't your units will suffer loses and you'll be at a disadvantage. 
Enough tips, it's time to tell you why you should buy this game now. 
Shogun 2 is incredibly refined, and I haven't ran into a single bug, well......gamebreaking bug at least, dancing soliders aren't gamebreaking, right? 
As well as this the game offeres a sense of scale, there are always massive battles that are amazing to look at, but the battles aren't so big that you can't easily control your units and make more tactical decisions. 
The game as a whole is gorgeous as well, the water is amazingly well done and other graphical features are really pretty. 
Diplomacy isn't neglected in this time of war, you can ally with clans, trade with them or do other in depth actions such as demanding another clan to cease trade with a rival clan of yours, depriving them of the funds they'd otherwise recieve. 
The only bad thing about the diplomacy is your allies behaviour towards you being attacked, if I'm getting my ass kicked I want to be able to ask a fellow clan to support my troops, or to place naval support around my trade ships if they have a bigger and better navy than me. 
Another gripe I have with the game is the cutscenes, by this I mean the video that plays when say a Ninja assasinates a general, I want a proper video cutscene, not a CGI thing that has a small box for you to look at, it doesn't even fill half the screen and is annoying for me personally although you may not care. 
This game is one of the best in its franchise and deserves your money, I highly reccomend this game if you jumped into Rome 2 and were disapointd, this game will not leave you disapointed or without your moneys worth, with hundreads of hours of content and endless replayability, this is a must buy.",1390325243,1390325243,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,76561198079378464,283,11,1588,0,879,1553985113,,

91,8720617,english,"My experience with the Total War series has been a largely good one, recent developments aside. I've put several months worth of hours into the series as a whole, and out all the Total War games- Nay! All the games in my library! This one is my favorite.

But enough mindless praise, lets cut this one open. 

Firstly, the BAD. Overall, there is a minuscule unit pool. Sure, you can say that this is due to it all being set on a relatively tiny bit of land compared to the rest of the world, but that was still a hurdle that had to be faced when playing this game.
Secondly, the AI cheats like crazy. Every warlord in japan must have been a mathematical genius, because there is no other explanation for how they can guess the range of my siege weapons down to a few feet. 
Thirdly, the AI is hard as hell, even on the medium difficulties. This became abruptly clear to me when I tried to introduce my friend to this game. He's not an avid rts player, so the steep learning curve kicked all the enjoyment he could have gotten from this game right out the door.

So why do you want to buy this game?

Firstly, the balance of units across factions puts a greater emphasis on battlefield tactics than the more recent Rome II. Despite having a fraction of the units, the game offers a deeper strategic experience because it levels the playing field and forces players to think rather than just rely on which unit has the higher numbers.
Secondly, the game is very rewarding. Upon breaching the learning curve, you find yourself filled with delight at your newfound victories, at the levels your generals are gaining, at the growth of your empire. By making the goals more challenging to reach, the game makes it feel all the better when you finally reach them. 
Thirdly, the expansions to the game give it extraordinary longevity. Fall of the Samurai offers a while new experience for veteran players of the vanilla game, and though Rise wasn't nearly as well made, it still had its own merits. 

One of the things to keep in mind when debating upon buying this game or not is just how much you like a challenge. If you enjoy trial and error, learning from mistakes, and visibly seeing a measure of your improvement, then this game is for you. If you're not in the category I mentioned above, go play something else because chances are you won't like the early game beatdowns this game will give you.",1389818756,1389818756,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198034207584,305,16,71635,0,29743,1594969921,,

I find rome 2 too overwhelming with all the added unit capabilities.
Campaign map wise and general clan playabilty rome 2 adds more depth and more customize options but can be too overpowering shogun 2 keeps it simple and fun.
I know im not the only one when I think rome 2 was rushed.

93,4829418,english,"Probably the best Total War I have played for a while. What it lacks in creativity, it makes up for it in everything else. 

What i mean by creativity is the unit, building, and event diversity. All the factions or Clans have the same units that they can use, and unless you have dlc, those are the only units you can use. Some people might say ""Well, Shimazu have different katana samurai,"" not really. It's just a better version of a katana samurai. 

However, the game is made very good. The optimization in the game is probably better than any other total war. The idea and setup of the game is terrifically made. I like now all the playable factions only have one or two provinces to start. This way, whenever someone starts a campaign, it is a lot easier to manage and forces the player to expand earlier in the game. Even though I am against DLC, most of the downloadable content in this game are highly recomended because of the added diversity and ingenuity (especially Fall of The Samurai).

Game has amazing visuals at maximum video quality, although I only recomend higher quality settings if you own a computer with better than recommended qualities. Custom battles are fun to play around in and campaign is amazing. You can chose the length of your campaign which is a good feature. City managing is good and despite complaints I heard, diplomacy works fine but is very simplistic. Enemies will wage war on you and some clans do expand and become roughly the same size as your clan late in the campaign. Enemy armies usually contain many units and are powerful. Agents are useful and I use them a lot. Upgrade trees for agents, generals, and clan development are organized and make hard choices to choose which upgrade or research. A good thing is massive armies and navies will greatly impact your income so having less units that are better is a good strategy. Real time battles are fun and I always look forward to them, especially when they are between massive armies. AI is good, although it does some questionable things.

If you enjoy clan warfare and turn-based games, can't go wrong here. Bit of a learning curve when you start, but well worth the time and effort.  Rise of the samurai and fall of the samurai are both great editions to the gameplay; as they serve as expansions that broaden the methods of gameplay from earlier Japan, to later Japan. Top that of with the blood pack, and your units look almost cinematic when attacking or getting shot down.

56,8540540,english,"Let's say that Shogun 2 Total War is the best strategy game of its type and series. The graphics are amazing while still being light enough to play onolder systems (I'd say you car run it on high with something as old as a Gtx 460 from nvidia). The seiges and land battles are highly optimized and work like a charm. The diplomacy is sweet to deal with and the AI generally doesn't fail spectacularly at it. The units are well balanced, even guns aren't too destructive as they suck at reloading and as such get snipped by rappid firing bow samurai. I would however recomend playing the game on harder difficulties as the campaign AI is sumwhat slow at building vast empires and as such makes you into the almighty and invincible ruler of Japan too fast, basically the harder difficulties give the other clans more money and thus more armies with which to fight you. This is honestly my favorite un-modded strategy game (just behind the Darthmod version of Napoleon Total War and just before the Darthmod of Empire total War).

15,8383558,english,"I had to rub my eyes. How could this have happened? Scant turns into Shogun 2’s campaign on the Hard setting, and I’d conquered my first city. My early-game army was already marching toward the next. Then one of the other clans landed a naval transport next to my home city and walked a small army right in. Total War’s AI, it seems, doesn’t have trouble with ships any more.

Thus began my army’s panicked march home to retake its own capital. Dismay, bedwetting, and the thrill of a fateful challenge: a good opener for ten.
Japanese castles: like chess in Kirk-era Star Trek.
Set, like the very first Total War, in the Sengoku period of Japanese history, Shogun 2 recalibrates the scale of the series in both geographical and military terms. After the multinational splendour of Empire and the continental romping of Napoleon, it narrows the focus down to a single geographical location and fewer troop-types.

The Sengoku (‘Warring States’) period seems a natural step; it’s the perfect backdrop for a multi-faction strategy game, and the martial culture is fascinating. By 1545, when the campaign-game begins, the ruling shogunate’s reach had dwindled, leaving Japan a shifting Venn-diagram of growing clans. Within this lay the seeds for Japan’s ultimate unification under the Tokugawa clan – and here’s where you intervene. As Daimyo, or clanleader, your task is to increase the power of your own clan, conquer or subdue the opposing clans, claim the seat of power in Kyoto, and, ultimately, form the new shogunate.

Every victory is celebrated by a round of cheering.
Even for those accustomed to Total Wars past, Shogun 2’s armies look fabulous. Each unit-type features incredible levels of detail. Zoom in close, and individual touches pop out at you: a full-face demon-mask here, an unusually crested helm there, a moustache... Creative Assembly have raised the technical bar too, with wonderful season-specific effects, specularity and downright splendid texture-work, especially in the rain.

The accents and intonations of the campaign and battle advisors are also fantastic, especially when things get heated. You can almost hear the spittle flying when your battle advisor yells, with great emotion: “Our troops are running from the field! A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!!!” And the music matches pace. From the airy, atmospheric, intrigueheavy string-and-flute music of the campaign map, to the drum-andgong- and-grunting-Samurai martial accompaniment to battles, the sense of atmosphere is palpable.

As ever, there are two phases of play. A turn-based strategy layer, in which you manage your clan and decisions take seasons to play out, and a real-time battle mode, in which you lead your armies to victory or humiliating defeat.

Early on, diplomacy is key. Even more so on higher difficulty settings, where you’ll find the AI working the clans hard, and you even harder, with bullish demands accompanying every overture. It gives the clans a strong sense of personality: they come to you more frequently with offers, but they can be ruthless in their exchanges, and prone to breaking off relations. They also gather bigger armies on higher difficulty, and are more proactive about expansion.

Keep your peasants happy lest they rise against you.
With alliances come serious responsibilities. Attacking an ally is deeply dishonourable, and while it may gain you territory and the production capabilities of captured cities, it also reduces your Honour, a factor contributing to your peoples’ contentment and the way other clans perceive you. After an experimental backstab, I spent a hell of a lot of turns paying for my land-grab with broken alliances, reduced trade and the resultant economy-hit, followed by civil wars as angry peasant-armies rose, and major hostility toward me from other clans.

When Geishas attack

As with the earlier games, special agents can be recruited to tip the balance on the map, and their influence can be pronounced. The Ninja is a highlight. His Subterfuge and Assassination skills enable him to lock down an army for a turn or slay its general, and if you point him at an enemy castle, he can sabotage key production structures within, or its very gates – a beneficial precursor to a siege. Monks, Geisha and Metsuke – the era’s ninja-sniffing secret police – are also available to perform a range of covert offensive and defensive actions. All these units can level up with use.

A small percentage of troops will tumble to their doom.
Halfway through my first campaign, diplomacy ceased to be an issue when realm-divide happened. This happens at different points in each game. When the AI assesses you as the biggest threat on the map, the Shogun decrees that you’re the enemy, and all the clans fall into line. A design feature to stop you sweeping effortlessly to victory, it changes the pace of the game remarkably: suddenly you’re under siege everywhere.

To keep things interesting in the meantime, events, missions and dilemmas pop up periodically. Winning a mission (by researching a specific skill, say) confers turnlimited benefits to your clan - a military or civic buff, perhaps.

Warrior Monks are highly skilled bowmen, but lack armour.
Kyoto protocol

Balancing military and civic development is crucial. Every now and then it’s wise to turn your techtree research away from Bushido (fighty) towards Chi (civic). This lets you unlock new farming techniques and tax-improvement technologies, as well as advanced structures and agent improvements.

However, civic navel-gazing won’t win you any battles. Idling armies hoover resources and offer no recompense, and you need to conquer a set number of provinces to win. Kyoto, bang in the centre of the map, must also be yours. So war it is.

I’d win more battles if I spent less time admiring my troops.
The defining characteristic of Shogun 2 is its refinement of troop variety from more recent games in the series. Good old-fashioned infantry, archers and cavalry form the backbone of your armies, with the odd clan-specific exception. According to which structures you build and which technologies you research on the tech-tree, they come armed and armoured in a variety of ways for different battlefield roles. Befriend western traders and adopt Christianity (gasp!), and gunpowder weapons are yours, at the cost of social and diplomatic enmity.

The bulk of your force begins with Ashigaru – essentially peasant conscripts – and shortly after, Samurai: disciplined, resilient, better-equipped and with considerably fancier hats. Yari (spear) Ashigaru and Bow Ashigaru are available as basic recruitment options in any town, but with suitable development, Monks, Ronin, and battlefield Ninja units become available, which tend towards specialisation in one statistic at the cost of another. Attain the top techtier of any school of weaponry and build its related building, and you can recruit high-stat legendary units, though the recruitment cap for these is extremely limited.

The prettiest fog-of-war ever? No doubt.
The direction in which you push your tech-tree, and therefore your army development, is dictated by your clan-specific perks. The Takeda clan, for instance, receive improved morale, recruitment costs and upkeep costs for all cavalry units, and can recruit superior cavalry. Another clan might benefit more on the campaign map, with bonuses to diplomacy and campaign-map agents, such as Ninja, Geisha and Metsuke. And in the traditional Total War way, each clan also differs in challenge according to its position relative to friendly or hostile clans, regardless of the difficulty level.",1388281303,1388281303,True,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False,76561198079553573,552,28,13301,0,574,1588692017,,
16,8382554,english,"I was surprised when I saw no one wrote a review for Shogun 2 total war, maybe because they are too busy playing it? ... I donno anyway I thought I might enlighten some folks out there.
Hello and welcome ... firstly if you don’t know what Total war is about let me give you my simple explanation ... you control a country (or clan in this case) and your objective is simple ... TAKE OVER .... not simple really but i guess someone has to do it ... There are MULTIPLE ways to do this ... Build a ridiculous army and crush your foes, affectively everyone :-/ 
forge alliances, help destroy large annoying clans which differ to culture to your own then betray those who were closest to you and take them unexpectedly .... Send agents to assassinate, seduce, demoralise, bribe key figures, to join ure cause or destroy them ... if that make any sense ? 
plan your own characters development, marriages, heirs and deal with family strife and honour .... deal with your neighbours through diplomacy, manage your finances and your people happiness in your domains ... its a beautiful fine balance to try to manage .... and anything can destroy it  ... choose to skip battle or zoom in and command your armies personally, watching the slaughter in all its glories ... if you are into those things ...
So what’s different/better in this total war? 
1) Improvement to the A.I. (but not perfect) compared to Empire total war which was HURENDOUS ... A.I attacking you with a reasonable size armies, responding to ure failings in term of dishonourable acts, your power and so on ... diplomacy is still ridiculous unfair but at least they engage better than before.
2) fantastic character deployment (ninjas, geisha’s and much more), you can upgrade ure characters and control their development trees as they level up almost giving RPG like feel to it.
3) well balanced and fantastic looking armies and battles!
4) Excellent improvement to multiplayer, providing you with amazing variety and personal development to your OWN avatar ... about time!
Deep variety of character’s, agents and what you can do on the battle field map,

I feel Total war went to back to its best in this title Shogun 2 ... It is well fleshed out, a lot of deep innovated mechanics to character development, A.I interaction, single player campaign, its feels more challenging, where you have to be forced to forge alliances, to try and take an upper hand in the campain, I LOVE the fact that during expert mode YOU CANNOT SAVE ... only auto save after each turn is allowed ... so it REALLY feels like a wrong move OR decision such as breaking alliances, or going to war could cost you your land and empire, the A.I is not scared to gang up on you if you get or getting to strong. and this bold move and tenacity of Creative assembly I respect ... 
This is one of the BETTER total war games which ALSO looks beautiful and music in tune with the game setting ....
This game is a must for any total war fan and for new comers a definite try out if you are interested in strategic management and domination of japan through various routes ...

Score 8/10

26,8351603,english,"Being a huge fan of the Total War series, I am very happy with Shogun 2. I amassed hundreds of hours playing Rome 1 and was extremely excited for the release of Shogun 2. I was not disappointed.

The campaign map looks fantastic. The time period is interesting and immersing. As feudal Japan heaves under significant political turmoil, clans rise quickly to vie for power and respect. Other clans will keep a close eye on you as you expand and will feel threatened if you acquire too much power. The beginning of the game mostly revolves around mundane land disputes or battles over historical greivances, but by mid game and late game, wars will rage over religious choices, alliances with western powers, threats to the control of the capitol and even rebellions you can initiate. 

The expansion pack ""Fall of the Samuri"" is worth looking into. There are many DLC packs that increase replayability. I am not a huge fan of how playable factions are introduced at a price, but it seems as though CA firmly believes in it. 

Battles are balanced and fun. A problem with battles is that the majority will be sieges. The AI seems to prefer to hole up and the game can become tedious as you hop from castle to castle to conquer the land. I did like the improved siege maps and I love that you could control artillery units personally.

Yo Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho
They fire flaming arrows at my battlements, leaving my defences as naught but charcoal and ash, and then they begin to scale the walls. A few fall and plummet to their death, the rest scale over the side and charge into my men. The sullen grey sky now full of smoke from the ruins of the wooden pallisades.

My mens morale is dropping but they're staying steadfast in the face of certain death. I rally them with my makeshift general in the form of Katana Samurai to get my troops to hold their ground. They do. I win.

The gameplay in Shogun 2 is the pinnacle of the series, everything is fluid and just works seamlessly. From the campaign map to the battlefield, it's glorious. The graphics are beautiful too, you just sit at your seat, in your boxers covered in sweat and you can't help but gawp at some of the landscapes. The online is fun but can get samey over a period of time. This is where Shogun's Achillies heel is, it's the samey troops that every faction has.

73,2406779,english,"The key to whether or not you're going to enjoy Shogun 2 hinges on your interest it's historical era - 16th century Japan.

Unlike the other Total War games, Shogun 2 is limited to essentially one culture in a relatively small corner of the globe. While this will certainly be reason enough for some to give the game a pass, those that dive into it will definitely be surprised.

Working with such a limited amount of potential diversity, CA actually managed to do a solid job at making each clan feel different from the other - chiefly by giving each one their own bonuses and specialties. Religion also became a defining trait amongst the clans with the ability to convert to Christianity and the introduction of the Ikko Ikki clan and their off-shoot of Shinto-Buddhism. A clan's religion actually became relavent in regards to diplomacy, economics, and what avenues you could explore with your military.

Agents continue to play a major role on the campaign map and their ability to shift the flow of the game is a big improvement on the slightly more helpful ones introduced in Empire. The combat looks great and large melee battles make a grand return with higher detailed soldiers and terrain as well as much more life-like fighting animations and movements. 

Another big point of this game is that it probably was CA's most stable Total War release on launch. There weren't too many bugs or unexplained crashes when the game hit shelves which was a big deal for fans given Empire's less-than-stellar debut. After some patches and a little down the road today and any technical issues Shogun 2 had are all but forgotten.

Overall Shogun 2 is a great experience but it's not without its flaws. Naval battles feel like they were just half-heartedly added last minute since Empire debuted them (and so they're expected now), given the much shorter time frame you're stuck with the same three or four clan family members the entire time, CA still struggles with battlefield/diplomacy/campaign AI (though it has gotten much better), and finally the campaign's end game is just one big cluster-f**k where allies turn on each other and go crazy while the player tries to take over nearly all the map as fast as possible.

In the end though, the biggest thing working against the game is the setting. If you're not into the whole ninja, samurai, etc thing you're probably going to get kind of bored of it actually a couple of hours.",1325293299,1387844797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006893472,471,63,12033,0,10352,1589486404,,

95,19958,english,"Shogun 2 Total war takes us back to what started the franchise and done an excellent job doing so. Before we get into things, I'll start with the negative points. 

1. When first released the game was pretty buggy in some areas, and while most of these have been resolved over the years, there are still some that persist, particularly in co-op/multiplayer.

2. Feels smaller, due to the setting in S2 the game feels much smaller than the locations covered in Medieval or Rome. This is largely in part to being focused strictly on the island of Japan, and the islands being split into provinces. 

3. The AI isn't always the brightest, between leaving a castle to disrupt a raiding party and leaving your main army to take the keep behind them, and the sheer volume of armies they will make with two or three troops in them just to go around and raid your provinces with it makes you wonder what their leaders are thinking. Diplomacy is also a little wonky with long time trade partners just deciding one season that you've slighted them and that they are now your mortal enemy. 


So okay... those seem like pretty big issues to get around. However, somehow Shogun still managed to steal almost 150 hours of my life. 

The different factions promote extremely different game play and tactics. Some that don't work well with the games auto-resolve, but are fun to play through as yourself regardless. There is nothing quite like causing an entire army to route with an army made up of mostly archers, or a significantly small force of highly trained samurai that are out numbered 4-1 

Co-Op when it is working for you is extremely fun as well and works surprisingly well for a turn based game. You can purchase troops / armies on your allies turn and essentially get all of the micromanaging of provinces out of the way before you start your actual turn. Once it moves to you it becomes a situation of moving your armies around, confirming you still want to make your purchases and then passing through your turn.  Battles are also extremely more enjoyable with a Co-Op partner. Gift half your troops to them (don't worry it is just for that battle) and the two of you can now do very effective multi-flank attacks that the computer pulls off so seamlessly all the time. 

I'm not sure how accurate the lore is, but the setting does very much make you feel like you are in the era, and you can feel the tension of the old ways fighting against the new.",1325437285,1387303581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197960399156,456,16,8609,0,8575,1563275699,,

The game has the least diversity of the series but this is both a strength and a weakness. The enabled the game to have a very easy to graspe rock, paper, sissors style of gameplay. Of course the downside to this is fans of the series felt that the diversity of other games, such as Medieval and Rome was not on display. Though the time period and more mono-block culture of Japan works alongside the game mechanics.
Shogun 2 has a good deal amount of DLC, not all of it is needed to get a great experience however. Pick up the Fall of the Samurai standalone expansion if you can, it completely changes a lot of mechanics from the base game. Set against the backdrop of the Boshin War, the end of the Samurai period in Japan. Gunpowder, foreign influence and steam power comes into play. I have played two full campaigns of Shogun 2 and one full campaign of FotS. Everytime was different and this is by far the most challenging of the Total Wars.

+ DLC's FoTS and RoTS are 100% worth paying for
+ Beginnings of a new kind of warfare - New gunpowder units, brought by western traders!
+ Faction DLC's - i couldnt have picked better clans myself!
+ Best battles ever seen in a Total War Game
+ Really does set the atmosphere for 'The age of the country at war' , or the Sengoku Jidai

- Family doesnt really matter - lose your faction leader, and just be replaced with an infinite supply of brothers in law's
- Espionage could be a little better
- Naval combat in stock game is slow, id rather auto - resolve (but it still looks great!)
- Enemy gets a little confused in Seige battles - never brings heavy weapons and kills himself climbing the walls

Gameplay
เกม Shogun total war 2 เป็นเกมแนว RTS ผสม กับ Turn Base แบบตัวหมาก เกมจะให้ผู้เล่นบังคับยูนิต (สัญลักษณ์แทนคือตัวหมาก) ไปยึดตามจังหวัดต่างๆอยู่ประเทศญี่ปุ่น และจะทำสงครามกับบรรดาแม่ทัพมีชื่อคนอื่นๆ เช่น โอดะ  นอกจากนี้คุณยังต้องบริหารจังหวัดที่อยู่ใต้การควบคุมรวมถึงจังหวัดที่ยึดมาใหม่ๆอีกด้วย ไม่เช่นนั้นก็จะพบว่ามียูนิตกบฏโผล่ขึ้นมายึดมันคืนซะดื้อๆ 
Gameplay : 8/10
ความยากง่าย : ค่อนข้างยาก

Graphic
ก็ถือว่าทำได้ไม่เลวนัก ในเกมคุณจะได้พบฉากห่าฝนลูกธนู หรือแม้แต่ระเบิดที่อลังการ ยูนิตต่อสู้กันแบบตัวต่อตัวระหว่างซามูไรกับซามูไร หรือแม้แต่การปีนป่ายกำแพงเพื่อยึดปราสาท
Graphic 7/10

22,8001313,english,"This one is a bit tough to review, because I have not gotten through a full campaign yet, or even maybe half way through one.  I have no idea how long that would take to complete a campaign, since the one I have going has about 6 hours and has yet to conquer more than one neighboring Daimyo, I think it will take some time.  Regardless, I wanted to sit down and give my thoughts on my experience with this game, for anyone thinking about buying it.

Shogun 2 is a grand strategy game.  Part of the game is played in world map where you manage your troops and provinces/castles, part of it is in combat where you control your army in skirmishes, battles, and sieges.

The graphics, like most Total War games, are magnificent and demanding.  It runs well on my newer i5 computer with high settings, but will chug HARD on lower end computers, even with graphics turned down.  Not to mention loading the game takes a good few minutes, or longer if your computer isn't that good.  Point is, it's playable on high and low end computers, but probably pass on this for now if you don't think you could wait 5 minutes or so just to actually get into a battle.

The aesthetics are wonderful.  The scenery, art, and sound design are delightfully immersive and pull me into the battles, where I can zoom in while my soldiers are marching and admire their incredibly polished, pristine armor.  I am not a Japanese art or history buff, but I felt this game did a great job of immersing you in the chaos around the rise of a new Shogun.

The strategic element of the game is tightly balanced and somewhat complex.  This is a grand strategy game, which your strategy on the world map and in battles will strongly influence how well your campaign goes.  The game is much better at teaching new players the basic tactics needed than older Total War games, but really understanding battle tactics will take some practice.  

Do note though, this is the point of a strategy game: great depth in its systems.  For me, battles were quite difficult tactically, with my men often losing morale and fleeing without me understanding why, or dying in flocks despite having the advantage of numbers (quality of troops goes a long way when you pit peasants against samurai).  I never blamed the game for my losses though, knowing that if I had more practice micromanaging my units, I'd be able to perform much better.


Despite this, I can only give this game a resounding yes in my review, with the disclaimer that if you don't really like or understand the niche that is Grand Strategy games, you may not like it.  This isn't a game to pursue if you're looking to zone out and not really think hard about how you want to siege a castle, or try to figure out how to hold a castle with only 3 archer platoons against a huge army.  But if you enjoy strategy or grand strategy games, or are looking to try one, I cannot recommend this game higher, for all the points mentioned above.  Total War: Shogun 2 is a fantastic game, and a fantastic Grand Strategy game, and now that I've written this, I'll probably take another stab at the campaign again.",1386742377,1386742567,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197995629098,956,28,2337,0,2045,1443685355,,

Agents can do any number of amazing and tactically influential things, like bribing an enemy army, assassinating a general, arresting a monk, or converting a population to Buddhism/Christianity. 
Battles are challenging and the AI manages to win a good portion of the time, assuming you aren't a tactical genius (holla). Lack of unit variety can make battles visually uninteresting, but brings focus back to the command portion, and there are a number of mods to make more unit variety.

Beautiful music and scenery bring this game to life like no other member of the series before it. The attention to historical detail and accuracy is astounding, and reminds us of what seperates the Total War series from other games in its genre.

The only field I feel was lacking, was the scale. Where as other games in the series, such as Empire, spanned continents, Shogun 2 remains within the nation of Japan, when a game of this level has the potential to span dozens of times it's size, for the ultimate experience.

Gameplay wise, there are always bits here and there that could use improvement, but still amazing compared to other RTS or Turn Based games.

Shogun 2 is a total war game and if you have been following the total war series you know how consistent they are with breaking the game at first and then developing upon it into something that looks and works great. This game however was a great exception and its release was alot more smooth than the other total wars.

The diplomacy is a pretty good system in this game however I find myself bribing to many kingdoms in order to gain a favorable status to the point where the neighbors are attempted to invade my barn! You have to remember that just giving people gifts can weaken your own status and make you more prone to attacks.

The RTS combat is pretty great in this game however I find myself hitting the fast forward button (basically making AI fight) when I am being lazy and I suffer great losses as a result. The Generals do not take kindly to a lazy shogun/Daimyo (player). While your generals might have ranks that can help them overcome battles easier for you its best to improve your own skill set to outmatch any AI you encounter!

I have tried the multiplayer with my friend and tend to drive him mad. I would invest to much money into the most ridiculous things. Multiplayer sometimes takes coordination between two people in order to better penetrate the enemy forces or you might end up with a minecraft partner.

I notice that Shogun 2 suffers the most in terms of the diplomacy AI, which does not necessarily limit your ability to manipulate the political atmosphere in the game, but it does present awkward scenarios such as a clan that asks for peace when they are about to be wiped off the map... alongside a payment of koku (the currency that Japan used at the time).

I can't say much more than has already been said.  That I have over 200 hours on this game should be endorsement enough, but I will add a couple extra comments:

Multiplayer battles.  The battles are certainly 'streamlined', trading realism for a more accessible type of gameplay.  Balance is sometimes a noticeable issue and I occasionally experience things that seem to be cheats:  outrageously fast or strong enemy units for their supposed level, although various combinations of retainer modifiers could account for this on occasion.  It just seems like skill is not well represented in the battle outcomes as well as should be.

57,7875894,english,"A remake of the classic Shogun: Total War, and possibly the last decent title in the Total War franchise.

I have mixed feelings about Shogun 2. It followed on from Empire, which was epic in scale and one of my all time favourite games, but I was looking forward to doing something that didn't involve gunpowder. Shogun 2 offered better graphics, and a return to the swords and spears and arrows that made Medieval 2 and Rome so enjoyable.

Unfortunately, I found Shogun 2 a bit disappointing. It did everything well, and unlike Rome 2 it was a reasonably bug-free release. But it just didn't seem to have the same staying power as earlier TW games. Each faction seemed to be a carbon copy of all the others, with only minor bonuses to specific units separating them. The strategic map felt much less ""epic"" than what I had grown accustomed to, yet still seemed to take forever to conquer. The AI was at least reasonably challenging, but battles felt very much like a game of rock-paper-scissors. Although some unit types have always had an advantage over others, Shogun 2 took it to Age of Empires extremes, which I found very annoying (why are swords so devastatingly effective against spears?).

All in all, Shogun 2 felt like a dumbing down of the franchise. While I appreciate that CA was trying to make the game more appealing and accessible to casual players (and thus boost their sales), I can't help but feel that this weakened the game for seasoned Total War veterans. In light of the recent catastrophe that was Rome 2, it seems clear that Shogun 2 was the start of a downhill slide for the franchise that may well spell it's doom. However, it's also fair to say that Shogun 2 is still a much, much stronger title.

The bottom line is this: Shogun 2 is a lot prettier and a lot easier to pick up than Empire or Medieval II, and a much better game overall than Rome 2. If you're wanting a less demanding experience, or just can't stand the aging graphics of the older titles, then Shogun 2 might well appeal to you.",1385960388,1385960578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999717898,749,14,3033,0,2535,1438608583,,

Seems to have great multiplayer features, including drop-in battles if you're online to spice up your enemy.

Worth noting is the Fall of the Samurai DLC, which is HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended.  It's musket and railroad era Japan, and it's a very refreshing change of pace from other TW games.  Some of the features here are game-changers, such as the ability to call in artillery strikes if a navy is near a land battle, and agents that have multiple meaningful uses.  Get Fall of the Samurai, do not hesitate.

A few downsides:  

1) Unit variety is a little lacking, each faction can field 90%+ of the same units.  Some factions get a few bonuses and extra units but factions are more generic than in any other TW game I've played.

2) Terrain is meaningful (and very pretty), but not as meaningful as Empire/Napoleon, where you could hide in houses and take cover behind fences/walls.  It feels like a step back from that great use of terrain in Empire.

3) Realm Divide feature is controversial and is not for everyone.  Basically, if you get powerful enough (and you'll know you're getting close before it happens), all factions who are not your solid allies will gang up on you and try to destroy you.  I suppose it's a decent alternative to the frequent TW non-ending where you just steamroll everyone, but it's controversial and a bit gamey, so I mention it.

Things that make this game great are the fact that you can create your own Daimyo avatar for multiplayer games, along with that, this game never gets old. I can storm Kyoto a million times with all the different clans and still be just a satisfied each time. The only thing that could be wrong with this game is that a large portion of the game is siege battles if you plan on playing the single player that is but with the economy system and tech tree at least you can choose which way you decide to storm Kyoto. Should i make a bunch of crap spearman and rush or sit back and wait to get some good samurai that never let me down The diplomacy is kinda useless unless you want an ally that will eventually betray you but thats pretty much every game a computer should never be allowed to run a country. . another reason why i prefer this single player overr TW: Rome 2's is because Rome 2 is just too big. Infact everything is just bigger from the campaign maps to the battles everything just seems way too big. I like the arena deathmatch feel they put in Shogun 2 opposed to the Conquer the world and get lost amongst your own provinces you own in Rome 2.

The multiplayer is great a nice map or japan that you and your created army must take over. i love the effort they put in the multiplayer. you can edit you units uniforms and your Daimyo entire outfit along with his horse. aside from that there is also a mulitplayer campaign where you and a buddy can either conquer japan together or fight each other to the death.

Shogun 2 brings out the best of every strategist. Massive numbers simply are not enough to defeat your enemy, and inferior forces still stand a change with the right strategy.

The campaign mode suffers from having a very ill-defined economy in terms of the inflation penalty experienced when your empire grows. The AI also cheats extensively, planning their movements against you even if you've never encountered them before.

10,7773963,english,"Overview: As the Creative Assembly's sequel to the game that launched the Total War series, Shogun 2 is a big improvement in and represents a culmination of the learning the developer has done over the years. With a return to fundamentals in combat with a distinct feel and look, Shogun 2 is a well-polished game that serves as a great entry point for players who enjoy turned based strategy fused with real time tactical gameplay.

What is Shogun 2?

Shogun 2 is a game in the Total War series that focuses on the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States Period) of Japan. The player chooses one of the prominent clans of the period and vies for the title of Shogun among many factions.

The Total War games focus on two aspects: Strategy and Tactics. The strategic side focuses on campaign map management, which includes using agents such as Ninja and Buddhist monks, planning and developing provinces, researching new military and civic technology, trading with other clans, and diplomacy. The tactical side involves set piece battles, the hallmark of the Total War series, involving (mostly) period accurate units such as samurai, warrior monks, ninjas, and ashigaru (levied) units.

Gameplay (4/5)

The gameplay is more polished in Shogun 2 than in earlier games in the Total War series. Units are recruited out of settlements and formed into armies. Due to the fact that the game takes place in Japan entirely, the unit rosters between clans are pretty similar, with most units being fielded by everyone, and only a few unique variations of base units available as clan specific units. While this doesn't detract much from gameplay, many Total War veterans will definitely notice the lack of the usually diverse units and factions a player can interact with in older games in the series. A player can choose the composition of their armies and take them to the field of battle against another clan. 

Combat is fought on battlefields in a set piece manner. The battles have a higher than average pacing, lasting usually five to ten minutes. Some may find battles too short/fast, but I personally found that it lasted a satisfying amount of time. In a typical campaign it isn't unusual to fight a hundred battles or more, so there is no shortage of combat. Tactically, the AI knows what it is doing but has a tendency to do dumb things, like misuse generals as well as not taking opportunities to flank your troops. Players may find the AI tactical abilities lacking in some areas.

Units are pretty responsive to commands and overall controls are easy to learn and use. Tactics have a lot of depth, with players having to manage unit morale, field positioning, and maneuvering. The camera look system is robust and designed to allow a player to zoom in on the battlefield and watch individual units fight.

The campaign map includes most of Japan, with the game taking place on the Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu islands. Mountainous areas allow for choke points and forests act as ambush points. A player can move their army along well-trodden roads, or cut through a mountain pass to make an attack deep in enemy territory. Ships allow for faster movement across the map, which can take a long time to travel on foot. Certain provinces have special resources important for research and development, which adds in another strategic layer for war planning.

City management is smarter now, and with the encyclopedia, it is easy to plan cities. As you upgrade the castle in a province, more building slots open up, allowing the player more room to build. As there are a limited number of building slots possible in a province, it is important for the player to consider the purpose of the province and plan accordingly. Provincial combat focuses on field battles and castle sieges. As provincial control lies in castles, most of the important battles you fight will involve one. 

The AI seems to be an improvement over previous games in terms of decision making, although diplomacy with the AI is still pretty clunky. It is hard to know the decision making process behind the AI, but it isn't unusual for a very weak clan to declare war on a much stronger opponent, among other obviously self-detrimental actions.

Look and feel - User Interface (4.5/5):

The game has a distinct period-specific Japanese feel, with the art and interface design reflecting those themes. The campaign map retains a parchment look until explored, and the four seasons of Japan play a role in campaign strategy. 

Campaign map management has been improved over the earlier titles in the Total War series. The Creative Assembly has gotten better with each iteration with how they present relevant information to the player. Family trees are very user friendly, and allow for promotions and adoptions for generals. Finances are easy to manage through the trade and tax windows, and the Shogun 2 encyclopedia can be opened on just about anything clickable in game, which provides deeper information found in just the tooltips.

Graphics (4.5/5):

The graphics are pretty well optimized. The game can run on lower end machines, but to appreciate the detail put into the individual units on the battlefield, a mid-tier and up machine is necessary.

Zooming in during battles will reveal the detail put into the individual unit's appearance, but also mundane things like grass and rocks. The details presented in every iteration of the Total War series improves, and Shogun 2, especially with the Blood Pack DLC, is incredibly visceral up close.

Sound (4/5):

The music and sounds are Japan-themed, with the sounds of the Koto and Shakuhachi prevalent through loading screens and as ambient sound in places like the campaign map. Units respond in Japanese, and the unit advisor speaks English with a Japanese accent (the adviser can be turned off).

Overall, the sounds and music are subtle and unobtrusive. You'll notice it if you're listening for it but otherwise it sort of blends in with the game.

Verdict:

The Total War series can be daunting for the uninitiated, but Shogun 2 is an excellent entry point for new comers while offering to Total War veterans a great gaming exp with a distinct look and feel that builds upon the things The Creative Assembly has learned through the years, knowing what works and what doesn't. While it isn't anything revolutionary in terms of new mechanics, it doubles down and nails a lot of the positive characteristics of the older games. Some may not like the narrower unit roster or gameplay focus on castle sieges, but it doesn't noticeably detract from the game. Shogun 2 is definitely a title worth picking up.",1385499384,1385499384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005723002,212,4,13338,0,12739.0,1496544326,,

Shogun envelopes you into 16th century Japan and challenges you to control some of  the strongest families during the Sengoku jidai or age of war. The challenge that is posed against you is to overthrow the shogunate who has betrayed your family , therefore striking you to pursue unifying and controling Japan. With the highly acclaimed single player which contains the Civilisation style turn based gameplay to the real time strategy from the likes of Command & Conquer and competetive multiplayer, you will never be stuck with nothing to do. 

The multiplayer incorporates a unique personal avatar system that was introduced in Napoleon total war and has been reworked, adapted and enhanced within the newest total war title. The user has an avatar which can be created and edited from the start of the multiplayer experience. Throughout the multiplayer battles and through gaining single player acheivements new items for your general can be unlocked to make your leader dominate the battlefield with his new shiny greaves . Upon winning matches you start to conquer the area's of Japan, allowing for seperate unlocks to units and retainers (buff cards) which gives the multiplayer some replayability and continuinity.

17,7765147,english,"The epitome of a good Total War game. Though I received this game a year after it was released, I feel no regrets in purchasing this game. Shogun 2 is the perfect game for beginners to get a grasp of what the series is like and its now become one of the classics for Total war veterans. Nothing feels more amazing than leading an army of samurai in Japans warring states period: The Sengoku Jidai. In this game, the mix of turn based strategy (with economic, political, and diplomatic ramifications) and real time battles is wonderful but the need to balance timing and aggression is more important than ever. The AI may seem difficult at first and hard to deal with but the Total War series has always been about realism and the AI's scripted actions make logical and historical sense.
Graphically Shogun 2 is stunning and one of the more easily run games in the series. It is a testament of Creative Assembly's hard work.
If you end up playing Shogun 2, I would also recommend playing its two expansions as well: Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. Both expansions add more depth to the title while adding various new units and factions to play as.
My final word is Shogun 2 is the perfect game for history buffs and action fans alike who love leading massive armies into battle but also love using passive or aggressive diplomacy in the campaign as well.",1385469885,1385469885,True,2,0,0.544235885143280029,0,True,False,False,76561198055963725,128,6,10666,0,9277.0,1482441492,,

24,490344,english,"Shogun II improves upon its immediate predecessors in the Total War series, but that's not saying much. The AI is somewhat better, true, and naval battles are no longer a nightmare of inefficiency. However, the game also takes some steps back. Most notable amongst these is the utter lack of replayability; with a single exception (available through DLC purchase only), every faction shares all of its units with every other faction on the map, and the only real variance you'll see between campaigns will arise from your starting position. Needless to say, that isn't much. 

Beyond this, you'll find yourself confronted by the usual products of this developer's notorious laziness. Worst of all amongst these is a combat engine limitation that also exists in Empire and Napoleon but manifests itself much more prominently in Shogun: the engine is unitary. That is, each soldier can fight one enemy soldier, and only one. Soldiers cannot be flanked and cannot be overwhelmed by numbers. Nay; if you've got a unit of ten men fighting against an enemy unit of one, then nine of your soldiers will stand around and do nothing. While this was less of an issue in Shogun's two immediate predecessors, being as that they were focused upon firearms, it is inexcusable that this limitation has persisted in a game focused entirely upon melee combat. This sort of disregard for creating a complete product is, sadly, a hallmark of the developer of this series. 

I do not recommend that you purchase this game. This is, actually, a somewhat odd case in that one of its standalone DLC products is superior to the title that spawned it; Fall of the Samurai is a more novel, more engaging experience than Shogun II is. If you simply must have your Total War fix, then buy that instead.",1320180118,1385432393,False,12,0,0.439365774393081665,0,True,False,False,76561197971072585,207,93,7194,0,6813.0,1474836123,,

Shogun 2 provides a mixture of well-designed characters with extremely detailed animations into deadly historical war.

The more focused scope of the game allows for a much easier time of getting into the series, placing Shogun 2 as the first game that one should buy if they are interested in the Total War series in this reviewer's opinion.

Strengths:
Preserves the depth of the franchise without getting lost in the tedium.
Beautiful, engaging visuals with some heavily stylized artwork.
Preserves the culture of feudal Japan, doing it great justice.
Good mod support.
Focus on Japan ensures you understand every unit's purpose.

Weaknesses:
Relatively steep learning curve, despite having been more simplified.
Discouraging to new players, as the game can take some time to truly start in force. (Not exactly a con for veterans)

Imagine playing a game for five hours only to get yourself in a situation where you cannot win and your last recoverable save was an hour ago.  Only to recover as you sacrificed a few provinces for your armies to retreat to a defendable position like the hot gates.  

As the filthy Oda peasants amass for a siege, your general screams ""THIS IS KAGA"" as he Shogun kicks a captured ninja into a well.  Your elite warriors line up side by side and make short work of the peasant army armed with pitch forks as your men's katanas gleam with blood and martensite.  Only to be slowly dwindled down by mass goddamn peasant archers that have fire arrows, your elite samurai get picked off dishonoruably afar from a man in a loincloth. 

The actual gameplay for Shogun 2 is quite diverse.  From the economic and diplomatic standpoint the game is turned base, as you set up buildings for your provinces to build up to bargaining trade routes and exchanging sons and daughters to secure alliances.  Just be wary, the computer is very devious and in the end most alliances turn into treachery.

Think of a RTS where instead of creating a new army for every different map/campaign mission you play, you maintain your army throughout the entire camaign (unless you get them killed).

The Singleplayer gameplay is centered around a Turn Based campaign map, where you are allowed to Macro your Economies, Commerce, Armies, Diplomacy, and Agents all on one easy to follow medium. One drawback is the lack of castle variation or construction ability, each siege battle will have the same castles for each stage of construction achieved in the province; However in other modes in the game, you may choose to preload a unique castle for one battle. The actual battles themselves take place in a Real Time Strategy environment where the player must field their units in battle against enemy forces. There are many types of battles; Sieges, Skirmishes, Night Battles, Ambushes; Each battle providing a different experience and strategy. Countless units will allow you to construct a diverse army capable of accommodating for any possible enemy strategy. The online play has obviously seen better days considering the date of release; However one can still find a competative game here and there. The Avitar campaign feature was truly one of the best facets of the game, allowing for players to join clans with their friends, and play a competative campaign style map which eliminated all Macro management, and focuses only on the battles to consider the outcome of each turn. The player then gains veteran units to field in later battles, and also the opportunity to upgrade each veteran unit with unique abilities such as fire arrows, or the swooping crane. The game also allows for historical battles which actually have some historically accurate information provided in the massive in game index. Trust me if you have any questions about how to do something in the game, it will be in that index.

19,4776118,english,"Shogun II, I think, is the best of the Total War series so far. The new Total War: Rome II is at the moment a buggy mess, but I believe even when that is fixed it will not be able to compete with Shogun II. I've always like the Total War games, but they're often set in such broad periods, with countries to conquer all over the map. That can be great, and many people like it about Total War games. But it can really bog down a play session, and sometimes it can get really silly. The more factions there are, the longer turns take, until you might as well go do something else with your time after you've hit end turn. And the broad timeframe can mean that you find yourself fighting dark age vikings with your army consisting of pike and shot.

Shogun II manages to avoid these pitfalls by being very narrow. The map consists of Japan, and nothing but Japan, and although there are several expansions set in different time frames, each of the campaigns stays within a reasonable narrow scope. This means the unit roster will not change much, and some may find fault with that. I like it, because it means you can really get a feel for your troops, and they never become useless. There are no large empires to carve out, and this may hold back those who are bent on world domination. But it does make for a much smoother experience gameplay wise, and it is also easier to keep track of things.

The AI usually is the main flaw in Total War games, and Shogun II is not a complete exception. I do feel though that the AI of Shogun II is the best we've seen yet, and all in all Shogun II provides a good challenge even to the veteran Total War player, especially if you choose some of the really difficult factions such as the Tokugawa. That old Togugawa Ieyasu certainly did not get things handed to him on a silver plate!

If there is one thing I would change about this game it is the sudden and anti-climactic Realm Divide. Suddenly age old alliances start to deteriorate, and everyone declares war on you. It feels really metagamey, and makes you wait for ages after you've hit the treshhold, and you know you can't conquer any more provinces or else you have to deal with that annoying Realm Divide. I find that the solution offered in Fall of the Samurai did it much better, as there you are divided between your collective enemies and your allies and friends.

But all in all I can definitely recommend Total War: Shogun II. If you would have to pick up just one Total War game, this would be it.",1380240252,1380240252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041720355,393,6,33611,0,31114,1565809556,,

 Tech trees resembling those from the Civilization series have been added, allowing for both added versatility and specialization in your choice of units. Also greatly enhances the 'peaceful' aspect of the game, allowing you to earn additional diplomatic and monetary bonuses outside of war. 

 General level system adds a befitting RPG turn to the series, combined with the tweaks to generals making them useless as piss as combat units that die instantly, this increases their precious nature and invites much more thought into how you'll proceed, as losing a general FUCKING SUCKS. 

 Excellent artistic direction, with faux-woodblock style picturing and calligraphic letters, this game has the strongest flavour of the TW series. 

 CONS:
 
 ASHIGARU FUCKING SUCK BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF TECHING COMBINED WITH THE SLOW TIME/EXPENSIVE COST OF SAMURAI UNITS MEANS YOULL BE FUCKING MASSING THEM ALL GAME, ESPECIALLY ON HARDER DIFFICULTIES.

В роли даймё — лидера одной из враждующих группировок — игрок должен вести боевые действия, заниматься экономической политикой и вести дипломатическую игру, чтобы добиться главной цели игры: объединения феодальной Японии в единое государство под властью клана игрока.

В сухопутных сражениях игрок командует армией. Армия делится на отряды, максимальное число отрядов — двадцать. Каждое подразделение имеет свои преимущества, недостатки, стоимость обучения и общий уровень эффективности.

Подразделения имеют определённый моральный уровень, который может увеличиваться, если битва проходит удачно, или уменьшаться при тяжелых потерях, гибели офицеров или в случае смерти генерала.

Осады принимают в учёт архитектуру японских замков, которая отличается от своих европейских аналогов. Японские замки состоят из нескольких террас, окружённых стенами. Высота каждой террасы зависит от рельефа. В Shogun 2 нет нужды строить осадные машины, хотя в состав армии и могут входит мангонелы (катапульты) и европейские пушки, которые не могут перемещаться во время боя. Все пешие войска способны карабкаться по стенам во время штурма замка. Чтобы захватить замок совсем необязательно уничтожить всех защитников. Достаточно пробиться к центральному зданию и захватить его. Войска также могут поджечь замковые врата, чтобы иметь более прямой доступ в замок и позволить кавалерии вступить в бой с защитниками. Также, кавалерия может спешиться чтобы залезть на стены. Крепостные башни могут быть захвачены во время штурма, как и различные здания присутствующие за стенами замка. Например, захват фермы повышает выносливость армии в этой битве, тогда как захват додзё лучников пополняет запасы стрел и аммуниции.

В «Shogun 2» разработчики вернули подбадривающие речи генералов перед боем. Все речи — на японском с субтитрами. В ней по возможности максимально точно описывается ситуация: кто противник, количество обеих армий, честь вражеского даймё, качества своего клана, и т. п.

Singleplayer- The global map is much easier to understand then in Napoleon or Empires, which is a big selling point for me.  Units seem balanced enough, in all three versions of the game with the exception of the navy unit with the cannon.

Multiplayer - The 1v1 coop/vs campaign is a lot of fun. Other modes are the drop in mode where you play the AI's side in other peoples campaign games, also fun. 
The rest of the modes, however, are garbage.  At this point in the game, the people you play against have usually already found the cheapest way to win.  The DLC factions have added some crazy units that are hard to deal with unless you're familier with them.

66,1617164,english,"Fun as hell. The combat is the main focus in this title of Total War. T.W. is known for its addicting combat, and in Shogun 2 its taken to another level. Unit variety is quite expansive, but mainly its hand to hand and bows for range with the occasional siege weapons and exotic units. Its just a freakin blast watching samurai charge eachother, mounted horseback units chasing down routing foes, archers launching mass flaming arrow volley towards a crowd of enemies, and everything in-between. Marching your armies through Japans provinces and claming them as your own, controlling resources and manipulating conquered provinces to fit your intentions, all whilest ranking up your generals and armies which is incredibly satisfying and well advantageous. The units are very responsive, so tactical planning and play is ideal, making most every battle unique.

Coming back to its roots, Shogun II provides crisp and well-developed naval battles, a leveling system for both agents and generals, and a reinvented castle development system that allows infastructure and taxation to develop the way you want it too. The AI still function with backstabbing prejudice and unit diversification between clans is lacking, but all in all the game is well-made, quite fun, and rather addicting.

I prefer Shogun II over Empire, but still, Shogun II doesn't have the feeling that Rome or Medieval II had the first time i've played them. To be honest I only played Shogun II for approximately 136 hours so far. It's more polished than Empire was on release, as of now Empire (not Napoleon) isn't exactly bad, but I just never liked the era, gunpowder and canons just don't cut it for me, I need raw army clashes with swords and shields and arrows, give me that any time over Empire. 

Additionally, I prefer the micro-management of your empire in both Rome and Medieval II, Empire's management of your forces and resources was streamlined/simplified, I never understood why since it was working fine the way it is in Rome and Medieval II, I guess they wanted to change it for the sake of trying something new, who knows. 

From what I've played of Shogun II it does feel better overall than Empire (the management). What I can say is that the beautiful graphics, the music and the cutscenes, the scale and size of the world map and the soldiers on it, make Shogun II with the ROTS and FOTS expansions a solid and brilliant game.

Might be slightly easier than previous games, but never felt overly easy, and definitely cut down on some of the situations in earlier games where every broken siege was followed by a train of another large AI controlled army. Battle map engagements are as fun and challenging as ever, but tend to go by the wayside later in the game, as the conquest map becomes your primary focus. If you like a game that takes some thought, this is one for you. Highly reccomended.",1356797330,1356797330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006184782,987,25,2831,0,2831.0,1348470000,,

Great graphics make this game easily addictable and grippingly exciting while easily counterbalanced with the weight of diplomacy and strategy that is vital to the success of not only an entire campaign, but each individual battle requires split decisions and a large amount of cunning strategy. 

Adding to the intellectual draw is the historical accuracy that says that this game was thoughtfully put together and not lightly made.

In fact, these leaders even appear in the game as generals to be commanded (provided you selected a certain clan). Beware, this game tends to slow down a bit towards the later stages, as even though the amount of clan's present tends to drop off sharply, the amount of control of those left vastly increases, and the AI takes a fair bit of time deciding what to do.

Each clan has specific bonuses, for example, the Oda having cheaper costing ashigaru that have better morale. 
Also, because the campaign have better Ai, you are forced to take more care in how you use your turn, sometimes having to turn to diplomacy, which has also been improved by adding the likely reaction to your offers and demands.

This one takes the best of all of them and adds a lot of new features and tech. While it still has the Empire model for taxing (1 tax for all towns) It allows you to exempt a town from taxes or to place a Matsuke/Monk in them to moderate their hapiness level. This adds more gameplay and purpose, as there are many more RPG elements for Generals, Heroes and Specialist characters now. 

I was floored with how many more RPG elements are in this than the others, with the Skill Tier systems for characters as well as bonus systems for over all class types. 
Diplomacy is more important in this game than any before it. It really makes you think about even little decision you make. Even on easy/short campaign, one wrong move could send your Clan spiraling out of control. 

Graphics are better than ever, sound is superb though initial loading times are a little longer due to scale.

95,188652,english,"so far one of the best entries into the total war series as it seems to take pretty much the best aspects of the previous games and mash 'em up.

personally I really like how you now have some degree of control on how your generals/characters develope(skill tree/semi random retainers), it makes you much more invested in them.

combat seems to be fine tuned and more responsive, positioning of your general is really vital to sucess due to the sphere of influene, so want to place him close to your troops but also avoid getting him killed.

graphics are gorgeous if you have the machine power for it(currently I don't :-( but I still enjoy it)

as for the bad things the two things I can think of is
1) loading times can be really long, especially the startup is tiring.
2) in some aspects the game is even slower than previous games, since a year is now 4 rounds rather than 2 it takes forever for your family-tree to expand.(e.g. sons first gets useful at age 16 so you have to play 1024 rounds)",1342266943,1342266943,True,0,0,0.458133071660995483,0,True,False,False,76561197964617326,475,26,7834,0,4502,1585445881,,

Also theres plenty of Multiplayer options including 2 player co-op campaign.

warning tho this game is taxing on your rig, unless you have a powerful PC you may have to upgrade to get it to play well,... the low settings may help a bit but take away so much of the details you really want a good PC to get the most out of this game.

It's a great addition to the Total War Franchise, it adds a lot of depth, and features, and also helped them recover from the failure that was Empire: total war.

The graphics are very good, as is the gameplay, micromanaging an empire isn't difficult and the game provides a decent challenge, save for the odd broken AI moments, but you can gloss over those as they don't happen too often.

Sadly, I can only give this game a seven out of ten, due to CTD issues it seems to have with my PC, while it's not game breaking and all the time, it's annoying to have to reload the game and continue again after it does so. Which also leads me on to another small flaw, loading into the game and getting to the main menu can sometimes take ages.

All players should be on a level playing field and the outcome should reflect who made better use of their money and had the better on-field strategy.

They went big with empire.

Shogun 2 is breathtaking in its depth, beauty, learning experience, opportunities for varied play, tactical reality, and the interplay of strategic characters and tactical elements -- such as whether your good general is still well enough to lead a battle or the castle gates are still bolted shut against the enemy as you remember them. You can zoom in so close as to hear the horses breathing, and when you do, you will see that each man's face and equipment vary as to the individuality of each character.

That said, the rock-paper-scissors interaction of the different units, while existing in every Total War game, is way too obvious here, and hurts the overall unit variety.

Players battle with various disciplines of Samurai, Ninjas, and even hero units, each unit-type wielding different weaponry.

Built in clan competition using steam, customisable general, and XP progression gives an overarching sense of progression to each multiplayer match. It could still use more patches to cut down on server problems/lag but the effort they've made has definitely paid off and I've already played more multiplayer Shogun 2 than I have the rest of the Total War titles combined.

Shogun 2 is a return to that Kurosawa-esque aesthetic, capturing the flair of Period Drama in the general atmosphere, ambience and graphics of the game.

Pre-battle speeches are back. Naval combat has been integrated into the game and adapted for Sengoku-era boats. Individual agents are much more effective and important, and an experience-tree system allows for robust customization.

There are a few downsides: A lack of topographical variation leads to similar battle maps (it is one island after all) and a lack of variety in the clans leads to a lower replay value.
