PES 2021 was awesome in first clean initial release. Fluid beautiful game of football. You could sense and see the difference from 2020, gameplay was polished and clean, it was a thing of beauty. Same as PES 2020 demo. Just a few days ago KONAMI released new patch and behold same ol problems are purposely forced back within game. Purposely wrong pass directions, terrible ball trapping, players refusing to go in to required positions etc. completely ruins the gameplay. If you hated PES 2020 and tought 2021 will be different don't hold your horses.

Game is not about skill anymore.  If you are constantly better than your oposition, game will put arbitrary limitations to your team to balance the game and make it more fair. Why they do it? To help new players don't get crushed by more skilled players.

PES 2022 won't be any different regardless the new engine. KONAMI have taken EA approach and will continue to do so. Arbitrary limitations and handicaps for skillful players, trying to shift focus to get people to go online and play MyClub is KONAMI new forte. FIFA have been doing it for years. Now PES will do the same in the coming years.

PES as you know it and remember it before, a beautiful game of football and skill is gone and is NEVER coming back. And neither am I.  Don't buy this game if you think you will enjoy playing and have fun. You wont. For 1 or 2 game everything will be ok and then everything will be frustration. Rinse and repeat. I'm uninstalling it from my PC and I'm never coming back. Goodbye PES.

If Konami doesn't want you to win a game, you will never win this. You will get 2 or more penalties in game against you, your players will be uncontrollable, passes will be wrong, your players would't get the ball even if it 2cm from them, you will miss at 2 meters from empty net but your opponent will score every moment that he will get because of your players can't use passing correctly. In some games situation will be the same but you will be on lucky side. But there is no pleasure to play the game if you haven't any influence on the result of the game. There will be always win of player chosen randomly by Konami scripts. 
Goals on 90+ minute in 6 matches in a row? Free penalties? Players that really uncontrollable and missing from 2-3 meters? It's all about PES 2021. 
I have a games to compare online in it. I've played FIFA series from 2007 to 2020 and PES from 2013 to 2020. This game is worst of all in online gaming experience.
Handicap in a part of every football game, but in this part of PES it's too much.
Playing online is useless and unpleasant in PES 2021.

Stellar AI defense that will outrun, chase you down, errant passes, Never really sure how your through ball passes will go. Even the softest pass forward may send the ball rocketing by your intended target. And on the flip side your harder hit through balls seem to have 5 pounds of lead inside barley moving along. Bad, and lets be clear here. Bad, Bad, well just plain horrible officiating. Don't bother trying to slide tackle. You will get called for it and most likely carded as well. I mean yeah. The officiating really ruins the game on it's own. 

Too bad really. Unlike that Pace whoring other game known as FIFA this game really lets you break a team down and really lends well to building up chances to score on goal. I dunno. I guess a game that's been around for this long shouldn't have such horrible game play as this. But alas, It's all about the money anymore isn't it? And btw. My Club looks to cost a small fortune to get the players in you want. Dare i say even more than FIFA? Why can't we just bid on players? Props to EA.

58,76868230,english,"After 15 years of playing FIFA every year, I was finally converted to PES last year. FIFA feels better in some ways, but PES does in others. PES 2020 was a slower, more methodical game than FIFA, in which it mattered more what the stance of the player is when giving a pass than in FIFA, for instance, and where shots more easily just fly off into space if you don't choose carefully when to press the shoot button. Getting the hang of these mechanics often meant that goals scored were more satisfying because they felt more earned, and that appealed to me. PES also looks great in its own right, and has heaps of bespoke animations that can make certain team plays feel more unique. But on the flip side, FIFA's close control just feels better. In FIFA, all players feel like Messi-like geniuses of ball control and passing, whereas in PES, they feel like average footballers at times, but you can still pull off amazing moves with regularity if you learn how to manage the game's rhythm. There is a place for both of these styles to co-exist, in my opinion, with neither being outright better than the other.

That brings me to PES 2021. One of the reasons on-field players felt like less capable footballers at times in PES 2020 was because the close control simply felt bad. Tackle collisions felt like the ones you would have in FIFA 6 years ago, and the skill moves system, which supposedly had been upgraded with the input of Andrès Iniesta, was straight-up terrible in my opinion. Say what you will about momentum, but even the best players in the world moved like heavily-loaded trucks at times in PES 2020. Konami updated the game many times and at some point seemingly made the game play worse than before, but the final update in the summer made the game reasonably good. This positive endpoint came at the end of a long year of weird changes, though.

So, the biggest thing about PES 2021 is that it makes that gameplay feel even tighter than PES 2020 did at its most fluid best. The tweaks that have been made were small, but the sum of them is impactful for ""feel"" of the game: the  the skill move controls feel better, players are more responsive, and the whole game speed also seems slightly faster. What you end up with is a game that still has all of the things that made PES 2020 a very good football game on the pitch, and also has elements that make it feel closer to FIFA at times. PES 2021 feels more fluid than PES 2020 did. That said, FIFA is still a fair bit faster and more fluid still, so PES 2021 feels like the more deliberate game despite all of the above. They are still very different. 

There are still times when the game feels somewhat stilted though; it is no FIFA. Off the pitch, the game is also genuinely unchanged, with menus that look more aged than time itself. The manager mode is good, but nothing to get truly excited about. I don't play these games online at all, I simply stick to quick matches and the manager mode, so I can't comment on other aspects. 

The changes are welcome, though the game could still stand to have a slightly better flow at times. And it is by no means FIFA, even though it feels faster than last year. But to sum it up: the on-field action is great. If the game had been completely unchanged from last year, like the marketing blurb on the Steam page says it would be, saying whether or not it was worth the 25 - 30 euros would be more difficult. But the improved gameplay for me easily makes it worth upgrading to me. If upgraded squads and slightly but noticeably improved gameplay sound like they might be worth the budget price to you, I can recommend you to get it.",1601568625,1601568625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198969545186,268,8,582,455,445,1601786653

63,76858369,english,"PES 2021 is an excellent football game with a raft of fun and addictive modes. 

I really like this game. In contrast to Fifa, which I used to play, it feels like a proper football simulator based on realism and good build-up play. To be good at this game you have to utilise space and come up with clever passing combinations rather than just dribbling past your opponent with quick players  (a strategy that seems to work like a charm on a rival title *cought* Fifa *cough*). 

Pes is a game for football purists. If you want a slower, methodical incarnation of the sport then you'll feel at home playing this title. 

I used to have issues when it came to online play with the Pes series. Past games have been riddled with lag and, as a result, have been virtually unplayable online. However, the issue appears to have been sorted and this latest title is smooth as butter. I have played 20+ matches and not a single one has suffered from serious lag. 

My favourite mode is probably MyClub, in which you assemble a team of (usually) superstar players and take on others online. Squad-building is a lot of fun and coming up with good player combinations is a decent challenge. On paper, a front-line with three world-class Premier League superstars might look good, but, for one reason or another (play style, lack of chemistry, etc), they might not 'gel'. This keeps squad-building fun - I am constantly tinkering with my line-up and trying to come up with better player combinations. It isn't just a case of unthinkingly throwing together a load of top players. You really do have to find players that work for your own unique style of play, and this might mean omitting someone who is a superstar on-paper.  

I enjoy playing against teams with different play styles on MyClub. I come across human opponents who play a direct, counter-attacking system, while others might favour a more patient approach. As a former Fifa Ultimate Team player, this is hugely refreshing. Ultimate Team players adopted the same play style every game, which involved passing to a quick winger and then spamming the right trigger...

Overall, an excellent football title, and I can't wait to sink hundreds of hours into it until the next gen iteration comes out in 2020. Highly recommend.

CONS:
-The movement and everything the players do is so clunky compared to how it used to be. 
-Professional world class players somehow can't take a good first touch
-No one can run with the ball. I you even sprint for a second you get shoved off the ball
-The interceptions are so unpredictable (The ""derp mode"" when everyone is fumbling for the ball is far worse than ever.)
-Free kicks are WAY TOO EASY TO SCORE. If you foul anywhere within 35YDs it's almost a guaranteed goal.
-Strength is OP. Pick tall, high strength players and be prepared to win every single tackle easily. 
-There are game-breaking exploits like being able to BLOCK THE GK IN CO-OP on free kicks. 
-You still can't add filters to matchmaking i.e. Co-op against other co-op teams, not a player with AI team mates. Or play against others using manual controls only. Also you can't just play against real teams. It's always against myClub teams.
-The friends list system and match room stuff is soooo bad. No integration for steam friends list or anything. Want to play co-op? Ok go browse servers and do all this other bs. Just a huge lack of online features. Want to play a random selection match with a friend online? Too bad, local matches only. 
-They give way too much away on myClub. Very few players should have a full black ball team the first week of release if any at all. They make it too easy to get the best players. Why is it that EVERY OPPONENT HAS ALL THE ICONS AND FULL BLACK BALL BENCH?? It would be better to be forced to play with an ok team that is 3-star rated maybe a gold or two. Nope, it's white ball team then straight to black ball right away. This makes it so unrewarding. 
-Player switching mechanics are worse. Like the ball will move through a player right by the ball and it won't let you switch. Changing to manual or whatever did not help.
-Every player online just pings it up top and 1-2 passes thru ball and that's it. That's because it is the only style in this version that gets rewarded.
-You can score off kickoff by sending your passer on a run after kickoff then just long thru and it works 50% of the time because of horrible marking AI on def.
-Still uses peer-to-peer connection, no dedicated matchmaking servers which leads to shit connection and lag.
-Huge amount of cheaters in the game. I come up against myClub teams with the ENTIRE TEAM RATED 109 which is impossible. It would come out to 99 in every stat and there is a training level limit that prevents this so WTF. 
-Nothing else other than what is mentioned above has changed from the older versions. So essentially the gameplay has gone way downhill. Graphics, data packs, and whatnot is pretty much the same as it has been. 

PROS:
none 

What to do: Don't buy. Wait for the new engine in PES 2022 and pray that it is better.

The AI seems to get dumber with every iteration. Thankfully this is the last one on the Fox Engine, which has been a dreadful engine for PES. 

Pros: Great player likenesses. Great lighting and shadow effects. Dribbling is very good (although ruined by dumb AI moving out your way). Full Manual controls in enjoyable. 

Cons. Very stupid AI who constantly move out of your way instead of trying to tackle you. CPU controlled teammates unaware the ball is right in front of them, so they don't take possession of it and the game doesn't change you into that player, forcing your to give up possession. Player switching is terribly inconsistent. Presentation and commentary is stuck in 2010. Midfield is not required, the game is simply about who can score the most, ignoring the fact in real football you can defend well and steal the win with a single goal. Referees are completely useless, blatant fouls are let go, whilst clean tackles are punished. 

Ultimately, i play this game simply for my love of football, but i don't recommend it. And wouldn't even call it enjoyable. The AI is far too dumb, the game leans far too much towards attacking, rendering the midfield pointless and the defence an afterthought. The frustrations far outweigh the enjoyable parts. 

PES used to be a tactical battle, in terms of formations, tactics and lineups along with midfield battles and decision making like when to press, when to sit, when to push forward. Now its just a sprint and shoot game, like FIFA. 

Thankfully, the Fox engine is dead and Konami are moving to Unreal. Hopefully they can recapture what PES used to be.

66,76597731,english,"WHAT HAPPENED TO FREEDOM IN THIS GAME?! (maybe in PES 2020 its same or worse?)

After almost a decennia coming back to PES, this is my thought: ""WTF HAPPENED?!""
I dont know how many times i got tilted over this A.I. So many cases where the game FORCES bad decision for u. 
Literally out of the players hands....

When playing a ""bad"" team against a ""good"" team is where u start to understand everything wrong with the A.I.
Suddenly the exact same players that played in the previous game, cant pass or control the ball anymore. (i timed it... it literally takes almost a full second longer to control a passing ball over just 2 meters. Or that pass over 2 meters suddenly just goes to space.)

****playing against a better stats team, means A.I starts making stupid mistakes for u (because thats what the lesser stat team shoulod be doing or something?!?!?! *****

Also the gauge bar that makes u ""control"" how fast u pass or shoot the ball...Why is it there? How many times i slow passed a ball and the game is like..nope, it will go mach 6 again.
5% filled gauge bar EQUALS 70% gauge bar filled in SO MANY CASES!!!!!!

Besides all of this, the Game A.I just FORCES u to make mistake that u didnt make at all just to ""balance"".
This means that U as a player have a phantom control over the game, because before u start the Game already decided u to lose, draw or win and will make sure this happens. (this is seriously starting to become truth the more I play)

Selecting what player to control. I'm not even starting on this. 2 choices and u have to accept it's not gonna be the one u want to control. So this means u are watching your defense letting players go, without u being able to do something about it, because u can only select a player that might aswell be sitting on the bench...

I'll stop for now, cuz this will be a complete Novel if i continue...Unless u arer having s much fun reading my intens pains and frustrations. More less so dissappointed after purchase :O",1601128107,1601128107,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198036390421,35,1,1563,1563,896,1601847938

Pros:
	Pacing: I can say that the pacing of the game is spot-on, a huge difference from the 2020 version, which had pretty horrendous gameplay.
	Graphics: Pretty good.
	AI makes better tactical decisions.
Cons:
	Online: Takes way too long to find an online opponent, high latency.
	Bugs: Players randomly letting the ball slip by them, players with 80+ passing screwing up simple passes, CPU scoring off every free kick.
	CPU takes advantage of ""turn and shoot"" gimmick, my defender will be glued to the striker when suddenly the striker turns and shoots effortlessly while not even facing the goal, goes in 75% of the time.
	Fouls: BLATANT fouls being simply IGNORED by the referees.
	Goalkeepers: Please fix the animations. When they dive they look like they're flying like superman.
	More fitting styles for kits: The player models are good, but the shirt sizing is somewhat wonky, perhaps add a tight kit option that fits more snug to the torso.",1600970988,1600971744,False,50,3,0.72814410924911499,0,True,False,False,76561199088891991,3,1,2033,1022,1387,1601486154

20,76372086,english,"So this is a ""Season Update"" since PES devs are busy making PES 2022 with Unreal Engine 5, which means this game is almost the same with PES 2020.
However, there are a couple of differences, and to be honest, they're not nice changes at all.

Unfortunately, the game has been dumbed down big time.
-Goalkeepers are almost useless, any player can score outside from the box like they're freakin' Batistuta, right in the corner. And top players like van Basten or Rummenigge can even score while they're under huge pressure.
-Also the passing system is a mess. Even while you are facing away from your teammate, you are able to pass the ball with almost 100% accuracy.
The online script can still break these obviously but you know the script interferes and affects many dynamics in the game and it's just another evil.

Anyway, gameplay-wise, these are the two biggest differences I've experienced so far compared to PES 2020.
For the rest, you can read my review about PES 2020 [url=steamcommunity.com/id/k1nJo/recommended/996470] here[/url] as they still apply to this day(except the super-cancel bug).

But since the game is cheaper, I'll give a thumb up only to support Konami for the sake of PES 2022, so I hope our support this year isn't for nothing and PES 2022 can rival FIFA in all aspects and not just gameplay.

Edit: Actually, I changed my mind. And I'm changing my review to negative cuz it is fkn aids.
-Defending in a football game by pressing 2 buttons shouldn't be praised. It is so bad that if you wanna defend manually it punishes you. It feels like there is no skill gap between players, maybe except top 1%, but for the rest, for 3 consecutive years now it's like I'm playing against the same guy. It is disgusting.
-Also, a football game with a dead dribbling system shouldn't be praised.
-And a game mode (matchday) which forces you to play against someone who's literally 11000 kilometers away shouldn't be praised as well.

This is a garbage game, stay away from it, at least from the online modes if you little care about your mental health.",1600770747,1600879708,False,12,2,0.632629454135894775,0,True,False,False,76561198046944185,97,5,13176,9503,5558,1601858924

Come to think of it, it's scripted not only on the side of the game, but also on the players: the game actually rewards ridiculous repetitive plays such as running to one of the corners and passing inside the area. Not to mention the scripted long ball at kick-off and corner kicks.

Just pathetic. Long gone are the days of actual skill and merit. Long gone are days in which you are actually rewarded for dribbling and for trying to come up with beautiful plays.

Cons:
- One of the commentators speech is not fluid
- Commentators often misrepresent plays. For instance, a bicycle kick that the keeper blocks might be labeled as a poor attempt at goal.

MyClub is fun as card-collecting mode. Game runs smoothly during gameplay* in 60FPS on a far from top PC (i-3 4160, R9 270, 8GB RAM DDR3) on medium settings. (Drops to 50-55 on high)

*excluding cutscenes/celebration close-ups, it's not a big issue since you don't control anything at those moments

Minuses: Online. Haven't found a match earlier than 10 minutes in yet. Connection tends to worsen A LOT during the match itself (and no, it's not an issue with my internet). MyClub has way less functions than FUT; and there aren't any special modes offline - player career, manager career, quickplay, that's about it.

$25 vs $70 is a good argument though



Summary: if you want to hop in once in a while, play a few games, maybe lead a club for a few seasons, make a nice squad in online card-collecting mode without the need for spending hundreds of bucks - take PES.

If you just want to grind/spend some money instead in an online mode, or have a wider choice of gamemodes - think you'd be better off getting FIFA.",1600387519,1600387519,True,12,0,0.657309472560882568,4,True,False,False,76561198115868913,130,8,1228,187,505,1601083543

Awesome mods for pes - kits, balls, turf, stadiums, scoreboards, leagues, licences etc you name it. The gameplay and atmosphere is fantastic, the only negative is, I am getting tired of the same old commentary year after year saying the same lines.
I played a full season of Master League in PES 2020 & had a lot of great games. The scripted play is still around as the cpu goes tryhard around the 60th minute when they are losing but you can counter this with your strategies.

83,76083475,english,"Here's an honest review after an hour and 20 minutes of gameplay. For those people looking to buy this game because of huge improvements in gameplay and other new features, you are going to be dissappointed. This as most of you may be aware is just a season update, hence no significant gameplay changes. So why should I upgrade from Pes 2020, you may ask? Well if you are looking to play online, then it is must. There are also tiny gameplay changes such as minor tweaks to passing and dribbling which make it bit more bearable. Another thing is the pitches have finally been realistically designed as opposed to the arcady pitches in 2020. The passing is totally realistic and feels more crisper this year compared to last year. The UI has been slightly more polished. For those who are solely interested in offline modes such as Master League, you will be dissappointed as they are largely the same as 2020.One con i can think of is the dribbling where players often run into each other instead of avoiding or going around them.; or when a slow ass player manages to outrun speedy players., This is one of the areas which MUST be addressed in PES 2022. Another issue is the shooting mechanic, specially the finesse/curling shots which still feel like slow motion. This is one area where PES can massively improve over FIFA. Finally the pricing of the game at £24.99/ $30 may feel like a bit much for just a season update. Personally I would have priced this around $5 dollar less but its not like FIFA every year where they make miniscule changes and charge a premium price.To sum up , Pros-1. Best Football Simulator in 2020.2. Passing is the best ever designed in a football game3. The customizations such as adding stadiums, teams and leagues as well as other stuff like scoreboards, adboards, chants etc.Cons- 1. Dribbling needs to be improved significantly.2. Shooting feels the same as 2020, like the slow motion curling shots3. Price of $30 may be a bit much for just minor changesOverall Rating - 7.5/10",1600283020,1600283020,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198157756908,122,7,1434,439,84,1601834316

20,76062886,english,"Reviewing this from the perspective of a Fifa player that has finally jumped ship this year to PES. Do not feel tempted to choose the alternative control scheme for Fifa players, honestly around the second half of the first match you'll get the controls down, and you're better off sucking for the first game, and using the default controls, which I feel are quite intuitive, versus settling for familiarity honestly. This is just the same version of PES as 2020, hence the 'season update', however this is made clear from the off, and is reflected in the price. If that bothers you, just be aware of the fact, however as someone new to the franchise, who never played 2020, I'm not bothered by it, and welcome a cheaper new football game.Now the controls have hooked, and I'm three matches in, I must say presentation, and gameplay wise, it's a far superior product to Fifa, and I am a happy convert. In regards to optimisation, there's a huge frame rate disparity with resolutions that differs too wildly to what I would consider just normal. For example playing at 1080p I am averaging 190 fps, however I struggle to reach 50fps at 4k, which is rather strange. Also if you see one of your favourite teams has their own edition, the 5 quid upgrade is worth it.

If all you wanna do is play offline mode such as MyLeague (Manager career mode on fifa) this game is currently not worth it because the full transfer update won't be released until October 22th.

I tried to give one more chance to PES with the 2021, because basically FIFA went nuts with UT and ridicolous game modes like Volta (jeez that was seriously abysmal).

So this was more an act of desperation and... surprise, surprise...

this time it paid off at least about the gameplay. 

This new release imo is smooth and very close to what I played in the 2020 demo and for the first time in years I had fun playing with PES. 

There are some negative aspects that I noticed so far,the  lack of official licenses (is a war between Konami and EA), the referee whistle is so unnatural and the menu is counterintuitive.

 For example to exit to desktop ya gotta click options. 

The ML is nice, but the menu is awful at the best, the contents are nice and also a lot of good features to go in depth in the training to let your players grow as you desire, and this is FAR better than the lazy FIFA system.

You cant perform 1-2 chemistry in this game anymore, the player is either too slow for a return pass or perform it poorly. The only way to score in this game is to do a lofted pass and HOPEFULLY the opponent defender will miss the ball and your striker can score. Goalkeeper IQ is lowered, no more insane save, which I think it's a good thing. 

Defending in this game suck too, all you need to do is run toward the ball since 1-2 chemistry is removed, defending now is just about who has better balance, and guess what, your defender always win. 

Crossing is a pain in the ass when you cant perform a quick cross but the player has to take a step back and cross like an amateur chicken on every Sunday league. I'm not sure if it's just me or it's the game design,  but I have extreme input lag. I cant just quick press the button then override it to trick the other player or perform a quick 1-2 anymore, I have to wait for at least 1 second after the player receive the ball that I can do something about it.
