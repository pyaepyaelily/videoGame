Asesprite has afforded me the ability to create dreadful pixel art and feature (bug) rich pixel art games the likes of which Bethesda would be proud.
There's a reason you see Aseprite talked about a lot in pixel art circles (squares?) on the internet. It's a fantastic bit of software that's continually updated and if there are any bugs, I've yet to find one. It's not perfect, for example I use Pyxel Edit for tile maps as it really can't be beaten for that, but it's not far off being perfect.
The Dev cares, he even gives the source code away on his Github but he deserves every penny imo. If you're serious about Pixel Art buy it. In fact, I'd be disappointed if you haven't already.
Quick tip: If you're worried about canvas size may I recommend 1 by 1. It's the only size I can work in.

From all the sprite-making tools available and even the programs unsuited for it, there is no doubt in my mind that Aseprite deserves the top spot. I have been using it for months now, and it works well for those new and old in sprite-making. I really can't recommend it enough for its price tag and work. Easy 10/10.

[h1]The Long Review: [/h1]
I first started my ""spriting"" journey using Microsoft Paint, a tool hard to use, even for art forms considered simple. Eventually, I grew tired of Paint's hardships and went looking for tools specifically designed with sprites in mind. I found two: Aseprite and Piskel. As Piskel was free, I decided to test it out first but found it quite rough around the edges and just lacking overall. So taking the positive reviews and the price tag to heart, I decided to pay the $10 for Aseprite, and a better decision, I could not have made.

Having used it for almost 350 hours, Aseprite is the gift that keeps on giving. It has an interface suited for both the beginners and advanced, a large variety of built-in colour palettes as well as the function to create one's own, a proper use for every tool available and a constant flow of updates from the hard-working developers. Aseprite has not failed me once in the time I have used it, and I can't imagine it will in the many more hours planned ahead. Easy 10/10.",1598008063,1598008063,True,6,0,0.566787004470825195,0,True,False,False,76561198262269600,84,1,21529,1,20550,1601568536,,

Some people, for some reason I'll NEVER understand, look down on it because of the pixelated interface. Like ""Seriously, the UI looks like crap"" JUST BECAUSE IT IS PIXELATED! I heard you can even use UI skins on it, but I find it extremely charming AND easy to read thanks to the larger pixelated fonts. (That said, I'll look for a darker UI someday~) And just so you know, an equally good pixel art program for Android has the same visual style for its UI.

Dumb 'issues"" about the UI aside, let's go into the features. Mirror editing, Tile editing, animation, layers, onion skin, pixel-perfect images, special rotation tool to lose as little as possible when rotating pixelated images, alpha channel/transparencies, color levels and channels, custom palletes and so much more that I didn't even scratch the surface yet. 

You could always use some free tools, they may have their own pros and cons in regards to what they can do, and while things like gimp will certainly be -stronger- than this tool, it has certain specific features that helps IMMENSELY compared to programs that focus on larger images without losing their most advanced features and adding its own flavor in the mix.

As an artist and graphic designer, Aseprite is something I wish I knew about sooner.

Oh. Oh my. This thing has pressure sensitivity now.
(AND you can find it for free on linux, or if you compile it, but darn is it worth the pocket change they're charging for it! Either way, it works even on a Raspberry Pi 3b+)

Little correction here, while you CAN compile it from a certain repository or simply install from one of the many Linux Distros' ""app store"", that is an old version. While I'm glad that it works on a raspberry, If you want this for free you're better off supporting Libreprite: Someone took the code and is advancing its development by themselves.

It has completely replaced my workflow for developing assets for my games. It has made it incredibly easy to quickly get animations working in game, and also allows for defining many ""points of interest"" within a sprite, by using the Slice functionality, such as bounding boxes and slots.

It does all of the above by allowing you to tag your animations, and assign metadata to slices. Exporting your spritesheet can also include the export of a JSON file including all of the data about frames, animations and slices, which can then be parsed in your game - so there is no need to really use another tool for this, such as Spine, or by writing your own custom editor, unless you need more than what Aseprite provides.

It is surprising that no other sprite tool has natively offered all of that. Even something as simple as the slice tool is a huge game changer. Another suprising thing for me is, that this is not mentioned ANYWHERE on their store page, although it's the main reason I use the tool. I've contacted other developers of other tools that add something similar to their software, and many have declined, or not followed up.

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
[*]One of the most used software for Pixel Art, and thus, it have a very alive community, with his own forums and artists doing wonders to help/show what Aseprite is capable of

[*]Compared to other programs like Photoshop, Aseprite is totally focused on Pixel Art, and that's good, because there's some options and things that you wouldn't see in your normal editing program, like the ""Pixel Perfect"" option, which if you activate it, your lines will not have Doubles (which is a common problem for beginners in this kind of art)

[*]It's beginner-friendly, so you can basically learn everything about the software in a lot less of time, compared to other programs like the already mentioned Photoshop

[*]You can add scripts to Aseprite, which can add a lot of things, like exporting to a file such as APNG, for example

[*]You can animate in Aseprite, and separate each animation with tags (for example, one tag for a walk-cycle, another tag for an attack animation, and another tag for an idle animation), so you can basically know where to find certain animation in your work

[*]It's a lightweight software, so you don't need to worry about it using so much memory or taking so much space in your PC

[*]You can even add community-made skins to it! Which change the appearance of Aseprite, most of these can be found on GitHub

[*]It lets you export your work in a bigger resolution, which respects the original canvas/sprite size
[/list]
And those are some of the PROS that Aseprite have

[*]If you can't understand English quite well, I'm sorry for you, because Aseprite is only available in that language

Onion animation, tagging for sprite sheet export with JSON file with many options, tiling, customizable grid, and it seems to be at the same time small enough that I can see someone becoming a full expert at this program.

AND it's cheap. And I heard that source code is free to compile too, modify it as well. But not to redistribute compiled thing nor the purchased exe. My impression of reading FAQ is that this is a decision made by main dev who used to go fully free open source but saw too much how often open-source project bleed down and wanted to live off product as well.

I am not sure how it works for companies however. But this tool is so good and cheap, you ought to buy it anyway, it fully deserves it.

Through Global Epidemics, this team will bring us new content.

Incredibly Highly recommended- even if you're a noob, you can get very far with this application
This Application is your best friend and tutor to producing animations with small graphics, 


and   paving the way for you to learn your ideas small before you go big. It is amazing.

 The animation building alone with an onion layer-customizable too, and frame rate, etc. everything is up to you. 

The price alone, is well worth it. Bought it off special, because of a review, and I've loved it.
 
P.s. It's DRM free- so once you own this, you may use it on any PC YOU Operate, and let life be a pixelated bliss.

Watching so many videos right now on how to get good at this,  THEORY Before PRactice :)

Notes; Wacom Intuos Pro and Intuos 4 works well  :)   
Windows 10 was easily compatible with this product. x

-Game Dev is very easy; with a built in exporting method for sprite sheets, Aseprite is incredibly useful for Game Development. If you make pixel art games, Aseprite is a must.
-COST EFFICIENT; small, one time payment is incredibly worth it, If you use pixel animation to any degree, the price is worth it.

I've got 50 hours in it, so I can do some review now.
[b]I'm not an pixel artist or artist itself. I just like pixel art much.[/b]
[b]Also, I didn't use any other application for pixel art at all. It means I can't compare it with anything else, except Adobe Photoshop. But we all know that no one in sane mind will be using it for pixel art. I mean, seriously, did you see how long does it starts?[/b]

Long story short, [b]Aseprite[/b] is like if god would have sex with [b]Blasphemous[/b]. (no pun intended) It is still an example of great pixel art, right?
https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/

To express it in a bit longer way: this app has everything you can need to do solid pixel art. I mean, it has a brush. What else would you need?

But jokes aside. Some of it's features:
[list]
[*]rotation of an image with saving the proportions
[*]a grid for proper pixel placing
[*]timeline
[*]layers
[*]onion skin
[*]pretty good palette settings, you can filter the colors by its hue
[*]timeline tags. It created not just so you could remember where does any animation starts/ends. It also can be helpful when you want to play some animation separately from the others, or when you need to export just one of many animations in your project
[*]exporting all the frames in one sprite sheet
[*]exporting as .gif without the pain in your arse
[/list]

Of course, the feature list is much longer. I doubt that you won't find some feature that you really need. But if you do, you can find an extension that does your thing. Or you can code it yourself. Info for [b]Aseprite[/b] API is available on it's [url=https://github.com/aseprite/api#aseprite-api]GitHub[/url] page.

As far as I competent (and I'm not) in pixel art, I can say, that you probably will not switch Aseprite to anything else once you've started using this. It is really good.

Я провисел в приложении уже 50 часов, так что могу сделать некоторые выводы.
[b]Я не являюсь художником или пиксель арт художником даже уровня любителя. Мне просто нравится пиксель арт.[/b]
[b]Также я не пользовался больше никаким софтом для рисования пиксель арта, поэтому сужу исключительно это приложение, без внимания к другим. Это значит, что сравнить приложение я могу разве что с Adobe Photoshop, но мы все знаем, что его для пиксель арта станут использовать только извращенцы. Нет, серьезно, вы видели сколько он запускается?[/b]

Если выражаться кратко, то это 10/10 на кончиках [b]Blasphemous[/b]. Он ведь все еще считается показателем отличного пиксель арта, верно?
https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/

Если выражаться более обширно, приложение имеет множество полезных функций для пиксель арта, список которых постоянно расширяется, и они улучшаются со временем. В смысле, здесь есть кисть. Что вам еще нужно?

А если без шуток, мы имеем:
[list]
[*]вращение изображения с сохранением пропорций
[*]сетка для ровного расположения пикселей
[*]таймлайн
[*]поддержка слоев
[*]onion skin
[*]полная настройка палитры, включая фильтр цветов в ней по оттенкам
[*]теги таймлайна, благодаря которым можно не только не забыть где начало/конец той или иной анимации, но и проигрывать эти анимации отдельно от других. А также делать экспорт отдельных анимаций из всего таймлайна
[*]экспорт всего файла со всеми кадрами в виде листа спрайтов
[*]экспорт анимации как .gif без [strike]СМС и регистрации[/strike] боли
[/list]

Очевидно, что список функций, в целом, огромный, вряд ли есть что-то такое, что может понадобиться, а его здесь нет. Но если вдруг почему-то нужной функции нет, можно найти расширение, которое ее добавляет. Или написать самостоятельно. Информация по API [b]Aseprite[/b] доступна на [url=https://github.com/aseprite/api#aseprite-api]GitHub[/url] проекта.

-Has a unique UI (reminds me of an old computer, which helps get into the mood of pixel art)
-Is a very professional product compared to free options
-A few channels/video series about pixel art that use this software on YouTube (which makes the tutorials easy to follow)

Cons:

It's got the most friendly and apt UI a software of it's kind has, and is a joy to boot up sometimes simply because of it's wonderful interface which always puts me in the zone for making pixel art. It feels like the right tool, and that makes a big difference.

Coming from Photoshop, and with not much experience in pixel art, it's taken a bit of time for me to learn how to make something look good- but that's got nothing to do with Aseprite as there's really nothing here I can see which holds one back. The shortcuts are easy to learn and while there aren't as many for obvious reasons, they're very similar to Photoshop in lots of ways. So if you're also coming from Photoshop it won't be too different luckily. I've tried other software dedicated to pixel art and sprite creation like GameMaker's editor and Pyxel Edit but they just don't do it for me like Aseprite does, with it's clean & easy to use interface. 

I'd say if you're looking to get into pixel art, pick this up. It's damn friendly for beginners with it's built-in palette presets, the new outline tool, and the many tutorials available on YouTube which will help you make your pixel art faster & look better, along with learning the hotkeys so you can even further speed up your workflow.

Aseprite also has the powerful capability of creating animations in the layer window which I haven't really tried yet, but I have heard from those who use Aseprite for animating that it's brilliant, and is many people's favourite software for creating sprite animations & pixel art animations- so do look into the features there if that's what you plan to use it for.

The devs are also top-notch, and they seem to be continuing to improve Aseprite as time goes on.

Animations took longer to create and load, and my spritesheets had to be manually measured pixel by pixel, which made the process tedious. Whether or not I was using PS right doesn't matter anymore because Aseprite fixed all the problems I had with PS and PDN.

Good saving / export options, good palette options, good preferences / customizable keys, good hints such as grids / onion skins and so on.

The interfaces own pixel style might be a little weird for some, but otherwise there's not a huge drawback to it.  Recommended.

edt: After testing it again a few years later I'm unfortunately going to change my thumbs up to a down for now.  I still think it's one of the best pixel art programs there could be but there's currently a bug that randomly changes low contrast colors when converting from an RGB image to a Index color image (even if there's less than 256 colors in the palette).  If it were a recent bug I'd just wait a bit but the problem is they've known about it for 3 YEARS now.

There's not an overwhelming amount of features like you'd get in other programs that aren't pixel art-specific, which is great for streamlining work and not getting distracted by excess UI and options. The program's smoothing feature for drawing (to removed jagged edges) actually works quite well, though not perfect, of course. Given the nature of pixel art, being able to quickly retrieve palettes is extremely helpful.

My only two gripes are that the UI is done in pixel art, which can make the font difficult to read sometimes. Additionally, as others have mentioned, the file browsing UI isn't very good. However, these are minor issues.

90,50311609,english,"Aseprite is amazing. 9/10 stars. I'll explain why I didn't give it that last star right after I show why it deserves the other 9.

You can move, resize, paint, draw, contour, select, spray, make transparent, animate, and do much much more. The limits to this app are just expanded day by day, and I find myself learning how to improve my workflow at astronomical rates. Its tools compared to other pixel editors are far superior, and if you have $15 to spare, it is definitely worthwhile to sink into this product. PiskelApp is a good alternative, but Aseprite can offer many more advantages if you are serious about creating. 

Some of the things Aseprite offers (+9 stars for this reason):
The layering+transparency makes excellent art creation. Animation frames+fps tools make creating game characters much simpler than other animation programs. You can also select highly specific areas to contain pixel art within those boundaries. Tools such as symmetry and perfect sizing for squares and circles are common, and I use them frequently. It is possible to change all of one color in a scene to an entirely different color using the fill tool. There's many other little tricks and tools that start becoming apparent over time the more you use this program. 

The only issues I've had (-1 star for this reason):
Resizing is not perfect in how it's done. Piskelapp just seems to be better in this aspect. Additionally, exporting sprite sheets at a larger size is also not currently supported, although you can resize gifs on export. Of course, this can be done beforehand, but the option for it would be nice to include since it exists on gif exports already. I haven't had issues in any other aspects, but if I come across them, I will update. Rest assured though, that in such a case, they can only be minor because in my many hours of usage, I have not come upon such struggles. 

Final Takeaway:
The one thing I think that really makes me love this app though, something that isn't really thought about after using it for a while, is the beautiful user interface. Everything, including windows, tools, animation frames, layers, and menus is pixelated, which makes the whole experience feel like building pixelated creations within a pixelated environment.

29,48950934,english,"it's a mixed review; the program does what it wants to and it does it fairly well, but there's plenty of problems that hold it back from being an amazing pixel art program.

for example, there's no way to move something through motion tweens, so if you want to move a sprite from point A to B, you have to do that manually which can look choppy if not done perfectly. the only way to animate in aseprite is traditional and that's fine if you're used to that.

a problem i had when learning how to use the program is finding out little things about tools; such as the shading tool only working on colours that are on its palette, but adding colours to a palette isn't obvious or in the program at all.

this is just me here, but the default UI design is pretty bad and i'd strongly recommend getting or making a skin to improve it. my personal recommendation would be jmswrnr's skins. an example of the UI being bad is that the animation timeline isn't displayed when you first install the program and that the new frame and layer buttons are in completely separate locations, with one of them being in a drop down menu and the other being at the bottom right of the timeline window/screen.

onion-skinning is a bit weird at times with it being invisible due to other sprites being in the way. although this is easily solved by hiding other layers.

aseprite has the foundations of a good sprite animator, but it 100% needs improvements that make animation easier and alternate themes included with the vanilla download. 
get it on a sale and prepare for frustration as you spend 10 minutes looking for the new layer or frame buttons. you have to go into this program with tutorials open in another window or screen or you'll be having a terrible time learning it.",1549986579,1549986922,True,4,2,0.556558370590209961,0,True,False,False,76561198012811928,235,81,8276,234,278,1601915510,,

Review

Pros:

Selection of tools and advanced/custom options

- It has a lot of overwhelming features. I would be here all day listing them all but it has a great selection of features that will make most people happy. Heck all I need to mention is the pixel perfect mode and FX so I could just end the review right there you know? Not to mention the advanced/custom options that some of tools such as the brush and bucket tool that have once you know about it, it could definitely benefit your workflow once you understand it and it counts for most of the tools. Its really up to you how much advantage you want to take and willing to invest into it. 

Accessible to anybody

- Whether you’re a beginner or professional pixel artist, you feel right at home with Aseprite. If you used other pixel art tools in the past such as GIMP, Photoshop or GraphicsGale, it shouldn’t take you long to get used to Aseprite (Unless you really hate the UI, which I will discuss in more detail about it on the Cons section of this reviews) but it can be accessible to anybody honestly and for a paid tool with overwhelming tools and features, I really admire that accomplishment.

Selection of tools for pixel animations

- Now one of the biggest selling points of Aseprite that most Pixel artists will likely tell you is the overwhelming amount of features for just making pixel animations and you know what? They aren’t entirely wrong. If you want to have a smooth workflow for pixel animations, Aseprite is the best option for it as far as I know. Now if you have been using a lot of Adobe product such as Adobe animates CC or even photoshop for a long time, you probably feel right at home with the options you have! Few highlighted features such as having the option to use the preview mode similar to photoshop and the option to use the onion skin. I could mention more animation features but again, I would here all day talking about it.

- What also helps Aseprite is that community are very helpful whether that be with tutorials, discussions on the official website or Steam and even David Capello himself is very often active to answer question to the people using his pixel art tool, which I can really appreciate that for taking his time to help out his own community that he has build up for years. With a community like this, it will be much easier to guide people that are new to using aseprite, whether that be a written answer or a tutorial video. This show more evidence on why Aseprite could be accessible to anybody whether you’re a beginner or not at pixel art.


Cons:

User interface (UI)

- Alright, lets the elephant out of the room. I’m personally not the biggest fan of the whole pixelated UI but I will admit that it is far from the worst but still, it took me some time to get used it but that doesn’t mean that it is still a pleasant to look at mostly while using it but I get why some people find the UI charming but it just not my cup of tea personally. Yeah, I know there are 3rd party options for custom UI for aseprite but again, like I said that by the disclaimer section, I will review product based on what was given to me right away after purchasing it and using 3rd party stuff to solve the issue kind of defeats the purpose of a review. 

Another disclaimer: with these two cons that I’m about to mention below. I want to make it clear that I know that David Capello is planning to add and fix these in the future and I will definitely cross these two cons out once these are fixed and widely available on Aseprite in the future

Text Tool is a mess

- Out of my least favourite tool in Aseprite, I think that the text tool has to take the cake with that one  mainly due to how useless and lack of polish it has as of 1.2.10-beta4 version Aseprite mainly due that you can’t edit your text tool once you finished typing any words or letters. Also, it is just me or do these wide variety different font that you have on the text tool to type in letters just feel out of place on Aseprite? 
 
 No Tile Map Editor 

- At the moment, there is no Tile Map editor but I did talk to David Capello about that and according to him (If you see this review somehow David, you can correct me if I’m wrong on this info) the tile map editor will be added on V1.3 update on Aseprite, so I keep this one brief and simple!

In conclusion:

It’s a must buy to anybody that used other pixel art tools in the past or never used one before and for just for $15 and the amount of things you get for it, is just worth it and you also get the steam key if you buy via Aseprite’s official website, which is so nice of David Capello or you can compile one for free since its open source but I choose to purchase it to support David Capello honestly due to how generous he is with his own community.

Spriting System:
GIMP:
Frames are layers, which means you'll have to manually export each frame. Then you'll have to make sure that each frame is correctly numbered and that the frame doesn't contain any mistakes. Otherwise you can do all the exporting work again. 
In the end, you'll need to work with seperate files, one for frame exporting and one for stringing all frames together.

Aseprite:
Has an animation grid with frame and layers in one place. This saves you all the extra headache of exporting, planning, perfecting, etc...

UI:
GIMP:
Has a cluttered interface with tons of useless tools.

Aseprite:
Keeps it compact by offering only the necessary tools.

Also Aseprite:
Has an extra option to export images for Twitter. 
THIS COULD HAVE SAVED ME ALL THE HASSLE I WENT THROUGH FOR EXPORTING IMAGES FOR TWITTER. In the end, this feature sold me to it.

77,45920470,english,"[h1]A 10/10 A delight to use (Review for version 1.2.9)[/h1]

[h1][b][u]Note:[/u][/b] This is a shortened version of a review from [url=https://gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/aseprite/]Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[/url] to fit Steam’s 4000 character limit.[/h1]

Even though drawing pixel art may seem like the low hanging fruit of graphic design, careful observers know that diligent animators & illustrators made & continue to produce marvelous pieces using this style. After all, artists have to make their work look appealing, iconic, as well as snappy while typically constricting themselves to a 16×16 or 32×32 pixel frame area with somewhere between four to 16 colors. The fun & challenge in pixel art nowadays thus lie in the self-imposed restrictions, akin to writing a haiku instead of a novel.

What makes this style even more appealing is its low financial threshold that aspiring artists have to step over. After all, free design tools are readily available on the internet. That said, most of these applications were not developed with pixel art in mind & can therefore throw figurative wrenches in the creative process, which is what [i]Aseprite[/i] (2016) tries to address.

It is an extremely lightweight, 33 MB big graphics design tool & sets itself apart from most of its contemporaries, as its solely meant to aid in the making of this one particular style of art. Of course, Aseprite features the typical elements one would expect from any other program of this sort, like the always needed “Recover Lost Sprites” option that backups unsaved work, the onion skin that lets one see the previous as well as subsequent animation frames, a preview window to inspect the fluidity of animations, the ability to save or edit user preferences, & so on. But none of those features were why I bought it.

What enticed me was that it has 58 color presets used by the most common 8-bit to 16-bit systems, which makes it easier than ever to recreate that classic video game look. More importantly, it features a tiled mode for both the X & Y axis that allows artists to check for inconsistencies in their work whenever they are designing a wall or a meadow, for example. What got me even more excited was that the program’s gradient tool can dither, which is a resource saving method commonly used in games from the 1980s & 1990s to show colors shifting from one to another (say a player character is entering a cave & the developer only has two colors available to show the shift from bright to dark).

Even better than that is that the program can generate color pallets based on the current project & that when the marquee tool is selected & one double clicks on the canvas, it automatically highlights a 16×16 pixel area (or whatever you set it to) so that artists can edit that section without worrying about the remainder of a model. In addition to that, it can be booted up without the Steam client, so that one can focus on their work with fewer distractions. After they are done, users will then be able to save their work in the .bmp, .flc, .fli, .gif, .ico, .jpeg, .jpg, .pcx, .pcc, .png, .tga, .webp, or the internal .aseprite & .ase file formats.

At time of writing, there aren’t too many complaints that could be brought against it, aside from a couple of minor gripes. One thing artists should keep in mind when editing in Aseprite 1.2.9 is that whenever they directly import a layer that has an alpha channel from another tool that all transparent areas will be rendered as black, which is easily avoided by filling those spots with a solid color of one’s choosing beforehand. Another grievance is that the gradient tool only works in straight lines, which makes coloring round objects more cumbersome than it could be otherwise.

In the end, Aseprite comes highly recommended for graphic artists that want to speed up their pixel creation process. It is relatively low-cost compared to comparable applications & has a free trial version available on its official homepage.

until now, my favorite by far has been cosmigo pro motion, and that did pretty much everything i needed, and had a free version that had all the features i needed. in pixel art communities i've seen threads about 'what do you use to make pixel art' and this name kept coming up that i hadn't heard of before: ""aseprite"", so i decided to buy it and take a look. and the result is aseprite edges even cosmigo pro motion out of the best pixel art program i've used.

i don't want to go into detail exactly as to why since others have done so well enough in other reviews. there are also a few small gripes i have with it (for instance, no easy way to change which color you have selected with the keyboard alone, you have to either use the eyedropper and the mouse or click on the color manually, and no real option to draw with the keyboard / control the cursor), but overall it's awesome. i'm using it for a commision i'm being paid for to do art for another indie's game, and it's been great for that so far.

i would not absolutely say never use anything else because there are certainly other programs that have advantages. if i were still using cosmigo pro motion i'd still be fine with that, and may even use it again (for some specialized features which this one doesn't have). but if you want to try out a new program to do pixel art, this is the top of the line.",1533246243,1533246359,True,49,0,0.82696157693862915,2,True,False,False,76561197979136372,1644,43,288070,8191,,1602088530,,

If you are already into art like I am, you won't find anything more in there than on photoshop or clip studio, but for myself, I still prefer to work on aseprite for anything pixel related. The reason is quite simply because it's hyper focused on pixel and real good at it, it take a lot of different element from different software and crunch it in a better, more efficient form. 

By being so focus on pixel work, I appreciate that that the interface is so simple, it'S a nice contrast with the infinite choices and unending drop down menu from other software, it's easy to explore and understand, you get around it quite rapidly. 

Another big thing is that on other pro software like photoshop and clip, you can do everything Aseprite do, but you need a lot of work around and tweaking to get to the point when you do pixel, over time you get better and quicker at it, but aseprite doesn't need those tweaking and tricky stuff, most of what you need is there and easy to use.

The program takes up the staggering space of 13 MB (!) on my Linux system, it's open source, and contains all one could expect from a tool designed with sprite creation and animation in mind. 

Beyond its standard image creation and editing tools - Aseprite comes with some rather nifty functions which caught my attention: I enjoyed the ability of being able to customize my own gradient shade/tint palettes with ease, the mirrored/symmetric editing mode, the indexed color mode for quick color switching, and the pixel perfect brush function for clean-looking sprite lines. 

I haven't touched any animation software since playing around in Flash in my teenage days, and Aseprite has the same core functions as far as I've observed. Easy to understand and work with.  

The only things I miss in Aseprite is to not being able to break out the boxes out of the software's window, e.g. it would be nice to separate the preview window from the main window. As well as not being able to export animations into high quality gifv/mp4 files (gifs tend to get messed up with artifacts when using a lot of colors and frames).

Aseprite features clear and easy to understand UI and tools. All of which cotribute to an easy workflow for those interested in retro sprite art. Many say that the tools don't make the art but in Aseprite's case I'd say that isn't true. After tinkering with the software for only a few hours and having little expereince in art and none in pixel art i was easily able to create something that looked far better than anything I had done in my ,at that time, 1.5 years of being serious in art. I was easily able to improve after some basic tutorials on palettes and how to size things. All thanks to just how clear-cut everything is.

- Within a couple of hours, I was making animations that used to take me days.
- Aseprite has a pixel-perfect option, so I no longer had to manually fix the jaggies on the lineart.
- It has a built in onion-skin feature (and you can modify the opacity, and/or activate a blue/red mode).
- If you used to make animations in Flash, you'll love the fact that it uses similar hotkeys (including "","" and ""."" to move between frames).
- It can automatically generate spritesheets from animations, and even export each frame as a separate png, or as a GIF (this has saved me so much time).
- You can easily customize the grid, and move tiles from one side to the other by holding Ctrl+arrow key.
- It has a symmetry mode (mirror x, mirror y, mirror both axis), perfect for drawing seamless tiles.

I can get a project done within a few hours rather than the days it would with other applications. Animation is actually very fluid, though (and this goes with trade or art form) exact specifications can be hard to accomplish due to personal skill. The price is really great for the content, but it isn't perfect. For example, you cannot add ""Add-ons"" or ""Workshop Items"" into the application. Another example is, the tool they give you to set one block down, doesn't allow you to set more than one block at once. This can definetly slow your progress down, since having to set each individual block down requires a lot of time, especially for larger sized projects.
 
Overall, Aesprite is one of the best in it's class (budget pixel-art software), but it definetly can be helped by a few updates and more community based nodes. This doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it if your trying to create ""pixel-art"", because you should. I'm just warning you about what may be annoying or preventing you from creative ""Nirvana"".

I have been using this program for a few months now. Today an update came out for it and it is top notch. For me, the two biggest improvements are that they added a gradient tool, and they made the symmetry option able to do horizontal and vertical symmetry at the same time. These are two huge improvements to me. This program really is great. Worth every penny.

--------------------------------
ALL BELOW WAS ORIGINAL REVIEW ON JULY 20 2017
--------------------------------

Great program. 

I got fired from my graphic design job a few weeks ago. I have been doing graphics for around 20 years. I have all of the Adobe software and several other programs. The day I got fired, I decided I no longer wanted to work for anyone else again and I decided that I was going to learn how to make a video game. That is what I am doing full time now. 

I bought Aseprite the day I got fired and learned the majority of the program by the end of the day. It is super easy to learn, yet is powerful enough that I feel more comfortable making my sprites in Aseprite than in the Adobe programs. It's missing a few key features like gradients, but from reading the update news it appears these are being added. 

One thing I would love to see (if it's not already there and I'm just missing it), is preserve transparency so that I can paint over top of something without worrying about my painting bleed off of the image. It's not a deal breaker though by not having it. 

Overall, this program is great. It's easy to learn and use, and it is powerful enough to make some great looking sprites and animations. I definitely recommend it if you are looking to make some sprites or pixel art.",1500573797,1506387843,True,58,1,0.857037186622619629,12,True,False,False,76561198092408632,278,33,99055,2,41674,1601600509,,

I can't think of any cons since I don't have much to compare it to cause yanno, -10 experience. Also I haven't figured out how to do everything yet.

I wanted to use my time to tell you what this software is good for and what it is essential for, all that what-not, so, [b]let's begin with if you are looking for using this software with job ethics (other than game development, animation, or commissions), I would extremely unrecommend it, and for using as a editting software is also not recommended.[/b] What I would do is get what Adobe has to offer, but that is for proffesional use only, and we aren't talking about adobe here.

The max that each canvas (picture) you make can basically go up to 1M+ pixels, but that really isn't important, just saying if you want to make something as your desktop for personal use.

[b]This is probably the best for it is animating, it is really easy to use and you can just start with ease.[/b] Can't really say the animation is the easy part, it's more of how you animate itself.

[strike]It sells this software short of just $15,[/strike] I meant to say... it is good at it's normal price... , u ' [strike]personally I think it should be $20 - $30, for what it can do and what you can do with it is amazing, with a new pallette each update, I love it. Still, that's not a good enough reason, hmm... maybe the fact you can just have onion skin, resize the pic without it being blurry or distorted (I'm looking at you MS paint), cutting / cropping will be shortly added, fully capable of being a professianial software... ehh, it's my best shot.[/strike]

^ People will probably be very mad at this part. ^

I was shown this by a friend on discord and i bought it. I was hoping i could learn... I messed around at first drawing stick men and simular things animating a stick move across the screen nothing special. Until i drew a shotgun. Alot of my friends liked it and the guy who told me to get the software told me to animate it so i did. At this point i had the software for not even a day and i made a shotgun gif. From there on i went to work, i made a working character and i made 10 different versions. I made alot of things to just use. I drew some art work too. Ive only had the program for a few weeks maybe a month and im loving it. It has put a spark in me and shown anyone can pixel art.

- Super fast workflow
- Different color modes
- Predefined palettes
- Frame based animations(Super easy to use)
- A LOT. of formats supported(.gif,.png.jpg etc etc etc)
- Spritesheet export/gif export for animations
- OpenSource code and file specifications
- Perfect performance

- UI design is the worst I have ever seen
- When exporting as spritesheet layer opacities get lost.
- Only a few tools available(Still enough, just wanna let you know)

All in all this software actually replaced Photoshop at some areas of my workflow, like painting some spritesheet animations and pixel art sprites.

If you're looking for a great pixel art/general art software just for drawing pixelwise, this is the one you should go for.
It's still in beta and recieves a lot of updates which is a good fact.

Even if you never used any 2D software before, you will get familiar with this piece of software rapidly.

Update: 11.4 hours in now, still loving the tool! I have made a few things, including two animations and a pixel fan-art of a little-known youtuber, as well as a few other small projects. Every project I worked on took a little over an hour, and each time I learned something new about the tool, such as the 3 scaling options (rotoscale is great for rounding and can create a great effect; nearest-neighbor makes a perfect scale-up pixel for pixel given whole-number scale-ups [i.e. 1x, 2x, 3x, etc.], and the other which I forgot), and the pixel-perfect assisted drawing tool, which is great considering I'm using a mouse.

Here are the two animations:

What I can say is I bought it a good while ago, but wasn't really into pixel art at the time, (I was using Krita, a free digital paining program) so this ended up sitting in my steam collection almost never used.

I gave it a try about a week ago, after I'd been working on a webgame for a gamejam. The game ended up being pixel art, but I had no fun making pixel art in Krita, it annoyed the hell out of me.

And I'm so glad I tried it. It's by far the easiest way of creating pixel art I've ever tried. Even the animation is simple. So far in about 12 hours of use I've made 3 fully animated game characters, (a soldier, a zombie and a robot) made myself a pixel avatar, and even tried my hand at making pixel fanart based on games I like (so far 2 of the Paladins characters) .

Well thought out!
Aseprite features a lot of the same basic handy functions that Photoshop offers like easily dragging your canvas around. Several selection tools, works great with moving pixels around and on layers.
Offers a really nice resizing tool that moves your pixels in a very nice way, which is great for animating as well.
You can import video files for animation reference and tracing.
Has very easy and clever default keyboard bindings allowing you to speed up your work a lot.

One thing I was a little worried about before purchasing Aseprite was the pixel GUI, thinking it'd be awkward to use. After about 5-10 minutes playing with the app, I hardly even notice and find it to be pretty nice.

[list]
[*] In the Tiled Mode, as well as both axis can we please have by frames? Showing a previous frame to the left in the workspace and forward frame to the right in the workspace whilst working on the current frame in the workspace would be greatly advantageous. At times I find the onion skinning a little busy in a frame I am working on and wish I could just see left and right the differences I am working with.
[*] Also can we please run multiple Aseprite sessions at once? I have multi monitors and can do this with the compiled version just fine.

This review is strangely enough about my point of view when it comes to the game/program in question. If you disagree with any or all of the points feel free to give me a dislike and/or a comment to discuss things. But if you are just here to rant and rage, I will ignore you.

=[Review]=
As I recently began to make a game with a few of my friends, I also began to find out that I am not just bad at Pixelart. I am absolutely terri- Ok jokes aside, I am not all that bad but I have much to learn. After a while a friend had shown me a browser pixelart tool which I used for a while but didnt help all that great and I came back to using Gimp. Shortly after I see a person on twitter writing on how to make a custom brush in a program that looked like it was mainly used for Pixelart and I was already interested. After asking this person, I was redirected via name to steam where I then bought it only one day after and used it for about 10 hours straight with varying results.

Overall, if you want to get into Pixelart and you dont want to pay a buttload of money for some high-end program, Aseprite is perfect for you. At first, like with any program, you will have to find your way around but after a while it actually becomes quite easy to use. Or in other words: You do not spend 5 hours on figuring out the basics unlike with some other high-end programs *cough*Photoshop*cough*. What? I didnt name any programs. You are hearing things. What? This is a written review?

...

LOOK A PERSON ON THE INTERNET WHO IS WRONG!

(Too soon?)

The program gives you a full on working layer and frame system. Layers work as intended. Human base, then ontop a layer of colour and ontop of that a layer of hair and another one for clothing. But what about animation? Here is where the frames come into play. Lets use a chest as the best example that I will give you now. A container. You have the chest right infront of you but you want to put in content that you dont want to redraw everytime? Then simply draw the chest without the top, put the top on another layer and only animate said top part. That way, one copy of said chest bottom part is enough for you as it will stay stationary no matter what. It is only the top part that moves.

Other than that, the program also gives you alot of colours to work with. Unlike your usual painting/drawing programs you can not only choose your own colours, but you can also choose from wide variety of palletes. You can make a real oldschool game look-alike or you can go in and create Pixelart Mona Lisa in the colours of the rainbow. You can even customize and create your own palletes to your liking. And those then can also be saved and loaded for later use.

There are a few different modes that I have yet to find out but one mode, the ""Tiled"" mode is honestly one of the best if you want to make continous tilesets. It mirrors every side of the tile you have on display and from there you simply pain as per usual. But at the same time as you paint on the basetile, all other tiles will be painted the same way and even overlay each other. This way you can make tilesets that add on to each other very easily and that, thinking about how hard that can be, is very very appreciated. I nearly ripped my hair out once due to a trial on actually making such a tileset in gimp. It became so frustratingly hard that I gave up until I found this tool.

Other than that, there are also a good amount of brushes. Not too many to say ""Oh Lord, where just where is the pencil?"". But also not too few to say ""Where is the eraser?"" You have what you need for the task that is pixelart. A pencil, spray, line, box or circle, eraser, fill and even a blur tool. You heard me, a blur tool for pixelart. Now doesnt that make things a bit easier?

Overall, this program saves me a lot of time going around trying to find out which colours to use because it is all in two windows. Oh yes, another point I nearly forgot is the second window afterall. You gain a second window which is the review window for your pixelart. While you go deep and dirty into the finest details, this review window can still show you, your masterpiece in its full glory. No more zooming out. Just a look to the right and you are up to date on how the mistake looks you just made. Well, or should I call it a happy little accident? Either way, its all there.

And that is about it. Another small point I would like to mention are the easy access keyboard shortcuts that make it very easy for righthanded people like me who mainly use their left hand on the keyboard. You are able to rebind them but the default layout works quite well for me~

And that is about it.
I would certainly recommend this program to anyone who wants to get more into pixelart. Actually have done that already with a friend of mine who bought it a day later.

It's a very simple tool to use with many unique features.
Want to challenge yourself by using the NES palette only? Aseprite has the palette built-in! Want to rotate things without having them look jagged? Aseprite has RotSprite! Want to make your very own MissingNo? Aseprite has the Scramble Tool!

While it's easy to draw something in any sprite editor, Aseprite has ""Pixel-perfect"" drawing, so you don't get those weird jagged lines when you try doing something like a curve, and ""linked cels"" which don't change with every frame, so you don't have to do any cut-and-paste into all the frames like I used to. The downside is that, if you accidentally forget to unlink something, it changes in all the linked frames. The good news is you have unlimited undos, unlike some of the other spriting tools I've used.

There's also things that other spriting tools have, like layers and palettes, and while Aseprite has some cool layer stuff, I haven't used it much, and if I were to talk about the palette editor, we'd be here all day.

Aseprite is worth the $15. I may have gotten it for free, but the amount of quality put into the sprite editor is enough to give away the price tag by itself.

16,29325655,english,"This program has some incredibly frustrating idiosyncracies, but also a strong core featureset, and a lot of potential.

First, am I the first to say this? The chunky 8bit stylization wastes an ungodly amount of screen real estate in the GUI. The minute I saw it in the trailer I thought it looked gaudy, gimmicky, tacky,  unnecessary and wasteful. I'm trying to draw some basic sprites in an efficient interface, not pretend I'm using an ultra lo-res monitor with an 1980s microcomputer. Lets keep in mind I paid for every inch of panel space I have, and if a program just throws it away, I'm basically losing money. I also finds this stylization highly distracting, though that seems to have been the opposite of its developer's intention. 

Intention vs. Implementation:
The first problem is that it wastes so much space. 
Another problem is the icons become cryptic. It was very hard to figure out very basic things about the program, which doesn't yet have a huge community online do draw knowledge from. 
Here's the big one, something the dev probly didn't consider. 
This interface looks *nothing* like any productivity program I have running on my computer. 
And herein lies the big issue, I am constantly having my eyes pulled to the GUI elements looming in my peripheral with their (as of 2016 at least) highly sylized blocky pixels. That bold, jagged, upscaled unicode font is constantly screaming at my eyes to look at it.
I would love to just have this look like my normal computer, which is running in Classic mode, AKA it looks basically like Windows 98.
I edit video in a program that doesn't look like a piece of glass candy. My eyes ignore the UI and focus on the content I'm making. It's lovely. Importantly, the interface doesn''t *match the content*, so my perception never blurs the lines.


There are some serious concerns I have with the default layout. I was unable to find any way to change it on Google and the program does not make anything about itself obvious. I was finally able to change it thanks to developer response(thank you), and I can finally get to setting up a workflow.

Overall the program performs well, hasn't crashed, and the thing that has frustrated me the most is that these issues stood in the way of me using a program that does have basically all the features I need. 

UI scalling has steep gradations only. Everything is too tiny or too huge.
Same with zooming in/out. Going from 100-200% in a single scroll-whell step is not very helpful. 
Preferences menu will hopefully see some expansion in general.
a ""Dark"" skin would also be a godsend, as with all productivity software.

the program runs smoothly and has a lot of options, and the fact that you can make animations with it is awesome. it's simple to use but still very powerful and has a lot of utility.

I'd compare it to Adobe Flash in terms of ease of use, and it shares many similar features (Onion skin, layer layout ect) so if your familiar with one, you'll find this a piece of cake.


Since I'm way more experienced in 3D, moving actual models with biped rigs, than I am at drawing my own things and then animating them, I'm not really the intended audience, as it's not my preferred medium. However, in under 10 hours, I whipped out my old 2012 era Wacom Bamboo graphics tablet and managed to draw and animate a moving image about my favourite TV show, [b]Channel 4's Utopia[/b] using a pre-existing Google image poster as inspirational basis.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to make animated pixel art, for games or whatever reason they want.

Each of these titles are great works, and serve their purpose. 
For sprites, I used Paint . net mostly, and I use Photoshop for my special needs. 

I was working with Paint . net on 2D animations to use with Unity, and somehow stumbled upon this software.

What immediatly sparked my interest was the built-in ability to make animations, if you are working with any of the above to make animations, I am sure this sparks your interest aswell, as with the software mentioned above, it is tedious and time consuming. 

The reviews spoke of fast and positive results, they mentioned that the developer actively listens and responds to his customers, and is shaping the product to everyones liking.

So I bought it for the low price of 15,00 euro, nearly instantly became pro at 2D animations, and even had the developer respond to my days old question about color palettes in the Steam Discussions. The reviews weren't lying!

The built-in animation stuff works really great and your exported spritesheet is easily imported into Unity. Next to all that, it is the little things that make this software great, like the option to change the hotkeys or using the eyedropper to sample through several layers without having to click the individual layer. There is a lot of attention to user functionality.

One thing that might scare you off, which was mentioned in the currently single negative review, is the interface. However, this interface serves as a really comfortable work environment for pixel art, although I can imagine this might not seem obvious to the average user. If this interface bothers you, there is the option to change it into a regular interface. 

There is a lot more positive and interesting stuff to say about this software, from the color palettes to the selection tool, but if you are looking for something to make your sprites and animations with, look no further and find out for yourself!

Aseprite is a cheap-priced, yet high-quality product, that thanks to it's focus on pixel-art, has built-in tools specified for pixelart such as border and outline selections, the shading brush, a ""RotSprite"" rotation to keep sprites much much more intact when rotated instead of turning them into a fuzzy mess, and plenty more that I haven't even got to yet after 40 hours of real-time-use!
The animation is the smoothest I had yet, looking similar to high-end animation programs by having all the layers and their frames presented together, making it easy to animate different layers, along with the option to move an entire animated layer without having to move each layer seperately, this product is not only incredibly easy-to-use for regular sprite animations for a game, with it's option for reverse and ping-pong animation, but it also allowed me to comfortably and easily create gif scenes to post on my pixelart blog, something that I do on a regular basis.

Skipping going deep into other features, like how amazing the pallette managment is, I also have to mention that the developer is extremely responsive, always answering suggestions and questions on the forums, taking away from them ideas for features to add, his support is simply great!

It has ALL the features you need to animate and draw sprites for any purpose you deem for game/UI or pure art. In my short time playing with it I managed to create some cool animated sprites that I’m using in my projects. 

If you already experienced in Layers and basic animation you can jump right into advanced features or if you just into painting and creating pixel art you can also enjoy. You can work with it on Mac also which was a major plus for me also. 

Are you thinking about trying first some free pixel creating tools go ahead and try them, they are not as good and do not have all the features, for onetime fee here you can literally get a Photoshop grade quality pixel art creation. 
I would definitely make it my go to pixel app.

75,25141240,english,"A really good pixel art editor. Arguably the best, but does lack some features other pixel art editors have and has some minor issues of it's own.

---

The features that impressed me include the palette editor, complete with many presets from classic hardware and other platforms. The animation editor comes with onion skinning. Each frame of the animation retains all the same layers in a matrix of frame & layer data. The freehand tool works very well for certain lines & shapes when drawing as it prevents the raw jaggedness of the shape as it would normally be rendered. The interface is just perfect for low-res pixel art.

Dither & pattern features like Graphics Gale and some other pixel art softwares have is disappointingly missing. It is particularly useful with the bucket tool. Another nice feature would be to allow selecting a portion of the animation to preview, like when I highlight certain frames it should use only those frames when I press 'play animation'.

---

I have found 2 issues that are only in the Linux version as far as I know (if you use Windows or OSX, skip this):

Sometimes the layer itself will copy and leave a highlight around it inside the animation editor that I can't get rid of without closing the tab. This is because it retains focus or something (I can't pin down the cause for this issue). 

The second Linux glitch is that Alt does not provide a functional eyedropper tool for me (using MATE). It shows the eyedropper in place of the cursor while it's held, but it does not process clicks for color swapping. Still, it is a reassignable key and setting it to something else bypasses the issue. I had gotten so used to Alt though...

---

Overall, it's great software that's near perfect for a pixel artist's needs. It's drawbacks are annoying, but that does not stop it from being the best pixel art software on the market despite all that.

** SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW, THE DEV HAS UPDATED THE COLOURING SYSTEM! IT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER AND EASIER TO USE!! O:

Let me say:

It's like photoshop, but for pixel art. Seriously. 

PROS
-- 
+Super rad real time animation preview makes animation smooth
+ onion skin lets you see what's on other layers when you're drawing new frames
+ LAAAYERS
+ work with opaque or transparent backgrounds
+ layers can be transparent and have opacity 
+ incredibly easy to navigate
+ YOU CAN LOCK UR LAYERRRS!
+ super cheap animation program that's cute, simple and well made. (Google the price of others, like Ulead GIF animator 5.0)
- able to save in basically any format (EXCEPT PSD. HOPING THIS WILL CHANGE!)
-also has a tiny preview to show you what you're working on.
- really really cool rotate tool, so your stuff doesn't get super fuzzy

CONS?
-- 
~ [strike]No crop? Seriously I can't find crop. If anyone can hint me that, ping me. 
- I hate that [ and ] don't change the size of the brush, but instead scroll through the colours. I keep messing myself up.[/strike] *** crop DOES exist! The dev stated it's in SPRITE - Crop
- no colour adjustment button. (in photoshop its edit > adjustments > adjust hue/saturation, but I wish we had one here so I didnt have to switch programs)
- [strike]no opacity lock so you can't just draw on the layer without worrying about messing up others, but that's a minimal complaint. [/strike] Lock alpha exists which lets me do that! Nevermind!

It's still a new program and has so much potential.
I hate trying out new software and have had my gif program for 18 years, I'm actually really really happy with this. I recently made a guide for this program if you're interested at looking at what it can do and how simple it really can be.

88,24146221,english,"What? Only an hour at the time of writing? And no past experience? Surely this can't be an accurate review. Take of it what you will, but an hour was all I needed (and the 15 dollars to buy it.) .

Why?

DawnBringer's 32 color palette was the default palette. Considering the tiny amount of work I've done with a limited palette (no ""dirty"" brushes) has been with this palette, I felt at home with this program almost instantly (Disclaimer: You may not feel as comfortable as soon as you start it up like I did. Trust me, it won't take too long.) .

Ok, so the palette isn't the real reason I love it. You can set up your own anyways, just thought that was awesome.

Working with it is easy for any beginner pixel artists or anyone new to the program (like me), while still powerful enough for professional artists. The pixelated interface is a nice touch, too. Dunno why that one guy was complaining, a round/smooth GUI would look strange (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, some guy gave a negative review because the GUI was pixel art itself.) .

But what is (what I think) the one thing that makes this worth more than some free digital art program?

LAYERS AND ANIMATION FRAMES ARE SEPARATE! That makes both simple and complex animations FAR easier to make. It functions a bit like other animation programs out there (I've had a little experience in Adobe Flash). What does this mean, you might (or might not) be asking? You can edit an image in different layers (like Photoshop layers), then move on to the nexxt frame of animation, while keeping the layers of the image!

I already have a small project in mind to use this program for, too! I will take [url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7-StDyt752DMkxrcGFlc2lkZ2M]THESE[/url] (I made these back in an animation/image editing class. I used Photoshop for them...) and redo them (unposterize, if you will) while using the same 32 color palette.

Oh yeah, and you can make sprite sheets for games. I'll be using that one day.

49,21596725,english,"Before using this I used Graphics Gale to do all my sprite work and didn't really wanna pay for something I could just use free.  After watching the trailer video and seeing the animation workflow, I decided to give it a chance, and man I'm glad I did. 

For anyone who has used flash, you'll feel right at home. The interface is similar and feels just as robust and 100x easier when making animations. Being able to draw/animate each piece in a different layer gives you a lot of control and ease, also for anyone who has used GG, they should know the frustration in editing multiple frames of the same layer and/or setting up sprite sheets after you've completed your animation. Aseprite does all of this automatically, and god does it speed up workflow!

One of the most surprising and powerful features of this program is the Pixel-Perfect option which lets you draw freehand (with a mouse even!) and get fairly correct results when drawing. I would advise to not rely on this tool, but it helps tremendously in learning how a line works, or why a line you made doesn't work. 

I also enjoy the option to change from a color wheel, to a color spectrum when picking my colors; and also being able to pick different colors from modes such as Analogous, Complementary and Triadic. (This just makes color theory something you don't have to master to have great colors in your art.) Also the default color palettes are great (really love having a NES palette) and I hope to see more implemented!

Exporting is super easy and simple as well! You can keep your file in .ase format (so you can keep your layers and animations exactly how you left them) and when you're ready to export them into your game, it's as simple as hitting CtrlL+E. I can't tell you how much of a blessing this simple little feature is, and how much time it saved me.

The only two issues I've run into so far are-
1: Lag seems to be a problem when making the color wheel/spectrum larger.
2: After playing and then stopping your animation, the layer defaults back to the top. Not knowing this at first caused me to draw on the wrong layer which was frustrating. After I figured out it did this, it was just something I had to be aware of, but annoying none the less. 

I've only scratched the surface of this program, so the issues I presented may have easy fixes I'm not aware of, nor do they take away how great this program is! If you're an aspiring artist, or a veteran in game design, I would definitely recommend this program.
