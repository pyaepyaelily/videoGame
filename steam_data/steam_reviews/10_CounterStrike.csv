1,77045329,english,Best  game I played from my childhood,1601843625,1601843625,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False,76561198359026994,4,1,28234,2731,28234,1601831114
2,77038504,english,"This game is so old, there are people born later than when it was popularly played who are now old enough to drink, drive, and breed. Though its golden days are long over, it still has enough players that you can jump on a server with active players any time of day, 24/7.

... okay, I admit, that personally it's hard to find a full server on my continent at certain unreasonable hours on weekdays for about three hours, and if I want a lively game I have to accept a 140ms lag minimum (the speed of light is such an annoying limitation) and struggle to understand what exactly I'm being yelled at for by a Russian-speaking admin, but I really SHOULD be sleeping... and I digress.

One of the best things about this game is that it doesn't try to pretend to be ""realistic"" past a certain point. I would say that it gives the gameplay a better feel than more modern games. All the players are made up of flat paper polygon textures. There is lighting but it is flat and simple, if you're in a dark area you're just darker. There is no dust or glare or complex plants or grass to hide in. It makes visual scanning of your area efficient and puts more emphasis on effective shooting and motion, your management of your weaponry, how well you can balance taking action and concealing your position and timing your engagements, and cooperating effectively with your teammates.

The control and movement in the game are sharp (if you've tuned your configuration effectively) and though simple in a basic sense, there are extremely advanced techniques that can always be improved. The unique air-strafe ability is of course both totally unrealistic and legendary as a built in almost magical quirk that allows for reality bending twists in the air as well as stretching out your possible distances for jumping gaps and avoiding complete annihilation by a sudden unexpected enemy, but require precise control and even a well-trained strafer can get shot just before a jump and end up hopping uselessly and mowed down by gunfire instead of bouncing away in matrix-style bullet dodging unpredictable weaves and feints. It doesn't make anybody invincible but can turn around a critical and seemingly hopeless situation and is highly amusing for all the dead players spectating the remaining battle to see.

Since this game can be played on much older hardware, it is more accessible to more people in the world. I like to have a certain minimum performance -- if I get slowdown in the middle of intense fighting on a 32 player server, I do my best to keep tweaking settings until I can play with a solid framerate even if it means plyaing at 640x480 resolution because you know what? The game has always been played with that low graphics setting in mind, and it still works wonderfully. Some people may forego fluid motion and response for a much higher resolution to get clear views and see those little elbows through small windows for careful sniping or because they're playing 5v5 pick up games instead of 32 player melees with big full team rushes happening all the time. To each their own. I play (at the moment) on a laptop that can handle a slightly higher framerate than the 60Hz built in lcd, so when I have my 75Hz external monitor hooked up, I really feel the 25% higher framerate, and this is from a monitor I picked up on the roadside that somebody didn't want any more because it is 12 years old. My point being, anybody can put a bit of effort into making their playing experience better and it barely has to cost anything (other than carrying a 12 pound lcd a few kilometers home on a bicycle) and you can literally feel the higher ability it gives you. Right now, I can tell I need a slightly lower friction mouse pad, because I have my crosshairs jump a bit too far every time I move my mouse, since I changed my setup around a bit recently. I know when I get a new surface and test it and find it better, I will probably play for a few hours and be energized and focussed. I don't know that I'll do well, but I'm sure I'll be excited enough to attempt some hilarious gambits.

I do wish that enough players were still into this game that the more specialty servers were still populated, and that more maps were popular. I miss sa_treetops, and servers with wall jumps and parachutes to help reaching normally unreachable map areas. Soccer modded servers too, I think counter-strike soccer maps were probably my favorite sports game of all time, but it's rare to find one with that key minimum 3 on 3 or 4 on 4 players, playing soccer seriously, being aware of team position and at least trying to be cooperative team players. But there are still surf servers. There are highly modded warcraft 2 servers if you want crazy extra abilities you can spend time levelling up. there are zombie servers and jailbreak, climbing and bunnyhop, and of course straight up deathmatch respawn free-for-alls.

And if you're lucky, you may find the rare server that plays that rare map, de_dust2. If you see it being played you better jump on, if you don't, you might miss it and you'd never find it being played ever again since its so unfamiliar to so many players and has such unbalanced and confusing map design.

Play cs 1.6. Just don't waste time when your team has an objective to accomplish. Do crazy unpredictable aggressive things if you're having a bad day playing, and even if you die horribly, you might inspire some of your teammates back into fighting spirit.

Thus ends my full flowing, free-flailing fire hose excuse for a review. I have no idea why I'm writing it. Oh yeah that mouse jumping issue. I think I'll pull out that external monitor and try some various mousepad surfaces, and be back on the pubs before the night's out. gg, noobs. -lazy",1601834454,1601834454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198844213329,77,5,1722,0,1722,1592402998

4,77036835,english,"My 1st review to a game ----

The very best FPS in all video-game history. Way better than Halo, Battlefield and CoD. This masterpiece evolve the Steam platform and eSports competitive community all around the globe due to its more than just a game. it is totally an experience and a way of living and only a mouse-keyboard game. It's a skill-based game that promotes discipline, communication, in-game personalization, coding (on console), and promoting working as a team more than its a ""Ima numba wan"" to win. Even tho, this game helped me to improve all my communication skills under English and French languages skills written/speaking/understanding in all levels and leadership skills in order to take decisions. 

This game along w/ all CS anthology impacted my life way more than expected due to I started playing it w/ some high school friends since 2002 (1.3, 1.5 and 1.6) and before Steam even existed, spending hundreds of hours in a big cyber-cafe-internet making lots of friends and being recognised at LAN parties around my area by my skills and it was very excited to be under CS tournaments meeting a lot of good and skilled people that nowadays still are in my life and one of them is still dedicating his life to be a PRO, stream CS.
Some girlfriends left me due to my fanatism and some others wanted to play it instead. I changed my mind the way I felt by technology and changed the scholarship degree I wanted to get as well.

By now I still have my 2000 hard copy, extremely rare to find on my own personal museum. <3

Normalerweiße , wäre das spiel für mich sehr gut - nicht nur aus nostalige feelingen, jedoch die ""verblödetete kinder community"" versuch den ganzen spaß zu zerstören , absichtliche provkationen , wenn man gut spielt wird sofort behauptet das man hackt und was ich schon alles gehört habe, es gibt ein paar gute servers, die aber 2020 fast leer sind , und die trash ""standart austauschbaren server"" sind die einzigen die gut befült sind. Der trend startete übrigens 2016, aber zurück zu das Spiel , das spiel finde ich trozdem besser als cs go , weil bei cs go alles nach plastatik aussieht und die zombie , jailbreak , deathrun server sind sowieso fast alle ein reines disaster.
Einer der größten punkten warum ich noch heute 1.6 spiele , da es nicht alles nur um waffen skins get , cs go hat aktuell durschnitlich ~ +/- 800,000 Spieler, davon spielen 750,000 es nur wegen die skins die anderen spielen es garnicht sind nur afk , traurig.
Ich merke gerade ich rede schon wieder um den heißen brei (tut mir leid :P).

Normally, the game would be very good for me - not just for nostalgic feelingen, but the ""stupid kids community"" tries to destroy all the fun, deliberate provocations, if you play well, they will immediately claim that you are hacked and what I have heard already, there are a few good servers, but they are almost empty in 2020, and the trash ""standard exchangeable servers"" are the only ones that are well filled. The trend started in 2016, but back to the game, I still think it is better than cs go, because cs go looks like plastic and the zombie, jailbreak, deathrun servers are almost all a pure disaster anyway.
One of the biggest points why I still play 1.6 today, because it's not all about weapons skins, cs go has currently an average of ~ +/- 800,000 players, 750,000 of them play it only because of the skins, the others play it not at all are only afk, sad.
I just realize that I'm talking around the bush again (sorry :P).

I was a NaVi supporter back then, with Markeloff being my favourite player ever. To this day, I cherish the original line-up: Markeloff, Starix, Edward, Zeus and Ceh9.

It's too bad they dissolved the CS 1.6 esports scene and replaced it with CS GO.

A miracle of the FPS genre.

Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.

This game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less.",1599662574,1599662574,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,76561199012881380,41,4,69592.0,0.0,69592,1595715618.0

86,63725044,english,"""Counter-Strike"" is one of those multiplayer-only games that really may stand the test of time decades after its release due to its simple yet effective premise and gameplay.

What the developers have created here is very impressive, even if not by today's standards, what it has inspired and the fact that it is still played to this very day says enough on the basis of its quality. Though at first  it may be a little difficult to get into, as many players are veterans that have been playing since the game first released, you are more likely than not to come around and see just what this game has to offer. I would highly recommend you first practice with friends if possible, or find people in a server that can teach you the basics and a few skills so that you are at least not completely lost when diving in to this classic and sort of dated experience. If you own ""Counter-Strike: Condition Zero"", I would also recommend you play those missions built around artificial intelligence players, as it is a great way to practice with with enemies more your skill level. Arguably, something like this should have been implemented into the base game, but alas this is not the case, much to the dismay of new players.

The concept is that of the conflict between two teams: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, both of which are pretty self-explanatory. Though there are a few standout mechanics in this game that differ from others of the time, such as buying weapons with in-game currency, the function of this mod turned intellectual property is pretty simplistic in a good way, making it easily accessible in terms of gameplay. The main two objective-based modes are bomb defusal and hostage rescuse, both of which are enjoyable in their respective ways, and they have obvious places in modern games that took inspiration from the basics of what was here, only expanding the influence this game holds over the multiplayer genre to this very day. Though the player base does prefer modded servers and the like nowadays, there are still enough playing the quality original maps that allow you to enjoy yourself and bask in the original experience of what ""Counter-Strike"" brought to the table when it came out so long ago.

""Counter-Strike"" is just one of those timeless classics, but it is much more impressive solely based on the fact that is is a strictly multiplayer game, which usually is a type of title that dies out a few years after initial release and loses any value once the player base disappears, but this game is a definite anomaly, one that has outlasted many of its peers and has influence on other titles to support it even when it inevitably does lose its loyal base of players.

88,75402392,english,"This game is so old, there are people born later than when it was popularly played who are now old enough to drink, drive, and breed. Though its golden days are long over, it still has enough players that you can jump on a server with active players any time of day, 24/7.

 ... okay, I admit, that personally it's hard to find a full server on my continent at certain unreasonable hours on weekdays for about three hours, and if I want a lively game I have to accept a 140ms lag minimum (the speed of light is such an annoying limitation) and struggle to understand what exactly I'm being yelled at for by a Russian-speaking admin, but I really SHOULD be sleeping... and I digress.

 One of the best things about this game is that it doesn't try to pretend to be ""realistic"" past a certain point. I would say that it gives the gameplay a better feel than more modern games. All the players are made up of flat paper polygon textures. There is lighting but it is flat and simple, if you're in a dark area you're just darker. There is no dust or glare or complex plants or grass to hide in. It makes visual scanning of your area efficient and puts more emphasis on effective shooting and motion, your management of your weaponry, how well you can balance taking action and concealing your position and timing your engagements, and cooperating effectively with your teammates. 

The control and movement in the game are sharp (if you've tuned your configuration effectively) and though simple in a basic sense, there are extremely advanced techniques that can always be improved. The unique air-strafe ability is of course both totally unrealistic and legendary as a built in almost magical quirk that allows for reality bending twists in the air as well as stretching out your possible distances for jumping gaps and avoiding complete annihilation by a sudden unexpected enemy, but require precise control and even a well-trained strafer can get shot just before a jump and end up hopping uselessly and mowed down by gunfire instead of bouncing away in matrix-style bullet dodging unpredictable weaves and feints. It doesn't make anybody invincible but can turn around a critical and seemingly hopeless situation and is highly amusing for all the dead players spectating the remaining battle to see.

 Since this game can be played on much older hardware, it is more accessible to more people in the world. I like to have a certain minimum performance -- if I get slowdown in the middle of intense fighting on a 32 player server, I do my best to keep tweaking settings until I can play with a solid framerate even if it means plyaing at 640x480 resolution because you know what? The game has always been played with that low graphics setting in mind, and it still works wonderfully. Some people may forego fluid motion and response for a much higher resolution to get clear views and see those little elbows through small windows for careful sniping or because they're playing 5v5 pick up games instead of 32 player melees with big full team rushes happening all the time. To each their own. I play (at the moment) on a laptop that can handle a slightly higher framerate than the 60Hz built in lcd, so when I have my 75Hz external monitor hooked up, I really feel the 25% higher framerate, and this is from a monitor I picked up on the roadside that somebody didn't want any more because it is 12 years old. My point being, anybody can put a bit of effort into making their playing experience better and it barely has to cost anything (other than carrying a 12 pound lcd a few kilometers home on a bicycle) and you can literally feel the higher ability it gives you. Right now, I can tell I need a slightly lower friction mouse pad, because I have my crosshairs jump a bit too far every time I move my mouse, since I changed my setup around a bit recently. I know when I get a new surface and test it and find it better, I will probably play for a few hours and be energized and focussed. I don't know that I'll do well, but I'm sure I'll be excited enough to attempt some hilarious gambits.

 I do wish that enough players were still into this game that the more specialty servers were still populated, and that more maps were popular. I miss sa_treetops, and servers with wall jumps and parachutes to help reaching normally unreachable map areas. Soccer modded servers too, I think counter-strike soccer maps were probably my favorite sports game of all time, but it's rare to find one with that key minimum 3 on 3 or 4 on 4 players, playing soccer seriously, being aware of team position and at least trying to be cooperative team players. But there are still surf servers. There are highly modded warcraft 2 servers if you want crazy extra abilities you can spend time levelling up. there are zombie servers and jailbreak, climbing and bunnyhop, and of course straight up deathmatch respawn free-for-alls.

And if you're lucky, you may find the rare server that plays that rare map, de_dust2. If you see it being played you better jump on, if you don't, you might miss it and you'd never find it being played ever again since its so unfamiliar to so many players and has such unbalanced and confusing map design.

Play cs 1.6. Just don't waste time when your team has an objective to accomplish. Do crazy unpredictable aggressive things if you're having a bad day playing, and even if you die horribly, you might inspire some of your teammates back into fighting spirit.

Thus ends my full flowing, free-flailing fire hose excuse for a review.  I have no idea why I'm writing it. Oh yeah that mouse jumping issue. I think I'll pull out that external monitor and try some various mousepad surfaces, and be back on the pubs before the night's out. gg, noobs. -lazy",1599184916,1599184916,True,10,1,0.631062984466552734,0,True,False,False,76561197967988216,25,2,251314.0,10007.0,238825,1602052122.0

95,74312664,english,"Aight guys, after spending 800h on CS 1.6, here is my honest review.

For a game made on the end of the 90s, this game has more than 10000 players active on Steam. The community is pretty active, pretty decent, someone are veterans who refuse to play other source games such as csgo and get the 10 years coin or the service medal.

This game is a fps which is divided by 2 teams. Terrorists which mission is detonate the bomb sucesfully on their main target or eliminate the Enemy team and counter-terrorists which mission is to defuse the bomb in time before it explodes or eliminate the terrorists.

There is other official mode which is the ""hostage"". The main mission for terrorists is to defend the hostage and the counter-terrorists rescue all hostages. Unlike csgo which you win 1 round by taking 1 hostage, other source/gold source engine games such as cs 1.6, you need to take ALL the hostages before time ends. Still a fun mode to try it out.

There is many modes created by the community, such as deathmatch, zombie escape (my favourite mode), jailbreak, AWP matches and more.

The objective to deathmatch is to kill many enemies fast as you can. Like csgo. Zombie escape you need to escape from that Control point before they infect you. The objective is to escape them sucessfully. Jailbreak i dunno because I never played. When i Started to play, I'm going to update this guide. AWP is the same mode to CSGO casual, but you need to kill the Enemy team with the awp [spoiler]or knife, who cares[/spoiler].

The only negative part is the price. 9.99€ is a bit expensive, I recommend to wait this game be on sale. Normally the price drops for a euro or 1.79€ on this summer sale [spoiler]it ended the summer sale lol[/spoiler], but yeah. Game is fun, decent community, just play for fun like I do.

Case you can't afford cs 1.6 and your PC is kinda a potato that can't Run CSGO, there is 1 cs game for free on Steam store you can play for awhile and it's fun to play. Game is Counter-Strike nexon studio, as known cs online to worldlive.

My Mark to 1.6 is a 9.8/10. Worth to play, fun game, just wait to be on sale and everything is Solved.

Sorry for my terrible English, i'm not an US citizen, much less an UK Citizen.

Have a nice day.",1597437784,1597437784,True,34,3,0.777208983898162842,0,True,False,False,76561198334489649,83,5,76456,261,51741,1600858718

74,73896850,english,"This splendid game was one of my greatest PC gaming experiences in my life. There's a ton of fun to be had here. I have a story on how I encountered this great first person shooter. See, here's the thing. I've never heard of 1.6 before. Shocking, I know. Well I've heard of its successor, Counter-Strike: Source. I wanted to play it, but I did not know of its existence on Steam. Even if I knew, I didn't have the money for it. So I went online to download it off a site. Then I found a download for Counter-Strike. It said the game was Counter-Strike: Source, so I went ahead and downloaded it. After the download, I proceeded to the install. I noticed something odd. Instead of saying Counter-Strike: Source, it said Counter-Strike 1.6. Didn't think much of it though, so I continued. Finally after installing, I started it up. I was so excited to play, but then I've noticed the menu window looked different from Source's. See for Source games like Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, etc, the window's a transparent grey style. Counter-Strike: Source has it. What I've seen was not it. The window had a military green color that wasn't transparent. You know the style Steam had during its early days? That's what it looked like. I proceeded to get into a match online. Once I got in, that's when I noticed it all. It looked different, the movement was different, the sounds were different, and there weren't ragdoll physics. It wasn't Counter-Strike: Source. That didn't bother me though. I enjoyed the game so very much. I played it for many days! I've had a ton of fun playing the game. Then one day there weren't many servers. There was like one I believe, and it wasn't filled. Starting the game up again did nothing. I did not know you could install bots into the game, so that was the end of my CS 1.6 adventures on PC for a very long while. I wanted to keep playing, but how was I supposed to do that without bots or other players? So years later I would finally be able to play the game again thanks to two apps on the Play Store called Xash3D FWGS and CS16Client. I downloaded the game files, put them in place, and started it up. I got into a match and felt a smile on my face. I got back to the world of Counter-Strike 1.6. I've noticed something very sweet on CS16Client, and that's the ability to play with bots. I've felt so excited. I learned how to add more maps and change the models for weapons, characters, and items. See, Counter-Strike 1.6 was not only one of my greatest PC Gaming experiences. It's also one of my greatest video gaming experiences of all-time. It brought joy to my heart, and I loved every second of it. Get this terrific game. I heavily recommend it.

And i can explain the reason of this loud statement: just like DotA (WarCraftIII map) for RTS games, Counter Strike gave impetus to the development of e-sports and FPS in general. The level of e-sports (millions of spectators, amount of sponsors, large number of great teams) that we see today is largely due to these two games.

Pure buzz guaranteed! Still getting fun in 2020... just like 15 years ago. I miss old competitive days on LAN-parties and LAN-tournaments with my old friends. Will come back more often for a taste of nostalgia. I think people will play the game even after 30+ years... i think they will play it till generation dies, thats why i am 100% sure that this game is [b]L E G E N D A R Y !!![/b]

55,73449566,english,"Counter-Strike is a game that I grew up playing.  I first tried in school during my computer classes when my friends and I finished work early.  At least once or twice, the teacher even managed to join our session.

These were good times, but also nostalgia speaking.  Counter-Strike is an FPS game from a time when FPS games had minimal graphical detail (comparative to today), with low polygon count and bitmaps that could seriously use an upgrade.  This game is strictly multiplayer, with the option for playing through LAN (setting up a server and having players connect to it) or the option of playing against bots.  

The actual game-play against humans or bots is strong even today, with tight aim controls and decent maneuverability of characters.  Depending on settings used, players typically start each round with a set amount of money to purchase their weapons, ammo, and armour.  Players typically have a limited amount of money, so your strategy begins immediately.  There are a decent selection of maps available.

Overall, this game is definitely a fun one, but at ""full cost"" I could not necessarily recommend in 2020.  If Valve/Steam spent a small amount of time to increase the maps used, I would say it is worth it.  There are just too many other games of similar cost and more recent graphics to justify purchase solely on nostalgia and memories - until Valve makes that update.",1596000303,1596000303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041645995,67,4,10.0,0.0,5,1597383565.0

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1595914155,1595914155,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198866882580,12,11,10.0,0.0,10,1581222234.0

Having purchased the ""Valve Complete Pack"" bundle way back when, I've decided to review the original Counter-Strike solely based on my undying addiction of the series. That being said, the amount of hours on this account does not justify the shear amount of hours I've actually spent playing this game. I was introduced to this title from a very old friend of mine, that after cleaning his room had discovered the physical copy of Counter-Strike for the original Xbox. Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks etc, but the one thing I remember most about CS for Xbox, was the bot play. One of the [b]Best[/b] bot play I have ever come across. Hard bots were my bread and butter of the time, and we definitely kept the love of the game going years after, transitioning to PC and ditching controllers. (Which IMO is the definitive way to experience Counter-Strike in it's full glory.)

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]A classic of it's time. One of the most influential title to revolutionize online FPS's. Gun-play holds up very well.
    [*]Endless hours of offline bot-play.
    [*]Counter-Strike has one of the largest communities with varying amount of mods, maps, custom gamemodes, etc.
[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Graphics/Textures are a bit dated.
    [*]Toxicity between matches may occur.
    [*]Huge learning curve, may take a lifetime to master.
[/list]

Overall, nostalgia hits hard with this game. I'd highly recommend giving this game a try! Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is actually Free-To-Play now, and revisiting this title makes me dumbfounded as to how huge the community has grown, and how the graphics have improved tremendously over the passed 20 years. Check out the [url=store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/] Valve Complete Pack [/url] aswell, It is definitely worth your money! (When on sale of course.) :)

62,72923385,english,"Counter Strike is an absolute staple in gaming history, and is an absolute blast to play. Almost anyone I know at least understands how to play CS:GO, even if they don't know the original 1.6. 
While I didn't play it back in the game's hayday, As it's older than me, it still holds up with gameplay. However, being such an old game with no more support from Valve itself, I do have some gripes with it, including: 

-Almost no servers in the US. Tons of middle east, Venezuelan, South American, Persian, etc. servers only. You'll have a hard time finding servers <50 latency, that are actually populated. This definitely creates a language barrier.
-Obviously outdated graphics, and an old community. While it's obvious that a 20 year old game has very bad graphics, this means that it puts off a lot of the newer demographic. You'll usually see people in their 20-40s. I rarely see any kids or people my age playing it usually.
-Strange systems and workarounds for today's era. It's hard for people to understand why people are spamming through thick walls, and how to buy ammo. Especially with no one else to play, I'm pretty sure it's hard for people to get into the game, unless they're already a massive Source/GldSource fan like me.


While I've only listed the cons right here, I don't think I'll have to talk about it's pros, and what a massive success and blast it is to play. I suppose that thousands more people have already talked about how great of a game it has been. I'm just a little disappointed at the fact that it is much harder for newer people, especially at this game, to get into this ""old looking game"".

 I'm angry at myself for not trying it sooner! It has proven to be addicting. 

At first glances, a new player to cs 1.6 is a challenging experience. It's different compared to the newer ones. You will be up against many experienced veteran players who know the game by heart, you will struggle to maintain your cool at times, but once you finally learn the game, take the time and actually play it, it gets better. It's a difficult challenge, and thats what I like about it. Can run on any computer because of the specs: light-weight, low spec, Simple yet Complex. The gameplay is an adrenaline rush. An enjoyable experience all-around.

Huge learning curve.So get ready for ""C'mon, how did he even shoot me?"" ""Where??!!"" ""I hate this game."" ""HOW??"" You'll be saying that alot.   -- At the end of the day, it's 100% better than the newer counter strike titles. More skill and effort is required to play compared to the other ones in my opinion.

Counter-Strike, the popular online action game and first-person shooter for the PC.

Gameplay

I bought it and played it online for years. The 1.6 version is by far the best in terms of playability. When they released Counterstrike Source they traded a lot of the game play for better graphics. It's a very old game by todays standards but if, like me, you've got quite an old PC which won't play a lot of the newer games, and you want to play in real time against other real players not bots then this is the game for you. If you've never played it then here's a brief run down of what the game is about. You first decide which team you're going to play for terrorist or counter terrorist. You then equip your player with a weapon, secondary weapon, ammo, grenades, kevlar etc. Then depending on what type of map it is you have an objective if you're playing a defuse map then you need to plant a bomb and let it blow up (terrorist) or defuse the bomb (Counter Terrorist). Hostage map stop the CT's rescuing Hostages (terrorist) Rescue Hostages (Counter Terrorists) on any map there is another objective -destroy the other team. The first team to complete an objective wins the round. Depending on which server you play on there are loads and loads of variations in maps, objectives, round times etc. Some servers have custom maps with no gravity, pistols only, knives only etc. etc. etc. The game really is vast and there are still many of players worldwide who play this game.

23,72205186,english,"           Jogo magnifico de belos gráficos que colocam qualquer tipo jogo de eletrônico no chinelo.
  As ambientações detalhada milimetricamente, que em gameplay se bate muito bem, as ambientações além de serem detalhadas a nível de The Last of Us Part II, tem como sua complexidade o equilíbrio entre os terrorista da Al-Qaeda e os soldados americanos.
  Os sons nesse jogo eletrônico são introduzidos de maneira supimpa, é realmente impecável como que um jogo tenha efeitos sonoros a ponto de eu me confundir a vida real.
A jogabilidade é revolucionaria de maneira nunca vista antes, além de ser simples e completamente divertida, trás outro aspecto realista que seria o detalhe que trás esse jogo a ponto da realidade, quase de cair o queixo de bem colocada ao game é, seria o tal ""recuo"", no começo quando você é apenas um patinho feio em meio a jogadores de nível minimamente intermediário, vem a imersão que se tem de segura-lo a parecer um grande soldado condecorado de tão bem a maneira de que se manuseia cada arma.
  Agora vem as partes principais: as gameplays e os impressionantes gráficos de cair o queixo de qualquer um que olha.
  A gameplay para players iniciantes e casuais é de certa forma complicada, porém, ao aperfeiçoar seu estilo no jogo, entre eles: o fuzileiro, franco-atirador e o espião que passa por todos sem ninguém se quer saber de onde ele veio.
  Agora vem o prato principal, os gráficos.
  Eu nunca vi gráficos tão impressionantes quando eu vi esse jogo, quando joguei pela primeira vez, pensava que se poderia sair um tiro pelo meu monitor, são detalhes minúsculos que passam despercebidos entre 90% dos jogadores, o modelos dos personagens são de altíssimos poligonos com textura de alta resolução que se parecem com pessoas de verdade, uma vez até tentei tocar na tela para verificar se era possível sentir o personagem, os modelos da armas não tem o que dizer, é como se você estivesse segurando a uma arma de fogo de verdade.

Nota: 9.8/10
Conclusão: não a mais o que dizer, é um jogo que não falha em nenhum tipo de aspecto,
e se falha se passa despercebido, porém a nota não foi 10  por conta deste pequenos erros
não perceptiveis aos olhos humanos.
Recomendo a principalmente para jogar com amigos.

Counter-Strike is a game developed and published by Valve, the classic FPS shooter

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Counter-Strike overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]
