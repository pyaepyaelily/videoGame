16,76345792,english,"The game is actually quite addictive and really good fun.... The price of the DLC however is an absolute rip off even on sale. Seasons should be base game the same with a few of the other expansion packs as for the stuff packs not worth the price of a decent indie game (bar a few quid) this is an absolute shame and pure greed on EA's part. Buy the base game for a fiver and just add CC. At the price point of the complete game its no wonder its so heavily pirated, its a weird way to go about it lower the price point less excuse to pinch it. Most of the stuff packs contain very little to justify a tenner.. I make my own CC so it was worth a few quid but no fkn way Im payin that price for what I can make myself in a few hours.
""EDIT""
So because Ive played for over 16 hours steam wants to know if Ill change my review...
hmmm well the base game is ok but lacking in what should be basic game mechanics as I said earlier seasons should be included in the base game by default Id say the other expansions have some argument for DLC status BUT they are over priced for what they add to the game. The building is still not as good as sims 3 but the character creation is more flexible. 
Pluses (at least for me) its easy to make and add custom content (Steam workshop ability would be nice for CC trawling the sites and remembering where you got CC can get problamatic if you use alot... Keep notes lol its the only way). I have not baught the game up until now but have made CC for freinds in the past (kinda why I picked it up needed to update some stuff for ppl and having the game makes that easier instead of my mate testing a blindly made package files (they usually work but testing my self is better.
I suppose the point Im making is if EA wernt charging quite as much for expansions maybe around the 15 GBP Id be able to give this game a positive review but at 650 odd GBP for the full game I cant recomend this unless you can create your own content. Sims 4 studio is user friendly and has lots of easy to follow tutorials to get you started, from the eas of adding your own stuff this title due to the community is worth a punt if you dont mind not having or paying for what should be in the core game. 
""EDIT 2""
on reflection I have decided to change my review and its for an odd reason I suppose, Whilst I still think the full game is overpriced, I do like how easy it is to access and alter content I also like how I can use all the FX in game without DLC restrictions, the only thing that is missing is a map editor or an easier way editing exsisting content.",1600715759,1602008669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198001802099,135,4,10755,4792,10410,1602081499

I was poor. Trash, broken sinks, rotten food was normal at our house, had to share my house with two other females. So the best way to get some money? Create our own company, but we need investors.

There's this family that lives in Oasis Springs. Nice house- no. It's a mansion. No doubt they had all the money in the world, so how would we be able to get it? Send in one of the roommates to get to know the family, don't make us look like a threat, we're friends! BANG! Shot the wife dead, no witnesses. Son does a barbecue and sets himself on fire. Don't alert anyone about it, perfect accidental kill. Only one left was the husband, now a widower. Get close to him, console him, then seduce him. Confess your attraction, dating, and soon she's proposing at a library. He of course says yes, moves into our house. Shares his money and sells his house. We become millionaires, the day we dreamed about has become a reality. Now then, what's the use of him?

Years later, outside of a giant glass skyscraper is planted three graves hidden out of sight. We forget about them after a while, but keep them as a memory of how our company began.

With that out of the way, I do enjoy the Sims.

I bought it again on PC because I wanted to mod it, and it's more convenient for me. It's not bad, but this is a very simple game on its own, I mean Origin sells it for 5 dollars; at most I could understand if it was 29.99.

Unless you have money to waste or The Sims 4 is on special offer I would not recommend buying it. As for all the Dls/expansion packs you are going to be paying about £300-£485.73. The special offers aren't to bad. Its still a lot of money when its not on special offer. I'm guessing The Sims target kids mostly. What kids parents can afford that on a normal income?  I was expecting a lot more when I bought it when it was on special Offer with the Sims 4 Pets. 1. Why doesn't it have cars? Like tf, who decided 'ya we just gonna be lazy as fudge and not add cars because we can do what we want...' 2. Horses ;-; Horses were my favourite things about the Sims 3 pets plus you got to have pet snakes, bird etc. You got so much more in the sims 3 pets then this piece of- Anyway I love horses and because I can't see or ride horses in real life games made my dream come true to have them in the sims 3. I love horses. But this is just doggo's and cats. Well done for adding two pets into to the game. The sims development team feel like they gave up and are now just in it for the money.

84,76296808,english,"Get the Sims 3...its not worth it.   

The Sims 4 is certainly enjoyable, but its a money pit that just doesn't do things as well as the previous Sims game.  You get less content for your money, you can tell alot is missing from the game which they sequestered off unless you decide to pay $10-20$+ for it all.  Like, there are building feature tabs with no items in them...clearly those items were made, but they purposefully left them out because they wanted more money.  I'm fine with that all to an extent, but to purposefully provide less content in your vanilla version so you can milk it is vastly different than releasing a finished product and THEN adding content to it to spice things up.  So whereas the base game is really cheap, a good portion of the DLC/contentpacks should have been in the base game, but were purposefully left out. 

But going to pros and cons- 
Pros: 
-Finding items on the world map is more exciting
-Alot of restrictions that were more politically correct and limited character growth were removed
-More customization/options to do various tasks than the previous Sims
-Character interactions and graphics were updated and look really nice

Cons:
-Unlike previous Sims, they added content after Vanilla was released as icing; this game seems to have been made and content was removed where you will need to buy that removed content (what my mini-rant above was about)
-Certain features are not implemented well, like finding items in the world.  Having certain items always appear at certain places consistently every few days cheapens the action
-Its way too easy...if you start out with the normal 20k, start the game with $30 in your pocket and plan to slowly add to your interiors as you slowly get promoted, you don't do that anymore.  You start off with the 20k on a house, spend it till you get $30 and then you walk outside and scavenge to get an easy 1k every few days.  Before you know it, you never need to actually work to just have unlimited funds.  This makes alot of game choices and options seem very trivial
-The new simplified SIMs emotion bar is incredibly easy, and it slowly loses its appeal.  You CAN change this in the options menu to the old SIMs emotion bar, but it leaves the same impression as if you found a way to cheat in the game.  Its hard to go back because the cheats make everything easier, but now that everything is easier, there doesn't seem to be much motive to do anything.  This should not be the default emotion bar, the more complicated SIMs emotion bars should be default.
-Interactions are more boring...unless you buy the content flavor packs, its kind of like Crusader Kings...after 10 hours you kind of lose your motivation.  There aren't enough random events or things to do.  

Overall:
It might be worth it to buy it ONLY on sale, but you'll need to get all of the content and flavor packs.  The DLCs are also just too small in of themselves...its like they took the Sims3 (which already had issues with spending money on lots of dlcs and content packs), somehow made it even more about money by giving you less for the same.   Effectively, you are getting a graphics upgrade for a few new minor features that aren't implemented well.  Stick to the Sims3, or better yet, the Sims2 and you'll never even care about whats going on with this new one.  Also, they plan to release the Sims5 soon so...why spend $150 dollars on this when you can wait to see about the new one (which I assume is a clone of Sims 3 & 4, just with a slightly different flavor of icing on it).",1600630188,1600630188,False,4,1,0.572663307189941406,0,True,False,False,76561198046478654,479,8,1222,0,1222,1600592319

87,76286775,english,"I have to give negative review because i feel little bit sad for product what has so much dlc but lack content in them. I own most of dlc from sims 1 and never played sims 2-3 but this game. Has some good but it feels like basic life is empty. I grind skills to use them for nothing and you die old age with out anything in them. I have played with out cheats and with cheats either way it feels like there´s nothing happening... I do own some dlc in this game but these do not bring activity to life. Sims 1 had robbers, fires, clown and other things happening here. Most biggest things you experience is mostly fire and fixing things what break. Here things typically is same. I had one vampire invasion that´s it.

While there is lot of good improvements compared to sims 1 and i have never played 2-3 but what should have been better thing to test first. I have to say. I hoped so long fransice had more in it after so long time. Where is cars where is anything to spice up life. while there was enjoying moment but those turned dull really fast because people are bland or i need perhaps bring more dlc in fold to enjoy it more perhaps... Those what i own are basic magic, vampire, seasons, famous and some of these dlc were in bundles so got some cheaper prices but 20€... If you could sell all dlc in 160€ then i could accept it. But.... i all ready wasted about that in sale on basic 4. This come´s from sims 1 fan... Game has lot of potential but damn they need to invest more in basic events in game and fix some great issues what i have with this game. For sample this game lacks open all command. So your sims can buy seed backs directly your inventory. You can have 100 of these. You need to do these one at time and even then you cannot order same thing many time´s in row. Why in hell there is no open all seed packs etc. Other is order and buying stuff from pc and stalls. Why there is basic click command increase pieces number ctrl + mouse 1 to 10 pieces at on. When you want fix your house max tech you need 100 parts. so order to get these you need to click all part purchases 100 times x 4 of each. My hand is suffering from this more than typing this review. Then come´s to npc sims. They are noxius and breaks your things. i owned butler and i wanted to take care of my daughter in game. Well i was not enable to do anything to child because AI keeps cancelling my task and I kept cancelling NPc task and NPC would not do what is told to help dying child. Because i kept placing brat to eat butler kept throwing it floor. When i tried to take her play with dolls and sleep. Something else ruins that. Butler to rest of family. So in the end she became sloth and hot head with fancy 2 color hair style on. I nuked that family later on. Happy end...

Here start some my experiences in 71h gaming this game.

Story 1. I made aspirant alchemist whom tried to make unlock immorality and worked as oracle. He was maniac lone wolf and genius so he never left house outside work times. He was super fat and afwul neckbeard and later on aspirant poins gain i ordered him exercise. So later on he looked fat man with massive muscles on fat like that old photo of fat man looking him self in mirror where round belly had muscles on. Then she met lady who started hang around him and managed get her preg and got butler and nuked this house hold because everything turned shit. Because basic system sucked previously and lot more...

Story 2. I made female vampire who could impregnate other women and had 3 traits. evil, flirty, and perfectionist. She mostly did art early on and got fame with that but i went to science job. cloned my self 3 of us. all same traits expect main one got the alpha rights to go after women. I cucked neighbour family goths and used bella goth like rabbits do each other. She has 6 or more lost count. Mortimer is not single bit wiser when she come´s to me each night when he plays alone in home rising my brats. Lot easier than previous family rising. Also she was not only one who was used. Went after my co workers and some lesser famous people like some trailer lady on famous expansion. Non of them were wiser. Still playing this this character but feels little bit boring as there has been nothing because i go work sleep with goth... About test boundries more.

Story 3 start. Same person as story 1 but this time cheats and testing how cruel and chaotic i can be with magic. testing currently.

32,76143180,english,"I rarely review games, mostly because I never think about it.  This one, however, stands out in my mind because it's a very unusual experience for me.

When the Sims first came out years ago, I didn't give it a second thought.  The very concept just seemed...strange to me.  ""Why would anybody play that sort of game?"" I wondered, especially with the huge number of farming games, fishing games, tractor games, golf games and so on, which were equally as ridiculous to my thinking.

The high price tag on it and it's DLC was much, much too stiff for my tastes even if I HAD been interested in it.  I didn't give it a second thought, until a couple of days ago.  Steam had it on sale, for a huge discount over its normal price.  I figured ten bucks wasn't that big a deal, so I'd satisfy my curiosity and see what the big deal about a glorified ""dolly dress up"" game was (that was my perception of the game for so many years).  It'd mean throwing away the money I'd normally spend on like lunch at McDonald's or something.  Whoop de doo.

However, after I installed it, groaning all the while at my over curiosity, I actually opened it up.  It wasn't some fantastic revelation, or like I'd been touched by the hand of God or anything.  But I moved things around for a bit, only to discover a couple of hours had gone by while creating my character and meeting my roommate through the tutorial.  That surprised me, really surprised me.

The game is oddly compelling and engrossing.  It's enjoyable, and most importantly, it's just simply some brain dead fun for laughs and a bit of creativity to creep in there.  Not bad at all for a ""dolly dress up"" game.

The real fun for me started last night.  I opened a new game to test out a new lot I'd downloaded and thought looked interesting.  So, my character is puttering around the house and I decided to just watch and see what she'd do.  In her infinite wisdom, she decided to go out on the deck and grill some hot dogs.  I'm still not sure how it happened, but she caught the thing on fire, and started hopping around screaming.  I didn't realize there was an ""extinguish self"" action at the time, so I kept trying to get her to run out of it, thinking she'd stop, drop and roll, or at least jump in the water garden right beside the deck.

To make a long story short, she tried to call the fire department but ended up dying before she could.  The game just sat there for a couple of minutes, only telling me that the character died in a fire.  The Grim Reaper showed up right after that, and hovered over her for several minutes it seemed like, grunting and groaning the entire time.  Then he pulled out a TABLET of all things and started entering her information and other dead type stuff I imagine, which made me start laughing like an idiot gone crazy.  When he was done, he gave another angry and exasperated growl and chopped her up, game over.

So I wouldn't waste all the work I'd done on the house, I moved a new household in, a full bunch.  About twenty minutes in, one of the characters repeated my poor first character's mistake and set fire to the grill, but she lived.  Not ten minutes after that, another of the characters was cooking in the kitchen, and set the stove on fire.  The $3,200+ stove.  She survived, and I just replaced the stove, because I didn't want to imagine what one of the guys would have done trying to fix it.  I had to breathe, after all.

All that to say the game is an enjoyable experience with great potential for custom content creation, and just goofball fun on top of it.  It's got to be at least as interesting as Farmville, Merge Dragons, or something like that, right?  Seriously, I had a lot of fun with it, and play it a lot over the past couple of days.  I still think the price of the expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs and all that is WAY over priced ($40 for party hats and favors?), but some of it I would consider buying.  I would consider it even more if it didn't cost as much or more than the base game.

Still, I give the game 8.5 out of 10",1600383428,1600383428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198258108511,26,1,10066,6137,1233,1602068872

94,75997699,english,"In the ancient days, I enjoyed the original Sims though stopped playing around Second Version.  I decided to mess around with the game when the entire line-up was on sale and have really enjoy playing the game again.  While DLC is on the expensive side, I found the sale helped in that regard a lot.  The Sims is not everyone's cup of tea... so which the videos and do a little research. For those who enjoy these games... I highly recommend though I would wait for sales to pick-up the DLC.

----- PACKAGE THOUGHTS -----

With regard to what I would regard as the essential starter package, I would recommend the following for the most basic semi-real world experience:

BASIC STARTER PACKAGE: Sims 4 (Basic), Sims 4 Deluxe, & Go To Work (which greatly expands the job options) plus Holiday Celebration Pack (FREE).  

ADVANCED STARTER PACKAGE: City Living, Dining Out, Fitness Stuff, Laundry Day Stuff, Vintage Glamour Stuff, Romantic Garden Stuff, Cool Kitchen Stuff, and Perfect Patio Stuff.

OTHER ADD-ON PACKAGES: Seasons adds seasons to the game.  Discovery University can be used to extend professions and educate adult Sims who want to return to school though are not raising kids.

PARENTING & PETS - BASIC PACKAGE ADD-ON
Obviously, if you want to deepen the lives of your Sims - 2 Pet Packages (Sims Cats & Dogs & My First Pet Add-On).  Of course, if you want the full kids experience, Parenthood, Toddler Stuff, & Kids Room Stuff.

THE REST - SPECIAL INTEREST & DESTINATIONS:

All the rest depends on your interests in certain areas, styles, and themes which can be very fun should you be interested in them - aliens, vampires, beauty spas, vacations, and seasons.  In put these into the final category as they are not essential for basic human-oriented sim world and some can drastically change the world - adding aliens, vampires, wizards, and X-Files Things - or eco-friendly/thin house living, magical islands and life-styles of rich and famous.... and so on. 

----- GAME PLAY SETTINGS - AGING SIMS -----

If you have never before played, you should be aware of the aging process that occurs as normal mod requires you to manage your time and focus on what is important to your sim as you will age in a fairly fast manner.  Sim Life Spans can be increased or decreased - Short, Normal, Long.  If you like to developed a family line, normal allows you to follow your original Sim(s) and then their kids, grand kids, great grand kids, and so on. If you are interested in developing your specific Sim(s) or plan to play several different families and rotate between them Long is a good option.  it is also possible to turn off aging for your Active Sims (You're Playing) and/or Aging For Inactive Sims (AI Driven) - of course, babies maybe forever babies and so on.  If you are really developing Sims, you might want to play with Aging Off & Normal/Long and simply toggle the aging to on when you think Sims are at the point you want them to age up.

Other ways to defy aging exist, vampires are immortal and wizards and research rare potion that makes one immortal. Others may exist, but these are examples in the write-ups of the downloads so not spoiler.

If you decide to purchase, I hope you enjoy it.

[h1] TLDR and Crazy Events at end of review.[/h1]

[h1] The DLC Argument [/h1]

Many people say ""ElECtrONic ArTs PrIce TOo mUCh"". Let me say it like this, I thought the same exact thing and used to hate EA for how they did things, but I can say this. I have received the BEST customer support service from them (was given a free game due to their system screwing up my account and they threw in DLC too) and this DLC while pricey is TOTALLY worth it, and I evaluate DLC EXTREMELY HARSHLY. If it can't do my dishes, sing me a song and entertain me then I don't buy it...and while the DLC can't do the first two, let me tell you it's so entertaining I'll do the dishes myself. -Throws dishes into dishwasher already piled full-

You can go to work with your Sims on some jobs like Acting, Detective and some others. You can go camping, go fishing, vacation to other towns and still live in a separate town. You can throw parties (not the normal Sims parties) that are super big and gain fame. You can do so many things that the DLCs add on that totally make the price worth it even if you buy only a few at a time.

DLCS I HIGHLY recommend

Cats & Dogs (Because why wouldn't you)
Get Famous
Get to Work
Journey to Batuu (If you like Star Wars)
Life of the Party
Up all Night

If you like Fantasy things

Realm of Magic
Vampires

If you hate people cutting off your water in the middle of the week due to ""conservation""

AVOID the ECO DLC

[h1]Pros[/h1]

1. Graphics are MUCH better and way more swag than Sims 3 even with mods
2. Great interaction options and so much more customization
3. Can customize diet, life style, much more and be good or bad.
4. Can help be a MUCH bigger influence / help when teaching kids in Sims 4 and they grow up smarter, better and get good perks if you do it (Parenting DLC I believe)
5. You can Woo-Hoo in fun random places now. Try for a baby in the outback in a bush. ""CRIKEY"" she stated ""THAT'S A BIG ONE""
6. You can own and build your own businesses with DLCs now too
7. Customize your Lots in the game to replace dull boring venues with ones that you like!
8. This list is gonna keep going so I need to stop now...
9. There are a LOT more skills you can level up now. (I should stop adding to the list...)
10. You can literally be an online famous star and do PC geek video stuff (Help me...)
11. YOU CAN MAKE GNOMES HAPPY ON SIMS THANKSGIVING AND GET FREE ITEMS!!! (Seriously please help me stop...)
12. You can befriend Sim Santa Clause and get gifts (Mine came into my house and cried to me, I cheered them up and he ate my food I made him. Okay I gotta stop send help...)
13. This list isn't going to stop itself...there's just too much content...DLC overwhelming...

[h1]Cons[/h1]

1. ECO DLC (STOP TURNING OFF MY WATER!!! I JUST NEEDED TO PEE AND SHOWER! IT'S TIME TO STOP! NO MORE!)
2. DLC price is hefty even on sale plus tax. It's worth it, but finances can be a strain at times.
3. Sometimes I've noticed that Sims can be a bit unresponsive when you try to tell them to stop something and they're talking to groups of people. You basically have to spam click stop talking even if you turn off free will mode. (Not sure why...)

[h1]TLDR[/h1]

Pricey DLC that is WAY MORE THAN WORTH IT. Much more content than Paradox DLC (sorry guys, I love Stellaris and your games, but you really let us down with your content quality this past year or two). Great base game, plus the Digital Deluxe Version content is actually WORTH it too. Ability to have thousands of game time hours and still keep playing. This is literally my new favorite game.

I highly recommend it. It's quite fun and interactive with MANY options, customization, features and more. I even hired a repair guy to come fix my stove that was on fire and we literally sat at a table chatting having fun while the stove had flames shooting out of it. Guy finally got up, fixed it and left. That's quality realism right there.

But don't take it from me, take it from Zoidberg!

[h1]Crazy things that have happened so far in game to me:[/h1]

Literally just watched my Sim take turkey, go to the bathroom, hold said turkey in his hand, sausage in the other, use the bathroom, wash his hands, and the turkey then eat the turkey...

Had a friend who died in front of me come back to use my video software to be famous: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2226340607

As a famous rich person I hired a butler to clean for me...who then proceeded to spray liquid all over my expensive computer cleaning it... https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2228621518

Butler start smooching and making out with the girl my Sim was going to get engaged too. I kicked her out and the butler walked outside later. This is what happened:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2229197337

Became friends with the Grim Reaper

Kissed a ghost and became friends with them

Had stalkers like my Sim as a famous actor so much they clean my house for free

Have vampires trying to get into my house every night to bite me

Went on a date and the bartender saw my famous Sim and stripped naked and started serving drinks

3,75976805,english,"I played this game and after comparing it to Sims 3 -- TL;DR at bottom

-Graphics: Goofy, which is cute, however it lacks (in my opinion) the realness that TS3 has, which charmed me into playing the sims.
I'd actually rather play The Sims 2 than this as it has more content than TS4 if I were looking for a cartoon-y game to play. It's like I am 'watching' my sims, rather than playing with them. I dunno, it just feels like The Fairly Oddly Parents (or Lucky Lucky Star?!) to me in a way...

-Gameplay: The same, but worse. It lacks the amount of options you could do in the Sims 3. Such as: having part-time jobs, seasonal holidays/festivals, Showtime's Singer/Acrobat/Magician careers... these are a few to name, but the most important points that I noticed that really made me despise this game is:

1) Loading screens... everywhere you go (unlike in TS3, you could walk, jog, cycle...) 
2) DLC is expensive, if it isn't on sale, with some having little content/or world content (Looking at you, 
    Vampires...).
3) Why is Toddler Stuff not included in Parenthood? 
4) The AI is really bad. My sims keep on waving their hands in the air trying to get past a sim who is in front 
    of stairs/or as an example, a chair. 
5) Only cats and dogs? What about birds? Horses?
6) The exploring events are really sad, though I do like that you can 'pick your own path', but I really preferred 
    TS3's World Adventures style of exploring pyramids, tombs (and whatever else I can't remember off the 
    top of my head)
7) Talking of vampires, where are werewolves?

Also, I am really disappointed that a lot of the events in the Sims 3 aren't quite in Sims 4. Burglaries, wild animals wandering about... I feel kind of trapped playing as my sims as I can't walk across the street, unlike in TS3 I could jog my sim over to my neighbour's house and knock on their door.
It's like we aren't in control.
Another point about how pretty bad TS4 is, if you are still reading this, it's about the traits.
The traits in each sim I have met in TS4 have really common traits (creative, hot-headed, genius, LOVES OUTDOORS, BRO!). It lacks variety -- this is what made me drop it after a day's worth of playing the game.

Replay-ability? Not really, it gets boring fast. The thing really letting this game down was (and still is) the loading screens for me. I just can't keep clicking on the map, then loading, visiting Art Gallery and doing what I wanted, then going onto the map, clicking home... loading... home. It got so boring at one point that I ended up browsing on Reddit and forgot about the game.

I did also notice that the game feels too family-friendly -- which can be great for new Simmers/or children... but it makes it seem to diluted.  [spoiler]I want to be able to cage sims in an empty ! I want to 'accidentally' leave my fireplace in the middle of a room full of carpets, stealing sim's spouses![/spoiler] 

All in all, my hands are getting tired so I will write my TL;DR conclusion:

PROS
+Cartoon-esque
+Family-Friendly content
+Smooth FPS
+Fun Create-a-Sim features (close-up detailing)
+Hair looks nice
+Sea is nice
CONS
-Not enough content
-Too many loading screens
-Bit Buggy
-Werewolves not included
-You cannot pick your own colours from a colour/color wheel
-You cannot walk to another neighbourhood/or downtown
-No cars
-Variety of traits are bad

Have fun, and sim on.

63,75880949,english,"The base game is bare-bones, lacks depth, and has most of its features stripped off and moved into dlcs, which, with current discount, cost more than the base game itself. And what I mean is that each individual dlc costs more than the base game.

The game is a step down compared to The Sims 3 and even The Sims 2 in every department with exception of maybe visuals.

It feels like somebody worked very hard to reduce and simplify every gameplay mechanic, but at the same time as a part of some sort of machiavellian plans ensured that at least visuals are solid.

This creates bizarre situations where some areas are strangely polished, but the actual gameplay is a letdown.

For example, in the build mode there are bunch of improvements compared to TS2 and TS3 - you can now relatively painlessly resize rooms, some objects ""click"" together and form groups (like chairs next to dinner table), and sims can combine some actions like now they can chat while eating or writing or ... Then apparently modding is made a bit easier and more streamlined (and uses python instead of C#), but...

BUT. Horoscope is gone, traits and aspirations have less impacts, ""memories"" (which stored major events happening in sim life along with screenshot) have been removed, and in many situations sim's mood only affect flavor text and color of the option you choose. For example, ""Workout"" becomes ""Energized Workout"", but it is the exact same thing as before. No gameplay effect. Most of the mood effects are done in the same way - flavor text/color change. Sims personalities are also extremely shallow, and as a result, they look largely the same, as most effects introduced by character are minor and largely amounts to a +- to sim's mood.

In essence it resembles brain-dead approach EA took when implementing ""Military Strength"" in Mass Effect 3. Every single difficult decision you ever made, every thing you ever did was reduced to a small +/- 1 to the total stat, which made the decision feel irrelevant. The same thing happens here. Someone tried to overstreamline every single thing related to sim's moods/characters, didn't exactly understand what this game even was about, and that resulted in soulless result we have. A complete letdown compared to previous games.

Oh, and let's not forget about the elephant in the room. The sims 4 removed Create A Style feature, which, in Sims 3 allowed you to recolor every object and every piece of clothing you had, They removed open world mechanic, and they also removed story progression for town sims. Well, at some point a semblance of story progression was patched in and town sims now age, but I haven't seen them form families, like they used to do before..

Also despite all the cut content, EA found time to insert SJW pandering in their game. Ridiculous.

So.

In the end, the base game maybe worth buying with 75% discount (like we have now) check it out... and then skip all the dlcs.",1599960661,1599991998,False,2,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,False,76561198007847377,759,74,1460,0,1125,1600199838

I think insane sims are more fun this time around. They talk to themselves, or their hand, quite a bit and it fills their social need. One of mine read a book to the couch, even showing it the pictures. They are highly unpredictable even with free will off, but they are worth whatever trouble they cause. I think the best combination is Insane Genius for the craziest behavior.

The biggest downside is the price of extensions and stuff packs. The game is good without them, but very limited. I suggest saving up and watching both Steam and Origin for sales. Steam has them more often but Origin takes more off during their rare sales.

97,75861645,english,"If you consider getting this game but never played sims 3: Get sims 3 instead.
Seriously.
Technically Sims 3 has one downside. If you play for hours on end you'll need to move your family to a different neighbourhood or your savegame gets corrupted and your game will crash continously untill you export your family and import it in a different savegame.
Sims 4 is more buggy, has more pathing issues, has  way, waaaaaaaaay less options both in design as well as gameplay.
Sims 4 is inferior to sims 3 in almost every way. 

Even though I highly recommend Sims 3 above Sims 4, these would be the reasons to get the sims 4 instead of the sims 3:
* You can choose your characters walk animation
* The tropical island expansion is playable
* Cats and dogs in the pets expansion demand less attention and are thus less annoying
* Transgender sims
* Children are less of a bore
* Vampires actually have interesting gameplay (though unlike in the sims 3, in the sims 4 vampires require a completely seperate expansion pack)
* Plots have traits, you'll need to eco expansion pack but there are actual mechanics to make eco friendly living an interesting part of the gameplay, sims 3 has a very minor implementation of this (clothing lines instead of dryers), sims 4 has a somewhat better (though  not impressive) implementation
* Slightly lighter / more colorful color template. Though sims 4 completely scrapped sims 3's ability to make a personal home decor style, so it barely matters
* (considering you have the correct expanion packs) being able to go on holiday to the jungle (though in sims 3 you can go to france, egypt or china...... so that's 1 destinatrion versus  3......",1599931266,1599931266,False,5,0,0.585648298263549805,0,True,False,False,76561198033424674,416,9,1011,380,631,1601227671

10,71692069,english,"After the unapologetically bugged Sims 3, I honestly thought it couldn't get worse with Sims 4, but EA has not failed to surprise. Actually I let EA surprise me despite my better judgment. This garbage was released in 2014, and so little work obviously went into polishing and straightening out.

1 minute in: The end of first day. He goes to bed. I thought he would wake up when he was fully rested or something and intentionally didn't force him to wake up, I let him sleep as long as he wanted. A little too much couldn't hurt. He sleeps for about 20 hours straight and consequently woke up famished and immediately peed himself.

10 minutes in: I make him wake up (of course). He does wake up (good for EA), but the sleep icon bottom-left doesn't go away. It just stays there. I can do other things, but it just won't go away. OK. Whatever. EA after all. What did I expect? Then I do some stuff, days pass: It stays there. Doesn't cause any inconvenience other than the impression it gives that EA doesn't disappoint. OK. Whatever.

25 minutes in: Now another icon gets stuck there right on top of the sleep icon. Again it doesn't affect the gameplay. I'll let it slide this time, too.

30 minutes in: Next day. He eats. I order him to clean up his plate. The icon disappears about a second after it looks like he's going to do it. Then he just stops. Minds his business. Clean up the plate, please? Again the same thing. He won't do it. OK. Whatever. I can place the darn plate in the trash myself. Problem solved, right?

Bunch of hours in: The stuck icons go away when I save and exit. Maybe that has to do with him not doing what I told him to do. I can just save and exit every time the icon gets stuck. The two bugs turn out to be unrelated. No activity icons are stuck, but he still persistently won't  clean up his plate OR take out the trash. Or rather, he takes the trash and drops it before leaving the house EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hmm. OK..

6 hours in: Certain actions randomly become undoable just whenever. It would be tolerable perhaps if this bug was limited to minor actions like cleaning up, but now he won't go to work. I spent half an hour trying to make him go to work. Saved and exited multiple times. Nothing works.

Finally: I start a new game. Maybe something was wrong with the previous one. A car was stuck somewhere in town? A fish tried to hop out of the water but couldn't so the game understandably had to go haywire? The usual Sims 3 circus shenanigans could be happening and breaking the game. I start a new game. My sim goes to bed at the end of the day. I let him sleep until the bar is fully green, and I tell him to wake up in the morning. 3 hours until his shift. We got stuff to do before that. He won't wake up. I break the wake up command. He sleeps like a baby. He has been sleeping now for close to 2 days, and I guess he's about to die peacefully in his sleep. Soon he'll be out of his misery at least.

EA, my dears. You deliievered a most fantastical disappointment. I honestly didn't think you guys could outdo yourselves in the embarrasment department. Bye forever.

If you're looking for creativity the previous title is the way to go, sims 4 removed the colour wheel, many of the traits, items, reduced neighbourhood size and location diversity, game play and probably more though I'm not going to waste anymore time on it to find out

Steam rejected my refund request, I really wouldn't bother. The fact that this game exists in it's current form is frankly insulting but I've learned my lesson. I will never waste my money on another sims (or any other EA) title again

My playtime at the time of the writing is only 3.7 hours, yet I played the game before on PlayStation 4, and my playtime then was probably about 120 hours at the least. The Sims 4 is way more fluid with the keyboard and mouse rather than using the right stick on a wireless controller to navigate through every single action and menu in the game. The game itself is sort of simple. It's pretty confusing if you skip the tutorial (which I highly recommend doing). Being able to customize my own characters with their own unique personalities is a very interesting concept that's handled well in this fourth entry. I spent nearly an hour customizing my house from the ground up when I first started. There's a lot for your people to perform and interact with like other in-game AI characters to befriend and hang out with. Your characters are capable of feeling a variety of emotions and you have to help them through whatever is happening depending whether or not it's something negative that can impact the way they interact with others, their career, their day, etc. I do not think the game should still be retailed at forty dollars, though.

Designing your own houses and exploring different lifestyles is fun, and is absolutely the time sink I wanted. BUT.

For a game that's been out this long, there are a lot of bugs and a surprising lack of content and options. If you play it for any length of time you're going to quickly get bored with the base game. And the expansions are the cost of an entire new game for some reason. I guess that's what you get with the industry leaning more and more heavily into microtransactions (at least it's not $1/single piece of art yet...). But it makes the game feel really underdeveloped. Really you're gong to need custom content from other players to get the most out of the experience.

And the brazen money-grabbingness of it all is further evidenced by the latest game pack. Look, it's a game where you micromanage stuff. It's not a grand majestic space opera. Disney and EA both need to calm down and realize that just because you have rights to an IP doesn't mean that people aren't going to get sick of it if you slap it on EVERYTHING. Cost effective or not.

I mean, I can easily put the same number of hours into a nice open world RPG that already comes with all the features for way less money. The Sims 4 is only worth getting if you have the extra cash to burn.

But by far the most annoying thing for me personally is I can't run it if my laptop is on battery power, because it crashes. That's just unacceptable. Fix the @#*& game.",1599627858,1599627858,False,28,0,0.702220320701599121,0,True,False,False,76561197997504712,30,1,10906,0,10080,1600313196

47,75312508,english,"It's been difficult for me to express the joy this game has brought me. My brother played a couple of the first ones way back in the day and the idea of micro managing toiletries and doing household chores never appealed to me. I watched a let's play of a team of people seeing who can kill their sims the quickest, and while I never really plan to be that cruel, it still gave me a good look at the interface and it was the first time I thought ""hey that actually looks kind of fun"". Sure enough, I would go on to dump almost 90 hours on it within a week (my back going out and having to stay home from work helped this endeavor).

It's still hard for me to explain why I love it so much. In one way, it caters to my inner character creation. My mind has always been a character generator and I've blogged and done short stories about my various characters throughout the years. This game allows me to get into their heads a bit more and live their daily lives. I have a powerful witch, a naturalist islander, a famous painter and DJ, a couple of adorable aliens... And one character whom is essentially my self-insert, a woman I wish I could be. She's a writer, and made a surprisingly decent living dumping out blog posts, reviews, and a children's book about my childhood teddy bear. If only it were all this easy in real life.

That really is the appeal, isn't it? I never thought of Sims as a 'lifestyle simulator', but here we are.

I wish I could go review each and every pack but I got a good chunk of them on sale through Humble Bundle, but it went directly to Origin so I can't directly review some of them. I will say that if you're reading this and wondering; Seasons and Magic are probably my top two favorite. Season adds weekly dynamic events that really help shuffle up your daily routine and get you out into the world properly. Strangerville adds a more point-and-click adventure style type game but Act 3 brought in an irritating mechanic that forced me to rush through it. I could go on all day about the packs but I'll save that for my actual blog.

I'll do a short dive into the gameplay. As you might be aware you can create a sim or multiple, I believe the max is eight? I had trouble just managing four so most of my households stop at 3 and maybe a pet or two. You can indeed manage their daily toiletries but I honestly cheat in some reward store perks that shut down the needs to eat and sleep and that has paid dividends into making the gameplay more enjoyable for me personally. Regardless, I've done non-cheaty characters in solo or duo households and it can be managed once you get some of the basics down. My aforementioned writer made a small living off of publishing her books and thus lacked a proper job for a while, which in turn gave me a lot more time to manage her usual bodily functions.

I will admit I don't build any damn thing from scratch but thankfully there is an online, in-game gallery where you can sift through some of your favorite creations and just plop them instantly, funds allowing. The most I do is combine and slap together premade rooms and then just work on the decor and upgrade. I never build anything myself because I just do not have the mind of an interior decorator.

One quick point of contention: Loading up the gallery destroys my bandwidth. It freezes most of my computer's functions as it's loading. It hasn't caused any crashes, but my podcasts and youtube videos start having hiccups, like an old skipping CD and it's very annoying.

Beyond that, everything else is a nitpick. You can go on all day about EA's general business practices. Some of the packs can be seen as simple cash grabs, and the upcoming Star Wars pack looks fun but I think it breaks the flow of the game somewhat.

All the same, I've adored this game and will be playing it for several weeks to come. Or at least until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out. I have more to say but as I mentioned, I'll save it for my blog.",1599028370,1599031535,True,45,1,0.780506491661071777,2,True,False,False,76561198065343430,527,102,9984,4,5392,1600918445

8). Many buffs that are funny af
9). You don't die easily

11). Fireman come when the alarm goes on. 
12). NO LOADING SCREEN

14). You can make different files of the families so you don't interfere with THE SAME WORLD

16). DIVING BOARDS

There's are neighborhood plans and perks, like an HOA combined with city gov or something. One of the perk laws you can pass amounts to 'free stuff'. It seems like a great idea, right? Everything belongs to everyone, and it's all free for the taking. But then you pass it and watch all your Sim's stuff they worked hard to get taken away by everyone who visits their house, to the point where you don't want guests anymore. The only way to get around is to go to other people's houses and take even more of their stuff, and to keep doing this every day that it becomes a job to 'steal' enough stuff to let your sims live well.

You realize that it wasn't such a good law idea after all, and you go to repeal it, only it's kinda really hard to repeal things while stealing enough stuff to survive, and no one wants to sign your damn petition to repeal the law because they all like free stuff. But you have to do it so eventually you just let the wife starve to death so you can concentrate on getting those 5 signitures you need to repeal this really awaful law/perk thing in the small time limit you have to get them.

So you've finally done it, and you have no stuff in your house because while you were inviting people over to get their sigs they took everything, and your wife is dead because you can't do 500 things at once, and they took your kid away because you forgot to feed him.

Update: I got the game working by deciding to disable every background program on my computer. I narrowed it down to my sound driver. disabling the sound driver makes the game work now for some reason. It may have taken me over 5 hours of trouble shooting, lets see if it was worth it.

Final Update: It's another Sim game. If you liked the others you'll like this one. The biggest problem for me is so much of the content is locked behind pay walls.

It's a great series. Super fun. Gameplay-wise, I can't see many faults, and I have spent many hours with it.

But EA is easily the most predatory company out there. The base game is just enough to get you hooked, but it does not feel like a full game. Don't worry, though they have over $500 worth of expansions and DLC to add to your simming experience. This will, however, not change the fact that you cannot go through a single playthrough without having to reset a sim because they got bugged and won't do anything to stop their impending mortality. Because, guess what? No matter how many packs you buy, the vanilla game has game-breaking glitches that can and will ruin a playthrough! I don't have a single mod installed and I still have to periodically google different bugs to figure out how to fix them.

Most of the time, I would be reminiscing on how we used to be able to buy a game and it would be a whole, playable thing, but honestly? The Sims was never like that.",1595470880,1595470880,False,22,0,0.722158372402191162,0,True,False,False,76561198191676721,98,4,3427,0,2621,1595904127

I do have a few problems with it. There's no cloud saves on either version of the game, the cloud saves are only on consoles that's my main complaint. I love The Sims series a lot and I do find the expansions worth it (only when their on sale) Humble Bundle is currently doing a sale on the game and every piece of DLC (Origin versions Only) the good thing about it however is that you can use all of those DLC with the Steam version once your link your Origin account to your Steam account. I love the fact that EA is putting their origin games on Steam (even though you'll still need Origin for some weird reason) however it does open door for millions of Steam users to play these games especially multiplayer games where some FPS games are usually dead in a year due to lack of player (CoD on Steam).",1595147298,1595147298,True,31,2,0.762112200260162354,1,True,False,False,76561198263091795,549,15,133,0,43,1596976693

I've been playing The Sims since ""The Sims Bustin' Out' was released on PS2, and every game always has me hooked for hours building and working on careers. This game is no different. I'm amazed that I spent 2 WHOLE days designing one house, for a game to be able to keep me hooked for that long doing one small part of the entire game is a huge plus for me.  How ever if you are looking to buy the DLC's for the game I would highly recommend waiting for a sale as the $50 NZD is pretty steep for just one of the many choices. A huge pro for the game is that if you already owned the DLC's from Origin then they will automatically transfer over to your account BUT you must purchase the game on steam regardless if you already own it on Origin.

56,72929944,english,"Buy it from Origin/ EA and get all the dlc pretty much for 50% off steam's pricing. I played the sims 4 without any additional DLC for about 80 hours, so if you believe this game/sim is incomplete from the get-go, you're sadly mistaken. It is FUN. Furthermore, about the DLC, one must understand that kids play this game too, so I could see why the packs were broken down into a few different categories/quantity of building stuff. The benefit of this is 'you get to choose what you want' so your computer's storage space isn't overloaded with a bunch of 'unnecessary' stuff. Kids want DLC too but the cheaper stuff, hence the 'stuff' pack creation. Believe it or not, some people live in rural america with very limited internet connectivity, so the stuff packs are a way for them to get things they can use and still remain manageable on their PC.

 I play sims on a hardcore gaming rig in HD but prefer playing games most of the time at 4K res, and it has played reliably without a hitch for 80 hours in HD. The graphics are nice and smooth, character movement (joint detail accuracy) simulation is pretty close to stellar. It is better than a lot of other sim life that I play but is still rough around the edges. What should be round still appears to be in a prismatic form or hexagonal in nature when zoomed in all the way. Nevertheless the game isn't meant to be played in that fashion. I feel the need to be clear, that it's NOT 'bad' but could be improved upon.

The game is challenging in several stages, progression is smooth and feels natural. However, it would be nice to hear the sims speak english as opposed to mumbling gibberish, but the time will come eventually in a human 'sim world'.  Take a look at 'House Party'.

Nevertheless, the developers have done a great job with the Sims 4, I'd imagine the scope and range of entertainment was quite an undertaking to perform. To get it to be this good, is quite impressive actually. If the sims 4 people could be added  to another type of sim like American Truck Simulator or an 'aviation sims' perhaps with the ability to build stuff, the fun factor would be endless in a virtual world.",1595132991,1595133491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198971979787,118,18,43363,0,4795,1600409897

The amount of mods is insane and for the most part install easily and are higly compatible. none of the pain from my fallout/elderscrolls days. 

I myself prefer the more localized system in place compared to the more open world in sims 3. game is far more stable because of it. I really enjoyed the feature but youre sims eventually completly lose there fucking minds and thats far less pervasive here, and there is a mod that fixes issue altogether. I have a pretty midrange computer and it handles the game wonderfully. If you have trouble playing sims 3 this is your game. graphically it's not much more impressive than 3 but it has alot more charm.

My biggest gripe is that this piece of shit game is a like an 8+ game and they shove there politics right up your ass everytime you open the game. BLM is a terrorist organization you assholes. I'm a conservative christian you don't need to force that shit on me or my children. I cant let them play this right now because of it.

I'm even okay with you misrepresenting the climate issue in the latest dlc. but you blatantly dumping you're support for a terrorist organazation on me on the homescreen, i dont appreciate it. I dont appreciate how stupid cocksuckers like you dont know that the union has been literally shattered in the last two scotus cases and youre supporting a group of murdurous communists.

14,72650278,english,"The Sims 4 is the most lacking base game we got and took awhile just to get pools, ghosts, stairs that can bend and now windows that can be put on half tiles. The things they did get right this game? Create a Sim is WAY EASIER to make unique looking sims and not have them all looking like the same in game. Building is amazing in this game, it’s a lot more friendly then Sims 3 ever was because it doesn’t punish you for changing the floorplan or wanting to add a basement like the sims 3 did. That being said the sims lack that personality they had in the past games and they all start to feel the same after a generation. If you want to play base game only for a while I would say you need mods because that’s the only way you fix the dull gameplay it has to offer. 

Mods I would use? MC Command Center , Slice of Life, UI Cheats, Meaningful Stories, Basemental Drugs (18+), Wicked Whims (18+) and T.O.O.L if you like to build.

The DLC is way too much for what they have to offer but that being said you don’t have to buy the DLC on steam. If you shop around on CD key sites and activate the code on origin, you can still use the DLC well playing the steam version. Which means another thing people hate, It launches Origin to play the game which is a turn off for most people. 

I would still say buy it, I picked up some DLC and i’m having a blast playing. You make your own fun in this kind of game so don’t expect it to push out a story for you. Play with life, play with sims.

34,71151448,english,"TL;DR: Game is ok base game wise and has it's own strengths and weaknesses, DLC definitely improves it though. Price is definitely terrible for DLC, so wait for sales. Base Game 7/10, Game with the 4 mentioned DLC 9/10

This game WITHOUT DLC is... meh. It's definitely shallow in comparison to Sims 3, and it's missing several features that seem vacant for no reason at all. An open world being one of these removed features. The moodlet system is really nice and it changes up how the game is played overall as now you ACTUALLY have to play while keeping your sim's emotions in mind. The relationships between sims are a bit more dynamic it seems, and skills that were once unnecessary are now key to making certain things go as planned like pick-up lines and jokes requiring charisma and the new comedy skill. More dynamic job systems are definitely welcome.  Some side gigs like writing and such have been reworked and even overhauled in some ways to be ultimately better. Creating a Sim is more dynamic as far as body goes, but the clothing options are severely hampered due to the inability to make custom clothing or even hair colors. The hair color options are slim, so removing the ability to have custom hair colors seems like a bad move in my opinion. The AI of sims have somehow both gotten better and worse. Sims will actually actively take care of themselves better based on what I've seen, but they also make nonsensical choices for seemingly no reason at all. For example, When instructing my sim to go indoors he picks the longest way to get there sometimes. Also, sometimes sims will have conversations while making food and even though there's an open spot at the table they will actively go to the sofa in the other room, thus ending the conversation abruptly. Aside from these gripes, I think the base game is pretty alright. Also, there are no substantial community hangouts on the map at all in the base game, only parks which is strange. The game itself is just plots to build a house and put sims in as random sims come and go from your house. That effectively brought this game down from a good game to an underwhelming meh game immediately. This means the only plot worth visiting is your own house, then you just hope that sims that have time to talk to you show up. They later added more in DLC, but this segment is for the base game. Ultimately it had me on the fence the whole time. Certainly wait till the base game goes on sale for super cheap. 

Once you add DLC though, this game ends up becoming great. For this segment, I have particularly gotten Get to Work, Get Famous, Get Together, and Seasons. I think these 4 are the quintessential DLC's that you must get when you can. These expansions add what the game is missing like the aforementioned local hangout spots (which are added in Get Together). The content the expansions add are definitely something worth noting. Get to Work and Get Together are the ones (in my opinon) you ought to go for first. They add what the game needed for sure, such as more interactive jobs and social hang out locations. The other two I listed add stuff like a fame system that actually works better than the one in sims 3 and seasons with more holidays than the sims 3 by a landslide (you can even make your own holidays). HOWEVER there is one glaring problem with all of the DLC's... the price tag. These DLC's have no business being priced as much as the game itself. None. So my advice, just like the base game, WAIT FOR A SALE. There's even DLC for DLC, its kind of absurd (Looking at the ""My first pet stuff pack""). Aside from pricing though, these DLC's are actually solid and even adds stuff that sims 3 didn't have/handled poorly.",1592782231,1594527411,True,51,1,0.803462505340576172,0,True,False,False,76561198066806674,412,30,1372,0,409,1599514121

*When you go to play it, Steam will launch origin, where you will find a new game in your library called the Sims 4, but this one has the Steam logo on it.
*Because your DLC was purchased on your Origin account, it will show as already purchased for this new game as well, but you WILL need to reinstall it on the new game... Which takes forever.

Saying all that, is it worth it? Personally, the reason I got it was because for the life of me, I could not figure out how to switch languages and as I love the sims, I wanted to use it in another language I'm trying to learn. Steam was able to let me do that finally and extremely easily! So far I'm really enjoying it and learning a lot. Also, I like the Steam interface and the befits of being able to connect with friends on Steam while gaming and I'm expecting easy mod downloads with workshop. Plus for future DLC, the sales definitely come to mind.

While I think the overpriced DLC is RIDICULOUS (I know expansion packs for The Sims have always been a thing, but... this is insane.), I think that the base game + mods, is actually worth it during a sale. I'd also say that while it might be called Sims 4, I really feel like this is almost a ""reboot"". It's like going back to the original with refined graphics, and gameplay. It's not a bad game. It's actually deeper than meets the eye at first glance, but when you look at the effort a company like EA puts into other titles... I just have no idea how they rationalize the DLC cost, except that they have no competition and The Sims 4 does a really great job at what it does, even if it doesn't quite meet the expectations set by its predecessor.

I recommend the base game wholeheartedly if it's on sale. If it's not? I can't. I actually enjoy this game faaar more than I ever thought I would, but $40... years after launch, with an insane amount of DLC that all costs just as much or more than the base game? No. 

I feel like the average gamer who would even consider buying this sees the DLC cost, and it's just an automatic ""nope"". EA I feel like could have tripled sales, by cutting prices in half. Yes, the franchise has a loyal following, but it's a good game that could have brought in waaaay more customers, had the price of admission not been so high. What sane person pays $40 for an expansion for pets?

Then there's the question of... what happens when Sims 5 comes out? How long are they going to support this title?

README IF YOU HAVE THIS WITH ANY DLC ON ORIGIN:

So I have an odd special review for people in the odd predicament where they already have this on Origin with a ton of the DLC already.  If you have it on Origin and you already have a collossal ass-ton of DLC on there, you can actually buy the BASE GAME here on steam, and Origin will add all the DLC.  YOU DO NOT have to buy the DLC twice if your wanting to go from Origin to Steam, only the base game.  The price of the base game has nothing against the price of all the DLC as I'm sure you may know.  As it currently stands, half my DLC is from origin and the other half is here on steam, so I know it works (you do gotta tinker a'lil).  Ignore my playtime by the way as I've played a bit on Origin.
If you do do this I recommend on the sims 4 store page here on steam clicking the dropdown arrow on all the DLC you already own on Origin and click ""ignore"" which greys them out on steam to kinda indicate to yourself you already have them on Origin.  It really helps any confusion and keeps you from accidentally Double-Dipping DLC lol.

As far as the game review itself goes it genuinely is a really great game but stupid stupid STUPID expensive if you want the whole package with all DLC.  While I recommend the game and DLC I also at the same time cannot in good conscience say that the price involving the DLC is AT ALL fair, not even close, not even a teeny-tiny bit.  I am honestly as appalled and disgusted by the price of the DLC as I possibly can be. It literally doesn't get worse than this, just putting that out there xD.  IF YOU MUST and are (R@zY like me for the love of GabeN wait for the DLC to go on sale as low as it can frikkin go.  If your a game collector that seeks the full package from your games then EA developers are gonna bend you over and buttfk you with an XL spiked strapon (no lube).

If I could make a neutral review, I would.  Gameplay alone is great but its extremely difficult to ignore, let alone forgive, that eye-sore, tacky, bright-pink & polkadotted elephant in the room lol. :steamsalty:",1594333641,1594338386,True,18,1,0.662430107593536377,0,True,False,False,76561198065605623,786,32,136,0,121,1594334555

Several bugs, missed opportunities, removed features, small maps, loading screens, superficial and limited game play, etc, etc. The advertisements for Sims 4 promoted ""you rule"" yet there are very few instances in which players have full control/rule over the game.

-Bunch of really nice quality of life features compared to the previous titles

-The game feels soulless and cutting corners at every possible opportunity to do so.

-Action queue is extremely buggy years after the game's release, the amount of time for a sim to perform action/idling is nonsensical.
-Removed sandbox design and put in the older scene/lot system is such a backwards compromise that's almost certainly done for technical/engine limits reason, such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out.(As expected, the decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc content, which feels really disrupted by the constant fast travelling",1594082492,1594082492,False,485,6,0.959623098373413086,20,True,False,False,76561198160257050,293,10,7103,0,7103,1594080534

the most meaningful part of the sims, form the game.. toally...
you can no longer choose a texture, and select a color, and make shit MATCH!
you can choose 3-6 options.. that is it...
neutered that puppy they did, and no longer will you have an amazing amount of content put out by everyoe.
PLUS, builders got neutered as well... 
they got a cartoon map, with a few preselected lots.. 
and as for open lots...
you get 1-3 to choose from..
seriously!??!??!
are you kidding me ?!??!?!
WHERE is my build mode that i can put in 100 lots on the map?
need a new lot for a new familiy.. forget it.. there is only ONE that has sufficient lots for a group of sims.
SEASONS i think it is that you want... NEWCREST is the town you want for building the nieghbourhood of your dreams..  whichever pack puts that in the game.
really disappointed with this decision(s) that the developers did there
-
they have gone and done it, they have made it more MOD friendly.. it's amazing the MODs  peopole made for this game.. 
though the previous had mods too, they couldn't do THIS with that system.
-
they even have a furry mod, so you can have dog like sims,.... wolven if you are into palladium..
they probably have cats.. and all kinds of crazy stuff.
they even have a wooHOO mod for pervs that are into that kind of thing.
you cant do that with the sims3 as far as i am aware...
carry an easle on you, for potential moment swith the family are afoot, you can pplace the easle down, take a screenshot, and pick up the canvas.. and continue the painting at home.

it is good, you will definitely get down to $1 an hour with this game before you know it...
but that being said, it's EA/Origin/<axis.. they have a ton of expansions...
that being said, keep that in mind when you get expansions.. you need to  be able to pump some hours into the game to get that $1 an hour ratio, to say that it was worth it.

expansions i would go for:
Seasons first, they are set to 1 week at first, so crank that up a bit so you can enjoy the seasons properly.
Pets .. 
Realm of Magic.. 
the others are what features you really want.. though you want it ALL, dont you?
that is where Steam comes in.
-
it is an Origin game.
so you will have to sign up on that, buy it through steam, and whenever you have a sale, which will most likely be on steam.. you can buy something..
now if you already have the sims4 on origin.. get it on steam as well, for the deals.. 
you get more sales on steam.
but BE MINDFUL of what you have and dont have.
Originwill know, but Steam will not.
so LOOK before you buy.
SHIFT-F1 at the sims4 loading screen will make the downloader available, so you can see what needs to download.
-----
now that's is out of the way...
it IS a good game, i will play it a lot.  i mean a LOT.
but the sims3 has SO much more you can build upon.

i miss non flat land to build upon. 
walk out basments and stuff... you got to put SO much work on flat land to make that happen with sims4.
sims 3 i had a whole bunch of 1x3 lots along the river side, each with a walk out basement that was epic.
they reall y need to do a HILLS world.. so we can do that again,.
not everyone likes to be flat when you build.. you need an up or down slope to the land... and..  give me back my map with expandable lots.. jeeze... 
it is worth it.
you will enjoy it..
but you will miss it a bit too ...
all at the same time..
and give me my colorwheel back..
big bullies ..
meanies...

So what is ""The Sims"" (Why are you even asking this question?) - in short the Sims is a virtual life simulator; you create avatars known as ""Sims"" and watch them live their life to the fullest or to the shortest; you can upload and share your creations with other Sims users AND you can mod the Sims game. And this is quite a shock but despite Origins; the game runs very smoothly with it active; Obviously since it's because the game isn't tasking on your system. 

There is more creation to your Sims; that's always nice to see - attire including.

The only issues that i encounter is A.I. computing and when i mean by that it's mainly what they want to do first versus what is most vital; so for example, if they are getting super hungry they might do something else; got a pet that needs feeding? well too bad the sim wants to look at a painting; it's all rather odd.

73,71509183,english,"This is predatory spliced up game play in its most diabolically pure form. I've only purchased the base game at a $20 discounted rate and am content with it, but what they are attempting with their $1000 DLC bundle at full price is criminal.  This game was released in September of 2014, six years ago.  It is trying to plumb $1020 from its fanbase for what is at most $120 worth of content.  Compared to Sims 3, it under delivers.  Take the Pets expansion for example; in Sim 3 you can have dogs, cats, horses, even a unicorn that could be sent out to burn down the houses of your enemies (not even joking.)  Sims 4, on the other hand, provides a ""cats and dogs"" expansion that simply includes cats and dogs...  Or take the Halloween themed content; in Sims 3, you could not only be a vampire, but a werewolf, fairy, a witch, wizard, or ghost.  Sims 4?  Vampires... and vampires alone is the whole expansion.

Yet, in the end, neither of these titles are worth the price they are asking, especially when there are current developers in the indie circuit that far outclass the quality and quantity EA and Maxis have reduced themselves to.  Given the practices of the company and their history and their continued action, all I feel is shame in my purchase of their products and the only redeeming factor is that I've acquired said products at a severely reduced rate.

Here are the ones I recommend vs. don't recommend having played with most of the expansions except eco lifestyle. 

[b]Highly recommended: [/b] 

1. Sims 4 Get Together: The most underrated sims expansion pack. Allows you to create unique mini-communities that your sim would be part of, either it be family, or coworkers, or hobby groups. Super useful in everyday game play. I use it to make family gatherings, after work hangouts, holiday parties...etc. The groups also allow you to modify other sim's behaviour based on your expectations which really adds realism to the game play. 
 
2. Sims 4 Cats & Dogs: Pets in the sims are a favourite of mine. Sucks that we don't have horses like the sims 3 but I am overall very happy with the cats & dogs expansion and I like the new vet career as well. 

3. Sims 4 Seasons: Self-explanatory. Adds seasons to your game. Sims behave differently based on different seasons. Also adds holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day etc. Highly recommend for varied game play. 

4. Sims 4 Parenthood: Adds activities to toddlers, children & teens in the game. Allows sims to parent their kids. You can give kids chores, ground them, reward & punish them for specific behaviours etc and these actions will have impacts on your child develops. More importantly, this is a game pack so it is only half of the price of the expansion packs. 

5. Sims 4 Dine Out: Same logic as parenthood. Allows your sim to eat at restaurants & also manage your own restaurant. One of my personal favourites. One of the better game packs. You can get a lot of hours out of this pack. Also super good for rags to riches challenges. 

[b]Medium recommended: [/b]

1. Sims 4 City Living: Allows you to live in cities and brings apartments to the game. Also adds various festivals to the game which are good outing spots. Really good expansion pack but ranked lower because I don't like how in the sims 4 they split sims 3 late night into three expansion packs - city living, get famous, and vampires. 

2. Sims 4 Get Famous: Allows you to become famous actor, streamer & DJ. Adds new world which is equivalent to LA in the real world with gated communities and hot venues. Really enjoyed the actor and streamer careers and I think the concept of the pack is good. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing with fame in previous sims games. Again ranked lower because I don't like how they split one expansion pack into three expansion packs. 

3. Sims 4 University: Allows sims to go to university. Not essential to game play since sim's don't really need degree to get jobs in the sims 4. However, it is well made and recommended for people who enjoyed the university expansions in the previous sims entries. 

4. Sims 4 Realm of Magic + Vampires: Essentially EA broke up Sims 4 Supernaturals and sold them in individual game packs, which is good in my opinion because then you can just purchase the occult sims that you were interested in. The realm of magic and vampire game packs actually went into each occult sim (wizard & vampires) in more details that the Sims 3 in my opinion. Rank medium because I think occult sims are not essential to game play but they are really fun and I would recommend picking up these two game packs when you get the chance. 

[b]So-So recommended:  [/b]

1. Sims 4 Island Living: Allows you to travel to the island world of Sulani. Adds mermaid to the game. In my opinion this should have been a game pack instead of an expansion pack. I am disappointed that they took out the resort management system that was in Sims 3 Island Paradise and I do not think this expansion much content compared to the other ones. 

2. Sims 4 Get to Work: Adds several playable careers to the game including doctor, scientist, and detective. The careers are actually really fun, especially on the first few play throughs. The drawback is that the tasks gets repetitive after a while so I wish more variety was added to the mid to high stages of the career. 

3. Sims 4 Jungle Adventure: Sims 3 world adventures turned into a game pack. Adds archeology into the game. Good pack but ranked lower because limited replayability and also doesn't appeal to everyone.  

4. Sims 4 Tiny Living Stuff, Laundry Day Stuff, & Romantic Garden Stuff: The top of the stuff packs. Tiny living stuff because it adds interesting concepts & objects to the game. Laundry stuff because it was a community voted pack and the build items in that pack are awesome. Romantic garden stuff because it adds good landscaping objects. 

[b] Weakly recommended [/b]

1. Sims 4 Spa Day. Outdoor Retreat, Bowling Night: Will use once or twice. Not that important to game play.               

2. All the other stuff packs and whatnot: $$$ packs by EA. Only recommended for avid fans of the series who have a lot of $$ to spend.                                                                                          
                                               
[b] Not recommended [/b]

1. Sims 4 Luxury Party Stuff: Almost $1 per item. Do NOT get unless you already got it. Ugly items that you will never use. 

2. Sims 4 Strangerville: Not a bad idea but zero replay value once you've been through it once. Use your money on some other game if you must get it.

3. Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle: Reviews have been horrible. There are many bugs reported online.  Community action plans are a HOT mess. Do not get it until EA fixes it.",1593807374,1593808137,True,72,0,0.866426289081573486,0,True,False,False,76561198296646684,124,19,18350,1347,3059,1601387213

Having now been around now for almost 6 years and still being supported with new expansions, The Sims 4 is showing no signs of going away and honestly, I’m here for it. It has the same problems, still, as The Sims has always had with AI and pathfinding, and now and then a Sim will steadfastly refuse to follow any kind of instruction or will stubbornly defy you in ways that make you believe in the possibility of computer sentience, but there’s so much content now that even if you only stretch to a pack or two here and there, there’s a ton of stuff to do. You can have kids and outfit their rooms; you can buy romantic props for the garden, build greenhouses, have pets and fall in love while walking them in the dog park. There are restaurants and ice cream parlours and a school of magic, if you’re that way inclined.",1593716396,1593716396,True,6,0,0.558424293994903564,0,True,False,False,76561198046669210,792,24,11103,0,4189,1600429178

6,71884419,english,"This is a write up on what happens if you already own Sims 4 on Origin and buy it on Steam.

= Installing =
The Origin and Steam install are in separate locations so everything will have to be redownloaded.  Any DLC you've bought in Origin will appear in game (but not in Steam).  Oddly there's no download progress for DLC bought in Origin and downloaded with Steam.  It just states ""a background download is in progress"".  Also, Origin now shows me two copies of The Sims 4 - one version is normal while the other is marked as ""Steam"".

If you want to go back to the Origin version just uninstall the Steam version.  Steam will delete it's installed copy of the game.  When you launch Origin it will think Sims 4 needs to be reinstalled.  Since the original Origin install folder is still there it will quickly verify everything and you'll be back to normal.

= Running the Game =
When you launch the game from Steam it fires up Origin.  When you launch the game from Origin it fires up Steam.  Even if you launch the Origin installed version of the game the Steam version supersedes it.  So if you install both an Origin and Steam version of the game it will always launch the Steam version.

= Sales =
The Sims 4 now has different in-game store fronts.  Right now there are no sales going on in Origin so that version of the game just shows all my unowned DLC at regular price.  But Steam IS having a sale so running that version of the game shows all the DLC at a discount.  I didn't buy any DLC from Steam so I'm not sure what happens with that.

= Saved Games and CC =
Both versions of the game use the same ""My Documents"" location for saved games and CC.  There should be no issues with that once all your DLC is installed.

= Bottom Line =
If you have any real investment in the Origin version then I'd say stick with that.  If you're new to Sims 4 then Steam is probably better.  The dual client thing is annoying since you need to wait for Origin and Steam to launch but Steam is the more robust client.  If the Steam version wasn't tied to Origin then I'd absolutely recommend dropping Origin but since you need both it's not worth the hassle to transfer to Steam.  Hopefully EA will get a clue and fully merge Origin and Steam accounts and just get rid of Origin.  The fact that Titanfall 2 bombed on Origin and is a huge success on Steam should be all the proof EA needs.",1593702526,1593702526,True,63,1,0.867829561233520508,0,True,False,False,76561198024928793,655,18,11,0,11,1593697718

8,71876185,english,"I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content.

I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so:

Some Pros:
- The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different ""worlds,"" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit.

- The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea.

- Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious.

- Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit).

- Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits.

- Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable.

- A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care.

Pro/Con:

- The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a ""professional gardener"" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun. 

- Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands.

I'm saying ""pro"" and writing ""con"" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around.


Cons:

Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers.

-  I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one.

A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm. 

- There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game ""more challenging"" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way.

- You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats.

- You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you ""short"" or ""long,"" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is.

- S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool.

- The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so. 

- Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin.

When I purchased The Sims 4 on Steam the reviews were at Mostly Positive, which for me is as good as Mixed reviews, it means there's something or some things that people didn't like about the game, so usually alarm bells would start to ring but as I actually owned this game on Origin before hand. It's good to see people in the reviews start to comment on the game rather than EA and Origin, as those are the main problems with the game. I knew that I loved this game and most people will get their bang for their buck. I like to have all my games on Steam and adding a game as a non steam product doesn't feel the same as owning it on Steam for me, it's sounds small but I know I'm not the only person that feels that way. If you don't care about owning this game on Steam, buy this game from a key site. It will only be available for Origin but it will be much much cheaper, same with the DLC. But if you want the game to appear on your Steam profile I would say even the base game alone is worth the money, the game's description mentions the use of imagination and the game only gets boring when you run out of ideas. 

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
    [*]Replay Value - Like I mentioned in the intro to this review, the game only gets boring when you run out of ideas on how to play. You can do a save as yourself, maybe try and make a character from a movie or any other form of media, maybe make a celebrity. The possibilities are down to you. You can turn off ageing so if you want to do a save as the same sim for a while (which is what I'm currently doing) you can, or if you want to do a save with multiple generations where sims are going to die during the save, that is also possible.
    [*]DLC - This will also be in the Cons for the game, but I can't say that DLC doesn't make the game more enjoyable. In The Sims there are 3 types of DLC: Expansion Packs, Game Packs and Stuff Packs. I own 3 expansion packs at the moment and I would say that they are all worth while, I don't think it's wise to buy multiple at a time, just buy them as you want them, this game can be very expensive to play. Do your own research on what expansion packs would suit your game more. Game packs are also worth looking at but add less content than expansion packs, therefore they are cheaper than expansion packs. I would stay away from stuff packs as buying them adds up, modded content can be just as good, but if there's one that interests you, go for it. Wanted to add that any DLC you own from Origin for this game will work on the Steam release, it won't show up in your Steam library but as long as you use the same Origin account for this game you'll be fine. Originally DLC wasn't working for me but it fixed itself after I uninstalled the Origin version of the game and Verified the Local Files in the Steam properties.
    [*]Mods - The modded community for this game is top tier. There are mods that are as good or better than official DLC for this game. There's some mods that add 18+ rated content to the game, which does make the game more fun, but there are some great mods for people who want a more SFW experience. WickedWhims is great if Woohooing isn't enough for you, Basemental Drugs obviously adds drugs to the game, Sacrificial Mods make loads of different mods which can be a bit over the top, if you want violence in your game the Extreme Violence mod is pretty detailed, they also made some horror based mods if you're in to that. I find that those mods add a lot to the game, but there are plenty of mods that can add more realism to your game by adding small but useful features, if that interest you. They're a quick Google search away. 
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
    [*]DLC - The DLC is great like I previously stated but the game has been out for years at this point on Origin, but DLC is still very expensive. That's why I would recommend only buying what you want rather than it all.
    [*]Not Open World - It seems weird that they went back on a Sims 3 feature, to be honest it isn't too game changing once you get used to it, but I would still prefer it to be open world.
    [*]Origin - You'll still need Origin to play this game. You obviously can transfer your Origin purchase of the base game to Steam, any DLC you own on Origin will work on the Steam game, it won't show up on your Steam library though. I don't know if it works the other way round. 
[/list]

I would 100% recommend getting at least the base game with some mods, if you want to add more content to the game after that look at some of Expansion packs, even if you buy the game from Steam you should be fine getting DLC else where, just to save a bit of money, on sale this game is expensive and it's not always going to be on sale. It generally is one of my favourite games, if it wasn't I wouldn't have wrote this long review, which has taken me a long time.

There was more to this review but you'll need to purchase the £30 expansion pack to this review to access it.",1593688636,1593688636,True,3,1,0.559647738933563232,0,True,False,False,76561198271793696,349,14,2020,8,1119,1601551085

Now as  a new player is it worth playing god with little Pixel people, You betcha the laughs and endless hours of slaughtering your pixels can be endless, Or maybe you wanna simply build your dream house you can do that also.  However consider getting the game on sales, Sales have rolled about for this game so many times including free giveaways from other sim players in a variety of communities, It can be a lotta fun but the cost is  crazy especially for the base and all its DLC. Shop about, Look about you be amazed how the sims community can help you gain DLC and Assist with known issues. (which also can be a lot faster then EA support, Ironically)

25,71386895,english,"tl;dr This review focus on DLC's because I think they are needed to make the game fun, but as it is now they are ridiculously expensive, so if you cant afford or wont support DLC's that cost twice of what the main game cost (which I totally understand), I cant recommend this game.



I wont go deep into how Sims works, because the majority of people know how these games work and they are all very similar, one thing I will say though is that you should know that this game doesnt have open world like Sims 3 and the worlds are much much smaller, but I'll focus on content instead, Sims 4 is a decent game on its own but it can feel really empty, so if you are gonna buy this I would recommend you to pick up a few DLC's to go along with it, its expensive but its kinda needed if you want to enjoy it imo.

I'll list a few DLC's i can recommend below but I can only recommend these DLC's if they are on sale (atleast 30% off) and I only recommend DLC's that I have played or know is good.

Tiny Living Stuff: Let's start with the 'cheap' DLC, this DLC is fun and its one of the cheapest DLC's avaliable, it adds the possibility of building super small houses and use compact furniture, you can also use the items in this pack to build your own commune, since the houses and furniture is so compact that you could fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot, all depending on the lot size ofcourse, but it makes this dlc fun and unique, I also think this dlc would fit well with the Eco Lifestyle dlc.

Seasons: This is a good dlc, it adds 4 seasons with holidays and a lot of new items and things to do, it also adds new weather and ways to die. ( pro tip, you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool ) 

Get Famous: If you care about fame and money get this one, its a decent DLC for its price when its on sale and if i remember correctly you need this DLC to become an Actor.
Keep in mind though that fame is not as easy to get and keep as it was in Sims 3, in Sims 4 you lose it really fast if you stop working on it and from what I know it doesnt carry over to your kids if you decide to get those.

Get To Work: This DLC is a must have really, it brings active careers to the game, as well as the option to become a store owner and hospital visits, its just a must have DLC.

Cats & Dogs: This is the only DLC that I own that I cannot recommend, it adds very little beside cats and dogs and its so incredibly buggy, were Sims 3 Pets added Cats, Dogs, Horses and a few Small pets, this DLC only adds cats and dogs and then there is the vet business career thing, but I personally isnt that interested in that. 
Another thing is that I have adopted pets in the past and they always end up getting stuck and the simmers cannot figure out how to take care of them by themself, its really frustrating since they get taken away really quickly, there just isnt enough content in this DLC to justify the price tag.

Final thoughts on the game, I do really like this game, its more alive in interactions than any of the other Sims games and the building and character creation is really user friendly, they made it so easy to use that everyone can make beautiful things no matter how creative you are.

I'll update this review in the future when / if I decide to buy more DLC's, if you have any questions write a comment on the review and ill try and answer it.",1593166167,1593629834,True,188,10,0.895291686058044434,15,True,False,False,76561198074660874,4309,35,3927,0,2900,1595174289

Yes, there are annoying fake buildings everywhere that your Sim cannot enter.
Yes, you have to wait through a loading screen if you want to visit a neighbour next door.
Yes, there are tons of small DLCs.

Yes, the towns are so small that it somewhat justifies the lack of cars (you simply don't need transport, there is a Bicycle if you really want it).
And yes, there is ""My First Pet Stuff"".

However, there is just [b] so much more [/b] in terms of building houses, creating a Sim, general stabilty of the game (I am yet to experience a game crash or a significant bug), perfomance (stable above 60 FPS with full max settings), superfast loading times, overall contemporary vibe of the game...

76,71585998,english,"I do not get the point why a game has DLC which are under normal circumstances as much worth as the base game itself, considering that these DLC mostly only give access to more playground and areas for your characters to be in.

Same applies for other DLC worth 10 euros (discount 7 euros) which only grant access to more furniture, I most actually question what's up with the money grabbing action, I know developing games is not the easiest job to keep the customers satisfied, but this is just a very bad price.

If DLC's would be at last half the price of 10-13 euros, I'd understand it, but please, a new world for fourty euros? The entire game for 500 euros (including all DLC's) ? whilst discount? Come on already

Same applies for the base game (Yes, the product costing normally as much as it's DLC's), I have not noticed any changes from the Sims 3, with out of the way, that the sims 3 are using one base model with only a few customization options, I'm horribly shocked that the same has been pretty much just shipped over to the Sims 4, with a few tweaks here and there.

You like the sims? Get the sims 3, it's just the same, yet, a better classic, and therefore, if you want to get DLC's, you only shove half of the money (19.99€) under normal prices into them.

Unfortunately, as much as I like the sims, but alone the prices and everything considered aline, I cannot recommend this at all, unless you actually have money to shove it to a grabbing-money industry.

So I'm guessing Pets is exactly the same stuff as 3 and 2, just updated graphics.

I'll just have to wait until they do one of those 75% off sales and get a couple more packs and hope that gets me by until the next one.

The gameplay looks great and the build and buy sections are well improved. However that is about all that the game is enjoyable for.

Everyone has complained about the DLC being expensive and they are 100% right, I bought this game during a sale and still payed over $70 for the base game, 1 expansion, 1 game pack and 1 item pack. And ever with these few upgrades the game is still very boring even after just a couple hours of playing. Then to look and see that there are still over 30 other dlc's i could buy just pisses me off. The DLC's are just rehashes of the original games over and over again... university, Night out, Pets, Vacation... none of this is new content, and from what I can see its all just a waste of money.

Aside from that there feels like there is even LESS to do in the new game. The create a sim is ok for looks, but personality took a giant dip. The cities are tiny, all the shops are gone, and one of the DLC's i bought literaly had 4 pieces of land and 3 were already built on.

I started off as a child with Sims 2 I believe, I can't remember much but what I can remember is that I played a lot Sims 3 even though I only had a few DLC's. I was so excited back then when I went to the store to get the pets DLC and that one with the additional cars!

But let's get back to the original topic - Sims 4. God how much I love this game but let me confess something, the majority of my playtime comes from pirated copies because as a kid I didn't had any way of buying the DLC's. Getting that out of the way I must say, I spent countless hours in this game making a perfect Sims, maxing out all his skills, making tons of money and so on.

I don't mind the DLCs being more expensive than the base game and that the base itself lacks so many things that should have been free as much as the other people do. After all, all that matters if you are having fun playing it and make great memories with it - if you don't then you have a reason to be mad at the price.

This game and it's franchise has been a big part of my childhood and probably been a huge impact on myself the way I am now. I bet if I didn't get introduced to The Sims I wouldn't be a gamer right now!

Although I always get to excited about new DLC's I seem to never actually play their stories haha but now since the game finally hit the Steam store which I've been waiting for forever (I was thinking about buying the game with most DLC's for a long time now) I can finally play this game and discover all it's secrets! This will most likely be my most played game in the future!

A lot of people also seem to be bothered how Origin is still needed to play it, but let me tell you one thing - the same applies to any other kind of game that has it's own launcher like Ubisoft. If you are bothered by it requiring Origin then don't get the game or just get it there instead. I don't mind having Origin installed just to start the game through Steam, after all I love collecting my games on Steam so this was a great opportunity to have one my favorites game on this platform that I can track my hours on and share things within the Steam community. Please don't review bomb the game JUST because of still needing Origin or them charging a high price.

If you don`t already have the game (Like i did.) then its a very good game to buy on steam. However, if you do, then you should just play it on Origin. All buying it here does differently is add a time tracker, witch is good and bad.

THE GOOD:
The game itself looks very nice and runs rather smoothly, You can do a lot of things in order to make money, including turning over into a life of crime. There are TONS of mods and if you like DLC (Witch i do as its like mods but better if done right, tho i find these to be a bit pricey.) then this game has you covered.

I'd go for GOG above all as they seem to care about preserving gaming history. The only reason i still use steam is because all my steam wallet cash from trading still here and i cant use it anywhere else.

Seasons
Laundry Day
Parenthood
Get Famous
Strangervile
Vampires
City Living 

And if you're not sold on the game yet at the time of checking this review, I'd recommend taking a look at The Meme House playlist by Vinesauce Joel on youtube.

Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game.

To be fair, they have added a much more in depth sim creator, which is pretty cool if that's all you care about. The AI system seems to work better too with interactions between sims being more fluid and natural.

72,71186619,english,"Wow.. So where to begin?

I'm not much of a [i]The Sims[/i] fan, but I've played 1 and 2 and had fun with them for a while. Also, I'm not much of a gamer nowadays since I'm a father, having a job, and time is kinda limited to spend on my dear hobby. Nevertheless I felt obligated to post my first review because of this game. 

This was mostly an impulse purchase because, as I said, I did enjoy [i]The Sims[/i] 1 and 2 and I have some money to burn, but I'm happy with steam and aren't that keen on installing other storefronts because of a game - though, when I started up the game and saw that you needed to install origin on top of Steam I thought, -[i]""eh, ok. I've already purchased the game so.. you win this time EA"".[/i] 
Sure.. I think it's scummy that you need to install one storefront on top of another storefront just to play the game but, for this instance, I gave it a pass.

I don't like EA. I haven't liked EA in a long while. I'm old enough to remember a time that when you saw that EA logo appearing on the screen you knew that [i]""this is a top quality game I have loaded on my console/PC right now"".[/i] 
Wing commander, NHL 97, Syndicate, Budokan... [b]Simcity[/b] for crying out loud.. 
The list is long.

So.
Starting up the game went smoothly, as it should, and I thought that, [i]""now that I own the game I could buy the DLC as well. They should have some packet deal for all the DLC for 20-30 dollars,  now that they've launched on steam and everything"".[/i] Went to the store to buy said DLC and I almost choked on my newly poured cup of coffee. 

Over $500!! effing USD to own all the DLC!??? That's FIVEHUNDRED US DOLLAROONIES!! And that is [b][u]WITH [/u][/b]THE 30% OFF!? I could buy a freaking [b]Oculus Quest 128gb[/b] for that amount! 

Needless to say, I uninstalled the game, the origin launcher and am right now demanding a refund. I knew that EA were scummy nowadays, but man. I just hope that the poor souls that purchase all the DLC actually can afford it and are not feeding their addiction with money they don't have. This is acting just as crappy as all the mobile gacha games that are overflowing the market right now, but instead of characters they offer you chairs, tables and pets. I'm honestly surprised that they haven't incorporated lootboxes at this point. 
[i]""Tired of your boring gray chair? Well, RIGHT NOW! you can have a GREEN chair! ONLY available for a limited time if you buy the AWESOMELY AWESOME surprise mechanic LOOTEGG of AWESOMENESS! only available for a limited time""[/i]  

And this is having a [i] mostly positive [/i] score on steam? I just shake my head...

Good riddance

Don't pay for your DLC twice!*** (If you already have the Origin version or any packs installed, I had to uninstall Origin entirely and then re-install it when prompted by the Steam version to get the packs to download to the correct folder, which is the base [Sims 4] folder under steamapps > common. You might also be able to just copy paste the pack folders straight there from your Origin folder but I haven't tested it, can't guarantee it isn't bug free that way.)

Make no mistake, this is the most lacking entry in the series, but despite that still a fun Sims game. Definitely worth it if you install some mods (MC Command Center, Basemental Drugs, anything by Sacrificial, Wicked Whims, etc) and there are some key improvements I could appreciate coming from Sims 3. For one, at least on my system, 4 runs much smoother than 3 even with a mountain of custom content installed, and the CAS is a breath of fresh air that might take you some time to warm up to if you're used to sliders. Adding on to that, EA has implemented a built-in Gallery feature where you can upload your own or download others' households, lots, etc. which I've made extensive use of to populate my worlds. It even supports custom content, provided you have said content installed when you download something off the gallery that uses it.

However, there are very obvious downgrades: Remember Create a Style from Sims 3? That's gone, you just have to work with whatever swatches EA provides unless you download a recolor as CC. Really annoying and I don't know why they would take it out. This goes for everything: clothes, hair, walls, floor, furniture, eye color, skin tone. If you're interested in creating a black Sim then you'll probably find yourself in need of some CC as the game does a terrible job of representing the range of African skin tones. The lack of an open world will also be an issue to some, and as a consequence of this you're also restricted to a finite number of lots since you can't just plop them down like in 3 or 2. I believe the base game only has 3 worlds (one of them being empty to allow for construction - EA, if you're listening, more of these please) with the rest of the worlds coming through DLC and providing more lots, so some could see this as having to pay for space. Personally I've yet to run into the issue of a lack of said space.

If you're curious about how much mods can add to your game, I highly recommend checking out Vinesauce Joel's Meme House streams on YouTube, they're the sole reason I even bought this game as a Sims 3 loyalist. In all I'm glad to finally see this on Steam.",1592547482,1592876269,True,508,29,0.908127963542938232,20,True,False,False,76561198150444933,1344,3,9319,0,117,1599956346
86,71201675,english,"This review is for those people wanting to move their sims 4 game across to Steam:

There are plenty of reviews online about the differences between sims 4 and other versions, this review is for current sims 4 players who want to play their game on Steam rather than Origin.

The first thing you'll notice is you have to purchase the base game A SECOND TIME in order to play via steam. Not. Cool. EA. I have moved games from different platforms to steam many times and it was always free, this added expense is unnecessary and outright stealing from loyal players. - so, I suggest you grab the base game on steam when it's on sale if this is still the rout you want to take.

The process of transferring will require you to uninstall your Origin version of The Sims 4 and re-install a Steam version of The Sims 4 (still in origin). That's right, you will still need origin to play the game. If you were hoping to ditch the origin platform think again! - this makes it almost pointless purchasing via steam if you already have the game on Origin. For first time players of the sims however I recommend purchasing via steam, just cos steam is awesome! 

The Origin platform is less invasive when playing the steam version of The Sims 4, just sign in once to origin when you start up the game for the first time and from that point forward you may launch the game via steam and the origin platform will not be an issue. (allow your DLC to install before launching any pre-saved games or you may corrupt your saves (make save game backups b4 changing to the steam version! Just in case)) – your saves will be in exactly the same place as the Origin version of steam: documents/electronic arts/the sims 4/saves.

On a positive note you will not need to re-purchase any of your DLC - thank you! thank you! thank you! I'm so glad they have allowed this. But I'm not sure any DLC will be purchasable via steam at this point, all DLC may need to be purchased via the Origin platform. so again, why bother getting the steam version of the game if you already have it on origin along with all your DLC?

One reason you may want the steam version is to take advantage of the Steam Overlay. You can stream and chat with fellow steam owners from the steam overlay in game. (still not a selling point though since you can do just that by adding The Sims 4 as a non-steam game on steam… I think the overlay works when you do this but I’m not sure), somebody please check and comment thanks!

Another reason you may want The Sims 4 on steam is to take advantage of the steam achievements and badges. Yes, The Sims 4 on steam has badges! Go get your ranks up everybody!!

I guess it all comes down to WHY you want The Sims 4 on steam, if you just prefer steam than by all means, get the sims 4 on steam, transfer everything across, Bob’s your uncle. It supports the steam community, so if you do, thank you! If you don’t have the cash to purchase the base game a second time than it’s probably not worth it. If you don’t care about steam achievements, badges or the steam overlay, it’s probably not worth it. If all you want to do is uninstall the Origin platform and play on steam… well you can’t, so get over it!

IMO I got the game on steam because I like steam, I like being on steam, I’ve always wanted to have The Sims 4 on steam, and I think EA have made a pretty good compromise here, they are giving us what we want but still getting what they want. (They probably just want more money – so long as Steam is somehow benefiting from this deal than meh! I don’t care, I have the game on steam now, I’m content).

Considering you must link your origin account to your steam account (vise versa if you're starting anew on steam) I do not believe players should have to buy the game twice. 

I do love this game, but without those pricey dlcs and mods the base game is extremely boring. there are glitches, your sims will stand and idle for hours and end up letting their kid/pet get taken away or straight starve to death. 

now onto the bad, this was probably the most stressful port of a game I've experienced. I have spent hundreds of dollars into origin dlcs and did not want to lose that, download was sketchy, at first didn't want to launch and I feared I had both wasted my money and ruined my origin copy, did opt to transfer my existing dlc but when I finally loaded the game up it said I had missing game data. after a bit of fiddling and uninstalling origin entirely, reinstall did seem to finally work. both my existing dlcs and save data (with mods) was still there. except every time I go to play the game or go to a new lot it says I have missing cas/build mode items that were removed. (I do believe this is a glitch as I have all items for the packs I own)

if you are looking to buy this game, whether it be to log steam hours or you are completely new to the series, buy it on sale. it is not worth $40 for the base game alone and if you are looking into dlc I would only buy the ones you find interesting and would best suit your play style.

It's still less costly than unlocking everything in The Sims 3 (and still less expensive than games with cash shop necessities like BDO, IME). The client is far more stable than prior iterations of the franchise, as well. While it doesn't have all of the most-loved features of TS3, new content is still being released - and I'm one of those players that likes looking forward to new content releases. If you want a complete standalone game without any new updates/DLC, this simply isn't the game for you - because the base game couldn't contain all of the features/assets developed over the last 5 years, and feels bare bones by comparison. That said, the modding community is very active and the variety of mods currently available are endless, both in terms of custom content as well as gameplay objects/improvements. Look up any video re: realistic game mods for the sims 4 and you'll see just a hint of the diversity of gameplay improvements available. 

The design choice/art style has allowed game assets to have aged well, if at all - meaning it doesn't feel like a 6 year old game. In other genres, a game this old is seen as a negative, but in this case, the longer it stays in development (without looking outdated or being unstable) means the more content is available. In a franchise like The Sims, you don't want new iterations released too quickly, as a new title means development for the current title ends, and thus you have to turn to mods to add additional gameplay features/content.

For Steam users, the game is ridiculously expensive and normally on sale Origin for much cheaper.

Launching the game on Steam still launches The Sims 4 through the Origin launcher. Why?

Origin owners of The Sims 4 will have to purchase the base game again via Steam. Origin CD Keys are unable to be activated on Steam. To use your DLC from Origin, uninstall the game on Origin and re-download it on Steam. Back up your saves & mods before doing so.

46,71036321,english,"Although this is the steam version, I have clocked in well over 2,000 hours on the origin version. This game is a load of fun. I will go over the good and the bad parts of this game. Starting with the bad.

- Load screens. Loads of them. You can't visit a neighbors house without a load screen popping up.
- The visuals on this game may not be to everyones taste, as this game took a more ""cartoony"" approach compared to the others being a bit more ""realistic"" looking.

As for the good.

- The ability to play more than one household on the same save file. This is something the other Sims games did not do. You were stuck with the household you chose first and couldn't play any other created family. As a person who indulges in stories, this decision was an absolute must. The fact I could play as one family and progress on them to a certain point, then play as a different family and visit the first to admire my previous work is a real feel-good feeling to me.

- The fact that you can visit any purchased DLC world without needing to create a separate save file. You can actually visit any world you want with whatever Sim you were playing as without any problem. 

- The CAS (create-a-sim) is easily the best in the franchise. You can mold and shape your sims effortlessly in this game by simply grabbing nearly any face part (eyes, nose, jaw, chin, ears, etc) and any body part (aside from hands) and mold them in any way you want. The only thing lacking is create-a-pattern, but that isn't a big deal in my opinion.

- The graphics in this game are best in the series. Although this is my opinion, I hated the ""realistic"" approach in the previous Sims, where Sims 2 felt dead and empty aesthetic-wise. This game feels like it has more life and color compared to the previous games. The sims themselves look great as well. The ones in Sims 3 looked too similar (and a bit creepy), whereas they look colorful and far more appealing here.

- There's never a shortage on things to do. Sims 4 had a rough start, but has come a long way since its initial release in 2016. Even the base game offers a fairly good experience, but with some of the DLC (my recommended would be Vampires and Island Living), there's always ways to enjoy the game.

- This game is a lot easier on computers. There's always someone complaining about the lack of an open world, but Sims 3 is an example of they we don't have an open world. The game was horrible taxing and had bad performance issues (unless you used certain mods) to run everything that was going on in the game. Sims 4 fixed that by separating the worlds and allowing the player to access any place at any time. This decision has resulted in the Sims 4 being easier on computers than the previous installments. Although I agree that it's pointless to visit a neighbors house you have to go through a load screen, but with since we can visit any lot, any world, at any time, with very little cost to your computers performance, I'll take the sacrifice.

In general, I find this game to be fantastic in many different ways and to be the best in the franchise.",1592586724,1592586724,True,23,1,0.599453568458557129,0,True,False,False,76561198024816867,112,11,13851,1461,119,1602070966

-Still launches through Origin. Buying on Steam just adds another layer of DRM.
-If you previously purchased through Origin, you will need to redownload any DLC, even if you already had it installed
-Your DLC carries over, the base game does not, which means you'll have to purchase the base game again.
-Your DLC doesn't 'unlock' through Steam's store, if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)

It's a great game but charging £373 (sale price) for all the DLC content is stupid. There should be a subscription service in place for this (E.G - paying a small fee monthly to receive ALL the content like ESO does.)

I would've hoped they would implement steam achievements and took advantage of the steam workshop but this is EA, they don't care.

Apart from that the game is very fun, base game content should keep new players entertained for 40+ hours.

52,71021393,english,"Im going to be honest this game feels more like a Spin off title than a main line sims game. A lot of the packs feel like they were ideas for spin off games then they decided to put them into the main game becausee there is already an established player base for it to purchase the pack idea. A good example for this is the StrangerVille pack this just feels like a spin off game idea something akin to The Sims Medieval or The Sims Castaway. Also any other life state apart from young adult and adult don't have any if some game play at all 7 years later... The sims went from a life sim to a millennial sim, sad to say buts its true. 

However! I do love the new gender neutral changes to Create A Sim there is no longer a gender barrier between clothing, makeup and hair its awesome A+ for the create a sim! Also the build mode is better in some aspects but still missing some key features from previous games in the series.

57,70998168,english,"This is one of my most favourite games of all time.

I have at the moment 367 hours on Sims 4 on Origin at the time of writing this, and I don't regret a single moment of it. It is the best Sims game, the building is so intuitive, CAS feels great to use, and the game looks gorgeous.

When it comes to expansions, yes I agree that the game is bloody expensive. However, there are certain websites that, you know, you can buy these keys from, and just activate them on the Origin account you've linked. You can still use it, you don't have to own the DLC on Steam to be able to use that DLC content.

Speaking of which, for anybody like me who owns DLC content on Origin already: just make sure you link to the right Origin account. I did that, and a second instance of Sims 4 (with Steam on it) appeared in my Origin library. Then I just went into the original one's files and copied over all the DLC files (they're called like EP01, SP01 etc.) into the new Steam one, and uninstalled and hid the old one. Hours played still there, it all works exactly the same.

And for anyone interested, my favourite packs are Parenthood, Seasons, Cats & Dogs, Laundry Day Stuff, and Get Together. I wouldn't play without them, but that doesn't mean the game is boring without them or any of them at all. I got on perfectly fine without them, and if you're really gonna complain the game is bare-bones without them, you probably shouldn't be playing the game. I mean, come on, it's The Sims. I really wonder what people want out of this game if they think no expansions is directly equivalent to no content. You've got building, you've got CAS, and you have actually playing the game, for many generations. Regardless, get a few packs on some website where they go cheap, or wait for a sale on Origin since that happens quite often.",1592514673,1592516070,True,249,63,0.683687508106231689,0,True,False,False,76561198301762024,523,9,2351,13,15,1602030896
