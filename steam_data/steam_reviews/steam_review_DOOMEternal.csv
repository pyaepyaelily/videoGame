On a more serious note,
unlike some people, I like the game play loop (chainsaw for ammo, flame for armor, ect.) I also like the platforming, like a lot. Maybe that's because I like platforming games. I could see that someone who just wants to kill demons wouldn't like wall climbing and dashing to reach platforms, but I personally like that. There is only one kinda negative thing I have to say and it's how pickups look. They look very arcade-like, and it's a little weird to be tearing open the chest of a gargoyale one second and then seeing your helmet in a bright green color labeled as a extra life the next.

And let's add Denuvo because everybody asked for it and wanted it so bad.

5,77056141,english,"WHEN YOU CHOOSE EASY MODE AND ARE GIVEN HARD INSTEAD...

Look I'm getting older and I hate games that stress me out. My job is enough stress thanks... It's why I stopped playing souls games. When you play a game and it feels like you heart is beating out of your chest and you cant settle for hours after playing because it amps you up that much THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU... Your body will tolerate it in your teens and 20's but eventually your health will be effected. That's just reality kids...

So imagine how frustrated and disappointed I felt to play through on easy mode and find the difficulty ramp up to insane levels. I got to the fight with the Khan Maykr and yes I quit and deleted my game... When I had one platform left to fight on because the others were on fire and I was surrounded by enemies getting pulverized on all sides by both them and the Khan Maykr. Then I get killed after about 10min of fighting I was out... 

It was actually once I got to Taras Nabad things started getting stupidly difficult and I stopped enjoying myself. Up to this point I was having a great time and the lore was fantastic and I was totally invested.

So I look to games like this so I can play on easy and enjoy myself. Because easy mode for me is gaming enjoyment across the board.  It's how I chill out... When a game stops being fun it's time to quit.

To the Dev team: if you cant make an actual easy mode then don't advertise the game as having one. This is likely just a major imbalance issue. But still, I payed good money for this.

10,77052170,english,"Doom Eternal takes the best parts of Doom 2016 and turns it up to eleven. The extremely fun and fast paced combat is improved with new weapons to wield and power ups to the Praetor suit. The levels are dense, detailed, and extremely colorful compared to 2016. My favorite addition is the new movement mechanics of dashing and monkey bar swings that make fighting even more fluid than before.

14,77050899,english,"Doom Eternal should be played is a different beast than its predecessor Doom (2016). While both games are great, and the story, graphics and music are very similar, the mechanics are quite different. I will try to briefly address this.

The game looks great, the textures are better than Doom´s and the effects have been improved. Weapons look better overall, and the game taking place in well illuminated settings allows the implementation of beautiful sights. What´s better, it is amazingly optimized, so you won´t have any problems with a medium gaming PC.

The music in the last two games is paramount. This is it. It´s what it should be. It´s perfect. If you have a good setup you´ll enjoy the use of bass with overdrive and thunderous guitar riffs. Although it is often frenetic because of the adrenaline and fights, sometimes string and brass melodies will accompany you through your journey.

I think the most important part of this game is how it´s measured against it´s prequel, Doom (2016). This game makes the former Doom game look slow. Yes, Doom Eternal is just pure action. Enemies will give chase, they won´t hesitate and are pretty damn aggressive. Run from them into a corner and you´re dead. Think too much and you´re dead. Stop for a moment and... you get it. This game has new mechanics that should be practiced immediately. If you try to play as you would Doom (2016) you will be humiliated over and over. At the beginning the new mechanics and information can be cumbersome, but keep trying and it will be an awesome experience. 

However, the game to me seems more difficult. It´s not just shoot them till they drop dead. Doom Eternal is strategy. You have to know the weakness of your enemy, you have to be able to switch weapons accordingly,  You have to plan. All of this while you try to run and dodge fireballs and melee attacks from enemies all over the screen. Whatever difficulty you played Doom (2016) in, try lowering one level for this one, at least at the very beginning.

38,72249403,english,"Review after buying and 1 hour of gameplay : 
I bought, hated and refunded this game. This is the gist of my original review
- the graphics and the world are boring, like something Arkane Studios with come up with, with their tiny Donald Trump-hand sized assets.
- there's about as much ammo as a hardcore zombie survival game, so most your focus will be on chainsawing to replenish, then going out of ammo almost immediately afterwards
- cliched combat - do you like getting suddenly locked in a room and swamped? They got you fam, literally.
- too many darned controls again - remember how id said they wanted to take the shooter back to its origin by keeping it simple? well, it's no longer simple. Grenade launcher? Blood punch? Double jump? Wall climb? Come on - I'm a simple man who's here to shotgun demons in the face
- But the worst, the thing that kills this game stone cold dead is the jumping ... lots and lots and lots of double jump button smashing and oh you failed? Well, now you have to double jump smash just to work your way back to the place you failed at. Infact, you realize pretty soon that there's actually way more jumping than there is shooting in this sad garbage fire of a game

Review after trying it again :
I decided to give the game another try. Bought it again, tried it again, persevered through the annoyances and actually enjoyed it . But I'm still voting it down, simply because of the jumping. There isn't much ""Doom"" this time, half of it is combat, the other half is still just jumping around like a Mario game. It's a shame really, this game should have had a lot more meat on its bones.

Doom eternal is a phenomenally well tightly designed game that is more akin to arena shooters than any other fps. The criticisms that this game is shit cause it's too restrictive and don't allow the player to have fun and be creative is baseless and unfounded, 2016 gave you the power fantasy, in eternal you have to earn it and that's most people's problem with the game you gotta actually think and be tactical about it. The different weapon combos, runes and suit upgrades allows for different playstyles so long as it adheres to the funzone, Eternal encourages player creativity more than 2016 ever did. 2016 rewarded the most power heavy weapons, Eternal rewards smart and skillful high level play.

You got a dozen different things to think about every second and it requires a different thought of play than other shooters, even competitive ones. Dude I couldn't get past the first arena in Gore Nest till I lowered the difficulty to Hurt Me Plenty, now I only play Master Levels on Nightmare yet people be bitching about how the game is unfair and is shit, the point of the game constantly harrassing ya is to get ya to a better level of play.

59,73148841,english,"Doom Eternal improves upon it's predecessor in almost every way. Plays even faster, every gun is amazing, more demons, bigger levels and another excellent soundtrack from Mick Gordon. Doom Eternal has a much bigger emphasis on resource management than 2016, with a bunch of new mechanics that ensure the player will always have ways of restocking their health, armour and ammo. Demons are much stronger and more aggressive, and the game does not hold back in throwing every type possible at you in its various combat arenas. All your weapons have different strengths and weaknesses against the various enemies in the game requiring you to constantly swap between your various guns and mods in order to effectively take out tougher enemies. All of this adds to a much faster, more refined and at times more punishing game than Doom 2016.

Score: 10/10

Pros:
+ New mechanics like the dash, blood punch, flame belch, ice grenade and meathook add so much depth and strategy to the games combat.

+ Plenty of weapon variety, every weapon is effective and unique from each other. 

+ Levels are bigger and have plenty of collectables and secret combat encounters.

+ Narrative is by no means superbly written, it is Doom after all, but it is still a very entertaining, dumb, b-movie style adventure.

Cons:
- Multiplayer isn't bad, but it's certainly mediocre. Currently the only gametype is 'Battlemode' which pits two player controlled demons against a fully armed slayer. It can get rather boring after a while, and matches often boil down to either the slayer being insanely good and wiping out the demons, or the complete opposite with the demons tearing the slayer apart in no time at all. Multiplayer in general is just lacking in content with only Battlemode at the moment.",1595487870,1601792912,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False,76561198151493019,81,12,3409,0,3409,1595484766,,

The story is pretty basic but that is ok, in a game like this your supposed to just have fun and shoot, but there is readable lore for the people who want more backstory. I do have to say that I'm disappointed with the final boss because ( to me at least) it felt repetitive and tedious. But that is pretty much my only problem with the game.

TL;DR: I liked it...mostly. YMMV.

Pros

- Round-trip journey through locations like Earth, Mars, and Hell with some tremendous art direction
- Plenty of variety of baddies, even though they were in overwhelming numbers at times
- Weapons felt ""just right"" and powerful

Cons

- Monkey bars were fun for the first 20 or so times I encountered them, then they got old like the Skylines in BioShock Infinite
- Frustrating first-person platforming (outside of battles) slowed down the pacing, and not in a good way
- Never enough ammo, switching guns every 10 seconds was disorienting

Once I got into the rhythm of the game, it really fired on all cylinders. Quite grin-inducing at times.

In the end, I think this sums it up nicely versus Doom 2016:

I played Doom 2016 on Normal and could spend an afternoon or an evening of it, eager to return to the game. It felt vast.

I played Doom Eternal on Easy and got exhausted after just a level or two. It felt compartmentalized.

Overall, it's just a new type of frantic and frenetic gameplay that some players will enjoy while others will not.

Technically fantastic, I was skeptical when launching on a brand new ultra wide screen and man it runs super smoothly on GTX 1070 with ultra details. The atmosphere is dark and intense, puzzles and secrets are satisfying, sometimes tricky, but it never slows down the pace of the game. The story line is ok, it goes crescendo with an amazing end boss full of dismemberments, punches and more. I've read some comments about the low ammo, but when you understand that can chainsaw everything it's not a problem as the level design is pretty smart. It took me ~24h to go through the whole campaign, which is good compared to some other FPS out there.

One of the best game I've played in the last 10 years or so (probably since Mass Effect, so that's even 13 years). It comes highly recommended.",1601744911,1601744911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197983055325,81,1,1430,738,1430,1601744022,,

99,72277267,english,"I want to preface this review with stating this is an excellent game. The genre of FPS has been kind of stale and has slowly shifted from Survival/FPS/Battle Royale into a ""tactical"" shooter experience. This is a defiant example of what great people can do with long standing franchises when given proper care.

The gameplay is a 100% improvement from the previous reboot of the DOOM series (DOOM 2016). There are more things to manage, more gameplay opportunities and a significant increase of rewarding skill based gameplay. The game is definitely more overwhelming than the previous game, which can be considered a good or bad thing, depending on your engagement and the focus.

The length and pacing of the game is a little different from the previous game. While some people are arguing that a certain enemy type breaks the flow of the game and that there is an annoying slow goo, it's much better than the first. The game keeps you much more engaged until the end and progresses just fast enough to keep it interesting, but not so fast that it expects you to master skills within seconds (unless you run the game on Nightmare for the first time, which I do not recommend).

The music is a complete step up from the first game. It's a total shame it will be the last album from Mick Gordon and I am not sure if the game will ever be the same without him. Speaking of which, I was a little disappointed to find out they only had the soundtrack for Collector editions month after the fact, instead of with Digital Deluxe editions (which costed $40 for basically 3 skins that aren't in game, 1 that is available in game and a weapon sound pack on launch. Pretty meager if you ask me and I was almost certain they said the soundtrack was included, but I wasn't going to pay the $250 CAD for it, that's a little much for what you only really want is the game).

The optimisation of this game is stellar. Not once did I fall  under 144 FPS which is something you don't really say from triple A titles these days. I could even push over 300 FPS if I tweaked some settings. The graphics though, well, that's a different story. There are some textures that are clearly 10 years old and I am not joking when I say this. There are some textures that remind me of Fallout 3. There are also lots of mirrored textures which was done to save on download size for the game. Which is nice for people with slower internet, but I don't think it would be that much bigger for even 512x512 resolution textures in this area.

Well it seems you've made it this far and have been wondering ""well why is this a negative  review?"" It's simple. There are more gamebreaking bugs that have been adding into  the game recently than there had been on launch. There is a bug where if I press shift very quickly while mid air and switching weapons, the game crashes. This is unacceptable, because I was playing a master level which does not let you load from checkpoints. What's even worse is that I play on Nightmare, so master levels aren't exactly a walk through the park. Hell, I would even argue that a master level on ultra violence is close to being harder than most slayer gates on Nightmare. Regardless, this crash happened to me twice. I disabled the overlay effect in the options menu and tried  to replicate the bug, but it seemed to have been fine... until I crashed on the first level of the game on One Life Mode Nightmare. It's a shame, because this is one of my top games of all time.

There is now a new bug that I have been encountering where the sticky bomb mod for the shotgun would not properly damage enemies and the arachnotron turrets. This is very frustrating and I have lost many lives and lost many Ultra-Nightmare runs because of this.  

 Denuvo didn't really impact my performance, but that's probably because of my system. I can't really notice a difference of 320 ish FPS increased from 300 ish FPS when it was removed, especially when my monitor is only 144HZ. It's nice they removed it but it seems the cheaters are rampant in Battlemode so I won't be playing it soon™.

Please fix this bug, otherwise this is easily one of the most important games of the 8th console generation.",1594187062,1601744542,False,3,0,0.528842389583587646,8,True,False,False,76561198010938140,459,91,6721,740,6720,1601746455,,

*OLD REVIEW*
As much as I love this game I have to leave this review because as of right now I cannot play for more than 20 minutes without the game crashing. When the game first launch I was able to finish it in a few weekends and had an absolute blast the game feels amazing. Now a few months and updates later I can barely get the game to launch let alone play uninterrupted.  I have reinstalled my graphics drivers, validated the cache integrity, reinstalled the game, put antivirus software on silent mode while trying to play, lowering graphics settings which before weren't an issue. I have put in console commands to skip the opening movies but I still frequently get either freezing during loading, random ctd, or a black screen when attempting to load the main menu. I have not seen these issues addressed and will change my review if they go away but for now I can not recommend something that crashes more than a Bethesda title.

-EDIT I was rather doubtful of being able to find a fix listed in the articles commented as I'd been searching online for a couple of weeks without luck but I decided to try the one thing that I'd realized I'd ignored: Borderless windowed. This eliminated the need to skip the intro movies and I haven't had a crash  since I implemented this but the game does feel much more stable with this implemented. part of the reason I'd neglected this issue was that I thought I had already been running in that setting. For those having trouble getting to the main menu due to black screens try +com_skipIntroVideo 1 in the launch commands to skip the intro videos so you can access in game options to change over.",1601097420,1601602292,True,0,0,0.532922923564910889,2,True,False,False,76561198132024225,101,2,3226,427,3082,1601706106,1601597329.0,"Hello Blooddragon,

82,66272982,english,"Is Doom Eternal a good game? Definitely. Is it as good as 2016? fuck no.
Eternal expands in all the wrong directions with annoying puzzles, trash platforming segments, boring 3rd person cutscenes, long linear maps, a nonsensical plot and an awful change in tone from the pitch perfect 2016. 

-LOST IN DLC PLOT?
Doom Eternal begins with you having somehow escaped hell and flown a space castle to earth, with Vega now running on some space computer. How did this happen after the events of 2016? Don't know. I was half expecting some flashback levels but I guess its left to the story DLC to explain...

-THEY CLIMB NOW!
What new features did you think would be in doom Eternal? if you said hours of climbing up and down walls, well you are a fucking liar. The player must now perform circus tricks, jumping from wall to wall over spinning flames. However if you fail it just teleports you back to the start anyway. So not only is the entire platforming process immersion breaking and annoying, it is also pointless.

-TELL ME A STORY FLOATING KEYCARD!
Remember in 2016 when you ripped a guys arm off for his finger prints. These animations did a great job of both grounding the player in the world and showing your character's personality. In eternal these animations are replaced by giant glowing spinning pickup icons... making the whole thing feel cheap in comparison.

-PURPLE FLOORS OF GARBAGE
In place of any environmental story telling, Eternal fills its levels with annoying cut and paste environmental hazards. Pipes spit out fireballs for no reason, burning chains spin endlessly, and purple goo sticks the player to the floor. Removing all of these things would be an improvement.

-EXPOSITION OF AWFULNESS
The game is drowning in unnecessary lore and cringe third person cutscenes that make little sense unless you trawl through the codex pages. The dialogue is awful and often you will have little idea what anyone is talking about or why events are happening.
2016 minimized taking control away from player, yet was still able to tell a better written and more compelling story.

-PLAY THE WAY I TELL YOU
Environmental puzzles must be solved exactly how the designer intended, want to break a fragile chain? you can't just shoot it with a rocket... an elaborate series of switches and jumps must be performed before the player can punch it. Often these puzzles and their solutions make no intuitive sense, and add nothing to the game whatsoever. Many other changes to gameplay have been implemented to force the player to play a certain way. By far the stupidest of these was reducing the players melee damage to 0, meaning that you cannot melee stagger and glory kill zombies. Instead you must carefully shoot zombies an exact number of times to stagger but not kill them... what fun!

-TUTORIALS INCREASED BY 75%
Intrusive tutorials will now literally kidnap the player into another dimension, imprisoning them within a stupid metal cube. Inside the stupid cube players must press the correct sequence of buttons to be vomited back up into reality.

-AESTHETICAL DECLINE
While trying to invoke nostalgia the art style ends up being boring and uninspired, with many great designs from 2016 such as the possessed being replaced with generic glowing eyed zombies. Other redesigns such as the Revenant are pretty bad.
The old thematic minimal UI of 2016 is replaced by a bunch of ""very cool"" tacky buttons and icons, complete with key bindings over each icon in case you forget how to shoot. Actual useful information like when abilities come of cool down is lost amongst the mess, when a simple icon flash next to the crosshair would have sufficed.",1585675843,1601596875,False,14,3,0.43389090895652771,7,True,False,False,76561197963825946,427,6,2034,0,2034,1586007869,,

im just gonna list some pros cause i cant think of any cons
-it's insanely brutal
-it's fast paced
-even on the lowest graphics it looks good
-the designs of the demons look closer to the original designs in doom 1 and 2 than doom 2016
-theres a crap ton of glory kills,chainsaw kills,berserk kills and crucible kills that even when you get the same one 2 times it doesnt really matter
-the game makes you feel all powerful and that nothing can stop you
-the soundtrack is definetly one of the best ive ever heard
-the new weapon mods are really good (such as the sentry turret for the chaingun)
-the unmakyr is back 
-sadly the gauss cannon was removed but the ballista took its place and it has an awesome design, and 2 good mods
-the ending is badass
-the weapon designs are closer to the original ones than doom 2016 (the plasma rifle in doom 2016 looked nothing like the doom 1 plasma rifle)
-theres a lot of secrets and cool things to find in the doom fortress

After loads of updates and painful patches I can now review the game when its working at its finest.
This game is almost a far cry from doom 2016, as much as they are most related to one another they as much different from each other in feel and purposes.
While doom 2016 was an immersive, dreadful, clean and fine reimagining of a modern doom game that would make you head bang, comfortable and feel like an actual Doom slayer...
Doom Eternal is just an experimental, bright, rough and intense experience with a very light tone. Not like doom 2016 ever took itself overly serious but this might be the total opposite ""taking itself seriously"".

The game is grand looking but aint beautiful.
Engaging but not putting you in the slayes shoes. 
Full of lore but not believable.

To enjoy this game you must forget about its predecessor, and dont dare compare them while playing.
Tho textures are sharper, lightings are smoother, loading are faster...
Doom 2016 still surpasses Eternal by modeling, color scheme and texture verity, in my opinion also in art style.
Doom Eternal shines at its combat and intensity, its action and the reliance on your reaction, its progression and aggression.
Take a deep breath, think and execute everything you know at your own pace, at your own difficulty and get this adrenaline working.

That is all I can say about Doom Eternal single player.
6.95/10 the game misses in my opinion on atmosphere and feel but the combat and the game itself are well made.",1589574312,1601504738,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198185910227,36,28,6548,337,6409,1601988908,,

60,65425855,english,"[h1] DOOM Eternal is the best shooter of this decade I honestly doubt anything will come close to DOOM Eternal now. [/h1]
DOOM has always been special to me and the same goes for the millions of fans out there and I as a fan certainly wasn't disappointed in the slightest when I finally got to sit down and play the game I have been so hyped to play. DOOM Eternal is so much more than just a simple DOOM 2016 copy and contains much much more gameplay variety both in terms of how you manage ammo but also how you take down demons. DOOM Eternal is a very different game in some areas compared to 2016 but is that bad? Personally I don't really think so. It has plenty of new ideas thrown in there to make the game fresh but still keeps the fun combat that DOOM is known for. I can't wait for the expansion to come out but I will update my review once I have gotten the chance to play it. 

DOOM eternal gameplay: You will recognize the gameplay from older DOOM games as It's still the incredibly fast paced shooter we have all come to know and love. DOOM Eternal does however have a few differences in terms of how you do combat this time as Chainsaw = Ammo = Firelauncher = Armor and you can use grenades too like explosives and freeze grenades to stun some enemies making them easier to take down. You don't have a lot of ammo so the chainsaw suddenly become a bigger gameplay element and some like this idea and some don't but personally I really enjoy it as it gives the game an extra layer of strategy over DOOM 2016. Not only does DOOM Eternal feature new elements in combat. The more you play, The more new tactics you will learn and the more you will understand how the weapons work on different demons. DOOM is a lot about fast movement and knowing how to take down your enemies efficiently. This is why DOOM has such a big replay value as you feel you can always do better. I personally feel like the more time I spend playing DOOM Eternal the more I learn the flow of combat and it's a what makes me so dedicated to DOOM as it's all about mastery to me. My goal is to play on Ultra Nightmare and eventually with enough practice on nightmare I will get there. It's fun and I am having a great time blasting through the campaign and it never gets boring to me. 

Story: DOOM in my personal opinion has never really been about a deep or meaningful story and it's just kinda there to give you something outside of the already fast and so satisfying to play combat but there is a story in DOOM Eternal and it's okish. It's nothing extremely important to me and it never was in a DOOM game but it's there and it's fine. I know what I am here for when I buy a game like DOOM and it's not exactly a deep or crazy in depth story I buy a game like DOOM for anyway. It's the fast combat, Fun weapons and addicting non stop action there makes DOOM what it is. 

Soundtrack: DOOM Eternal's soundtrak is metal but what I like about DOOM Eternal's soundtrack is that it also puts modern elements like electronic/dubstep to the mix like DOOM 2016's soundtrack did. Personally I don't really mind this and it doesn't destroy the tone of what DOOM is in my opinion as it still keeps the heavy guitar sounds in there which to me is what DOOM has always been about when it comes to the soundtrack. The first DOOM's soundtrack was inspired by 90s Thrash Metal and artists like Alice In Chains, Pantera, Slayer, Judas Priest and Metallica which makes it a game unlike the rest in the series but I have to admit that DOOM 2016's soundtrack and Eternal's soundtrack is very unique in tone and sound too as modern elements to Metal isn't really a bad idea in my view. I don't really see much of a point arguing on whether or not one genre is better over the other as DOOM Eternal and 2016's soundtrack is more than enough proof that they can go hand in hand and provide an interesting and brutal sound each in their own way. 

So what is missing? 
DOOM Eternal is a fantastic game and absolutely is the best the series has ever been. DOOM 2016 revived the old school FPS formular once more and brought back DOOM into the modern day of gaming which i highly respect ID software for as the FPS scene of gaming was dominated by modern military shooters. I wanna make it clear that DOOM's singleplayer campaign is fantastic and I have spent almost all my hours ingame playing only the campaign but I feel it's missing the classic Deathmatch modes there made DOOM not only a fantastic singleplayer experience but also an awesome multiplayer shooter. There is a battlemode in the game too but I don't really feel that can compare to the classic Deathmatch DOOM is known for so I really hope they will add this someday during DOOM Eternal's lifespan.


Conclusion: DOOM Eternal has been praised for it's addicting combat, music and just how fun and over the top it is and DOOM will always be my favorite shooter ever made. DOOM Eternal was everything I as a fan could hope for and it seems to be the case with the rest of the fanbase. I don't actually think I have played a single bad DOOM game yet and that goes to show how ID software understands how to make shooters. Some things end but DOOM is Eternal my friend.

62,65452168,english,"This game is Doom 2016 but pretty much everything is better. From the feel of the guns to the new demons, to the new mechanics, it's all just better. Although there is one thing that I absolutely love. And that is the slayer gates. These things are super tough trials that you can find in most stages of the game, and they are the biggest power trip in the game. These trials will throw enemies from late game levels while you're at say level 5. You will have to use every single tool you have at your disposal to survive one of these things. You constantly have to monitor your health, ammo and armor while dodging attacks and considering what demon to go for with what weapon all at a moment's notice. These trials are tough but still don't feel unfair. When you die it's almost always your fault, and it doesn't feel as infuriating as dying by random chance. And that feeling that you were almost there but just didn't make it keeps you going. But when you finally beat a slayer gate, it feels so incredibly amazing that it's hard to describe. This, I think is Doom at it's best. They are balanced well enough that a competent player should be able to beat it in a few tries on normal or hard difficulty, but still feel that rush when you finally beat it. But the thing that really makes you feel powerful is that, despite the odds stacked against you, you are in control the entire time. With your mobility, you decide when and where the fight happens, (to an extent) and this I think, is what really makes Doom so much fun. Another thing that massively helps the experience is the amazing soundtrack. When your battling through hordes of demons while BFG Division is blasting in the background just makes you feel like a badass. Although one negative I have about the game is the marauder. The real issue I have with the enemy is not that he was a bad boss fight, (In fact it was a fantastic boss fight) or that he's a hard enemy, but that when he shows up as a regular enemy, you have to kill literally every other enemy so you can focus on this one enemy, which really breaks up the pace of the game. The real problem however, is that he is in control, which as you might have noticed is the complete opposite of what makes Doom fun, and that is my real problem with him. Although, he fortunately doesn't show up very much, so he's not that big of a negative. Finally I'd like to cover some of the criticism this game gets, one of which being the heavy restriction of ammo. In my opinion I think it achieves its goal of having people switch their weapons more, which I think makes the game more fun. For example, in Doom 2016, I found myself almost exclusively using the Super Shotgun, which, while fun to blast through hordes of demons without a care in the world, it became somewhat boring, because you had no incentive really to use any other weapon unless there were demons outside of it's effective range. (And this is Doom we're talking about, so not many) In Doom Eternal however, despite it having the meat hook which lets you get into a demon's face for massive damage, the ammo restriction discouraged only using the super shotgun, (among other things) which I think gives the game much more depth as you have to really think about what weapon you're using and if it's worth using all that ammo. This game is definitely worth getting for 60 moners and absolutely worth getting for 30 moners.

tl;dr: Slayer gates are awesome and are the high point of the game, marauder (as an enemy) bad because it makes you do the opposite of the slayer gates, the restriction of ammo gives the game more depth, and it's definitely worth 60 moners.",1584772785,1601448064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004962632,35,12,3542,6,3542,1601084791,,

67,76795988,english,"Lets get these two main issues out of the way very quickly.

First, there is only one water section that I never look forward to... In regards to gameplay negativity, that's about it.

Second, if you aren't running this game on modern hardware, expect Hell to be risen on your graphics cards. You need a pretty beefy GPU if you want to get good and consistent frame rates at simply 1080p resolution. I'm playing this on a 2080ti and even then when I touch the area where my graphics card is on my computer halfway through a level, it feels like a campfire so be cautious of that.

With that out of the way, THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!

You boot up the game for the first time and it immediately throws you in mayhem. You're already slaughtering demons all the way up until you beat the final boss (except during that water section) with little to no breaks in between.

This game is a roller coaster ride that even people who hate shooters will love. The pacing of the gameplay also never stops ramping up each level. You encounter new enemy types, you solve some cool puzzles, you steadily get new guns and fun weapon mods, and the lore is so interesting that it's one of the first games where I genuinely had interest in reading the codex forms (albeit, I still tend to prefer just audible voice acting for storytelling overall). You learn more about the Doom Slayer's origins and you expand on the his original crew, the stories of hell, and more.

And about the dialogue, it's bone chilling... Without spoiling anything, this game will creep you out with it's dialogue on death and torture.

And I'm gonna be real, in any shooter game, exploring always felt worthless. Until now, I never managed to find any game that felt worth while for looking around the environment and scavenging for more stuff. THIS GAME... it's always fun. The collectables for more content and weapon mods were wacky and some even led to more demon slaughtering opportunities.

And I'm not kidding... THE SLAYER GATES will tire you out. Every slayer gate completed lead me to shutting off the game and wanting to go for a walk with a water in hand. They made you exhausted but it was still always so fun to the point where even when I lost, I was eager to reboot the level and try again until I won. Let that be the prime example for how fast and fun this game is.

Just be cautious, it does noticeably have a larger learning curve than Doom 2016. Playing this game on higher difficulties will require A LOT of button memorization considering there are like 8 (technically 9) weapons, 20 suit techniques, a truck load of weapon mods and mastery mods, and you need to be really good at tracking the ammo you have in all weapons and the cooldowns on your equipment since one wrong decision will definitely cost you especially if you want to do an Nightmare run.

And the Battle Mode... It's pretty good. Although it isn't the first thing I'd prefer to jump into when I boot up the game, if you want a different experience, it doesn't disappoint. It's still super fast, it incentivizes fast-paced gameplay with knowing your mechanics and cooldown management, and if you have friends, it's a fun way to interact with others.

TO CONSOLE PLAYERS... Don't play this on console let alone use an Xbox controller on PC.

Please... just... just don't.

You lose a lot of options for button swapping making weapon swapping slower and clunkier, making turns in an environment this fast-paced just punishes you, and it's just overall a hindrance of what you can accomplish just with a standard keyboard and mouse on PC.

100/100. Buy it. Don't miss out. This better get Game of the Year. It deserves it.

PROS:
-Gameplay
You run, you dash, you jump, you slaughter, you punch, you RIP. AND. TEAR. Even on tiny baby difficulty, this game kept me on my toes and constantly going ""Oh SHIT!"" every other moment.

-Plot
Somehow they made Doomguy even better, with his lack of care or judgment towards others. Your job is his job - to kill. Nothing else. The maps can be hauntingly frightening and also absolutely stunning and gorgeous.

-The Meathook
YES.

-The Unmakyr
Y E S .

CONS:
-Ammo.
Especially if you compare it to D2016, it's borderline annoying how low your ammo is in Eternal. The low ammo will have you pulling out the chainsaw on any innocent zombies you see, but I couldn't help but feel that sometimes needing to chop down zombies for ammo would interrupt my flow of decimating Hell's creations.

-Crater-sized plot holes (that you possibly might need to pay for in the future if you want to know)
There is 0 connection between the ending of Doom 2016 and the entire game of Doom Eternal. It's definitely a sequel, but it refuses to acknowledge that.

-The UAC
The little hologram pops up and it gets very cliche very fast. And also very annoying. Stop talking to me, cyberlady. How do you even know I'm here killing demons? Aren't you supposed to be a pre-recorded message? I hate you, cyberlady.

I typed a whole entire spiel about how busted Battlemode is, but I'll just leave it as this: If you want to enjoy Multiplayer mode, play as a Demon.

To be honest, it's painful, and I lost interest real quick. I had expected a nice after work, low thinking gorefest but got drowned in the pointless mechanics.

Not joking, a *stupid* number of new mechanics. Some for combat, many not. There are several disparate skill trees that have painfully little impact. Numerous combat mechanics (off the top of my head): sixish new finishers, flame thrower thing, ice & standard grenades, two new melee types, all the weapon modes (and their upgrades); it just goes on and on. There's forced exploration and secret hunting for weapon and armor upgrades. Oh, and the frequent jump puzzle  ... because doom needed that, right? Complete with swinging from bars, wall climbing, and double jump resets; hello Mirrors Edge anyone?

Many of the mechanics are forced. For example, you have little ammo capacity and are forced to weave in slow finishing moves into combat (which can be minorly sped up in the skill tree), one to replenish ammo, another move to get health, and another for armor.  Feels like all the rejected mechanics for the previous games were green-lighted here. Again, for me, it takes away from the authentic Doom Experience and belittles it to a forced cadence of artistically expressed finishing moves.

This game is brutal; one of the most intense and overwhelming FPSes I've played... ever. If you are overwhelmed, don't be afraid to set it to an easier difficulty. Don't be afraid to set it on I'm Too Young To Die, if you must.

Doom 2016 was good, even if it did have a slight aftertaste of the devs still playing it safe and pulling their punches even as they were changing the FPS genre and Doom's public image forever. They were coming off of 8-10 years of building Doom in the wrong direction, so it's forgivable. Doom Eternal doesn't hold back from the start, and things get even more crazy going forward. Everything is bigger and more over the top than Doom 2016. Earth is a cataclysmic mess and it's pretty clear that the only person who is able to stand up and survive all this crap is the Doom Slayer. And, most importantly, we get to see Heaven, finally, and what exactly the demons are and why souls are made to suffer in Hell.

I can't recommend this game enough. The full price is very much worth it.

20,76730542,english,"First things first: It is a good game and worth its money.

I've only played the single player as the 2016 Multiplayer didn't really satisfied me and I wasnt yet in the mood to give Eternal's Multiplayer a try.

My (personal) trouble is: I've enjoyed Doom 2016 far more.

That may be partially due to the fact that Doom 2016 was completly different from shooters at that time, while Doom Eternal is now ""just another"" iteration of Doom 2016 (and that point doesn't really qualify as a con). But it also feels like the Devs fell into some ""more, bigger, better"" traps and lost some of the original spirit.

Encounter design ""felt"" better in 2016 than in Eternal.
For my personal taste, the Devs went a little bit too far with item scarcity in favor of farming with special abilities. In combination with the fact that many enemies almost require a specific weapon to avoid spending too much ammo, the micro management takes some of the enjoyable, instinct driven havok of the first game away - at least in my eyes.

Don't take this as a real con, but depending on your experience with it's predecessor, maybe dampen your expectations a bit.",1601324901,1601324901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047984840,49,5,2144,0,2144,1593260624,,

66,76681647,english,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

he age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.

The positives to this game are the visuals. The developers went with what the original doom enemies look like and enhanced them.
Now for the negatives.
- As others pointed out, this game is more of a platformer in that there is a lot of jumping involved. It almost seems like there is more jumping than killing in this game.
- The weapons: You are constantly running out of ammo, then to top that you will have to use certain weapons with certain enemies which is constant instead of certain weapons with for certain situations. NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS.
- I am okay with the junk zombie enemies constantly re-spawning in groups, this made it feel a little more like doom wen you can kill groups of zombies, but I REALLY HATED that the only way you could replenish is to have to kill an enemy in order to get health, armor, ammo, OH and in order to get that stuff it all depended if you set them on fire, froze them, or just blow them up with a grenade.
- The levels are linear. Yeah you end up back at a center room but once you completed a path, there is something that stops you from going back that way for most levels. Only level that came close to feeling like the originals was the Gore Nest level which was level 7 I believe.
- It is the same crap as Doom 2016, you enter a area or room and fight it out with a bunch of demons, after you kill them all you can move on. Nothing like the original where you had the excitement of unknowingly walking through a hallway and wondering if the wall next to you will just open up to have a bunch demons spill out onto you.

It became evident everything that made Doom 2016 a great game was back and had been turned up another level. 

The graphics, gameplay, music, story are all 10/10.

67,76573392,english,"One of the most addictive games i have ever played and never stops getting old and is far superior than DOOM 2016. If you hear criticisms like ""low ammo,too cartoony, can't be creative, muraders are bad, or too hard,"" they either haven't experimented with the sandbox or don't get the DOOM franchise at all. 
 
    Lower ammo capacity makes you more on your feet and keep an eye on your resources, doesn't make it bad.The DOOM games have always been about managing resources and DOOM 2016 failed at this, so this was them correcting this mistake and making it more viable to manage. DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO CONSERVE AMMO DO NOT DO THAT!! 

  The cartoony artsyle is a homage to the original DOOM games. They have always been cartoony, the whole plot in DOOM 2 was a revenge plot for a pet bunny for fuck sake.

   People think you can't be creative in the game because ""you have to shoot a grenade in the caco's mouth"" This is the worst option in the game since you have to wait for the animation and have to be precise with the shot. Doing weapon combo kills the caco's instantly but people only played the game once and complained about it without experimenting which is pathetic.
  
   The murauder is a really good enemy and have to learn his moveset. If you think ""oh I don't like getting good at killing an enemy"" then you are being really ignorant and not looking what the game is. Yes, the murauder pressures you in the arenas, so does all the other enemies, you just have to get gud bottom line. He is a joy to fight once you understand his moveset and role he places in the arenas
   
   This is a game you really have to see what the devs are trying to accomplish and not play the game once then complain it's bad. Don't believe the negative reviews with these kind of complaints, they have only played the game once and don't know what the franchise is about. I mostly blame DOOM 2016 for this since that game created a group of players that only stuck with one gun and why DOOM 2016 is really bad and horribly balanced on an objective level. This is the superior DOOM game and i would recommend anyone who is skeptical to pick this up. Don't be so harsh judging the game at first, trust me this game will kick your ass a lot at first, but once you understand what the game is trying to do you will love it.

70,76566042,english,"I will preface this review with these few statements: I haven't played the game since Empowered Demons was about to come out (Updating it today for the spooky event). I pre-purchased the game for both the hype but also DOOT skin. I have played Doom, Doom 2, and DOOM (2016), haven't played Doom 3, although the first two were more ports and eventually in Eternal. Haven't tried DOOM64 yet! Most of my content is on the single player portion but roughly 40 hours were spent in Battlemode.

""Rip and tear until it is done!"" The motto of this game,huh? Well, I like to think so! It feels more fast paced and fun than playing 2016 was, even with some oddities. So, how to really start? I'll start with the campaign for y'all.

Campaign~
The singleplayer campaign isn't hugely long, at least not for me. It was a nice good length, you can rip into demons and just enjoy the gameplay, its got lore and a plotline for those who really want it but it can be entirely skipped if you go by the cutscenes. The layouts aren't the most innovative but it doesn't need to be in my opinion, with the nice little parkour sections to just delight in, nothing really complex, just simple stuff for the most part. The puzzles aren't really that hard to get, it's more about the combat stuff, with plenty of different demons to crush and gut with your arsenal. I will warn new players ahead of time, the ammo economy is strange, you don't have a lot of ammo but you use a chainsaw on the fodder demons to refill your reserves. The grenades, flamebelch, and even the new form of melee (Blood Punch is the main one, chainsaw too for ammo, another weapon later on!) are all a bit different than I expected, not in a bad way, freezing enemies or burning them for armor is handy, chainsawing demons is also so stress relieving! The boss fights are interesting in my opinion, they sometimes are frustrating or even can be enemies you'll see again later! The combat can get hectic sometimes, at least on Nightmare it was for me, although muscle memory helped me until then so I built up new memory! As unprofessional as this review will be, here is all my opinions. 9/10 Campaign

Arcade Mode~
This is something I only played a little bit but I did find it fun, let me use stuff I normally might not get to! I will be including the cheats you can earn in the campaign in this category since it was a lot like it, same with Master Levels. So, the cheats are absolutely a treat worth replaying levels and looking for secrets more! The best cheat in my opinion is the QuakeCON audience! I like getting cheers while gunning down demons! The Master Levels are interesting, harder versions of the level you played before, I only had the Cultist Lab one for playing since I played it shortly after beating the game the first time, it was a fun mission to replay with everything from Prowlers to Cyberdemons now! Extra Singleplayer Content 10/10

Battlemode~
I didn't hate this mode, actually love the mode itself! It's not bad, just could use bug fixes from my memory, maybe more options to choose from. The mode is fairly simple, it's two player demons and their minions against the Doom Slayer player, demons win the round if they kill the slayer, slayer wins when having both demons dead at the same time. You can choose an upgrade each round, tie breaker lets you pick a powerful ability or upgrade. My gripe is that it could use more than JUST Battlemode, along with proper matchmaking by at least skill. 7/10 for Multiplayer Content, Battlemode is fun and interesting.

Cosmetics~
They look nice, fairly easy to get too. I personally like how it's all free with the battlepass it has, free content is always a blessing. Monthly cosmetics are good, snag ones from themes you like, they've ranged from meme-ish with the hipster to cool throwbacks like Hack To The Future stuff. 9/10 Cosmetics, just personal opinion on them.

Overall~

80,69204174,english,"It's great strictly gameplay wise. Doom 2016 meets a MOBA is the best way I can describe the new mechanics and systems. Sadly, the combat is the only part I can praise. Everything else feels against what Doom is about and is much closer to the original Darksiders. (Update: while reflecting on this the combat itself feels very Darksiders too because of the psuedo-moba elements. So essentially, think Darksiders 2 for combat, but environments are Darksiders 1, but it's an FPS.)

The story is ok I guess, not that it should be as up-front as it is. It ruins the pacing set by the combat and only feeds to a loud minority that care about lore in a Doom game. Plus there are already plenty of plot-holes between the Eternal and D16 alone.

Many environmental hazards just suck. They aren't fun and don't affect demons at all, so they can't be used strategically to help dispatch demons.

The boss fights are all really lame. Personally I would argue the only good one is the Khan Maykr fight, but even then a certain mechanic regarding the floor (despite the boss being a flying enemy) makes it hard to say that much.

The chainsaw rework is polarizing. I'll just say that any any points in favor of the change are easily disputable and it just comes down to whether or not you like reloading in a Doom game.


The Marauder ought to be given a further reach with his axe attacks. This way he'll be a much more aggressive enemy and the ""middle"" zone that you can retaliate is much more defined.
(update: he was actually changed in a patch to make him easier in some way. I'm not sure how they changed it, but my balancing idea is more applicable to how he was on release day)

Many of the demons made to look like Doom 2 demons look like trash. The Archviles are probably the best looking out of these, but somehow the classic sprite still looks better. This point comes down to opinion though, so take it as you will.

Battlemode got hacked to hell and back within days of release. An anticheat patch was released, but that causes some other issues, such as input delays in story mode, or the reportedly game just not working on Linux.

Those are all issues from my day 1 experience that I can just think of right now. I'll probably update this at some point with more actual gameplay issues.
Outside of gameplay, a recent patch added an aforementioned anticheat program to help Battlemode and an upcoming Dark Souls-essque invasion system. The issue is that the program requires Kernal level access to your computer, similarly to Valorant. This is terrible because this essentially means that to play you must allow full access of your PC to ID, which could be catastrophic if the system was cracked. (Update, this has been removed, but i'm leaving this section here because the fact that it was ever a problem is a problem.)

Update as of 5/19/20:
Also I just remembered that the enemy AI bugs for everyone at least once. No matter what, you will find at least one demon just standing around in a corner somewhere each playthrough. Pain elementals just don't work though because their projectiles, lost souls, are the most broken part of the game. In my entire playthrough, I don't think I got damaged by a lost soul once because they were too busy bouncing around like rubber balls.
After remembering this and thinking over my previous criticisms, I don't think this game is worth buying. Support the series emotionally to hell and back and hope the sequel is just like it if you prefer it to 2016, but there's no way to look at anything regarding this game and not feel duped for buying it.

Update as of 9/25/20:
It has been months since the game's release and not all of the Master Levels (more challenging versions of campaign levels) have been released. Besides that, a whole new DLC campaign was announced as well. While I can't yet talk about the gameplay for either, I find it extremely disheartening that the fans had to wait through two delays before the game's release and even the people that pre-ordered the game for $90 still don't have the full game. During all of this though, Battlemode has gotten several sets of unique cosmetic rewards for playing. I'm not sure why, but that just feels ass-backward to me.
In addition to this, patches are still being released to fix bugs in the storymode, despite the game's two delays suggesting there wouldn't be as many bugs as there were. I can't even give this game an ""A for effort"" anymore, unfortunately. Still as disappointed as day one and I hope that the next DooM game doesn't suffer from the same pitfalls that held back such amazing combat.",1589586497,1601063145,False,25,1,0.519813060760498047,2,True,False,False,76561198421570337,100,3,496,0,476,1591504492,1597182021.0,"Greetings,

Doom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence,a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable,it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.

The combat is faster,and even more brutal,with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old.It makes you use every single gun and master them,the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery,they are fun/beautifully designed,yet exceedingly challenging,every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).

Gordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal,this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline,some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday,but i think he did a better job in 2k16,it had much more ""unique"" tracks compared to Eternal.

[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]

This game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16.You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back,this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.

I can understand,and i agree,there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo,i personally don't mind this at all,and i love the glory kill animations,but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.

[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question,it's the answer  [/h1]

The DOOM reboot from 2016 got a sequel! Did it live up to it's expectations? In my opinion, yes and no. While the game is faster-paced, a lot of the arenas decreased in size, which actually ended up messing with the core mechanic of DOOM, running-gunning-and-looting.

The story gets you started, once again right away with the action. This time, they got rid of your pistol and just gave you the pump shotty. This was a good design choice, as I felt like the pistol in the previous game was kind of annoying to use and didn't serve any real purpose other that to be that gun that you use as a very last resort, but enough about that. The story is better than 2016 DOOM, with the Sentinels, the Doomguy origins, it's vastly more interesting than learning about the foundations of the UAC.

The gameplay is faster-paced thanks to Doomguy getting a dash ability. While this ability is great for getting across the arenas, it also makes you realize just how much they've cut down on your space to fight in some areas/arenas. While I believe this is fine for the secret encounters, for normal arenas this is unacceptable. The Mars base and even Hell in 2016 I felt had a lot of verticality to their arenas, where as even here with the dash upgrade i wasn't seeing much. There were jump pads but those often ended up screwing me over to find a demon on top waiting to punish me. The chainsaw actually ends up being really useful, as it has a charge that you can use on lower demons to farm ammo if you're having trouble finding some in the arena. The collectibles are really fun to find and the cheat codes are funny/insane to use.

Before I get to the art design, i'd like to touch briefly on the multiplayer. Firstly, it seems the promised mechanic of invading another players' story mode is still in the works, so it might get better. However, as it stands, the multiplayer is very barebones. Battlemode can be fun, but not for more than 3 matches in a row sadly. The mechanics and gameplay of it are interesting, but we lost DOOM 2016's PVP, and I feel that it's a huge step backwards and something they could've maybe looked into porting or revamping.

The art style is... different. The gritty and dark looking demons have been changed over to look more like their original DOOM counterparts. While I can't say i'm a fan of what they did to the Revenant, all the other demons (especially the Cacodemon) look better. The weapon redesigns are also very welcome.

12,76512199,english,"First, I would say if you liked DOOM 2016 for just the story then I liked this game's story for around 2 play throughs. Other than that I would not recommend this game for it's multiplayer or ""seasonal"" rewards. I would give this a sideways thumb just because it's not the greatest. The developers could have done so much better with the online also I have had problems with the punchable objects. I sometimes can't punch them (they don't activiate) or I can't climb on them until after multiple tries.
 
I liked the game at first. The ""seasons"", multiplayer, and parts of the campaign kinda made it boring after a while. First the ""seasons"" you level them up by playing the campaign, online, and doing weekly challenges (random stuff in campaign and online). The challenges are usually I thought 6 campaign and 2 online. Now it looks like 3 campaign 3 online. I would be fine with that if the online wasn't garbage. 

Online is 1 vs 2 either you suck at Slayer and get obliterated or you and your teammate demon are obliterated by an overpowered Slayer there are barely any even matches. Also with online if one person leaves the lobby the closes so if you are a high level, low levels tend to leave causing you to wait forever by a cycle of find lobby, lobby closes, back to main menu. I wish they kept the same online as the previous DOOM at least that one was fun to play. 

The campaign gets stale after running completely through it multiple times. I beat the game beginning to end around 4 times now. I made a new save after my game bugged and said I didn't do something. Now I just put a bunch of cheats on and blast through a mission to get the weekly challenges done in less than 30 minutes and it's boring as hell. I am tired of the same thing over and over again. There is a ""demon prison"" (small re-playable arena) in the game but I could never really use it because it fills after missions (I don't really know) but once I beat the game, I never get the chance to actually use it. 

Also you get a lot less experience for the season if you replay levels. I kept making new saves to level it up because you need or needed (I didn't really check this season) 100 of thousands of xp and you only get less than 10k per mission when you replay them. You mainly get xp in the campaign from the mission challenges which once you complete them you can no longer get xp from them. So the campaign is basically useless to replay for xp unless you do the weekly challenges.

Hopefully they add more stuff with the dlc besides campaign and maps for online. The game lost all of its ""wow"" for me. I feel like its more of a job then a game at this point. The main problem is the campaign is a series of arenas that have the same enemy spawn points every time and give little to no reward. I literally just run through with the BFG and kill everything in seconds and go to the next arena (with cheats on). 

I still play the game to complete the weekly challenges whenever they release a new ""season"" until I get it all. Also I will play through the dlc campaign.",1600999439,1600999712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972765678,268,6,5057,80,5009,1601731477,,

32,76488796,english,"Let me start by saying that I fucking love this game. It's one of the best brand-new FPS games in ages, it's one of my personal favorites, and it's a contender for my game of the year. Unfortunately for it, it won't actually WIN that spot, because I waited until this year to play Outer Wilds, one of the greatest games ever made and the most perfectly-designed videogame since Our Lord and Savior Portal. But were it not for that misfortune, Doom Eternal would be up there.

What I love about this game is what a lot of people kind of hate: It's incredibly tightly designed, with a lot of interlocking systems designed to make fights constantly intense, frantic, and brutal in a way that pushes the player towards maximal physical skill (in terms of reflex) and a massive amount of snap decision-making. It feels exhilarating and amazing and it's totally unlike any other FPS out there that I've played. It also feels like a logical progression of Doom 16's design choices, which moved away from the traditional gameplay loop and design of older Doom games and towards a new loop that emphasized keeping you in the fight longer. That loop means that fights have to carry a huge amount of load that they really didn't in old Doom games, which had as strong an emphasis on exploration and resource management as anything else. Doom Eternal's solution is to embed resource management into fights in a way that feels less tacked-on than Doom 16: Glory Kills were always an integral part of Doom 16's loop, but they technically weren't required, and the chainsaw was a definite afterthought for players because come on. Especially once everyone realized how broken Rich Get Richer was... 

Anyways, this makes fights more interesting and frantic by pushing a lot more cognitive load onto the player. And the whole game is more brutal due to the do-what-we-want-or-die design philosophy. And I think all of that works beautifully. However, not everyone wanted or expected that kind of design. Maybe they weren't clued in enough to realize just what a departure Doom 16 was, maybe they weren't paying attention when the team was talking about Doom Eternal pre-release (Hugo was very forthright and honest about what the game would be). Maybe they thought they'd like they'd like the new direction and didn't. The point is, I feel like a lot of the negative buzz about this game comes from people who were expecting something other than what they got. And honestly? that's okay. Not everyone has to like the new direction. It's a pretty radical shift if you're a shooter fan of any stripe, and if it's not to your taste, that's alright. I wouldn't say that the game is badly designed: it does exactly what it sets out to do. The question is whether you'll like it. I really really did, you might not.

I also really like the game aesthetically. Doom's gone full goofy comic book, with a bright, colorful design that makes everything pop a lot more than it did in Doom 16: The piss filter is 100% gone. A lot of the design is very early-2000s-console-gamey, and I mean that in the best kind of way: this game just wants you to be entertained, and it puts its all into that. It has this whole hub environment in the Fortress of Doom that's full of fun design, interactive elements, neat collectibles (including a set of the best music from most of id's older titles which you can freely play as you roam around), a ton of different references, callbacks, and gags, and a 486DX running The Ultimate Doom and Doom 2. It's not serious, it's a metal album come to life, and it's a celebration of Doom and of gaming in a general sense. Which just feels fitting: This is Doom, for crying out loud, a series that helped define modern gaming culture.

That doesn't mean the game is perfect, however. Doom 16 had a wonderfully self-aware, in-on-the-joke way of building its world. It knew we didn't care about any of this crap, and it never put the brakes on to try and make us care. Somewhere along the line, I think people on the team forgot about that. Eternal cares more about its story and spends more time on it than it should. And sometimes it works and the cutscenes are funny and enjoyable. Other times... erm, not so much. I wasn't really into hearing a bad monologue from a female scientist who sounds like she's about to orgasm over T H E  D O O M S L A Y E R ' S meaty demon-slaying... shotgun. Yes, that is what it sounds like, and if you didn't realize, congratulations, you can't unsee that image now. If I have to suffer, so do you. id, you make out the doomslayer as unironically awesome like that, because he's silly and stupid and inherently tongue-in-cheek. And I KNOW you know that, because you had him quote the Doom Comic in a slightly better cutscene (only slightly better). And Hugo, I know you like lore, but... time and place, man.

And that's really the issue with stacking this against Doom 16. Doom 16 is a perfectly crafted transitionary game. It doesn't have as clear a sense of identity mechanically as Doom Eternal, but it masks that through really good presentation. Doom Eternal has a much clearer design center, and in terms of gameplay I'd say it's straight-up superior. But a lot of what surrounds that gameplay is weaker than the framework of Doom 16.

For those of you vanilla Doom fans, who are against all of this, just... well, go buy Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 on Steam. Steam remains the best place to get these, because you get the original WADs, no pills. However, the Steam release now also comes with the new Doom releases, as it is elsewhere, and these provide a great way to jump into the wide world of Doom mods without the complexity of source ports (but get a source port eventually, so you can see the rest of the doom modding scene. It's beautiful).",1600966600,1600966600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198053889745,570,18,1838,0,1838,1600722166,,

Multiplayer is...Honestly Trash, One, Finding a Match takes Hours or even Days.

Two, When being the Slayer, you get screwed over by the Loot Block if you trying to chainsaw a Fodder Demon and making it not even worth the time playing as the Slayer. (Yes, i am a Experienced Player, I played the campiagn on UV then NM.)

Three, Cacodemons are a curse, Their so thicc and big they you can't even pass em'

Four, Pain Elemental Soul Sheild, is basically another curse, They handle all the Slayer's bullets. (If you know what i am saying :>) 

I hope Id Software (or Bethesda, which ever one that is doing changes to Multiplayer) can make some changes on the Pain Elemental Sould Sheild so that it doesn't handle all the bullets. I say about 100 bullets can hit through the Sheild that will be fine with me

This game is worth it for the single player alone. Games these days tend to come with a well thought out storyline as a way of keeping their users engaged, while providing context of the character(s) and their choices in game. Doom 2016 & Eternal are no different, and they do not disappoint.

ID mentioned they were building an entire universe for Doom, and that's exactly what they've done. The story picks up ~10years after the events of Doom 2016. The Slayer arrives to see Earth fighting a losing battle against the forces of Hell, and his journey to save them takes him across the universe, into Hell and 'Heaven'.

We learn a great deal more about the history of the Sentinels & Argent D'nur - and while this game answers a lot of the questions we had after Doom 2016, it has now left us with more questions!

------------------
POSITIVE ASPECTS -
------------------
- The graphics/sound remain incredible and true to Doom.

- The storyline is very in-depth and well planned out(see my lore guide).

- The monsters/weaponry have been improved (although they were already awesome in Doom 2016).

------------------
NEGATIVE ASPECT  -
------------------
Doom Eternal introduced wall climbing, as well as a few platforming options such as 'monkey' bars to swing off, and hovering platforms to jump across.

The wall climbing works, and they have been plausibly added to the landscape. However the monkey bars and hovering platforms are simply out of place and don't logically fit in.

I can't risk having Denuvo Anti-Cheat on my system, it's not worth it to have a big internal security system that can be exploited and my entire computer is at their will.

80,76440309,english,"You know what? I am incredibly disappointed in this game. I absolutely loved 2016 DOOM and I looked forward to this for a long time with eager anticipation. First of all the graphics are impressive. However I found the level design in the early stages to be poor with annoying tomb raider style climbing and leaping mechanics. Also, for some reason the combat seems much harder than 2016 DOOM. Despite always being on the move I found myself overwhelmed and constantly running out of ammo and having the damnedest time farming it through the special kills I needed to do. I found it aggravating. I think it introduced too many extra mechanics and buttons to be a proper fun Doom game. Also the story and lore is way too much. Keep it simple stupid. In theory I really want to play it to completion, but I dunno if I will.",1600884054,1600884054,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197965934002,194,84,165,1,165,1600883871,,
81,76439697,english,"As someone with a crippling fear of gore I bought this as a joke. Yeah playing this for the first 2 hours made me increasingly sick and nauseous but I'll be damned if I didn't say ripping and tearing demons was incredibly therapeutic. Graphically gore looks pretty damn nice especially when I realized the more chunks you can see blown off the demons actually displays their health. Doom Eternal is actually one of my first arena shooter type games. I learned quickly when it comes to movement Its highly imperative that I keep moving and understand the build up of the map to avoid completely surrounded and overwhelmed ([i]which admittedly still happens to me a lot[/i]). If you have heard literally anything about DOOM you know by now the sound design will not disappoint. Dynamic sound design makes for interesting high octane metal gracing the combat and beautifully collaborating and changing with each shot you take and weapon you choose to use. If DOOM ETERNAL's score doesn't get you hyped and moving you need to see a doctor. 

Overall I'd give doom a solid 9.5/10 my only issues being minor bugs I've encountered such as getting launched into the air by mancubus' (mancubi?) and some issues regarding the menus. Additionally I also dislike some of the areas between the high action arenas, sometimes I found it hard to navigate or figure out exactly what the game wanted to me do. Other times it seemed like the path between the arenas were dull and repetitive. I found they were always filled with the tentacle enemies which I didn't really find to be anything but an annoying appearance  I definitely recommend this if your a fan of literally any shooter, experienced tactical shooter vets who want a fun aim trainer, and even the single player steves and sallys out there that want games to play without worrying about other players and team balance.

This is my favourite first person shooter this generation hands down. It improves on everything Doom 2016 did and makes it 10x more intense. I love the movement in this game, once you activate the movement rune there is nothing stopping you! You can glide around the arena shredding demons! The double jump and dash work hand in hand with the meaty sounding weapons and the grappling hook of the super shotgun to give you the most satisfying way to kill anything in any first person shooter out there. I simply love the enemy variety and how you have to balance ammo and health while smashing some demon faces in. The glory kills are so well made and I like that it is based on the angle you come from. I see people complaining about the Marauder but he was only hard the first few times after which he was actually very easy. His holographic animal thing is quite annoying but it's a good thing it doesn't have much hp. The story is also very interesting and I recommend diving into the lore through the many youtube videos out there. 
The visuals are absolutely stunning and the sense of scale is conveyed very well, especially the Earth stages show the mass destruction caused by the demonic invasion. Last but definitely not least is Mick Gordon's masterpiece of a soundtrack. It is so visceral sounding going from some freaky ass humming to thumping guitars, truly masterclass work.
The multiplayer is not to great, I like playing as the Marauder but the servers are absolute trash. It feels horrible to play because it feels like I'm on 800 ping 75% of the time. 

The multiplayer is also forced on you by the weekly challenges which I do not like. They have a lot of work to do when it comes to the multiplayer.

Performance is top notch, with my GTX 1080 at Ultra Nightmare graphical settings I was getting above 80 fps pretty consistently. It very rarely dipped below 60 but that was only for a few seconds and from my knowledge happened only twice. (Once in a Nekravol arena and once in the final boss battle where I got surrounded and died.) 

I 100% recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade shooters and action games. It's a 10/10 hands down. I love this game, LOVE IT. I can't wait for the DLC expansions, until then I'm going back to hunt the collectibles and find the remaining Empyrean Keys.

EDIT: Done with all the collectibles, and have finished the Doom Hunter Level on Nightmare. Boy was that a sweaty experience! 3 tries to beat it though :P

For the Multiplayer i can't say that much being a Slayer for the first time is really challenging,but you'll get used to it. Being the demon is really fun you can become one of the annoying demons like the Archvile,and The Marauder.

So should i buy it? Yes,You should buy it but i do recommend buying it on sales.
So Overall Doom:Eternal is a good movement FPS game with great graphics that a mid-spec Setup can run.

21,76391013,english,love the idea of this game its so fun i love the idea of glory kills love the little secrets in the game its just an all out fun game highly reccomend it,1600798634,1600798634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198451294967,40,2,66,0,66,1600646649,,
22,68521075,english,"it‘s good, but i can‘t deny a slight disappointment.

doom eternal is good. very good. in fact, it’s one of the best shooters in recent years. but since the hype around it was massive, the game just can’t live up to the expectations.

technically, the game is almost flawless and runs super smooth and stable, even on older systems. i‘m running it on a system with a gtx 1060, an intel i7-7700 and 16 GB RAM on almost completely maxed out settings and not a single crash, stuttering or slowdown. Not that the grafics are extraordinarily detailed or demanding, but it looks definitely very good and is very well optimized on the technical side.

gameplaywise however, it‘s a little bit of a letdown. it’s basically unchanged from Doom 2016, which is a good thing, but some mechanics where shifted towards a little slower pace in my opinion. in doom 2016 you could just pick up ammo, health and armor and but here you mostly have to acquire it through either chainsawing, glory-killing or burning your enemies. the max ammo you can carry is rather limited, so if you just want to revel in the gunplay without carefully considering when you have to use your chainsaw, glory-kills and flame-thrower, you‘re gonna have a bad time. many people say, this makes the gameplay rather tactical, but i think, it just slows the game down and is downright tedious at times. the chainsaw for example doesn’t seem to work on bigger enemies, so if you run out of ammo while fighting a hell knight and there are no smaller demons left to kill for ammo, good luck.

doom eternal is supposed to make you feel powerful, but due to the almost constant shortage of ammo and a very limited arsenal the first couple of hours do almost the exact opposite. it really took a couple of hours to get into a rhythm of constantly changing between shooting, chainsaw- and glory killing, and using the flamethrower. after 6 or 7 hours, the game starts to be a bit more fun, but i am not lying when i say that i was rather unimpressed and slightly bored during the opening hours.

Then, there are all those platforming sections that really feel out of place. overall, the movement feels very smooth and responsive, but to die several times because you miss a jump is just annoying. In the first doom games it was technically impossible to jump, and now in Doom Eternal we have to dodge some rotating flaming bars and jump over bottomless pits like Super Mario.

another thing is all the story and lore-stuff. i am usually really into the stories of games. in doom 3 i read every pda and fully embraced the atmosphere. but in doom eternal the story just feels off and unnecessary. all the readable codex stuff indeed is a bit distracting and builds a sharp contrast to the constant over-the-top-action. it’s just weird to slay two dozens of demons, then stop dead in your tracks for a minute to read a codex entry you just picked up.

the music is another mixed bag. it’s basically the same as in doom 2016, which was not bad but i can’t help but feel that a straight thrash metal soundtrack without all that weird kinda dubstep-electronics-stuff mixed in would do wonders for the game.

Doom 2016 somehow slipped under the radar for me 4 years ago, but when i finally got to play that game, i was pretty surprised how good it was. And i‘d say, compared to Doom Eternal it’s still the better game. i even heard one of my favorite reviewers on youtube say, that doom eternal would revolutionize the genre again in ways the first doom, quake and half-life did. i wonder how much that guy was paid to say this, but it’s far from it, especially since doom eternal is so similar to Doom 2016 as Doom II was to Doom I.

In the end, I’ll have to be honest: I liked doom eternal but i had more fun with Doom 64 🤷🏼‍♂️

28,76372618,english,"With Doom Eternal, id Software made the bold choice of looking at their previous game and trying to do everything better, opting for a tighter focus on resource management in combat and an understanding of the enemy. The Slayer's arsenal functions less like John Wick's menagerie and more like Bob the Builder's belt, with each enemy type demanding a different tool for the job. Though this works to heighten the combat loop of the game, it functions as a dramatic tonal shift from the power fantasy of the 2016 remake, to now feeling like one man against a literal descent of demons. Whether this change strengthens or weakens the experience is ultimately down to the individual player. At a technical level though, everything here is superior to the 2016 remake, and it should not go unnoticed how consistently Mick Gordon has been killing it with these soundtracks. A masterful fps that is definitely not for everyone.

Another issue being a lack of ammo, which in of itself isnt a problem but the fact you cant kill enemy's with melee (untill you unlock a skill, which has a recharge time) can make some fights drag out longer than they would have im DOOM 2016.

Im a big fan of the colours, bright, glowing ammo pickups, health packs and more give the game a unique feel, along with the generally better gameplay mechanics, better story and of course, new soundtrack.

If you were looking for a sequel to Quake Arena, you're in luck.

If you were looking for a sequel to Doom (2016), this ain't it, chief.

If you buy it anyway, prepare to be *always*, *constantly* short on ammo. Because you literally can only carry 16 shells for the shotgun and 60 for the machine gun. The game only works if you play it the way they want you to play it, which is, glory kills. Over and over. Nothing but glory kills, There's no way to keep enough ammo or health without doing the same damn glory kills, over and over again. Just constantly jumping and dashing around, trying not to die until you can manage to get another glory kill and maybe a few shreds of health and ammo to keep going until the next glory kill.

It's also worth mentioning that even if I do get tired of D:E's gameplay, I can still play Doom I & II from within Eternal itself, which kind of blows my mind tbh. Looking forward to the DLC.

My biggest problem is lack of actual multiplayer, as I don't consider BattleMode anywhere near as exciting or competitive as traditional deathmatch or CTF. If BattleMode is all D:E will ever have to offer as far as multiplayer, then soon I will be pretty much done ripping and tearing.

Pros 
-Super brutal and satisfying combat.
-Unbelievable Soundtrack
-Mostly fun difficulty level (til the last 2 levels) 
-Lots of collectable stuff to find and extras and Easter eggs.
-Runs and is optimized pretty well. (I have GTx1080 and i7 6700k @4.49ghz)
Cons
-A few enemies ability sets make them a chore to fight and can feel grindy
-It's a very expensive game for the playtime.
-Honestly is just brutal mario with demons bc FML is there not a lot of platforming

Recommended if you love brutally difficult FPS games with s***loads of demons and don't mind the 11-20 hour playtime window.



Oh boy Doom Eternal, where do I start?

When first playing through about the first half of the game, it was everything I could have ever asked for.
Around the time I got the meat hook grappling thing I was a little bummed as I thought it was a suit upgraded but it's locked to the super shotgun. Still cool, but I would have loved grappling to any surface, (like I thought it was going to be.)

Overall most enemies are fun and pretty tough in certain groups. Some are pure cancer.

The first 75% of the game, this was my new favorite videogame. The last 15% or so it was grueling, brutal, and just irritating to the point of not being fun at all. The other 10% is just time waste-y platforming that loses it's luster quickly that is kind of sprinkled throughout.

I love hard games, but there are a few enemies in this game that straight up make me not have a good time.

It is fairly short for a AAA 60 dollar game.

I really only think it's worth that price if you are an absolute Doom NUT, like I am.
That being said, the game took me around 18 hours to finish on ultra violence on my first playthrough, which is very solid for an FPS but... still pricey.",1585285747,1600683893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198078300577,580,12,1277,0,1110,1586756230,,

Story: Not strong, but it's Doom. The goal isn't exactly a deep story, so it gets a pass. However, the story is more in depth than DOOM (2016). As a matter of fact, it added on to that story, and merged their arcs with the classic DOOM games. Very impressive. Not many series can pull that off.

Gameplay: Phenomenal. You still run fast, jump high, and juggle big guns and a chainsaw. But it addition, you can dash, and the Super Shotgun has a meat hook that will pull you towards enemies to SMACK THEM IN THE FACE...but with buckshot.

16,76292393,english,"At first I disliked DOOM Eternal. It felt like the game was trying to hold my hand by telling me the best way to defeat enemies. The level design was too linear, while the 60 FPS cut scenes felt overly smooth, taking away any cinematic quality. Also, I didn't feel that there were significant improvements from DOOM 2016 in regards to gameplay and story.

Well I'm certainly glad that I pushed through my initial impressions and gave DOOM Eternal a real shot, because this has been one of the most satisfying FPS experiences I've ever had. The story is decent, the graphics are fantastic, and the sound is excellent as well. But it's the gameplay mechanics that make DOOM Eternal so damn fun to play. Once you find the rhythm in how to use each weapon in any given circumstance, you will find yourself in Shooter heaven. The feeling of ""hand-holding"" that I had with all the pop-ups of how to fight certain demons turned from annoying to welcoming, as I wanted to become as an efficient DOOMSLAYER as I could. Each demon you fight (aside from the weaker ones) has there weakness to certain weapons, and their mods. You can upgrade those mods as you progress through the game, and as the game gets more challenging, you unlock more mods and skills.

While DOOM Eternal gives you many tools to kill demons like the badass DOOMSLAYER that you are, it is at the same more more unforgiving than helpful. You find yourself in situations where you die over and over again by hordes of demons who's main goal is to brutally end you. However, that is when DOOM Eternal is the most enjoyable.  Gamers like a challenge, and this game provides one of the most fun and rewarding challenges you'll have in a long time.

Creators of this game were lazy here and there.

Doom eternal is childlish.

The levels do not fit doom universe at all, and 3/4 of them are just bad levels even for a 1999 game. Rooms look like this: one texture, one pillar and few props, and mirrored two times and elongated. Graphics looks like copy paste work, done in a haste and without artistic vision or any illusion of ""realism"". Few levels are great.

In doom1993 enemy corpses remained on the ground forever, you could see the history of what happened, but in doom eternal as well as in doom2016 everything is cleaned up before you can even look back, again a downgrade in standards.

Every enemy encounter locks you in some space which is a downgrade, in doom1993 and doom2 everything was dynamic, enemies could wander around the map, game felt alive. 

Secrets are no longer secret, damn.

The story is beyond bad. They wanted to make a story but did not refer to the previous doom's story in ANY way, did not continue the cliff hanger, even though almost all the characters are straight from the previous game. And the levels of cringe are through the roof.

Gameplay is good but boring level design does not allow the gameplay to be excellent.

I hate frequent cutscenes or locked animations that bring nothing to the experience.

I think that doom 3 was a big budget game from Id with talent put in it. 

Rage 1 also had some  ambition in it, but Doom Eternal made terrible decisions in many departments making it a boring game. And I am most sorry to witness it.

Lockdown this year meant lines blurring between work and home and i needed some ME  time to decompress and i thought i would install some new games and get back into it . I have been buying , installing and not playing games from sometime now 

I have spent 34 hours to complete this thing and i absolutely loved every minute of it .
The spawing of demons gets repetative in a way but if you give a day or twos break , the fun is back in hacking and slashing as the maps are new and then there are secret items and things to discover

The accompanying story board and lore is detailed as fun entertaining to read as well 

Thanks to the dev for letting me relive a piece of my childhood again , hopefully this older me sticks to the habit this time around , its a great start for sure.

While it's hard to describe, the initial difficulty can be a bit off putting as well as the platforming sections. But after you add some upgrades, there's a zen-like appeal that you can wipe out a dozen demons in room with you barely taking a scratch.

Of course, it's by no means an easy game since enemies are relentless in this game and I've had my fair share of getting boxed in although the extra lives systems gives you nice safety net. The performance is great on my 1060 despite the fact that I disabled dynamic res scaling and had some options set to low but it runs buttery smooth. There are some frame drops when using the ice bomb and I had two crashes in the game's final boss.

It's a solid package for a campaign that'll last you 13-15 hours depending on how much you want to go secret hunting and if you're a Quake/Doom fan there's a lot of references you'll get. Music is top notch as well and there's never a dull moment in the game.

While it's a nitpick of mine, the tone of the game changes midway with less funny moments happening with it being more akin to 2016's story but it didn't detract from the experience. There are moments big and small which make this a damn fun roller coaster ride.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The plot is not not bad, but having plot in such a game does not add much to the overall impression, as the gameplay is a farmore important part.Speaking of which, it was good as earlier, so if you enjoyed the 2016 Doom, you will enjoy the sequel. What I find a bit misfitting is greater focus on acrobatics and several large parts dedicated to it and the need for constant abilities (grenades, chainsaw, sword, punch etc) use, so you need to keep focus on those.Music is great, but what else would you expect?All in all highly recommended a well-polished and fun game, BFG 8 (000) / 10 (000)",1600378235,1600378235,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197994323388,1330,28,1952,0,1952,1600376911,,

63,75227179,english,"I've played most of the DOOM games, and liked the 2016 version best.This one doesn't do it for me - it's basically just try to defeat onslaughts of demons, then walk a little, then rinse/repeat.There's not much of a story, no character development, no puzzles, etc - it's basically Serious Sam or The Killing Floor but with the DOOM aesthetic.Grind up demons to over-the-top metal music - fun in 30-60 minute increments, then - more of the same - yawn.EDIT:I've lowered the difficulty and it makes the game more playable (for me). My previous comments still stand - it's basically kill one horde after another.I wish Steam had more than just ""Yes"" and ""No"" for reviews - stars would help so I could give it mediocre rating.Also, I'm having tons of audio problems - I use a Bluetooth headset (Uproar) that works with every other game I've played. However, DOOM seems to have a lot of issues, particularly with Bluetooth headsets. In my case, the game can sometimes start without sound, or sometime the sounds quits mid-game. Either way, it's a nightmare to get it working again. I usually have to reboot to fix it. I've tried several of the 'fixes' online and none work. I guess if you want to play, you should simply not use Bluetooth...Ridiculous!EDIT:Ok, I've continued to play despite the audio problems (not resolved). Instead, I've used my wired headphones instead of Bluetooth and I don't get any audio issues at all. I still think this is ridiculous that this game causes these issues and they haven't been fixed by Bethesda.But, at least it's allowed me to play uninterrupted, and since lowering the difficulty, the game is better than I first suggested. Mind you, it's still basically killing horde after horde, but the environments get better as does the gameplay.I'm changing my rating to thumbs up, but just barely.

I highly recommend you play Doom 2016 before this one because both the story and gameplay are direct evolutions of it.

The Denuvo anti-cheat program seems to have been removed as the patch notes say and as of the posting date of this review that seems to remain true. It felt like a dirty, underhanded trick for Bathesda do add that software after the game came out and I stopped playing entirely for that time period.

41,76041534,english,"Generic Scifi Shooter™ 2020. That's the impression I had in my mind throughout the game. 

Sadly I didn't enjoy this as much as the other reviewers.  The entire game felt like someone had decided that the new Doom game should actually be more of Borderlands, more of Destiny and some sprinkles of other shooters, but less of the things that made Doom fun.  Like it or hate it, I believe this is the direction that Doom is now heading in,  it's trying to appeal to other players.  

There's now a central hub, and you're on a ship.  You can unlock different parts of the ship.  The entire ship felt entirely unnecessary and a waste of space.  It broke immersion and the sense of continuity of the story.  The bland, disembodied voice of a ship's computer accompanies you and tells you what to do.  At the end of every level, there are stats and rewards thrown at you, and every unlock, progress or reward is accompanied by beeping and booping to give you a sense of pride and accomplishment™. 


👎 There are a lot of [b]mechanics[/b].  There are [i]too[/i] many mechanics.  
The Doom execs decided that players like points.  So they added points to everything.  Weapon mods and runes and batteries and suit points and arsenal points and crystals and on and on and on, I can't even remember now.  It felt overwhelming and once again unnecessarily excessive. They also decided that players love achievements so part of weapon upgrades are hidden behind mini-achievement progress. 

As if that weren't enough, even the monsters have mechanics that affect your choice of weapons.   
Certain weapons with certain mods work better against certain monsters, you must remember those or risk wasting ammo.  

Ammo is now a scarce resource, and instead of being able to enjoy the mayhem of monster swarms, you are now managing ammo, switching weapons, and looking for the nearest fodder to chainsaw to get some ammob ack.  It's no longer that you can enjoy your favorite [i]kind[/i] of weapon, you must play in the way they want you to play. 

Among all the mechanics, the thing that spoiled it most of all was the commandeering of glory kills; where these were once satisfying ends to certain encounters, these have now become a means of replenishing health and a means of surviving.  

With so many 'burdens' to bear, the fights no longer became fun, they became a chore. 

👍👍👍 Despite all the above negativity, what kept me going was the [b]environments[/b].  I'm a fan of beautiful environments and artwork, and the game's mixture of Biblical, SciFi and Hellish themes I found captivating.  I definitely enjoyed exploring and platforming my way through these beautiful settings.  Strangely many people disliked the platforming aspects but they seemed well designed to me

😐 Some also-mentions; the music didn't feel anywhere near as powerful or impactful as Doom 2016, it was sort of there, but not really noticeable.  It felt like an afterthought.

And I experienced some crashes; annoyingly several of them occurred right at the final boss fight when trying to use the BFG (also a scarce ammo).


Overall, not recommended as it didn't feel enjoyable as a Doom game. The game was forgettable and I was eventually waiting for it to end.  

But seeing as I am in a minority, I'll add that if you're going to get this, get it on sale.",1600209478,1600209534,False,5,0,0.478559553623199463,0,True,False,False,76561197984170060,644,122,1285,0,1285,1600204557,,

When Doom Eternal FIRST came out it was amazing! Blood, Guts, Gore,.Guns,Great comical sayings in game,etc. I sadly never finished the campaign due to my Real Life. After a few weeks off the game i was ready to come back and start ""Ripping n Tearing"" once again...however this time not so good,you see Bethesda decided to add a ""3RD Party DRM"" to ""in their words ""Protect against pirate cracking the game"" However this is all fine n dandy. HOWEVER MY problem and others it seems as well is when THEY(Bethesda) puts the ""software"" aka ROOTKIT"" INTO your kernel. TLDR You have a high risk of losing all your data on YOUR computer(Having a IT degree in computers,networking n such and doing so for 18+ years). THIS is NOT ACCEPTABLE for ANY gaming company and UNTIL SUCH TIME I WILL NOT be playing DOOM Eternal, UNTIL the ""3rd Party DRM"" BS IS REMOVED %100 COMPLETELY from the game itself and patch out! AVOID THIS GAME and Go buy the reboot DOOM 2016....or any other game for that matter.",1589845550,1600197775,True,0,0,0.559064507484436035,0,True,False,False,76561198061040572,75,2,768,0,768,1587169037,1595950948.0,"Greetings,

59,76025844,english,"NOTE: This review is for single player only

This game is amazing. There are a large variety of weapons and abilities that can be used to craft a unique playstyle. Some of my favorite weapons are:
1. Super Shotgun: instantly DECIMATES lower-class demons and decently damages heavy demons. combining all that with a grappling hook that can set enemies on fire gives you a work of art.
2. Plasma Rifle: the base weapon isnt very exciting, but the weapon mods make it amazing for certain scenarios. For example, the Mircowave Beam is amazing for killing agile demons such as Whiplash, and although Heat Blast has horrible range, it can be useful if youre crowded in by fodder demons. 
3. Chain Gun: Similar to the Plasma rifle, but with different abilities, such as a turret, where the chaingun becomes 4 chainguns, but it overheats quickly. the second ability is a shield, which tempararily abosorbs damage. both are good in certain scenarios.

Overall, The game is rich with story and secrets, from the DOS pc in the Fortress of Doom, to finding Daisy around the game. Combat is perfected in every way, with even the first weapons getting some use later on. If you can master the flow of combat with quick reactions, you'll be blazing through the game in no time. And the atmosphere is beautiful. from the music impeccably crafted by Mick Gordon and Chad Mossholder, from the stunning views of Exultia and Taras Nabad, to the perfected hellscape of Nekravol, it is a masterpiece. My only gripe with it is that there are a handful of movement bugs that can cause people to literally fily.

64,76021082,english,"-This is the most visually striking FPS I've ever played.  The 2D art is phenomenal, too.  The scale of the environment is immense with many environments feeling daunting. 
-Enemy AI is really good most of the time.
-Exploration is generally rewarded
-Zero glitches or bugs found in about 9 hours of playtime.  (Good work Bethesda, et al.)

The minuses

Franchise has taken on the flavor of Super Mario Bros. - with demons!  There seems to be so much finicky (double) jumping and gymnastic pole swinging that it seriously detracts from the game.  For example, there are inexplicable wall cannons that shoot hazards you need to sprint through.  Just make a side-scroller if you want to subject players through perfectly timed jump sequences or hazard traps.  You have to magically climb/jump certain designated areas, but yet can't climb the simplest of environment structures. There is a ton of it in the game.  Also, invisible walls abound so prepared to be frustrated on a regular basis. 

My biggest gripe has to do with being forced to use particular weapons to specifically deal with different demon types.  In the midst of battle, you have to remember to switch to Weapon Z so you can switch to Weapon Z alternate mode B so that you can aim a shot to a designated weak point on location C of a particular type of demon.  You can no longer play how you want to play.  If you are a shotgun afficianado, tough sp!t because you are pretty much forced to use a different weapon at the drop of a hat.  Do you like a good machine gun-ish weapon?  You're up the creek because you have to press a different button (or combination) to deal with other regular run-of-the-mill demons.  In Doom 4 you were at least allowed to use the weapon you want even if it was inefficient.  With Eternal, if you're not using a grenade on thus and so, or lobbing this projectile on this other whatchamacalit, you'll have to dial down the game difficulty too much in order to succeed.

Demons are now immune to friendly fire from different demon subtypes.  They react to them, but no damage is done. (It used to be immensely satisfying in other Doom games to watch them get pissed off and fight one another.)

You are forced to use the chainsaw because resources are so scarce.  You must melee (with a demon!) to get magical armor to spill out of them even though they wear no armor themselves.  Brightly colored magical bits  spill out of them that your character automatically sucks up like a vacuum cleaner.  The chainsaw itself runs out of fuel itself very quickly for some inexplicable reason.

The Glory Kill aspect has gotten way out of hand.  You need to habitually stagger enemies on a regular basis so you can get health through your magic-glory-punch.  You can't perform the headshot you want to many times so that you can wound an enemy to the point of staggering.  They then blink like Christmas lights  (and then fast blink when they're close to being un-staggered) so you know when to run to them and perform a Glory/finishing move.  It ceases to be fun really quick.  I don't remember it being this intrusive in Doom 4.  What happened?

The lack of a quicksave still haunts the game.  Do you have a life, or limited time to play a game?  Doom Eternal doesn't give a soggy wet turd, because you will be replaying from a past checkpoint if you dare to leave the game.  

I was 20 years old when the original Doom hit the scene.  It changed the gaming landscape for me.  The franchise has morphed into a mandatory jump-y/swing-y/climb-y glory punching exercise that is more button/key-clicking than it should be.

13,75971724,english,"Honest talk, everything in this game is just perfect. The game has beautiful graphics, everything was looking so realistic, and it's what I love in games. Gameplay was interesting and fun. I had never played a game, that was this fast, But it made it FUN! 
The soundtrack is the best from any action fps game I've ever played, or any game ever I've played.
I didn't really understood the story, but I don't have any history with the earlier DOOM games but know a little or them. 
Shortly, you go around getting a revenge on some demons (I think responsible) and killing some smaller demons on your way. The killing is the best part, and it really made me feel strong, really. You have a lot of ways to kill the demons; Glory kill, shoot, punch, rip & tear...
All weapons are great, and some of them helps you keep the flow of the game. You also get the Super shotgun, and it has a hook pulling you towards the enemy.
There is also an online game mode, which is pretty fun too. two guys, play as demons, one as the slayer. but one negative thing is that when I tried it, I got into games with people much more experienced than me, making it quite a challenge, sometimes unfair.

I wasn't really interested but I went ahead and bought the game. I was not disappointed. From the start, the game throws you in without any tutorials and you begin your quest to kill all demons. There are some hints to show you some game mechanics but if you don't want help, you can easily turn them off in the menu. The music is amazing! I loved every single encounter I had because the music pumped me up to rip and tear everything in my path. You can't catch your breath for a sec without something spawning in or fighting in a mini arena. The story is a little weird to me but only because I haven't played the first Doom(2016). The controls are really good and I enjoyed dashing around and flying in the air. You really have to plan your moves carefully to get the most out of your weapons. There is a multiplayer which I have only played about 10 times. It's a lot to take in but having a friend who can dumb it down helps. It's basically a 2v1 match where the demons must kill the doom slayer while they spawn in demons for help. Over all I had lots of fun and played it again just to grab all the collectibles.

24,75957593,english,"TL;DR: DOOM Eternal is a great buy, whether you played DOOM 2016 or not. Treat yourself.

[h1] Graphics: 10 [/h1]

I run a high-end system, so I'm able to enjoy DOOM Eternal in all its graphical fidelity. Regardless of how good your system is,  the game looks terrific. Demons are universally gruesome in a good way and react satisfyingly when you glory kill them. The most impressive aspect of the graphics is the environments. Whether you're on Earth, the homeworld of the Sentinels, or the Doom Fortress, environments never cease to amaze in some way. Backgrounds are full of interesting things to look at, including remnants of battles between colossal titans or gorgeous architecture that's fallen into disrepair. Clipping and other graphical glitches are practically non-existent, and the FPS is butter-smooth. Did I mention the gore? If you have blood lust, this game will satisfy it.

[h1] Sound: 10 [/h1]

This game has perfect audio design. More metal is crammed into this game than DOOM 2016. Whether Mick Gordon composed it or not, it imitates his style well enough that most people won't tell the difference. Speaking of, he did compose some tracks in this game that are god-tier, and you may be able to point them out yourself without trying or being familiar with Mick's style. The music absolutely enhances the gameplay and it simply wouldn't be DOOM Eternal without it.

Every weapon has its own distinct sound that doesn't borrow from any other game, and I've taken to relying on the dash sound effect to keep my dash fully operational in the heat of battle (smart strategy FYI).

[h1] Control: 9 [/h1]

The game can be played with either a keyboard & mouse or a gamepad, though I prefer the former. It takes time to master the Doom Slayer's movements in order to best evade incoming fire and plan an attack route, which is a good thing. The game can become brutally difficult through no fault of the control scheme. You can re-bind keys if you have issues, though the default setup works for me. The only issues revolve around me hitting the wrong key for, say, the chainsaw (default key is C), in the heat of battle. I don't think that would happen if I played on a controller, but the speed at which the game moves with a mouse is simply irreplaceable.

The Doom Slayer is fast and fluid in his movements. Even the platforming is quick and enjoyable. It makes DOOM 2016 feel slow as shit.

[h1] Fun Factor & Longevity: 9.5 [/h1]

Believe me when I say you won't find a more enjoyable single-player FPS experience. DOOM Eternal blasts away the competition with its high-octane action that's smarter than it looks and pulse-pounding soundtrack. The Campaign consists of 30-40 hours of gameplay in one run. I wanted to experience it on harder difficulties after I was finished, and the game presents a few single-player modes for you to sink your teeth into. The Campaign can be played through Extra Life mode, which challenges you to finish the game without losing all your lives, and through Ultra Nightmare mode, which sets the difficulty to the highest setting and ends your Campaign-long run, with a marker to mark your progress, if you die. It's super intimidating for a newcomer, but after finishing the Campaign once, you might wanna give them a shot.

The multiplayer is okay, I guess. It's more thematic than it was in DOOM 2016 (and a bit better), but it's not a draw. More progression and better multiplayer would serve to beef it up. The single-player content is the reason to own this game.

[i] The Ancient Gods: Part One [/i] has yet to come out as of this writing. It'll be significant DLC for the Campaign, extending its lifespan. Apparently you don't even need DOOM Eternal to play it, but don't do that to yourself. Buy and play DOOM Eternal, then be psyched to play the DLC when it comes out October 20.

[h1] Respect for the player: 9 [/h1]

In a video game landscape in which video game publishers and some developers treat their consumer base like mentally challenged apes, DOOM Eternal doesn't. It gives you all the hand-holding you'll need and no more. More importantly, there are no microtransactions whatsoever in the game itself. There is, however, a Digital Deluxe Edition that's poor value, so just get the Standard edition and you'll be set.

[h1] Final Score: 9.5/10 [/h1]

I told you to get it already. Get it. Enjoy it. Rip & Tear.",1600089721,1600089721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066444762,94,4,9862,0,9862,1599511610,,

53,75931476,english,"While I recommend Doom Eternal, all I really want to say here is that the Marauder, an enemy that shows up 2/3 of the way through the campaign, is just cheap shit that tanks the flow of the game and comes close to ruining it.

Every other enemy in the game can be killed through overwhelming force.  Even though a few of the tougher ones have weak spots you are encouraged to attack, you can still lay into them with whatever gun you choose.  This comes at the cost of potentially using too much ammo, which is already scarce, and making things harder on yourself.

This doesn't apply to the Marauder though.  There is really only one way to kill him.  He has a shield that blocks all attacks (when you shoot his shield he spawns an attack dog that you also have to kill).  The only way to damage him is to wait until he drops his shield and comes rushing at you with his melee weapon, in this instance (literally a split-second window) you are now able to damage him.  Weapons that do the most instant damage are the only real options.  (BFG and Chainsaw don't work on him, only normal, non one-hit-kill weapons.  This just adds insult to injury.)  About 7 or 8 close range, direct hits with the super shotgun will put him down.  That's repeating the routine of waiting for him to even be able to take damage 7 or 8 times.  Not fun.

In the tutorial it mentions that in order for him to not shoot you (which does huge damage) or send out his dog (which happens from you shooting his shield) you need to maintain a relative distance to him.  This is fine for the first couple of times you face him, where he is basically considered a boss fight and only low-level enemies fight with him (a boon actually, since you can use them to regain your health), however, towards the later part of the game he is mixed in with other powerful enemies that don't allow you to simply focus on him.  This becomes extremely frustrating, as you're dying from him, his damn dog, or some other enemy behind you.

If you want to get gud here, then expect to be dying a lot and repeating these sequences often until you happen to get through it without really knowing what you did to succeed.",1600035868,1600035868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998283282,137,18,1237,4,1233,1601488331,,

Doom Eternal isn't really a shooter game at all.  FPS aspect of this game is merely incidental.  You're really In between the melee-fest are a lot of pseudo jumping puzzles that come far too frequently - many that border on completely monotonous and forced.  

Ammo drops have been purposely nerfed to the point where the only option you have is to sorta damage things until you can glory kill them.  This is the entire basis of the game design in Doom Eternal and it's really annoying.  The movement speed has been slowed to the point where you're completely dependent on character upgrades to get anywhere effectively. And yeah, all the jumping puzzles. Actually, this game feels exactly like God of War 3.  The lore, characters and wall climbing all scream GoW 3 - good for it's day, but most of these design choices Id lifted just feel out of place.  

While generally the game looks great and runs at very high FPS with little tweaking, the arenas area also very small and the area you're allowed to traverse at any time is quite limited.  Id has come up with a game design that I'm sure they think is clever and ""strategic"" but it's not - it's just annoying and boring.  Once you figure out all you have to do is glory kill literally every single enemy, there's not much to it and the holes in the rest of the game begin to show very quickly.

I want more doom but i do not want more of this doom. They focus on jumping puzzles and quick time shooting way too much. There is one boss fight that you cant get ammo unless u do headshots on fast moving targets while being shot at and it really just is annoying. On xbox I beat doom on nightmare but Eternal I had a hard time beating on normal as when it got hard it stopped being fun as the hard parts tended to be the jumping puzzles or the quick time events. And just so everyone knows there are demons in the game that can only be damaged during a very short window and although i can do it I tend to just avoid killing them until the end then spend 5 minutes waiting for the demon to be open and shooting it. it really really slows down the combat. There was a bunch of cool stuff and I am hopeful for the future of the franchise.

If you like jumping puzzles then you might not care about that but I feel like jumping puzzles are not what made doom fun. I play doom to kill demons and feel bad-ass not hop around on platforms and feel like an idiot when I fall off for the 50th time.

44,75858685,english,"I'm not a long-time Doom fan. When I played Doom 2016 though, I felt like a convert. It was fun, it was fast-paced, you had to be instinctively aggressive to get through. I only had to get through 3 levels before I decided to purchase this game. And when I finished Doom 2016, I installed this one and started...

The Slog. This game feels off-beat. It feels like a chore. In Doom 2016, I was the Doom Slayer. In Doom Eternal, I was the Doom Janitor. Hallway after hallway of similar battles, occasionally entering a room where some big-shot is there to lecture me on the plot. I was very quickly bored of this game.

The Disconnect. This game didn't feel like it followed Doom 2016 at all. Sure, there were references and characters reappeared, but it felt more like they rebooted it after the ending of Doom 2016. No references or apologies from Dr. Hayden for banishment. No explanation for the 'Fortress of Doom'. Or where Doom Guy was when the invasion started. Or really... anything.

The Story. There was one?! And there are multiple reasons for the surprise. First off, Doom Guy ignored the plot whenever it  dared show up in Doom 2016. In Doom Eternal he bows his head to the plot whenever it feels like monologuing at him (and us). Also, the story... doesn't explain anything consistently. Sometimes, it talks to the Doom Guy, assuming we all know what's going on. Sometimes, Doom Guy appears to not know something that it later says he should definitely know.

The Realization. I paid full price for this because Doom 2016 was awesome. This game did a good job telling me that good games only happen once per franchise, so I'll just play 2016 on repeat and forget I made the mistake of getting this.

The Lesson. If you liked Doom 2016, keep playing it. The only familiar things this game has is the visuals and the soundtrack.",1599927690,1599927690,False,5,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False,76561198023166530,680,19,589,0,589,1593897879,,

Because the game is functional, has good moments, and is generally a good game, compared to most other things out right now, I have to reccomend it.
Compared to the original Doom 2016, it is a major ****ing dissapointment though.
at the start of the game, it is entirely an ammo management game.. constantly running out of ammo. This is mitigated a little later on, with the chainsaw being available more often, and having to sink all points into carrying more ammo.
So often the pace is ruined by super tough enemies, which require special methods to kill, making half your arsenal useless. (The cacodemon early on, and the fckin annoying Marauder later on)
The arsenal is okay, but certainly missing some of the weapons from Doom2016. 

It seems like all new innovations on this sequal, were the wrong choices, compared to Doom2016.

Personally I enjoyed Doom Eternal's campaign allot. it's the smoothest and fastest game I've played in a while. Everything from the soundtrack to the movement makes you feel like a complete bad ass. 

The theme of Doom is there but the spirit isn't. It feels more like a hero shooter, as it forces you to use certain weapons at the right time. Doom's always been about: ""use whatever the hell you like to tear shit up"".  It does not make the game itself worst in anyway, but just Un-Doom like compared to 2016...

I also agree that the platforming is the worst part of the game. I feel like we never asked for it. When you don't have all the abilities it can get frustrating. In a game like Doom, platforming becomes a chore because it detaches you away from combat. 
 
To all the new anti-mainstream-gamers who are praising and defending this game to death on Youtube. You should play more popular old-school shooters (Doom, Quake, Dusk etc) to understand why people don't really appreciate this game.

86,75820852,english,"Following Doom 2016, Doom Eternal came with a wave of anticipation ahead of it's release. Unfortunately, I do feel as if the general consensus has been lukewarm towards the game, with some finding issue with the game's difficulty causing many to bounce off. I do actually get it. Though all enemies have an exploitable weakness or two, you will come across an enemy type during the second half of the game that requires a form of super shotgun ballet to defeat. 

I'll confess, I first completed this game on Xbox One when it was first released. Whilst I had such a blast with Doom 2016 and played through it multiple times on ever hardening difficulties. I found Doom Eternal extremely hard and had to drop the difficulty down to easy just to limp on through to credits. I did initially find the game to be a disappointment and kind of didn't want to talk about it after I finished it. 

But then I played it on PC with a mouse and keyboard. And the difference was night and day.

I feel stupid now for ever trying to play this game on a controller when it is so clearly a PC game through and through. On mouse and keyboard everything just clicks. For instance, unlock the heavy cannon scope and the rune that slows down time when you aim whilst falling through mid-air grants you these precious windows to line up your shot and your next plan of attack. The game basically gives you that 'discombobulate' moment, where you assess your surroundings, check which resources you need to replenish and which nasty you need to 'deal' with first. You constantly need to be refuelling your health, ammo and shields, it's the old Id mantra that has been at the heart of Quake 3, fight then recover.  

Not since Sekiro, has an action game actively pushed you to always be on the attack. Not since Sekiro has a game given me that sense of well earned elation for defeating those particular hard sticking points. By the end of the game, I practically look forward to the marauder encounters, as I had become more proficient at tackling them. It's the same feeling I have against some of the more memorable bosses in Dark Souls. A kind of respect and the anticipation of a good fight.   

The only place where the Doom Eternal falls down, is the story - which tries to explain the origins of the Doom Marine. After Doom 2016, which felt so refreshing in it's depiction of the main protagonist, it feels like a bit of a step backwards unfortunately.
  
Apart from that Doom Eternal is one of the best action games on the market. It's a more involved beast than it's predecessor, but it's a game I keep coming back to. Ramping up the difficulty. Ripping and Tearing. Can't wait for that DLC.

+Fast pace singleplayer Arena FPS

-Difficulity not balanced, often need to switch to serve that level
-Only one gamemode for multiplayer ""Battlemode""... which is 2 demons vs 1 slayer
-Specially late levels player very long due to though fights
-Forces you to do melee attacks to gain ammo specially on high diffulity

A let down from DOOM 2016 in my opinion.

7,75807287,english,"Doom Eternal is a game that demands your time and respect. For the first ~1/3 of the game, it was an exercise in frustration as I got my butt kicked over and over playing on the ultra-violence difficulty. I later dropped it down to hurt me plenty, even ""i'm too young to die"" at times. My suggestion would be to play at a higher difficulty to hone your skill, and drop it down as you need to, to get through the game. Make sure you are practicing using the full selection of skills and weapons, this game demands you utilize your entire arsenal to be an effective slayer. If you have a mouse with extra buttons, assign things to them like the chainsaw, grenade launcher, weapon mod switch, grenade type switch. Get used to the combat loop, and loop around the arenas, never stay still. Once you get good with the full arsenal, the game has an unmatched flow thats extremely satisfying, but it can be extremely difficult as well. Great reward awaits once you increase your skill though, and the skill ceiling is extremely high. I havent event touched the nightmare difficulty level, maybe someday. 
I went back to play doom 2016 after beating eternal, hadn't played it in like ~8 months. It feels so basic and slow compared to Eternal, I dont think I can enjoy it anymore like I  used to. Eternal has raised the bar.

Overall the game is fun and beautiful. The graphics are improved from 2016, it runs fully maxed out at ultra nightmare 1080p on my RX 5500XT 8GB, i5-3570/16GB DDR3, which is a modest spec sheet by todays standards. I cap the framerate to 72fps to keep it in freesync range, it sticks to 72fps 100% of the time, never stutters. Very well optimized, but it really needs 8GB VRAM to shine.

18,74983433,english,"Gameplay wise its better than Doom 2016 in every way and might even rival Doom 64 for the top Doom game of all time. Okay, Doom 64 really wasn't all that great.

I have a couple of issues with the game's lore. It really borrows a lot of terminology from Christianity, but then it b-lines into some alternative dimensional reality. It seems like the story was hesitant to call the Makyrs angels, but, of course because of their shape, white color, etc. It's pretty easy to tell these creatures are modeled after traditional ideas of angelic beings. To me this theme is quite generic and has been carried out in too many games. I liked it better when it was one man's quest to kill demons. The whole, heaven conspiring with hell against earth, or earth being caught between some war between heaven and hell theme is a bit overplayed. Of course, all of this is implicit as we're not told who created earth, the angelic beings are the creators of Urdak and use other dimensions or realms to their advantage. They are, in many ways, just as evil as the demons.There's also some weird force evolutionary story behind all it, again, it's just overplayed and seems like the writers took little in the way of risks. Like what if heaven were truly good and hell were truly evil? That would be a novel idea in a video game haha. Anyway, its the most story driven Doom yet and even with the generic elements to the story, the Slayer is an interesting character and the overall game benefits from the additional narrative. 

Finally, I love the fast paced action, resource planning, the use of the blood punch, and the glory kills system. All of these things work together to create a little strategy in combat, but not so much that its overdone. I am not a big fan of the gore, I know, you are playing one of the goriest games ever made, but for me it is truly the game play that really kept me coming back to this game. I wish there were more games like this that didn't necessarily have to be so blood soaked.

At first I thought, yeah, it was a great game but not a patch on Doom 2016. After smashing through the main campaign and dabbling in the battlemode I left it for awhile and forgot about it pretty much.

However, going back to it after a small system upgrade, it is just astonishing, really. The battlemode is infinitely better than the PvP system of the previous game, and the campaign has the same, if not more, longevity than the previous iteration.

Mick Gordon's soundtrack again adds so much more to the game, and proves that music in games is absolutely integral to the gamer experience. 

If the expansion content proves to be as good as the main game, I cannot wait for it to drop!

- The Hub world feels incredibly out of place and lazy, the game ends up feeling disjointed with so many distinct locations and hardly anything to glue them together smoothly.
- The weakpoints completely break the game for me, you are instantly punished for not using the weapons/weakpoint needed to take down some enemies. It makes the freedom of Doom 2016 basically disappear. 
- Why is there so much platforming all of a sudden? I understand a little bit for battles to add verticality, or having some for exploration; this game takes it to a new extreme though, it's excessive. 

While the game has a fantastic soundtrack and does feel amazing to play, these negatives ultimately turned me off and I never completed it. It just doesn't live up to the masterpiece that is Doom 2016, I've completed that game about three times and it's sad this game was such a big departure from that. Hopefully the third game will go back to Doom 2016's style.",1584742844,1599810940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198070468891,252,21,1073,0,381,1599810272,,

34,75779902,english,"this game is fantastic. one of my favorite games of all time.

DOOM eternal is soo much better than doom 2016 imo. in 2016 i had to pace myself HARD when trying to get through that game. sure it was fun but i got bored after like 1 mission. The game just felt so repetitive that i could only play through it one mission every day or 2 to finish it. this happened 2 years ago when i played it for the first time, and it happened to me again when i played it in january in preparation for this game. When i got eternal i couldn't stop playing until i beat it. I beat it in like 3 days as opposed to like 3 weeks with 2016 cause i never got bored. DOOM eternal also has the same number of levels as 2016, but the levels are longer. I even replayed it immediately after i beat it on nightmare difficulty cause i was loving my time with the game.

in 2016 all the weapons felt absolutely useless except for the super shotgun. that thing had like hundreds of bullets, you could shoot it twice before every reload, and it did insane damage. In eternal all the guns have a purpose because they toned down the max ammo of the weapons. Now most people didn't like this change and i'll admit i didn't like it either for the first couple hours, but it grew on me cause it forced me to think strategically and not just turn my brain off from extremely easy mindless combat.

DOOM eternal does have some things that i don't like but those are few and far between. I think there are too many buttons to keep track of. most of the time i would just forget entirely that grenades exist and never use them and i only started using some of the other stuff like flame belch around halfway through the game. I think the multiplayer is some of the worst multiplayer iv'e ever played, but the campaign is well worth it on it's own. I think the purple goo and the tentacles were an awful idea, and they shove the story down your throat too much, The marauder used to be a big issue i had with the game but as time went on he got easier, especially with the super shotgun-ballista combo.

Most of the problems everyone else has with this game i love. people hate the dash and the small amount of platforming they have to do. I absolutely LOVE the dash and i never found the platforming hard or a reason to dislike the game. Most of the people who say that probably just have never played platformers and/or are extremely bad at them. A lot of people don't like that the game feels more arcadey. So what if the graphics are a little more animated and brighter that doesn't detract anything from the game itself.

Now lets just hope this DLC will be just as good as the base game or better! But i'm sure it will be.",1599799955,1599799955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198965121903,127,5,2020,0,2020,1587920469,,

63,70179067,english,"Having played this game for 60 hours (at the moment), i can safely say that this game didn't disappoint me at all. In fact i think its a masterpiece and  a lot better or maybe i should say its an upgrade to Doom 4. Dont get me wrong  Doom 4 is an excellent game.
The graphics, soundtrack and level design is amazing. The plot is really great.

[h1] Extra life & Abillities [/h1]
I really love how they added extra options and useful abilities in this game that you have to unlock or it is given to you so that you get the most out of the game.The downside is that it isnt consistent with the previous Doom game and by that i mean the options and abilities in this game arent available in the previous one. Like for instance you can climb walls or slow down time briefly to make an accurate shot. 
Its not really a big deal but to me it feels like im playing a whole new separate Doom game instead of an continuation of Doom 4

Also feel like the developers nerfed the game a bit with the Extra Lives and Reinforced Sentinel Armor option. Again, not a big deal. There were some moments in Doom 4 where i couldnt progress in the game because of some annoying demons that i had to deal with and the only way to get passed them is to lower the difficulty. 
In this game you just waste a 1up and continue fighting with the same difficulty without having to redo the battle again. This kinda saves you some frustration.

[h1] Weakness & Customization  [/h1]
They added some new demons in the game to create some variety on the battlegrounds. What i really like is that they also added some weakness to each demon if you want to kill them efficiently. You dont necessarily have to use their weakness to defeat them. You can  also choose to attack some of them  head on.
If i could pick one demon that annoys the hell out of me, i would choose the Arch-vile. Seriously i cant get near him or he'll burn me. I cant attack him head on because of his flame wall and even if i hit him he''ll teleport somewhere else and continue with summoning demons. Sometimes an  BFG shot wont kill him even though hes not hiding behind his flame wall. Demons like the Arch-vile need precision and fast reflexes

I can clearly see the developers spent much time on it because not only did they try to make the game look gorgeous with stunning graphics but they even created an customize-able UI and you can even change how  your slayer or demon looks like

[h1] Battlemode [/h1]
In all honesty, i dont like this mode. The main reason why I dont like it is because the other day I witnessed on a stream where two players were playing as an Revenant and they easily won all rounds in less than 2 minutes.This was by the way not just in one game but in several games. Sounds really fun, right? 

[h1] Improvements [/h1]
Things that im missing in this Doom game:
- A Deathmatch next to Battlemode.
- Few missions where you  infiltrate or fight as a demon. So far there was just one moment in the game where i had to go as a Revenant. What was the point of introducing the ability to poses an demon if were not going to use it often in other missions?
- Seeing the resistance instead of hearing them in broadcast at the fortress. I know theyre not the main focus but it wouldnt hurt if they got some screen time and it would make it a bit convincing about humans trying to survive the demon invasion.
- An option to convert your points to other type of points. At moment if have a lot of Praetor suit points that I dont need anymore because I already unlocked all of the suit abilities.

There are a few missteps (most notably the purple sludge sections) but overall Eternal blows DOOM 2016 out of the water. With each gun being a tool with specific purpose, and like 4 cooldowns to track, it feels like a multiplayer hero shooter at 3x the speed. It's crazy intense, and when you finally master its gameplay loop, supremely rewarding. The graphics are downright gorgeous. Load times are almost instantaneous even without a SSD. The score by Mick Gordon has thrown off the semi-dubstep-metal leanings of DOOM 2016 and is now EVEN BETTER. The collectibles and secrets are well worth finding. The deep world building and lore from the previous game return, but the story is front and center this time (with a few surprises) and it does a stellar job at selling the Doomguy/player as the stuff of legends.

76,65392591,english,"EDIT 2: Denuvo has been removed after heavy backslash from the community. Empowered demons have theoretically finally been added, but I still haven't encountered a single one. 
We still don't have a proper multiplayer, and invasion mode still isn't in the game as promised. So I'm keeping my review negative.

EDIT: And now the final nail in the coffin. Update 1 forces you to install DENUVO ANTI-CHEAT SHITWARE EVEN IF YOU ONLY WISH TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER. YOU FUCKING SUCK, BETHESDA. I'M NOT INSTALLING THIS GAME UNTIL DENUVO IS REMOVED.

It's not bad, but falls short compared to DooM 2016.

REASONS FOR NEGATIVE REVIEW: 

-> Gimmicky multiplayer shit instead of some good old FPS arena like DooM 2016 had. What the hell, ID?

-> Difficulty is badly adjusted. Ultra-violence is too easy,. nightmare is too hard. Pathetic.

-> Marauder. It's simply not fun to engage, and goes against the core, intrinsic pacing of the game, forcing you to stand still and cheese/exploit him instead of the run n' gun that Doom is and always has been. That absolutely ruins ultra-nightmare runs and is detrimental to the experience in any other difficulty level.

- >Second chance rune and extra lives remain lost/wasted when loading past checkpoints (when I DID still have them, and UNUSED). That is stealing from the player, utterly idiotic and straight up pisses me off.

-> Where are those empowered demons and the invasion mode you showed us way back in 2018, ID Crapware? Oh, now it's coming ""at some point after release"". Well, maybe I shoulda paid ""at some point after playing"" too. Talk about overpromising and underdelivering.

-> Cutscenes, glory kills, dialogue don't get to the level of those in DooM 2016. You won't find anything like that glorious DooM 2016 intro here, those beautiful glory fills (almost every glory kill is stab-stab-stab with the wrist blade). You just had to give us more of the same, Id Shitware. And you even failed at that.

4,75716723,english,"Ok. to start off, this game is no joke, it is the best shooter i have ever played, so i tried to review it, as briefly as possible.

GAMEPLAY
This is the most fun you will ever have in a fps, no camping with sniper rifles, no holding position and waiting for the enemy, just sheer fast paced violence. As you progress trough the campaign, you get more and more abilities and upgrades, and by the end of the game, you will blast trough doom hunters without even noticing it. Also have to mention, the game is actually pretty hard until you get the hang of it, so i recommend to start on the ultra-violence difficulty and anything lower (of course, if you aren't used with the gameplay).

STORY
Ok, so the lore is really deep, but it is disposoable. That is why most of it can be found in the codex entries you collect trough the game. It's a choise id software had to make, because DOOM isn't really a strory driven experience. Again, if you want to, you can learn all sorts of stuff about the doomguy and the night sentinels etc.

SOUNDTRACK
I am a metalhead, if I might say, so there is no surprise I think this is excellent. Even if you don't like djent, and metal music in general, you will still appreciate the soundtrack, it just fits perfectly within the gameplay. Watch the documentaries on Mick Gordon's youtube channel, he provides a lot of info about the thing that went into the making of this masterpiece.

MULTIPLAYER
Haven't played, can't review :), but from what i've heard, it's great.

OVERALL
<<9.66/10>>
The game only has some little mistakes, for instance i missed a slayer gate in a hard level, so I wanted to re-play it with the in-game cheat codes (they count as collectables wich you can find) until i'd get to the slayer gate, and then disable them (slayer gates are disabled when using cheat codes), but i couldn't, meaning that i had to play the level again, up to the slayer gate, with no cheats, just to get that one thing (again, the level was pretty darn hard).

19,75700856,english,"Before I start with the review, it‘s good to know my accomplishments in the game and how I get to the game and information about this review.

I‘ve completed game on the Nightmare (Highest difficulty) and I‘m trying to complete Ultra-Nightmare (In Doom Community known as „The Path of Eternal Torment“)
I‘ve completed master levels (Extream versions of some levels) The Cultist Base and The Arc Complex on Nightmare.
Because DOOM is my most favourite franchise, I‘ve pre-ordered it for 60 euros.
This review is only my view on this game, I‘m not inspirated by any other review on DOOM Eternal.
In this review I‘ll compare DOOM and DOOM Eternal campaign. Also I‘ve tried to make it spoiler-friendly
With this in mind I‘ll start with my review.

Arcade / Serious
I always thought that DOOM is a serious franchise.  
DOOM (2016) was perfect in it's serious feel and althrought there weren't many enviroments, all of that enviroments seemed functional and realistic. When were you walking through the UAC buildings everything seemed to had purpuse. On the other hand, you could easily get killed, because you thought that this is a ledge, but it isn't.
DOOM Eternal has more of a Arcade game feeling, than the serious. It still look good and enviroment is still interesting to look at, but it has much less of details than in DOOM. Also some levels do not seem functional. For example, when I was at the Cultist Base level, I got into a room, where you had some square that was surrounded by abyss and you had to jump across some poles that were at the side of that room. At first I thought that it‘s great, I know exactly what to do. But when I get across I just thought: „Why would anyone build inside a building a square, dig up an abyss and put poles on the sides of that room?“ Also the game has in some cases very strange colors. For example, when you chainsaw an enemy, he drops all kinds of ammo, just like in DOOM. But now all of the ammo has different colors, so it looks like the enemy just vomited rainbow.

Story
The story is perfect in both DOOM and DOOM Eternal
In DOOM, story is telling about locations you are walking in, enemies, Doom Slayer, characters and interesting objects, also with some history of UAC and hell. The story can be learn from data logs, scattered around locations of campaign, so its only up to you, if you want to read it.
DOOM Eternal story is made the same way. There are still data logs (Now documents) and it‘s still only up to you, if you want to read it. But now, I think that DOOM Eternal is better with story. DOOM Eternal expands the story of UAC, enemies (In case of enemies, they have put additional information, on how to defeat them.

Music
Mick Gordon did wonderful music again. I won‘t talk about the problems Mick Gordon had with Bethesda. He still had his hands on that soundtrack (And his guitar). And his idea of metal choir was brilliant. Thats all I can say.

Gameplay

Weak points
DOOM Eternal enemies now have weak points. Very controversial function. But I was happy to see that in game. And even more happy that it‘s not necessary to dominate the game. In fact, weak points are important only at the beginning of the game. Then you can simply ignore it, because you will have weapons strong enough to be able to ignore it. Interesting is, that DOOM Eternal have given new meaning to weak points. Of course there are still headshots and new weak points that when shot will deal more damage. But more importantly, weak points are designated in two ways.
First one is specific weapons on specific enemies. This was seen in DOOM, but in DOOM Eternal it‘s much more important to use right weapons on enemies. Because if you don‘t you will lose LOTS of ammo.
Second one is weak points, that‘s good to shoot at. And not because it will do more damage. But because shooting at some weapons of enemies, will DESTROY them and you will disable certain attacks that the enemy had with that weapon.

Mobility
DOOM had one big problem. The Slayer was slow. In DOOM Eternal this problem is solved much better than just increasing movement speed. They add the dash ability. With increased movement speed, it would be too easy to dodge incoming attacks. But with dash you actualy have to click a button to dodge a attack. And believe it or not, that‘s a huge difference. Dash can be used in parkour, combat and travel. You will always use dash, because if in DOOM was rule, that standing still is death, then in DOOM Eternal moving without dash is death.

Enemies
There is one very popular rule in DOOM. If you see an enemy, shoot at it until it dies. But in DOOM Eternal, you must think how you want to kill the enemy. DOOM Eternal enemies are more complex than DOOM enemies. Some enemies have slight resistence against some weapons. For example the heavy demons (I prefer calling them mortaly challenged, than demons. It can be an offensive term) have slight resistance against plasma rifle and heavy assault rifle. The shield troopers that were so unpopular in DOOM are still present, but that shield has weekness. The plasma rifle does very big damage to those shields and if enough bullets have been shot, the shield will explode, killing trooper and damaging nearby enemies. Shooting with other basic weapons at those shields would be an unbelievable waste of ammo.

Parkour
In DOOM, there were some parkour and it was already a problem, because if you would fall into the void, it killed you instantly. Something that‘s extremely stressful on Ultra-Nightmare. DOOM Eternal has parkour that doesn‘t kill you, but it has maybe too much of it. Not for me, I consider it easy. In most cases. But I‘ve let my friend play DOOM Eternal and I saw, that he‘s bad in parkour. It soon became boring. He was failing to accomplish those parkours and I had to do that for him. If you are a person, that have problem with parkour, then it will be a big problem. The parkour is meant to cool you down from a arena you were figting in, but if you spend 10 minutes on one parkour, then it‘s very boring.

Difficulty
The difficulty is something interesting. It works the same as in DOOM. The higher difficulty the more things you‘ll have to do in a short time (This was probably designed by adding more damage to enemies and by making enemies more aggressive) In DOOM Eternal, many people are complaining, that even on I‘m too Young to Die (Easy difficulty), it‘s still very hard. But it‘s good, because in DOOM, there were still a small amount of things you had to care about. In DOOM Eternal, there is much more pressure on you, because you have much more functions, and every function has it‘s own button. To explain this little bit better, in DOOM, the only important buttons for me were: Movement (WSAD, Space), shoot (Left Mouse, Right Mouse), melee (F), weapons (1-8, G), and equipment (CTRL).
And now DOOM Eternal: Movement (WSAD, Space, Shift), shoot (Left Mouse, Right Mouse), melee (E), weapons (1-8), equipment (R, G, and some changing button I dont remember), and special equipment (V, T, C).
All of this equipment have to be used at right time and because some people simply are not fast enough to control all these functions, they fail even on Im too Young to Die.

Overall
Overall DOOM Eternal is a great game. While the game graphicly is not of a improve from DOOM. The gameplay of this game is truly a revolution. If you want to dominate the game, then you have to adapt your tactics to weapons and enemies of this game.

37,75679209,english,"Quantity over quality.

Doom Eternal is more. More demons, more demons, longer fights, and on paper that's great. In practice, it becomes a matter of learning to manage chaos. Keeping track of every demon quickly becomes impossible.

Eternal doesn't hold back. It feels like the kind of game that would be perfect to jump into a few days after finishing the original, because the difficulty jump is noticeable right from the start. Part of it is, as is the tradition, Doomguy has lost all his weapons and upgrades from the previous game. And that inflates the difficulty early on, particularly on Ultra-Violence, and it feels awful rough as a result. I died. A lot. And not to really tough enemies, but relatively basic ones.

As I upgraded, though, the game opened up. New tactics and means of survival became available. And once that happened, the game became fun again. Doom Eternal needed to start you off stronger and have the upgrades be more gradual, or at least deliver them faster. Once you get the hang of everything, it's a blast to fly around the map, picking off demons and delivering killing blows while never remaining too far from death.

But there's some issues. Additions of ""weak points"" and more subtle weaknesses of certain demons remove some of the violent, creative problem solving from the 2016 Doom. If you're not hitting Cacodemons with a shotgun grenade, you are generally Doing It Wrong, which is a disappointment. Conversely, the ability to shear certain demons' weapons off is a useful tactic, but it's usually not as effective as just... killing them. 

Though the challenges return from 2016 Doom, they vary in quality. Some of them just a nice encouragement to master a certain skill, but some are the tiresome ""execute this demon in one specific way"". The worst are a particular shielded type of demon you have to fight in one specific way. Or you're Doing It Wrong, and you're dead. Similarly, bosses often require a specific target or weapon, or you're... Doing It Wrong. I just wanna shoot a thing with a cool gun, not get quizzed on the dev's ideal way to dissemble a Mancubus!

It also goes on [i]long[/i], definitely longer than it needed to. At certain points I just felt exhausted with the gameplay because it was the same loop over and over, often with little pacing or breathers inbetween. I ended up welcoming lore and dialogue just to break things up. Still, it's definitely a challenge, and once your kit is filled out, utterly satisfying to punish demons.

This features a lot more platforming, and while most of it isn't too hard, it involves more blind jumps and pattern recognition than I'd like. It feels like we just needed enjoy to make sure we understood the new platforming elements for actual fights, but there are timed areas, chained jumps, and just a lot of leaping around to do that largely feels put in there because they added the platforming elements than it being that exciting on its own. In addition, there are the aforementioned ""blind jumps"" from time to time, where you can't recognize your destination or next step until you're already into the process of defying lava.

With all my complaints, it may be surprising for me to give it a thumbs up. And that's because the core gameplay from Doom 2016 is still there, in the end. It involves a much more defensive approach to combat, moving and picking your fights and often punishing the more aggressive gameplay of its predecessor. But I did appreciate that it was willing to be unbashedly a [i]video-game[/i], harkening back to elements like extra lives, more power-ups, and gimmicky stages.

But it's also more unfocused as a result. Doom 2016 was a stronger game, but Doom Eternal is still good. It just keeps trying to be things that it's not.

41,66468497,english,"After putting roughly 160 hours into this game, there a few things I can say in regards to it.

Translating the classic Arena Shooter has been a difficult task for most AAA devs over the past few years, where many of the original shooters have seemingly deviated off their original roots by adding things such as regenerating health and a multiplayer with loadouts, DOOM Eternal breathes a new life into the arena shooter genre by adding a host of new mechanics and movement abilities that call back to the roots of Arena FPS games while keeping things fresh and exciting.

Movement is absolutely phenomenal, and weapons such as the Meathook can send you soaring at speeds unrivaled in most modern FPS. 

Combat is fluid and exciting, and far more interesting opposed to DOOM 2016. Weapons are varied, monsters require forethought instead of a constant drip feed of one weapon. It allows your earlier arsenal to still remain relevant as you progress through the game.

The sound design is fantastic, and weapons have a metallic clank to them that makes them feel less like cannons and more like metallic death machines. Enemies explode into gory chunks that splatter and slosh around as they collapse into gory pinatas. I also don't need to sing Mick Gordon's fantastic work on the soundtrack; it's universally known that DOOM Eternal's soundtrack is one of the greatest Video Game Soundtracks of all time.

The story is nothing to write home about...but there's clearly an attention to detail and love for the universe that was seemingly lacking from the series third entry.

The multiplayer is a mixed bag, though the devs are constantly adding and updating things to balance it out, and all upcoming content has been confirmed to be free.

I have over 100 hours in Doom 2016, and this is just as good, though it's definitely not the same. I actually really appreciate the changes they made though. If you want Doom 2016, go play Doom 2016. It's still an absolutely incredible game, one of the best of it's generation, and it's not going anywhere. Doom Eternal is not trying to be Doom 2016.

52,65584236,english,"If you want a game where you can just turn off your brain, use 1-2 guns. and coast through the campaign, Doom Eternal is not the game for you.

Doom Eternal demands that you use your brain in combat. This isn't Doom 2016 where the Super Shotgun and Gauss Cannon are all you need. You will need to use every tool in your arsenal to succeed, especially at higher difficulties. 

Weapon switching is absolutely critical. Different weapons are more effective at taking down certain demons, as certain demons have weak points that can be exploited. The plasma rifle is excellent against energy shields, while the scoped version of the Heavy Assault Rifle can shoot off a Mancubus's or Revanant's cannons. 

Another thing you'll notice is that pickups are scarce. But, they're really not. The demons ARE the pickups. You want some armor? Light some demons on fire and kill them. They'll drop it. You want health? Glory kill some demons, or upgrade your ice bomb and blood punch, so that demons will drop health when killed by these abilities. You need some ammo? Use your chainsaw. Unlike 2016, fuel will recharge when you run empty. These complaints of people ""running out of ammo too quickly"" are the complaints of people who refuse to adapt to this game's mechanics. If you prance around using one weapon, you'll run out of ammo for that gun quickly. If you don't utilize fodder demons for resources, you will die.

Having so many abilities can feel overwhelming at first, but once you keep playing, it'll all come together, and when it does, it feels REALLY GOOD. The combat, which is the core of this game, excels in every department.

There's a bit more story in the form of cutscenes, but if this doesn't interest you, you can skip the cinematics. The story can be expanded upon by reading the codex entries you pick up throughout the levels you play. The story wasn't a piece of art, and it wasn't bad. Like 2016, the story just serves to push you into more demons, but this time around, there's a bit more lore for those who are interested.

If you're buying this game, and you've played Doom 2016, don't play it like you played Doom 2016. Once you start learning the mechanics, you're going to have a blast playing this game.

More of everything apparently, because that's what DooM Eternal is: everything that made 2016 such a good experience but cranked up to 11. The combat and gunplay cycle is quite a lot less forgiving, which takes some getting used to but that makes it quite a lot more satisfying when you manage to take down armies of the damned by yourself. There is a bit more of a balancing act here, I found myself needing to balance my weapon use to get certain resources (armor, health, ammo). I personally enjoyed that part, ymmv though. The music is also even more dirty, aggressive. Hellish. Mick Gordon really did well with 2016's OST, but Eternal's knocked it outta the park. Really is a shame the OST can't be bought anywhere, I'd give quite a lot to see that happen. The demons are fantastic as well. Classics like the Pinkies and Revenants are still here, while others like the Archvile return just to make life more difficult. Not only are there more demons, there are even more ways to kill them.

The RIP AND TEAR meme is basically a mood the player gets into when you're in a terrific combat flow juggling through weapons, acrobat-ing through an arena, and scoring powerups/resupply. Anything that breaks from this can slow down the energy.

Overall, I really enjoy this game and of my FPS this is the one I continue coming back to. Nothing quite feels as awesome as when you're playing this; you're unstoppable. You feel like a god. If you go back to any other FPS, it will feel sluggish and outdated. 

The platforming was not as bad as I imagined. My only true dislike is the extra lives system (which really come in handy later in the game so you don't get slowed down with death) that you often receive before a difficult arena but you do not get input on whether they should be used or not. Extra lives are automatically used. I wish I would get a prompt asking me if I want to use one. My first play through and every arena wiped the floor with me. Often there is a strategy to learn or mistakes to be avoided. 

The hardest demon is the archvile, use the crucible on them already and get it over with. The marauders are annoying at first but you develop proficiency over time. Don't worry about making mistakes or  developing your own system of fighting--it will come over time and the game will help you to make the best choices. 

My only other big suggestion is that you look online for the appropriate mods for each gun. The best mods are not the same as D2016. Sticky bombs on the shotgun is amazing.

53,75587711,english,"ID Software manage to revive this old franchise starting from DOOM 2016 that introduced many things and improvement especially to the combat system. This time they crank it up all the way to the highest level they can possibly imagine and do. What I love about DOOM Eternal is they try to position themselves as a unique breed of FPS in the age of generic fps that rely heavily on stealth, battle royale and etc, DOOM Eternal encourage you as the DOOM Slayer to aggressively engage with demons to better control the fight. You have many tools and weapons to slice and dice the demons. There are some game mechanic such as chainsaw for ammo, glory kill for health and flame belch for armor. These 3 mechanics is very important to better fight and survive hordes of demon especially in higher difficulty. On top of that, DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal is very rich in lore and storytelling about the Slayer himself. Throughout the game, you will found codex entry that explain events and answer some questions from the previous game. It is very interesting to say that the lore present itself kinda like ancient history but feel like comic book which is really great and I love that. But, if you don't care about that it's okay too. As the game progress, you will empowering yourself and master the combat system to become the ultimate killing machine against the Hell forces. The feel of fighting Marauder is so frustrating at first time, but beating Marauder at high difficulty (I played on Ultra-violence and Nightmare) is so good. I don't care much when it comes to people complain about Marauder because some of them keep mindless shooting attitude without changing to new tactics and other weapon. Instead, they just use super shotgun which is totally lazy. Nevertheless, this a great game and masterpiece of FPS in many years. I do hope that DOOM Eternal will be crown as the GOTY because the game is really great and interesting. Besides campaign, I can't really say anything about Battlemode. because I haven't play yet. But, new update improves the game in lot of ways, some in campaign and Battlemode. The new upcoming Ancient Gods DLC P1 is very promising as the campaign expansion that will take place after the event of main campaign. Maybe some new Master Levels will come out sometime after the DLC that gear towards experience player. Also, I'm looking forward to the Invasion mode that ID Software teased us back at Quake Con 2019 where the player can invade other player campaign as a demon. As we all know, the mode got delayed because the world turn upside down this year and many of us need to work from home. Same thing goes for the developer as well.

58,75580848,english,"When I first heard of this game, I was hyped. DOOM 2016 for me was and still is one of the greatest shooters and video games I have ever played, and having played through Eternal probably a dozen or so times now, I can safely say it surpasses its predecessor and then some. 

The game plays differently from 2016 in that you are forced to be thinking constantly, managing your resources, burning enemies for more armour, chainsawing for ammo, and glory killing for health. You need to be constantly switching weapons to counter the different demons and the threats they pose. It's a fast-paced, metal as fuck chess game that will make you feel like a god each time you conquer an arena and really put Austin Power's hair on your chest.

Their definitely is a learning curve with this game; the new mechanics like managing resources and taking them from your foes can take time to get used to, as well as the speed of the combat. Once you master it, you truly enter the ""fun zone.""

In terms of art style, Eternal has abandoned the dark, gritty look of 2016 in favour of a bright, colourful, arcade-like aesthetic. I like the style a lot myself, as it gives off this badass, comicbook appeal, further reinforced by the over-the-top nature of the gameplay and the story.

Some people have complained about the over-abundance of platforming in the game, as their is quite a lot of it. Personally, I find the platforming to be very enjoyable, as you get a moment of levity between the relentless battles as you traverse these massive, gorgeous looking, unigue environments. No two levels look the same, which really adds to the replay value. Further adding is the abundance of secrets and collectables hidden throughout. You can find collectable figures of all the demons, which can be viewed in the Slayer's man cave. You can also find tokens to upgrade your suit, further bolstering your power and abilities.

Story-wise, the game picks up some time after 2016, though it is never explicitly stated when this is. It throws you right into the action, and leaves you the task of understanding whats going on by finding the lore pages and delving into them. I quite enjoy this system, as it lets you have fun and get right back to killing demons, without having to sit through lengthy cutscenes expositing all the info. The game leaves you to fill in the details, and even without the lore pages, you still get a grasp of the basic driving force behind what it is your doing and why your doing it. You are never left completely in the dark, and given just enough information to make you want to take a break and learn more about the characters and the universe your in. All the cutscenes too can be skipped thankfully, which I often find myself doing on repeat playthroughs.

The music was once again done by Australian composer Mick Gordon, and he did not let down, delivering a soundtrack that perfectly captures the speed and tone of the game. Filled to the brim with tons of new and amazing heavy metal tunes, as well as several renditions of classic DOOM tracks. This soundtrack is a blast to headbang to.

As for the multiplayer, id Software developed BATTLEMODE, where three people get into two teams; one is a single, fully loaded DOOM Slayer, and the other two play as demons of their own choosing. Currently, their are five demons playable: Revenant, Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, and the Archvile. The first team to win three rounds wins. Personally, I really enjoy this mode, as both the demons and the Slayer. That said, the matchmaking isn't the best, and often pairs you with either players with too little experience, or too much. Plus the Bethesda server is pretty shitty, and won't let me join matches more often than I'd like, despite my fast internet. Regardless, it's still a fun and enjoyable experience, once you get over the learning curve.

All in all, I can't praise this game enough. For me, it truly deserves its title as the Terminator 2 of video games, as it took all the stuff that made DOOM 2016 a glorious bloodbath and made it faster, more stimulating, and fun. If your a fan of classic FPS titles, or just faced-paced shooters in general, I would highly recommend DOOM Eternal. You might need to lower the difficulty til' you get used to the mechanics, which the game lets you do at any time, but once you understand them, you can truly rip and tear your way to victory.

The basic combat loop: Switch weapon mods on the fly based on the threat, switch to your super shotgun and meat hook off a flying enemy to reposition, flamebelch a group of fodder enemies to get some armor, chainsaw to regain ammo and assess your situation, target enemy weak points to eliminate priority threats, glory kill for great success, double jump to a monkey bar and double dash to reposition again.

the campaign for doom eternal is one of the most addictive and fun experiences ive ever had playing a singleplayer video game. i highly recommend that you try it if you are down to learn how to survive by using your aggression to both kill everything and get all of your resources back from doing so.

i could gush on and on about how much they did a good job making this campaign really fun and how it feels really rewarding when you use the right tool for the job, but i don't think i need to

the multiplayer, battlemode, is a different story though. its like crack cocaine lol. not many people get into it but if you do, you will get extremely addicted to an unhealthy level then crash and feel the negative effects

if you are good enough to learn how to play the mode, playing with an enemy that is either a little bit above or at your skill level is very very very fun. however, said games are extremely rare as the battlemode playerbase has dropped down significantly from launch.

as of the time of this review, the latency is still incredibly bad, with a near 2 second delay from where you are on your screen compared to everyone elses. this is really really bad, especially with a game where dashing out of the way of things can mean life or death and then you get shot around a corner and explode into little bits.

trying to get into battlemode now will likely not get you anywhere. either you will stomp fellow new players or learn the ropes with somebody in the official battlemode discord, until you get destroyed by a high level player/lag/something else, then ultimately quit.

i highly recommend that you buy this game for the outstanding singleplayer, as well as the coming single player dlc packs, and the (hopefully) more casual invasion mode. 

i do not recommend that you try out the multiplayer, as from what ive seen from my own personal experience and that of my friends, it will most likely end in you just feeling bad about either your skill or the state of the mode. just go play quake champions or any other arena shooter if you want that stuff.

But as the game progresses and you gain access to more mods, you find yourself fighting very challenging encounters with relative ease. That being said, you can die VERY quickly on nightmare. I cannot imagine playing this on Ultra Nightmare. I would not do that to myself.

One lesson I will pass on, as it was a really important thing that I needed to learn. The goal of encounters is to kill the heavies and and super heavies. Perhaps I should have realized this earlier, but for some reason it did not click intuitively for me. I started trying to whittle down easier enemies so I could work towards killing heavies and super heavies, and kept finding myself getting overwhelmed. They will spawn indefinitely. Killing the others will end each encounter. The rest are fodder for the chainsaw or flame belch, which needs to be done as often as possible.

I was disappointed to see the story didn't pick up exactly where 2016 left off, because it ended with a cliffhanger. The story of this game is much richer than 2016 (though still light), but does not connect in a meaningful way to 2016. It is still interesting though.

- The multiplayer is BAD. It has promise but it has two major issues:
. - It's incredibly laggy. As the Slayer, look forward to a full second of delay between action and response vs mobs. One seconds of waiting for health after a kill, one seconds of waiting for an enemy to light after setting them on fire so you can get armor, one seconds after damaging before you can glory kill. It's utter nonsense. I can't tell you the demon's experience of the lag due to the other issue:
. - As a demon, good luck finding a competent teammate via matchmaking. Come in with a friend or lose. Don't have friends who own Doom Eternal and want to give Battlemode a try? Too bad!
- I do not trust the developers to ""fix"" Battlemode. They have been announcing plans to add a competitive mode and still haven't fixed major issues from day 1 (such as the lag). They added Denuvo Anti-Cheat POST-LAUNCH which you HAD to install even to play singleplayer (up until they removed it due to backlash).

The game launched with an ambitious season pass system, which is... okay I guess? I imagine you have to put 10-20 hours into battlemode for each season (which lasts a month, I think) in order to get all the loot you paid for, but there's just not enough variety in the gamemode to warrant that much effort for most people, especially with the above mentioned issues. There's also weekly challenges that you can complete for extra season pass EXP such as play 10 matches, kill 2+ demons 15 times with the chain gun, etc. but... It's just not doing it for me.

Ammo capacity is pretty limited so you will need to use your chainsaw when you find yourself low on ammo. Platforming quickly in combat is necessary and really adds to the enjoyment of encounters. Then there's also a flamethrower, grenades and weapon mods to play around with.

There are a lot of things to juggle while playing this game and it requires focus.
So if you got fog brain or are easily frustrated you might not have fun.

The platforming sucks, the cutscenes, hub world bs and even more complicated upgrade system are even more abundant and out of place - these weren't in DOOM 2016 and we were better off for it. The gunplay forces you to use all your weapons in a way that really restricts how you can approach fights, and it starts to feel super repetitive compared to the previous game. 

There was a good game hiding in here at some point, but there's an almost Disney-esque sense of ""oh wait, this is popular we should have this too"" level of bloat which is not only a massive slap in the face of DOOM fans, but a pretty damning indicator of what has happened with id's relationship with Bethesda. Tim Willits leaving before this game even released is a pretty good indicator of things going south.

67,75506449,english,"This is a really fantastic VIDEO GAME
It is very fun to play. It is worth it.
But, in short, this game is like the Matrix Reloaded for better or worse.

The biggest issue is the narrative arc the creators imposed on this game. The 2016 Doom story is fantastically stupid simple. You're alone on a Mars mining base overrun by demons. EVERYTHING IS SO FUCKED! Wires are dangling from stuff, demonic shit has been going on. You alone have to get rid of this problem. COOL. Simple. The sense of place and the stakes at hand were very palpable in that game. 

Whatever story they are trying to tell in this Doom Eternal game is absolutely bonkers. I'm almost done playing this thing and I have no idea what the goal is or where I am 90% of the time. The stakes are so high (Earth is overrun by demons) that it almost feels like it doesn't matter. The initial planning of this game should have left this whole thing on Earth. There is so much to explore. It is also telling that a lot of the fan art I've seen related to this game tends to take place on the Earth levels. That is the most inspiring and relatable place you seem to visit in the game. Then you take this special portal to these cyber-medieval castles don't seem to have anything to do with anything. BUT. These random places are amazingly rendered. Each zone is so nicely detailed, intense, bizarre, and hilarious in it's own extreme way. 

Which brings me to my thesis. The Matrix Reloaded was a sequel to a film that needed no sequel. I was content to just see The Matrix. But I guess somebody felt the need to make this sequel. That movie takes Neo and the gang all around the world to who knows where, introduces way too much lore about Zion or whatever, has a council meeting, and all this baggage that doesn't really amount to much. BUT. This movie is so fun to watch. The fight scenes are so elegantly choreographed, extreme, intense, and fantastical much like this Doom Eternal. You probably won't watch the Matrix Reloaded to learn the mechanics of the Zion infrastructure, as you wouldn't play Doom Eternal to learn the history of the Sentinels. The narrative, if pushed aside, is just the vehicle for the ridiculous action portrayed in both Doom Eternal and The Matrix Reloaded. The reason I write all this is because I am disappointed at the opportunity missed by the game developers in creating this game. It's hard not to compare this to Doom (2016) and I would conclude that this is a completely new invention in the series. However, unlike the Matrix Reloaded this is a VIDEO GAME and it lives up to that genera to the highest degree. It is very fun and intense.",1599339895,1599339895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198355328742,12,1,1878,441,1330,1602030609,,

Many dislike parkour but at the same time people seem to forget doom 2016 had to walk for longer periods of time with nothing not even music to keep you interested half of the levels were empty save for collectibles and not nearly enough demons to kill. but criticizing doom 2016 is considered heresy by most. speed runners trivialized every fight because doom 2016 was unbalanced. hunting all of the collectibles were a bitch and unfun in every way. Doom 2016 is not a masterpiece and I'm glad this game improved on it.

 If you aren't aggressively weapon swapping and using the arena to your advantage in doom eternal the only people who would like this are those who enjoy mindless violence which would include those who play on controller. controllers are very limiting not because of aim or precision but because of weapon bindings. 

The biggest problem this game has is it's music. no joke it's too quiet. With how intense firefights get it's difficult to even hear the music it gets tuned out. Make no mistake this game is best played as a heavy metal album experience which is a real shame that the audio settings don't allow that for some people like me. finagling the volume mixer and audio settings in game every time i launch doom eternal is unacceptable.

97,75480125,english,"So it's Doom. It's fast paced, brutal, pulse thundering action that makes you feel like an absolute badass while tearing through demons both big and small with a plethora of weapons. Negatives first as there isn't much. 
This is a much harder game than the first, and the lack of a pistol with unlimited ammo that can make dispatching the random zombies that wander around more annoying. Your melee also no longer kills on its own, it only stuns enemies until you charge a blood punch that creates an area of effect of damage around you. 
There are some very annoying enemies, with most being fun to figure out, and some just being annoying ammo sponges until you figure out how to take them down. 
The slayer challenges don't replenish your ammo after doing them, and if you fail them you can try again, minus all the ammo you used trying the first time. These can be very annoying to try and try again. 
And now on to the positives! 
The soundtrack is brutal and wonderful and features previous ID game tracks as bonuses to be found through the world. 
The game, both graphically and stylistically looks amazing with the monsters looking slick with blood and gore with each being easily distinguished from each other. This is a seriously pretty game. 
The game runs great and can easily be customized to suit your rig, running well both on my 1080 sli desktop, and my 1070 laptop with some tweaking. 
The Doom Slayer is highly customizable with cosmetics galore and secrets that reveal more and more ways to make the Slayer more your style, and unlockables given through combat. 
The weapons are brutally satisfying to use with each having their own niche in combat, though some are more useful than others. Does anyone actually use the assault rifle scope? Hm... micro missiles, scope... micro missiles, scope... I know what I went with! 
The BFG is a weapon of last resort due to low ammo found through the game, but is satisfying to use as always. 
The game is not as tight and focused as Doom 2016, but this is a very worthy successor to the previous installment and I look forward to see what comes in the DLC coming in October, if you like first person shooters with some mild horror elements and brutal close combat, buy this game and have a metric ton of fun!",1599305865,1599305865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045415615,265,27,1480,29,1039,1601963950,,

Eternal is a huge disappointment.

too many issues to report and you can find them in all the negative reviews here and elsewhere.

in short it´s not Doom anymore, I don´t know what it is but I know it´s not Doom.

boring unbalanced first half of the game, it gets better in the middle and becomes tedious in the end.

it didn´t felt like Doom, a lot of annoyances and very little real improvements.

get it heavily discounted but don´t expect a sequel to Doom16, it´s a different game altogether.

                      **OLD REVIEW**


From near perfection, to buggy mess. 
That's the best description of Doom: Eternal. When the game launched all the way until the May update, Doom: Eternal was a masterpiece. After the update, the game has become horribly unstable, and potentially a security threat for PC users. The game added Denuvo Anti-Cheat, which has kernel level access, meaning that essentially it has the highest level of access to your computer. Not only is it a potential security threat, it has also caused frame drops, near constant crashes, and *potentially A.I. bugs.
Many enemy A.I. act very differently / much less aggressive. For instance, Marauders. However, that one may have been an intentional balance change, which I do not like, as they are very much able to be defeated.
Speaking of balance changes, the toxic water environmental hazard has been made essentially harmless for seemingly no reason. The purple goo that slows the player has been nerfed to be basically non-existent.
Overall, the game has been made unnecessarily easy, even on the hardest difficulties. Or it would be, if it weren't for the horrible instability that the game has now. 
Before the May update, Doom: Eternal would have been one of my favorite games of all time. I played it on launch day and 100% the campaign on Nightmare within the first weekend and loved every minute of it. Now, I wouldn't wouldn't recommend this game at all, and have personally uninstalled it. Even though I have the Deluxe Edition with future DLC content on the way, I won't be playing it again as long as these problems continue to exist.

TL;DR
From one of the best and most optimized FPS games ever to unplayable, buggy mess that has had it's difficulty nerfed to its detriment.",1589736313,1599263978,True,0,0,0.50161510705947876,0,True,False,False,76561198045126973,212,1,2851,0,2509,1599095433,1595465080.0,"Greetings,

Genre: First Person Shooter
Difficulty: Challenging

Pros:
+ Slaughtering demons is still fun
+ Still challenging without being unfair.
+ Music is still incredible and suits the game perfectly.
+ Demons have exploitable weaknesses.
+ New enemies
+ Returning enemies from the 90s Doom games, such as the Archvile.

Cons:
- ID Software and Bethesda once turned the game into a security risk by adding Denuvo anti-cheat (which is not the same as Denuvo anti-tamper, which generally just affects performance). The security risk is gone, but still, what were they thinking?

55,65414008,english,"Doom Eternal is incredible, utilising all combat and mobility mechanics is exciting, a feast for the eyes. Every weapon has purpose. Quick switching and setting hot keys is a must for the best experience of this game. The game is richer in lore than other Doom games. With cutscenes during and at the end of levels, these can skipped for those less interested.

The combat is greatly enhanced, with new mechanics that have cranked mobility up to 11, and allow for a varied way to collect and manage resources. A great change that forces the player to show some level of competence. You have to ""earn the power fantasy"".
The game is more balanced than Doom 2016. It requires more strategy and thought from the player. The guns are tied to mechanics (weak points, shields, staggering etc.) which lead to plenty of room for experimentation and showmanship.

Some levels are very long, this is a double edged sword. The game is more epic, yet it shows how mentally exhausting it can be at times. 
Platforming can be mildly annoying but is usually simple and can be rewarding if you find a path shorter than intended or have improved at traversal.

Doom Eternal has an arcade style with a neon HUD and inclusion of an extra lives system, there is plenty of audio and visual cues to aid the player. It is a true video game, clearly inspired by classic Doom. The art style differs from Doom (2016), and may take getting used to, but it helps the game look so majestic. The graphics are a big step up. The demons' designs are more inspired and distinguished this time around and great detail was put into their animations (for the glory kills in particular) that help make the demons feel alive, or rather unalive...
The most impressive visual enhancement is the demonic gibbing, seeing the body parts of the demons disintegrate is very satisfying.

 Unfortunately some bugs have been introduced with the first 2 updates (Update 2.1 has fixed most of these), the game may also crash occasionally.
In the campaign, some sequences such as using battery cores can be grating to sit through on replays.
The multiplayer, Battlemode, is quite limited. This was intentional as the game is singleplayer focused. However, with only 1 game mode, there isn't much replayability. 

The lack of an expansive multiplayer mode is far from a problem. With plenty of multiplayer shooters out there, Doom Eternal presents a campaign that easily wins it the title of my new personal favourite shooter of all time.

You will not get a true taste of Doom Eternal in a measly couple of hours or a single playthrough for that matter. The game is best experienced at Nightmare difficulty, its very much worth working your way up towards it, it's challenging but greatly rewarding. The master levels further prove Nightmare difficulty's brilliance with its fast, adrenaline inducing pace.

Cementing itself as one of the strongest entries in FPS, Doom Eternal is a blast to play.
The game is not a casual experience. It is fast paced and wants the player to prove they have what it takes to be in the shoes of the Doom Slayer, to RIP and TEAR!",1584727498,1599230409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198258467884,89,13,14815,928,13273,1601400914,,

Level 5 - All lives gone, i am getting rekt. I am not sure whenever I or the game is crap... Moment, is that grappling hook considered a secondary fire ? Would that activate the slow time rune ?

If you haven't, but you like shooters with an emphasis on fluid and challenging gameplay that keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end: this is also your game! 

I actually found the lore to be quite interesting and well done. It is a bit cheesy, sure, but interesting enough to give all the mayhem a little context and keep you engaged. Especially in the codex there is quite a lot of lore to read, and it's much more comprehensive than you might think or expect from a game like this. But if you don't care about any of that, it never gets in the way of the action if you don't want it to.

The shooting mechanics are fluid and great, just like in Doom 2016. But there are much more tactics involved than before. Every monster type has it's own weaknesses and strengths. You will need to switch weapons and approaches depending on the enemies mid-battle all the time. If you get the hang of this, it feels amazing to 'dance' through the levels, dealing out damage like an absolute badass! Every weapon has it's uses throughout the entire game. Absolutely amazing game-design.

The only thing I would critique about this game, is that I missed the industrial look and feel of the levels from Doom 2016. Doom Eternal's levels are mostly open areas in (post-apocalyptic) suburban settings. This makes for excellent gun play and opportunities to dance around the stage, but I liked the mood of the science stations and factories in the 2016 game a bit more (the Hell levels in that game were not my favourite). But this is just a minor gripe.

Rip and tear, until it is done. Enough said. Extremely worthy successor to Doom 2016 and the games that inspired it from the early days of video gaming. Extremely fun combat mechanics, awesome mobility, beautiful levels, beautiful enemies and weapon models. The guns all feel useful and varied, which adds something to the combat. In Doom 2016 I felt I could do the bulk of the game with the shotgun, but with the new mechanics in place here, there are serious benefits to swapping between weapons tactically, especially on the higher difficulty settings (am playing on Ultra Violence and it feels pretty good). 

Performance is outstanding. I have everything on high (textures on ultra nightmare) and am getting very solid 90+ fps at 1440p on a (Ryzen 2600X, GTX 1070 Ti) but closer to 120 fps. I could tweak it for higher fps I'm sure, but the performance is super smooth as I have it right now and it looks great.

You have your typical Doom loadout including shotguns, plasma rifles, and the BFG. Their are a couple of new additions to the arsenal like the ballista, the crucible, and the unmayker. The only problem is that since the ammo for the crucible is only in the last three levels, the weapon is kinda useless when replaying the earlier levels. The story is awesome with stunning places and badass demons and dialogue.

Anyways, now that's out of the way. Read on.




Music- Do I even need to comment about it? I dig alot of them (IE Meathook, The Only Thing That They Fear is You, ect)

Story- It's a nice little story about Earth being invaded by demons and DOOM guy is just there to stop it. Nothing that bad, but hey it's a nice way to have a break for some of the action.

Voice Acting- It's fine. That's all.

Level Design- Pretty good, although I had to search for guides multiple times because my dumb brain can't figure out shit. And simple puzzles are also a nice change of pace. (Though you can speedrun some of them)

Enemies- Very fun to fight, except the Marauder. Should've been a miniboss in that one level. That's it.

Secrets- Very fun to collect and actually give you some boosts. 

Weapons- Beautiful, sad that they got rid of the pistol. (Though you can somehow bring the pistol back into the game and I also like how the pistol looks)

Characters- Not bad, I wish some of them could've been written better. But hey, I don't really care.

87,75401945,english,"They took everything from the first one and made it better.

One thing I would note is that in DOOM 2016 I played with a controller because the game recommended that I did. This time, I tried to use a controller and then switch to M&K and had a much better time on M&K. When I was on controller in 2016, I was also playing on Hurt Me Plenty but I decided to go with Ultraviolent this time so it may just be that you only need M&K on harder difficulties.

I'm playing on an 8700 and a 2080 and I was able to play with ultra settings with high frames (not sure what the number is exactly). GeForce Experience seems like it doesnt have every single graphics setting cataloged so make sure you go into the game settings and disable motion blur yourself because GeForce did not disable it for me.

I'm running the game off of a Samsung 970 EVO M.2 and load times are consistently less than 5 seconds when I die in the game. This is in contrast to the 20+ seconds I was getting on PS4 in DOOM 2016 and about 10 seconds on a Samsung 860 EVO SSD also on DOOM 2016.",1599184078,1599184078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198198140586,53,2,605,50,214,1601490481,,

Epic gameplay.
The best music in a game
Very relaxing. Just sitting back and watching my villagers interact with one another is beautiful in a way.
Graphics look beautiful. Very colorful and vibrant
Cartoony, which I... oh we talking about DOOM Eternal? Oh. 

Epic gameplay
-The best music in a game [but better] 
-Very relaxing. Just sitting back and watching billions of demons being slaughtered with my ---bare hands is beautiful in a way.
-Graphics are almost like it's real [Minus the ""goofy"" demons.]
A tad cartoony, which i like.
-The developers like listening to the fans. I like that. By the way, dont cancel your purchase of this game when you see the Denuvo reviews. It got removed a while back, so no malware.
-Calls back to the older games [DOOM 1, 2, etc.]
-Good multiplayer [even though a bit repetitive after a little bit]
-A challenge, but not so challenging that you smash your monitor into your pc and shove your keyboard in your skull. Plus, I'm Too Young to Die
-Requires raw skill. You have to stuff that crap up your eye sockets and nose just to get a shiny yellow Slayer. It's worth it, though
-FINALLY. A GAME WHERE BATTLE PASSES ARE FREE!
-Literally the only buyable things are extra campaign things. The Rip and Tear pack [Which you get for 5 bucks, not just a preorder bonus] costs 5 bucks and doesn't go away, AND has DOOT! Revenant so that doesn't count.
-They updated DOOM 1/2 so we can have the classic doom rewards on Steam.
So I updated it.
Here is what I originally said about it. Laugh at my absolute idiocracy.
""The Classic DOOM rewards. Golly. Darn. I would say a cuss word here but i'm a good boi. So I wont. Instead, An introverted slacker will complain about how he needs to spend 15 extra dollars to get some pixels recolored and a new title.
Actually no. I won't. As I said, I'm a good boi. Just please make it so I don't need to buy the Bethesda versions of these games. This one game already ate up 65 dollars. I don't want to spend another 30 bucks on this game""

Cons:
-Bethesda requires your info. A LOT OF INFO. But I've sold my soul to the internet, so not a problem for me. And it was worth it.
-Story.. well... uh... there is some... i guess???? But it's really boring to sit through and read the 50+ codex entries there are.
-Bad matchmaking for the multiplayer. I was teamed up with a level 7 and against a 198. That isn't fair matchmaking. Help.
-The battlepasses are a real grind. There should be like 12 challenges. Maybe 16.  Because I just want a shiny slayer with green stuff around him. Please. Give me this.
-The Deluxe Edition should have 60 bucks taken from it when you have the base game. I don't want to spend 90 bucks solely to make my weapons sound different. Or at least give us another Rip and Tear pack which includes that slayer and weapon sound pack. Lets make that 10 bucks. 90-60=30. 30-20 [which is the Year One Pass] = 10. 10 bucks.
-Broken Slayers Club system. I cant do fan art. I have to grind by READING. Maybe just give me things for stuff I do in-game? That would make leveling ACTUALLY useful. 
All in all, a stellar game. 10/10 would recomend.
But really. Make the Deluxe Edition cost 30 bucks if we already have the base game. 10 if we already have the base game and year one pass. Please, id. Please do this.",1593187399,1599159832,True,1,0,0.496582657098770142,0,True,False,False,76561198066217388,22,13,14768,1608,8244,1601764374,,

37,69318717,english,"Doom Eternal is a totally excellent game, and I'm very glad to be able to change my review to a positive one since the Denuvo Anti-Cheat was removed from the game. Suffice it to say that if you enjoy FPS games, this is a fantastic one. Slick as hell with the gory fun of smashing your way through hundreds of demons. Great!

The game looks absolutely amazing with tons of detail, great design all around, and a fun system where demons fall apart as they take damage. It's also optimized very well, such that even if your hardware is not the best, you could still probably play it. Sound is also great, with a sick djent metal soundtrack by Mick Gordon, and some very satisfying sound effects of guns and demons alike. Voice acting was also done well. 

I must say, I was not initially sold on the changes to combat they made from Doom 2016. There is a lot more strategy involved with how you approach fights, and in the first few levels I felt quite weak. As the game goes on though, you power up and increase your skill as well, so pretty soon I was mashing my way through crazy hectic fights without too much trouble (I only played on Hurt Me Plenty, I'm sure Nightmare is very intense). Once the muscle memory of chainsaw, flame belch and grenades all got worked in to the run-and-gun formula, the game really kicks up to another level. Extremely satisfying to play and designed to push you without breaking you down too badly. Marauders are a divisive enemy, since they can only be handled in very specific ways, but I found that they mixed things up in a fun way and they weren't too infuriating. Whether you like the combat in Eternal or 2016 better is a matter of personal preference, but I think the changes made here really do a service to this title.

I tried the multiplayer a bit and it's fine, not really my cup of tea. Matches are very quick and can feel one-sided depending on who you go up against. It was fun to try for an hour or so after finishing the game and getting the collectibles, but I won't spend more time on it.

Doom Eternal is definitely one of the most impressive games I've played. It took me some time to warm up to it, but once it clicks, nothing else is like it. Remember if you're having trouble that you can always go back to earlier missions to get those upgrades you missed or farm for extra lives (you'll need them, you die a lot) without losing your progress in the campaign. After I finished the main game, which took me about 16 hours, I went back through the levels and cleaned up the rest of the collectibles and slayer gates, which was a fun diversion and made me appreciate the game all the more. The best part of going back to earlier levels is you can use cheats (not for slayer gates though) which were very fun. Try running around at super speed blasting everything with an unlimited-ammo BFG. Very cathartic. Overall, this is an excellent sequel.

There's a lot of platforming, which I don't mind... but it isn't really Doom. Music isn't nearly as good as 2016, and the story is dull and takes itself too seriously... While isn't a terrible game, it doesn't earn a recommendation.

2nd update: Finished the game, it never gets any better. Instead of focusing on arena shooting, you spend 1/2 the time cycling through your different abilities to restore health/ammo/armor, and a 1/4 of the time swapping weapons for specific enemy weaknesses.

53,69285543,english,"Update:
The developer has asked for an updated review based on fixes, i.e. the removal of Denuvo.  Here's my updated review.  First, fixing issues later after a product's release doesn't wipe away the damage that was done by having a game out there in a broken state.  I trudged through and finished the campaign with the issues in place because that was when I had time to play.  You only get one chance to experience a game for the first time, and Bethesda ruined that experience.  I see no reason to let them off the hook for that because they cleaned up later.

If we're talking about the campaign itself and imagining what it would have been like to play it without problems, then there's a great experience to be had there.  It's not a particularly long campaign, but it's a satisfying journey, assuming that you're getting the chance I didn't to play through it in its present, non-broken state.  My biggest frustrations at this point have to do with the lack of things to do beyond the campaign.  

Multiplayer:  Battlemode, simply put, is a great big mess.  An asymmetrical game experience with unnecessarily complicated mechanics lifted from MOBAs where you're dropping bizarre AOE zones and running around in circles is absolutely the last thing I would have ever expected, or wanted, from a Doom game.  Gone is 2016's satisfying multiplayer deathmatch mode into which I've poured hours with friends, mastering challenges, unlocking customization options, and reveling in a classic multiplayer experience.  Battlemode is an ill-advised, crass experiment that does absolutely nothing to up the ante of the 2016 multiplayer experience, let alone replace or even mimic it.  Frustratingly, much of the game's unlockable and ongoing content seem to be tied into this mode which, for me, is absolutely useless.  I could have (and did) tell Bethesda leading up to this release that I would have no interest in a mode like this.  I was far from the only fan to say so.  Yet here it is.

Also gone are 2016's replayability-boosting Snapmaps.  While I appreciate the game's clear desire to embrace bespoke content, the campaign offers limited replayability.  The ""cheat"" cards that you unlock seem to be designed to incentivize replays, but the novelty quickly wears off.  Snapmap created the possibility of co-op experiences with your friends, something this game also entirely lacks.  Yes, there were a lot of trash snapmaps, but yes, it was also a great deal of fun to experiment and find the hidden gems.  It was like the old days of downloading Quake 3 maps to mess around with.

If you think it's unfair of me to compare Eternal to 2016, then I'd ask when it's ever been looked on favorably for a highly-anticipated sequel to deliver far less content and far less replayability than its predecessor.  This game absolutely underdelivered in that regard, and so as much as its campaign is worthy of praise, the game itself is by no means a worthy successor.  Neither is it worthy of a Triple-A price.  Wait til you can get it for half price, slam through the campaign, then call it good.

If Bethesda would like to see a *favorable* re-review of this game, then they should consider taking great strides (especially with upcoming DLC) to reintroduce classic multiplayer, cooperative elements, and replayability.

Original review: ""Taking a screenshot locks the game, if you can get it to launch at all, that is.  It's about a 50-50 proposition.  Oh, and I didn't have any of these problems a week ago.  What gives? 

Fix your mess.  I paid a triple-A price for this to have it work like broken early access garbage.

It's only made all the worse by the fact that the game is ridiculously fun.  It's like you've baked a fresh hot pizza and served it in a box made out of used bandages.""",1589692015,1599084459,False,5,0,0.500838935375213623,0,True,False,False,76561197998364783,418,16,1427,0,949,1599083204,1597181293.0,"Greetings,

59,75341321,english,"Play Doom 2016 first, then this. Doom 2016 is like driving a well made luxury car with perfect suspension and power steering. Doom Eternal is like hopping into an Indy 500 car flooring the gas while being chased by a cruise missile. 

It's very fast, but also very nuanced. You have more variety in enemies which can make some encounters pretty tough when they team up. Ammo is more sparse and the chainsaw is less of a super weapon now and more part of your bread and butter rotation. Shoot guns, chainsaw fodder, repeat. Run out of health and you have to glory kill or use your super op blood punch with the health back perk. Use your shoulder mounted flamethrower to get armor. Use freeze grenades to get health, lock down real tough enemies, and just do more damage. Use grenades to stagger and deal with trash. It all fits together in an extremely high paced puzzle.

Movement is still important as it was in 2016. Dash, double jump, monkey bars, super shotgun grappling hook off enemies, jump pads, and teleporters all help you out in avoiding slipping into a blender of hell knights and cacodemons. Weapon swapping is also still important, and now for once they found out how to make sniping an important part of the gameplay rather than a useless gimmick. Enemies have weakpoints you want to hit to severely nerf their firepower and avoid getting zoned into a corner, and some enemies are weaker to certain weapons like the ballista which does extra damage on flying enemies and is very useful on pain elementals. 

Enemies range from the laughable such as gargoyles and imps, to the ones that are dangerous in group settings like the carcass, to the ones that will destroy your ass 1v1 if you don't know what you're doing like the marauder and the archeville. They all fill their separate niche and become extremely threatening when working together, which can make encounters become unique puzzles that challenge your reactions and decision making skills. 

Things I don't like? Multiplayer sucks. I get what they tried to do, but it just doesn't work. One person is the very strong slayer, and two other players are demons with their own unique skills. I played it for about an hour before never touching it again. I'm glad they didn't do something incredibly dumb like try to make a BR, but this really isn't a solution to the issue of how to revive classic fps multiplayer. A CTF mode would have been much more preferable. 

Second thing I don't care for, although it isn't a bad idea, is the daily xp system. They add skins and new content that you can unlock by doing weekly and daily challenges like glory kill this many imps or whatever. It's not terrible, but there's also little incentive to do it. They are limited time only, but unless you really care about getting a new rocket launcher skin you probably won't bother. 

All in all, great game. Very hard, but fun and the best cardio you're going to get playing a video game.

At first it feels a bit weird and different than what you would expect, then it starts to suck you in and feel like it's fun, but by the end of it all you realize that frustration is what this game brings and not fun.  If you don't play the way the devs want you to, you lose.  There is no freedom or creativity in how you traverse the battlefield.  When I got to the final boss on nightmare I literally quit and didn't even want to do it because I didn't feel like I would actually be accomplishing anything.  This is even more apparent after doing a full nightmare play through of Doom 2016.  When you return to Eternal from there you realize that all the fun you were having is gone, and it quickly turns into a why bother.  

And to sum up exactly why it isn't fun...

In Doom 2016 it is all about movement, shooting, glory kills, and exploration.  That is it.  And you can go about it however you want too.

Doom Eternal is all about movement, precision, and resource management.  Shooting is there, but it doesn't work without the precision and resource management.  Glory kills are there, but they are harder to do and more situational because it is tied to resource management.  And exploration is kind of there, but the map basically tells you where everything is including the fights so it really isn't there.

And git good is just a stupid thing to say.  I'm fully capable of doing it the devs way on nightmare.....it simply isn't fun and not worth my time.",1585423029,1599054102,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041053106,102,2,7365,0,2143,1599088688,,

83,75315848,english,"Doom Eternal is everything I missed and wanted in shooters.

Like in the previous and way previous installments, you are slammed into action with your shotgun and told to 'go nuts'.

The levels are jam-packed with secrets and interesting vistas, which makes exploration a lot more fun than in 2016. I hear a lot of whining about 'platforming', but the puzzles that actually involve small platforms and jumping occur perhaps a handful of times in the game; they're not even that difficult unless you have two ham hocks for appendages and the reaction time of a retractable bridge on a large river. The way I see it, each was put in to replace a sterile corridor.

If you're afraid of not finding everything on your first try: No sweat. You have an option in your FORTRESS OF DOOM that allows you to replay any mission. The lower difficulties are made just for that, to get you to master the game at any speed you want. Hell, if you don't feel like too much of a challenge, you can pop in a cheat code, which you find here and there in the game as secrets, and enjoy the game with instant death ammo, endless ammo, endless lives or confetti spewing out of your enemies while the nerds in Quakecon cheer you on.

If you do feel like a challenge, there's plenty of ways to increase how hard the demons whoop your ass if you slip even once. It's not even about turning them into bullet sponges, it's about increasing the damage your enemies deal, how they react to you, how many of the real nasty ones the game throws at you etc.

That out of the way, there are some things that could've been done without.

The extra life system isn't bad and an interesting addition, but I wish I had the option to reload a save rather than waste another life, just because I was backed into a corner by 5 Mancubi while every Gargoyle spat their green goo in my face.

The gunplay is very different than in any shooter that has ever existed, but it does seem more like a gimmick than an actual system. At first, I ran into the foible of relying on a single weapon, switching to a backup when I ran out of ammo, while using specific weapons only to target the weak points of certain enemies. The game doesn't want you to play like that and will punish you for it. 

Once I started quick-switching between one and another weapon to take down demons, each one of them died remarkably faster and I ran out of ammo less. The thing is: There was no strategy in this. Everything just disappears faster, when I spam between shotgun, arbalest and rocket launcher like some demon-slaying juggler, all the while mixing it up with grenades, frost grenades, the shoulder-mounted flame belcher and chain-sawing enemies once I've ran out of ammo. 

Perhaps I am just more towards a methodical shooter, but I can't be the only one that sees the gameplay of Doom Eternal turns into a chaotic mess on higher levels.

I'll consider buying it again when it gets fixed,[/strike] also screw bethesda launcher and all these crap.

Update:

I bough this game again on sale and i absolutely loved it, some issues were fixed but i had some crashes here and there, nothing major thought. As a game it's spectacular, one of the best games i've played this year. OST is amazing, movement and gunplay also top notch. Everything is what you'll probably expect and more.

I was expecting 2016 but more, but what I got was a more unique and interesting experience.

Thank you id software for your efforts to make such an amazing single player campaign; it was worth my preorder.

Marauders can go fuck right off tho.

Also nightmare in this game is absolute masochism compared to 2016. I'll probably complete a run someday, but not today, tomorrow, or probably this lifetime.

76,69197549,english,"Leaving previous review below as record. 

After completion I couldn’t leave the review negative. It is a very fine game and likely the best of the year for me. I do understand the need of anti-cheat to protect the integrity of the online multi-player. I just wish publishers would consider have a none anti-cheat option for those of us on alternative platforms. Like in the MCC and especially single player games like DooM. If Microsoft can do it there is really no reason that you can’t.

Still lean more towards DooM(2016) but I am really glad to see the Shadow Warrior/2(2013/16) dash make it into the game

Should have known better than to put any level of trust in Bethesda.
Game is completely broken in unnecessary root kit update.

Doom did not need a Bethesda account or ring-0 access in 1993 and it doesn't need them now.

DOOM 2016 was good, but it felt lacking something. It seems that in DOOM Eternal, they found it. 
It was a very enjoyable experience balanced between kill kill kill and the occasional exploration and little puzzles here n there. The combat is fast, fun, and challenging. My favorite part was seeing and feeling myself adapt and get better at dealing with the harder demons and fights. Very rewarding. 
The story was packed with content. Attention to detail, everything felt explained in full to me. The longer the Icon of Sin is on earth, the stronger it will become. and the codex entries are a fun read. 
Havent tried multiplayer yet.

This would off been one of the best single player shooters ever. Definitely has the best combat system I know of. I'm more a sniper guy but then again you're rewarded if you can quick scope actually.

One thing that's pissing me off though is the ledge grabbing and path seeking inbetween fights. It's really getting out of hand in this title. A game that steals my team with stuff that I didnt sign up for wont get a recommanded. That's that.

Though I understand that if you're a single player gamer only, this game basically has no other fps coming close in terms of action and complexity of combat. 

Now normally I would be forgiving if this game had replay value but unfortunately no, if you wanna go back in the campaign you have to play the level in one go. For me someone that only plays a game for 10-20 minutes in little breaks of long programming sections this is impossible so I cant replay the game. 

I would say I dont regret buying it but if you dont mind watching guides how and when to jump/ dash or where to find certain items and you want a good action arena shooter then get this game on discount.

	- The game is no joke hard at times, you'll probably be playing through this on the lowest difficulty if you aren't used to really fast paced FPS games. I wouldn’t recommend playing this with a controller, its not like a causal walk through a COD campaign.  Not knocking them, just understand this game packs a challenge.
	- Graphically beautiful with plenty of customizable filters and effects, so you can make Doom have the tone you want. 
	- Very well optimized, you can easily get this game looking good and have high FPS over 60. Just don’t believe you have to have everything on Ultra. Mess around and see what you noticed. With everything maxed, it does have some FPS dips, especially at 4K. 
	- Plenty to do, the games campaign length feels perfect. You'll spend roughly 30 hours or more getting through it. Then you'll want to play through again to see what you missed. Rare that a game makes me want to repeat it.

I loved Doom 2016. I loved it more than I could have ever thought possible. When I finished it I was hungry, starving for more. I enthusiastically picked up Doom Eternal, echoes of the rave reviews ringing in my ear, eager to get my fix. Yet halfway through the third level my frustration and disappointment are immeasurable.

It would take an essay to explain in depth how much is wrong with this game, and I don't feel like writing that much, so I'm going to bullet point my grievances.
-The combat shotgun sucks now.
-Ammo for everything seems to deplete far quicker than before, and far quicker than is acceptable for the challenges now posed.
-There is never enough ammo, and no the chainsaw doesn't make up for it because.
-The chainsaw never seems to have enough fuel, and there's no proper indication of how much fuel you have and how much fuel you need.
-The basic punch does no damage. THE BASIC PUNCH DOES ZERO DAMAGE.
-The dash sucks, and gets far too much focus in the now numerous and overbearing parkour puzzles.
Rune challenges are gone, and I loved those.
-Explanations for upgrading things is done exclusively through neon tutorial boxes rather than Vega talking you through it, making the entire thing feel more sterile and lifeless. Yeah, maybe it didn't make much sense that the computer could upgrade your weapons more by tracking you being a badass in each level, but at least it made you feel connected to the game more than this.
-Every arena has more enemies, they move faster, they attack WAY more, and they're all harder to kill. A challenge is one thing, but when I have 5 enemies literally crawling up my butt (literally they attack from behind at ALARMING rates) and gibbing me before I can even realize they're there it's no longer a challenge, it's plain unfair, and I played on normal difficulty because I'm not a masochist and just wanted to have fun.
-The flame thrower that gives armor was a nice idea in theory, it's terrible in execution.
-Extra lives are the worst idea they could possibly have had when making this game. It's supposed to make you feel clever and rewarded for getting an advantage by exploring. But the game is designed to make it required to progress at a reasonable rate. Which then in practice just makes you feel like a loser for dying and having to be rescued by your extra lives. It would have been better to just balance the combat around NOT DYING.

I can think of only 2 things that I think are improved in this game from the last: the map feels better, and codex items are easier to spot. That's it. Everything else feels worse.

65,75175273,english,"This is one of the few times I wish I had a middle option for recommendation. I’m not a huge fan myself, but I don’t think it’s a bad game.

If you liked Doom 2016, you may or may not like Doom Eternal. It’s a different type of game built out of the same bits. Much more chaotic and much less focused. It’s Doom 2016 cranked up to 11, and not in a good way. 

They added a bunch of new mechanics but none of them do anything interesting.  Now you can press a button to get armor just like the way you can press a button to get health. You can punch things when your punch things meter is full. Certain enemies have weaknesses where you shoot a particular weapon at them or shoot them in a particular place, but exploiting those weaknesses ends up feeling like a chore.

Then I played DOOM Eternal. I did not have fun.
In fact, while a friend of mine walked me through the first few levels, he warned me that the first three levels sucked and were frustrating. I agree.

2016 made me feel like a badass with a tons of weapons designed to kick more ass than Duke Nukem.
Eternal makes me feel like a frightened rabbit running for his life from a pack of hungry wolves. It also makes me feel like I do not stand a chance unless I remember a crapton of key bindings and keep flailing on my keyboard like a madman. I keep having to lift some of my left hand from the movement keys just to switch weapons efficiently, use the flamethrower, switch attachments, you name it.

I tried playing on normal mode. Then I started dying a lot. So I switched to easy mode. I still died a lot. The descriptions of all difficulty modes essentially say ""You will die a lot"". What, so on DOOM 2016 I had fun on easy mode while still feeling challenged, even completed my game to 100% unlocks, but on Eternal every difficulty must make me feel like I'm not welcome to even try enjoying the game? Gee thanks.

Speaking of dying, one of the MANY resources you collect in the game is extra lives. EXTRA. LIVES. What kind of DOOM game expects you to fail and die and just... enables it??? Like this just felt like an overcomplicated overhealing system with the addition that since using an extra life still means you died, you get to keep playing [i]with the mark of shame that you couldn't handle the battle you're in[/i]. Yeah I really wanted a game to make me feel like I'm too stupid for it then pat my head and be like ""It's okay, you suck but since you searched for this arbitrary trinket I'll allow you to suck"".

One more thing. On 2016, the most basic enemy on easy mode would have a hard time damaging you in any meaningful way. On Eternal, even the most basic easy-mode schmoe is a threat to your continued existence. Yeah remember when the lore said the Praetor suit was super strong? I think this might've gone lost in translation.

In case you haven't noticed, I don't recommend this game at all. If you wanted something that makes you feel like a badass tearing through armies from hell, play DOOM 2016. If you want to be rewarded for pressing a ton of different buttons, play World Of Warcraft. If you want your computer to fart in your face, play DOOM Eternal.

DOOM (2016) encouraged intelligent movement and calculated aggression. Eternal, by contrast, is so frantic and ammo so absurdly scarce that the player is forced into a repetitive pattern of cycling cooldowns while kiting in a circle. Pinging around an arena with underpowered weapons and a useless melee makes you feel less like a badass and more like a mosquito.

The Mario-style jump puzzles and environmental hazards feel out of place. They are dull and unnecessary padding between encounters.

There are some additions and tweaks that may take a moment to adjust to, but rest assured that once you have the combat is still solid. While I would recommend this game, I am primarily writing this to address some of the issues I encountered as a warning to potential buyers. Specifically, the buggy state the game seems to be in. 

My most recent play session consisted of:
-Some walls spawn only to limit combat zones. From a design point this is fine, but I had to reload my checkpoint (and at times replay combat) as these walls did not disappear after winning, completely halting progression. 
-This game puts a higher focus on platforming than Doom 2016. Personally, I found this to be more tedious than fun. Often times the collision detection seemed off. Using a dash into a climbable wall would typically snap me to the wall, but this was inconsistent (perhaps the angles are more particular than I realized) and I was met with a bottomless pit or pool of acid. 
-After acquiring a new weapon I promptly fell through the floor to an area I had already cleared, but the enemies had returned and I had to fight my way out again. At first I believed this to be intentional, until I returned to the checkpoint on a future death and the ground I had previously fallen though was now solid. 

Any of these on their own would classify as minor issues, but given their frequency the overall experience felt more irritating than enjoyable.

Дело мне кажется не в системных требованиях игры, потому что DOOM 64 тоже решил не запускаться.

I wasn't honestly bothered with new types of enemies nor constantly chainsawing smaller enemies for ammo. Only down fall for me was lack of power ups, which in 2016 DOOM was more than plenty.

25,71452010,english,"Below is my original review, done about halfway through the game.
I'll summarize:
The game is absolutely awesome minus three things, two of which aren't that big of a deal.

The insane amount of pointless lore, and the HUD are weak points.  The 2016 version had a much easier to read HUD - could more readily tell when stuff was ready to use better.  The lore is overkill and doesn't matter much to a Doom game - the game is of course just kill everything you see.

The platforming and climbing adds to the game nicely.  However, the extreme platforming is still horrible.  I'm only really talking about the very few (~15 or so in the game) where you die over and over again doing a jump.  Jump-Dash-Jump-Dash or Jump-Jump-Dash-Dash or whatever.  If they brought those 100% difficulty jumps down to 90% I would be very happy.  After 60 hours of playing and I still die over and over again on jumps is just stupid.

Visuals and world building are awesome.  Combat is awesome.  

9/10 maybe an 8/10 after I quit the game when I die 15 times in a row after some pointless stupid jump.

Just finished last night and will play again tonight.

Original, mid-point review:
This game is stupid and is not a true Doom game.  It is a jumping and puzzle game with some 
shooting added.  You will spend 80% of your time jumping and dying and trying again and again.  

They wasted hour upon hour of making up pointless lore and story telling with made up words that mean nothing to the Doom game play or the franchise.  Doomguy just kills whatever is placed in front of him.  That time should have been spent on explaining portions of the game and what they mean and how they work, e.g., Cheat codes, Challenges, XP, whatever those extra mini-missions are within each level, the things on the HUD (The HUD is awful BTW - the Doom 2016 style is far better to gauge how much fuel you have for the chainsaw - the graphic in Eternal I still don't understand).  

This is a reversion to some other style of game like Doom 2003 was - not genuine.  Graphics are good of course, and the SFX and music are awesome.  The 20% of the game that is fighting is really fun, but too difficult.  Constantly running out of ammo, and also running out of fuel as well.  Again, not Doom.  Even on easiest level you will get wiped out over and over again, and I was successful playing on Ultra-Violence on 2016.  The Doomslayer's main base is stupid as well - excessively large for no reason than to place unused artwork.  

The game is not fun - it is all frustration and confusion as to how to play.

In this Eternal completely beats 2016.

Goods:
-Super good game mechanics
-Greater mobility than 2016
-Hell lot of new demons and finishers to them
-Skins for everything!
-Good story.
-Graphics (I still prefer Doom's 2016, even knowing they wanted to be more faithful to the old doom demons... But they ARE good)
-Rip
-Tear

Improvable:
-Codex entries... God I love the story but I would rather have had a bit more of it explained over voice notes or cutscenes I don't know
-SnapMap. I think Eternal could highly benefit from it, and I'm not a huge fan of battlemode personally
-Battlemode is meh at best

Whole campaign with all unlockables upgrades, etc... took me around 30 hours in Hurt me plenty. So more or less same as 2016, a bit more I would say even. It takes a bit to get used to the gameplay mechanics,  but I think after mission 3 the game just turns waaaaay better for some reason in case you feel the game is not clicking the first 2 missions.

When you have a game that is nothing more than a boring mind numbing chore to play. What ever joy and fun this series has was completely scrubbed away by bad game play design decisions. predictable enemies and arenas where in many cases were retextured from ones you ran around in earlier. 

The enemies in many cases are just downgraded from the previous game im sure in an attempt to up frames per second. Most of the weapon are just retextured from the previous game. As well as a majority of the sound effects just being recycled. 
I know that it is a money saving and time saving methodbut that doesnt excuse the mess this game is..

It's nowhere near as good as Doom 2016. It's far more arcade feeling and a little sillier. I feel that Doom 2016 balanced ridiculous over the top action with a grounded feeling a bit better.

Ammo changes are weird, but I get that they wanted to try something new, but it doesn't really work in my opinion. Yes you can chainsaw to reload, but it kind of gets repetitive and takes the fun out of chainsawing. It also means there has to be trash enemies in every fight, which gets irritating.

Runs extremely well, optimised brilliantly. Has its fun moments but the combat is very cluttered and feels like just cycling between cooldowns. You spend too much time in the base which I'm not interested in a doom game.

83,75093452,english,"DOOM Eternal is an incredible game that has made very many improvements over 2016. A lot of common complaints are that it limits creativity through lack of ammo, and that there is too much platforming. First of all, the lack of ammo forces you to be more creative by making the player utilize weapon switching more. In doom 2016, combat encounters were mostly just ""Move around in a circle with the super shotgun until the demons are dead."" I still loved that game though. But in Eternal the player is encouraged to use more strategy. Not to mention the chainsaw actually refills in this game, making combat even smoother. And the platforming is very simple. Some people say that they are ""puzzles,"" when in reality an 8 year old could do the platforming sections. The parkour is very short too, and adds some breathing time where you can find some extra health and supplies. Speaking of supplies, Some folks say that flame belch is nothing more than an extra gimmick to further complicate the game. But the flame belch allows you to negate portions of incoming damage, which allows the devs to make smarter ai and stronger demons, which makes the game way more fun.

91,75082640,english,"DOOM Eternal is a good game, if you haven't played DOOM (2016) then the rest of this review is irrelevant, however when compared to its predecessor this game is inferior in several ways.  The game is great, better than most out there, if DOOM (2016) didn't exist this would be one of my favourite games.  However DOOM (2016) does exist and that makes this game ultimately disappointing as a successor.

Firstly much of the aesthetic has been changed in ways which just make it worse.  Pickups have been desaturated but the brightness has been increased, creating a cartoonish look that does not blend with the game world.  Weapon pickups in particular are now floaty spinning and glowy things instead of being blended in.  The secrets are now also glowy floaty things instead of being blended into the game world too.  This almost seems like it was a change made later in development seeing as there is a cutscene (shown in the trailer for the game) in which you obtain the plasma cannon.  However at that point you have already obtained the gun as a pickup item (that you would actively have to avoid collecting).  The UI is designed to match this aesthetic which makes the game look even more arcadey.

On top of this further changes to the aesthetic have been made in the sake of fan nostalgia pandering.  The soldier, mancubus and cacodemon have designs based on the original DOOM sprites, which only serves to make them look dated and out of place.

The chainsaw has been changed so that now instead of picking up fuel it has a single charge that recharges overtime.  Additional charges can be picked up as items but you will never have more than 1 charge because you will be using it to get more ammo.  In the previous game ammo was fairly plentiful meaning you could usually save up charges to kill a large enemy when you didn't want to deal with it.  In this game the ammo cap is vastly restricted and you will always be chainsawing fodder and switching weapons to keep you ammo count up.  There is however a new weapon called the crucible that replaces this role, however it is a late game item and the ammo scarcity is more equivalent to the BFG.

DOOM Eternal has added extra mobility options in the form of climbing walls, monkey bars and a dash. These make the combat much more fast paced and facilitate much more creativity with the boss designs.  However this has been used as an excuse include several parkour sections in the levels, which are not challenging and ruin the intense flow of the game that was present in DOOM (2016).

The game frequently suspends the action for tutorials.  Every new piece of equipment/ ability has a disruptive tutorial,  as does almost every large demon.  They are overintrusive and could have been done in a more integrated way.

Many demons now have a weakspot which makes many encounters more gimmicky and repetitive as there is a fixed best weapon and strategy to counter them.  When combined with the fact that the demons seem more tanky now, you are basically forced into using the weakspot to take down the enemies.  This gives the combat a more formal rythm compared to the free flowing structure of the previous game.

One of the new demons added is called the marauder.  The marauder is not a hard enemy if you know how to fight it.  However it is the previous paragraph turned up to 11.  This demon is boring to fight and very gimmicky.  On top of this the game gives straight up incorrect advice (as one of the tutorials) on how to counter this enemy, causing it to be a frustrating learning experience as it is the first demon capable of completely soloing you.  This demon ruins the rythm of the combat as its numerous mechanics force your attention, but require you to slow down the pace while you deal with it.  Not fun 0/10.

The music is good, but in most levels it does not hit as well as in 2016.  It does not seem to be synced as well and often reaches climax right as the fight ends leading to a disappointing fade down to the out of combat track.  This could have something to do with the fall out between Mick Gordan and ID.

I'd recommend it as the story is fun and the more intense fights manage to capture the fun of Doom.  However coming from 2016 it feels overall underwhelming.

96,75079915,english,"Fantastic game. Massive improvement over the 2016 installment with great weapon variety and diverse arsenal. Pros:
1- Fluid combat even more than 2016. The addition of dashes, flamethrower, and the tweak of the chainsaw made the combat cycle more fluid than ever before.
2- Level designs are the best in the franchise, both from the mix of combat and exploration, the versatile environments and little dash of parkour added on top. Combat areas have more options for movement with the addition of jump bars.
3- More demons, with weakness points and various patterns. Some are a joy to fight and some are just a pain in the ass (slithering fucks).
4- Combat now focuses more on strategy as you have to keep moving while evaluating your options and choosing your little fights. Smaller enemies serve as resources while bigger ones you need to build up momentum to tackle (in the form of ammo, special attacks, or both). 

Cons: (Spoiler alert)
1- End game levels are not as flushed out as early levels. The last two levels were actually nothing but fight area after the other with little exploration or parkour to add variety. 
2- The end two bosses are just horrible. I don't know how the developers landed on those design choices but man the are complete opposite of the entire game. The last boss is basically a bullet sponge which is really disappointing since the game masterfully avoided bullet sponges among many other typical FPS games gimmicks for adding artificial difficulty. The second to last boss is a repetitive loop where the arena is getting smaller as the boss sets the floor on fire! The concept is extremely poor in practice as it made the fight boring and annoying.

Overall the game is most buy if you are a doom fan. I'd say it is worth ~30 USD or so.

Pros: graphics, gameplay, relentless pacing, plethora of unlockables, armor/weapon upgrades, and content in general.

Cons: Marauder is initially a fun challenge, but soon after turns into one of the most annoying and rage-inducing demons to fight against thanks to him showing up multiple times again and again throughout the rest of the game.  He hinders the enjoyment and initial excitement of the game by a ton.  By a certain point he is no longer a fun challenge; he becomes simply irritating to the point where you want to stop playing altogether.  There's also the checkpoint system which I absolutely loathed.  You can get 90% into a boss/horde battle and the minute you die, you restart at the very beginning again.  What a huge turn off.

The game is not horrible but while DOOM 2016 was enjoyable from start to finish Eternal was ""meh"" in like half of the content. Get it on a steep discount if you really liked DOOM 2016. While playing through it i had many moments where i was disappointed or bored instead of thrilled. Would i have known the following i would not have bought the game.

- The amount of parkour between the battles makes up around 40% of the game. This is way too much and it is just simple jumping making it really boring to do.
- The game is so buggy i would categorise it to be still in beta. Had to do mission 3 more than 4 times since the battle completion bugged out and i did not get the weapon upgrade point. Fell through the floor sometimes. Enemies often don't act and freeze. Sometimes completed mission objectives just get lost later on. 20% of my game time was redoing bugged missions. I don't remember having a single bug in DOOM 2016. Rushed development? 
- The story presentation is simply garbage. You get drowned is notes to read to follow what is happening since they can't be bothered to explain anything elsewhere. DOOM is just not the game to be an epic Opera. This is another victim of their new game development philosophy MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER. 
- Two of the new enemies are just horrible from a design perspective. The Archvile summoning demons is really strong so i one hit kill him with the new weapon. That's the way every single fight against him goes. The other is the Marauder. Putting him into the game was an obvious oversight from the rushed development. I honestly thought we would get a patch removing him.  
- The difficulty is unbalanced. Most fights are so easy even the highest difficulty is not that hard. Then there are some fights i had to change to the easiest difficulty. Having to go to the menu all the time just ruins the game flow. Again, DOOM 2016 in comparison was perfect. I just played it on the highest difficulty and never had to change anything. 
- I totally get what they wanted to do with the severe ammo capping. It's good in theory but the way they implemented it is not finished. I often end a fight with no ammo left at all. Then comes a small challenge fight but with no enemies to refill. So i can't do it and have to return later. Why not just spawn a small refill enemy in every challenge fight?

Edit

Got two other interesting points. 
- The ammo problem is handled right in the master levels. Seems like they know where the problem is but had no time to do it in the campaign so only the two master levels got the right enemy respawn behaviour. Again, the game is simply not finished.
- The marauder fight is the only one not shown in any trailer. They know it's bad but strangely kept him in the game anyway.",1598450132,1598555796,False,8,2,0.485460668802261353,0,True,False,False,76561198008793734,196,21,1439,0,1126,1598571642,,

Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game.  I was hesitant to buy it at first after so many people were comparing it to Doom 2016 in a not so good light.  While it certainly is a very different feel than Doom 2016, the game stands on it’s own.  I had a TON of fun playing this game and time would fly by because the action was so constant and intense at times.

I would recommend this game to anyone who loves constant and intense action in a twist of an old school shooter with the newer concept of power-ups and attachments.

88,75005589,english,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
One of the best FPS's to date. Smooth gameplay that flows like water. The combat puzzle is wonderfully put together.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
How the game actually plays is Eternal's strongest point. The ""combat puzzle"" is a joy to work through. Different demons require a different approach. Sure you can [i]try[/i] to Super Shotgun everything, but it won't work out too well for you. For example, if you used the Heavy Cannon's scope mod to shoot off the rocket launchers of the Revenant, he won't be able to shoot at you and be forced to close the distance in melee combat, making him a far easier target. Glory kills replenish health, flame belch replenishes armor, and chainsawing replenishes ammo. Learning when to use those and what demons to use them on can really make your life easier. This is what I mean by the combat puzzle and the game revolves around it.

There are a lot more platforming sections in this game as compared to previous Doom installments. Platforming is implemented well and is used to discover secrets strewn about the levels. Your traversal options are greatly expanded with bars to swing from and walls to cling to. The bars in particular help combat feel as fluid as it does, helping you glide across the battlefield.

[h1]UI and Customization[/h1]
The UI is just incredible and fully customizable. The hud can be changed to a few different colors, made smaller, or removed all together. Hud opacity can also be changed. Almost every facet of the game can be changed to how you like it.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
This is obviously the best looking Doom to date. The Slayer is meticulously detailed, as well as the levels and demons. Up-close glory kills look incredible and taking a screenshot you can see the true work put into the presentation. Weapon models are suitably detailed, which should be the case as they are always in front of you. The level of detail in the levels is truly awesome, especially if you care about the lore of the game.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The sound is pretty good, although for some reason the soundtrack sounds a little muffled. Weapons all sound great and the chunky hits on demons is wonderful. Punching is also really satisfying and the sound makes you want to keep on punching.

[h1]Online[/h1]
I'm going to be honest here, Online is not the true gem of this game, that lies in the singleplayer. However, Battlemode is pretty fun. It pits a single Slayer vs 2 demons. You can be one of several demons all with different abilities (like summoning other demons or summoning a flame pit). It's quite fun, but there are limited maps and it's the only game mode.",1598537275,1598537275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198003789539,80,5,1555,32,1040,1602034284,,

98,74989858,english,"OK Reviewing this game is REALLY difficult. 
TLDR: DO NOT think that 'the hardest mode' is for everyone. That's where the bad reviews come from.
No one ever did Ultra Nightmare with less than 200h in this game. No. One. Ever. Will.
It's great, its SHIT, it's amazing... in that order. Let me explain...

This game is set up so that the most casual player to the most highly skilled can all find their own mastery.
DHMD is for people who want to roflstomp, explore the world, read the lore... then leave.
Ultra Violence is for people who have played through, who want a bit extra challenge. You should be able to AltiSwitch your DPS weapons, and have custom Keybinds for each weapons at this point, else go back down a difficulty.
Nightmare is there for those who wish to truely understand the finely nuanced combat and it's high-level quirks. This is for 1/1000 players.
Ultra Nightmare is for those who know where enemies will spawn before they've killed the previous one. The explicit definition of mastery. This is going to be less than 1/10,000 players. This is 'God' tier game play, and I do not say that lightly. 

DO NOT come into this thing thinking you can take on Nightmare without learning the deep inner systems of this game. You'll leave hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned. Thus so many bad reviews for the game. People are idiots.

IF you're a casual, want to play a challenging and highly enjoyable single player experience / campaign, and come form games such as;
-ShadowWarrior 1 or 2
-Titanfall 1 or 2
-Doom 2016 (Caveat)
  Or 
-any other action heavy, content lite shoot shit until it dies game;

then do this:
Buy Game. Play on  Ultra Violence. i think. Maybe the one below that. Yeah, the one under that. I make UV look easy.
spend all your time looking around for secrets, make sure the first Suit upgrades you unlock are 'larger Automap Reveal Radius'. Find every secret and Codex (usually really simple to fine them, they are on the main story path). Read everything, watch every cut scene. Enjoy the game.

Otherwise;
Ultra Violence is for people who have played through once before and understand the game loop.
Shoot/jump/dash/switch/chainsaw/'do it all again'. At this stage I recommend mastery of quick switching weapons.

It's not a glitch, it's an intended 'high level' mechanic. If you're using the MMB or Weapon wheel to switch weapons at this stage; upgrade your skill, or stop playing UV and go back down to Don't Hurt Me.

Nightmare is for those who want to truely master every Nuance and combat system of the game.
DONT watch videos online and think you can do that. You can't, unless you are Shroud Himself... Or Mayo. Trust me. I am a better FPS player than you. This game is going to hurt you. a. lot.

GG>

Buy it and play on easy for a power fantasy.
buy it and play on Hard if you're determined to put 1000h into learning the game's systems.
Else,

Shut up. Fuck Off.

16,74978520,english,"TL:DR
Worth buying on a discounted sale for single player and to support the developer, but don't install through Steam. Instead pirate it to bypass Bethesdas bullshit, or configure your firewall.

The experience is tarnished by the decision to try to force the player to create a Bethesda account and link it to Steam, even if you have no intention of ever doing anything online with the game. The only way I know of how to bypass it is either disable internet on your computer, through adapter/unplugging ethernet cord, or configure a firewall rule to not allow the game reach out and ""phone home"". I've had to disable the rule once in order for it to ""phone home"" and validate itself somewhere halfway through my playtime, as it refused to startup until I did so. Then re-enabling the firewall rule worked still, and I was able to finish the game.

GAMEPLAY, in my subjective opinion, is still good when compared to the predecessor. However for every advancement it makes, it takes a step backwards as well. 

New weapons are fun, but the changes to the chainsaw are incredibly frustrating. You only get 3 units of fuel for it, and it always 1hit kills anything with only 1 fuel. However there is no way in knowing if you can actually use it on an enemy until you try it, and get a ""no target"" message, or slice it up. As some demons are immune to the chainsaw, and others have to be damaged to an unknown degree before you can do so. 

New melee charge up punch ability is fun when it works, but extremely infuriating when it doesn't... At times I was either mid air and it simply refused to be triggered, or it briefly bugged out and I ended up doing a regular punch and getting my face ripped off instead.

You get much more mobility actions when compared to the previous game, a double jump, and two charges of ""dash"" which are omni-directional. However, the level design is now much more vertical and platformer puzzle driven now. There's a lot of time spent on weird and unpleasant first person platforming without any sort of action. I felt like I was playing Prince of Persia at times, instead of RIP AND TEAR. The dash also bugged out at times and I ended up getting stuck inside of enemies/terrain for a brief period of time, enough to get turned in to a pink mist on the difficulty I was playing at.

STORY, is mediocre to good.

Exposition occurs primarily through codex entries, and some voice over lines. The developers are attempting to explain and rationalize everything in the setting/events, instead of leaving mystique do the work. While doing an acceptable job, it still leaves minor plot holes and inconsistencies. Especially glaring in many levels where platforming puzzles are so blatantly shoe-horned in without regard to how it would fit in with the setting of the level.

SOUND, absolutely incredible!

Honestly, the sound design carries this game farther that even gameplay. I would like to especially highlight the background ambiance sounds of the levels and the music as really standing out. Top notch work!

+ Excellent campaign with neat enemies, arenas, collectables and lore.
+ Unique and fun multiplayer which brings in knowledge of campaign gameplay.
+ Nice selection of weapons with which to slay.
+ Superb enemy variety and utilisation along with integration into the rest of the game mechanics.
+ Refined weapon arsenal where everything is viable, which is needed when the game wants you to constantly weapon switch.
+ You don't die falling off cliffs and such unlike Doom 2016, just spawn with a bit less health, so it's easier to explore.
+ The most optimised while also good looking AAA game I've seen in a while.

= Platforming is fun for downtime but basic, unless you put effort into chaining meathooks, dashes, ballista boosts and the like.
= Marauders are awkward when thrown in with other enemies, though fine eventually the dog is still annoying. Look up Under the Mayo on YouTube explaining how the Marauder is actually an excellent enemy for the game.

- Other multiplayer modes would be nice and snap-map didn't return, so less value for money in some regards compared to Doom 2016.

Sometimes you don't even get the luxury of knowing how the hell you died(a ""killed by"" message would be nice!)

The movement in this game is a HUGE improvement from 2016 and the light platformer elements are easy, but fun, but one-dimensional. The movement improvements are more for the combat, though, for getting out of aforementioned sticky situations. 

The game gives you a lot to work with, and at its hardest it demands you use all of your options at once. Getting though Nightmare will push even the most dedicated FPS players to the limit, with there being plenty of rage inducing moments. Don't forget that when you sign up for Nightmare you get what the name implies, but it's satisfying to overcome insurmountable odds. 

Finally, the multiplayer is mediocre, the secrets are hardly secretive, the UI kind of sucks(but is great where it needs to be), the rocket launcher lock-on is ass, and if there are two things this game has a lot of its skill trees and bugs. But all in all its a great game, I mean look at how many hours I have in it.

41,74946016,english,"Doom Eternal is a mixed bag. On one hand you have the combat which is exciting and challenging. The game forces you to use strategy against the enemies by using different weapons and abilities. Along with a great soundtrack it can be a lot of fun blasting and killing demons. On the other hand, the game is let down by simple and boring level design and awful jumping puzzle sections.

Between nearly every single ""arena"" to fight demons, there is always some sort of jumping puzzle. Walls to climb, spinning ""Mario"" flame poles, monkey bars to swing from, and large pits to cross. These sections really break up the gameplay and consist of about 40% of the actual game time.

The levels are pretty simple, very linear, and always give you waypoints on where you should be going next. It would seem they focused more on visual appeal rather than actual fun or interesting level design. They look great with awesome backdrops but everything is so chunky and static, it feels like you are traversing a fake environment just designed to move you along to the next arena for a demon fight.

46,74943369,english,"Fast paced and a helluva blast. If you liked DOOM 2016 you're more than likely going to love this. DOOM: Eternal adds more guns and brings back old ones in new ways that really put a breath of fresh air into this sequel. With great controls, badass abilities and an arsenal of weapons that would make the US Marine Corps look small caliber you get to wade through hordes of demons on Hell on Earth with a new emphasis on platforming and exploration that even DOOM (2016) didn't have it really is the ultimate DOOM Slayer experience.

As always, there are a few minor drawbacks. While I mostly got away scotch free, I have heard multiple reports about this game having no small amount of technical issues at launch but I do believe a large portion of them have been resolved with updates and such. The soundtrack, while still amazing, isn't quite what it was in the previous installment having slightly more ""wub wub"" in it than I would've preferred or even expected from such a Metal focused game like DOOM. Eternal also struggles with it's missions, or rather the transitioning between them. In 2016 you went from room to room and every mission was effectively just a few steps past where you ended the last whereas in Eternal there is no small amount of massive scene changes with little to no explanation short of ""lul let's go here now"" which can make the game a little jarring in the pacing. While I don't personally share this opnion, there are some that draw issue with the level design combined with the lack of continuity between missions and likened the game to ""a DOOM Slayer theme park"" as opposed to the more grounded approach taken in 2016.


Even with those issues and shortcomings I do believe that Eternal is overall better than 2016. From the weapon design, to the improved upon abilities to sinking deeper into the DOOM universe's lore. It's a fantastic approach to the game with hours and hours of fun (Including DOOM 1 and 2 from 1993 and 1994 fully playable inside the game) and is absolutely worth your time and your money.

Did you see the Doom Guy? One punch of this guy would vaporise a grown up dude!) and replace it by some anime-like shock wave?! Eurk... 

And what about his teen room with guitars, magazins and toys?! He is the Doom Slayer, ffs! Not most of his fanbase nowadays!! He doesn't j*** off on his throne thinking he's the best when mommy cooks his meal! Wow... How can you mess up your character so much?!

I've completed the campaign in 11 hours.
It's really fun but there are some frustrating things in game.
In some ways it's 2 steps ahead of Doom 2016 in some it's 1 behind.
Overall it's better then the predecessor, but not without it's faults.
Exploration is still rewarding, and in my opinion to take a bit of your time to look around is not only smart, it's fucking necessary.

The story has been much improved but it has it's ""question marks"" here and there. It's very much expanded, refreshed and clarified, i love it. It's not a lot, but it's enough and not in your face stuff. You can read codex entries as before.

100% recommend this game but here are some criticism, spoilers ahead!!!!

Hugo Martin mention that the super shotgun was too good and they wanted a game where every weapon is viable. They bot succeeded and failed at the same time. Super shotgun is the best overall weapon period especially with the flaming meat-hook. They ""nerfed"" it by taking away a lot of ammo it's mitigated by regenerating chainsaw but still it's bad, it's artificial and i don't like it.


Minibosses: 
The Marauder is bot the most fun and most frustrating enemy type. If you havent played the game yet i won't spoil it for you. If you have i'll say one word. Dog.
The Platform shieldy guy that has two phases: fun, good finally not only super shotgun.

Bosses: Really fucking good. 'nuff said weapon choices matter!

Some fights can get REALLY hectic and it's where doom shines. The ""get out of Jail free 9000 gun""  sometimes takes away from the fun, but it really is that. Press the button and you won.

This game has a surprising amount of depth for a central mechanic of simply shooting things until they die.
Original review below.

Doom Eternal is much more ""arcade-y"" than Doom 2016. The atmosphere is brightly colored and collectables are shiny floating objects. Personally I dislike that. I greatly preferred the atmosphere of 2016, where, for example, the collectables (save for the toys) were part of the environment.

That being said, the game mechanics are a lot more refined in Eternal over 2016, especially in regards to movement. Among the refinements is a much tighter resource loop. However, there could be an argument to be made about there being [i]too many[/i] weapon mechanics in the loop. There's now a flame thrower and an ice bomb which is swapped to and from the frag grenade. There is also a sword at the end of the game. These special weapons added onto everything from 2016, including two weapon mods per gun. It's just a lot of stuff to remember to utilize in the heat of the moment when there are only fractions of a second to react. I did not get the hang of fully utilizing everything until close to the end of the game.

Gripes about the atmosphere and the at-first unwieldy arsenal aside, I still highly recommend this game.",1593442234,1598403759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198015657256,223,6,5952,54,1732,1601952883,,

76,74916236,english,"Literally epic. Definitely the most fun I have had playing an FPS in years. 

First off: prepare to become a one-man killing machine because your arsenal and abilities require you to learn them fast and actually put them to use. The good news is that with every new enemy and encounter, the game pauses and pops up a screen that shows you the exact weak points of your new enemy aka demon fodder. I'd say the funniest weakness is the Cacodemon's vulnerability to swallowing grenades from your shoulder launcher or shotgun; his wide eyed ""OH SH!T"" face right before detonation is freaking hysterical. 

Secondly, the game is a straight-up rewarding challenge. You will learn to get into a rhythm of combat.. or you will be getting squashed. As a true DOOM scholar I went straight for Ultra-Violence difficulty, beat it, then beat it again on Nightmare. After both, I am pleased to report that I had only a handful of instances where I felt like I had been cheated into a death, or experienced a death didn't really make sense. For all of the other many times I died, I completely understood what I did wrong, and could immediately take a different approach, streamlining the jump back in and preventing my ever feeling ""burnt out"" from frustration. Every time I got past a section, I felt very satisfied with myself for overcoming the insanity of the onslaught. 

In particular, the Marauders that everyone seems to be obsessed over are indeed a worthy challenge. They give you virtually no room for error, and punish you gravely for taking either of the two typical approaches of ""close and in-your-face"" or ""I'm gonna try to snipe you from the other side of the area."" With that in mind, you must maintain a delicate balance of medium distance so that he can't use his close-range shotgun, or super-fast long-range ax blast. But once you defeat one, you WILL feel a rush of accomplishment. PROTIP: Punch the Marauder after you stagger him with a successful shot and he will stagger again, leaving him open for a second shot.  

Third, the story is well-structured, well-paced, and genuinely interesting. The scattered lore pages are fun reads, and do an excellent job of building not just the world, but the mysterious, elusive DOOM Guy as well. In fact, this is the most you can see and hear about DOOM Guy ever, so there is a general sense of many long-time questions finally being answered. At the same time, you also feel like you want to learn even more, and the explosive, exciting ending leaves you with the feeling of ""I just can't wait for what's next.""

Fourth and final, as to the technical parts, the game has buttery smooth performance for even old systems and seems to have a highly efficient slow-motion effect in place for when your frame-rate drops below a certain level, preventing the action from becoming unfairly stacked against you. Even at the lowest settings, the game looks very beautiful (as much as that word can be used to describe the vile hordes of Hell), and it's actually fun to take a look around and soak in the artwork between the surprising diversity of locations (it's not just burning burning pits of Hell the whole time). Your mother-base and mission jump point, a ship of Maykr origin, is a barrel of fun all by itself, and there is plenty to look at and explore within. 

In a nutshell: this is a mandatory choice for all FPS fans, of all types, and DOOM fans of all ages. If you don't want to single-handedly ""RIP AND TEAR"" through the armies of Hell like a literal God, then what the Hell do you want to do with your life?",1598401852,1598401852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197975927735,102,1,2843,0,2843,1598312450,,

81,74913983,english,"DOOM Eternal is a fantastic game, with fun combat, fun platforming, and a pretty alright story.

Combat is by far the best part of the game. While (most) enemies do get shredded by your arsenal, it does take planning and strategy to ensure you survive combat encounters. Becoming overly cocky, even when replaying earlier levels, can lead to taking a lot of unwanted damage. Planning your attacks, glory kills, blood punches, chainsaw uses, and most importantly your movement around the arena are a requirement if you don't want to die. The arenas are designed with your move set entirely in mind, so take advantage of all the ledges, bounce pads and swinging bars. The challenge gates for both secret encounters and slayer gates are a great challenge and super satisfying to beat. Encountering Marauders can be frightening at first but clearing the arena of other enemies and playing safer is not only the best way of fighting him, but also a great change of pace when it comes to the usual ""kill everything in sight"" combat.

The platforming sections of DOOM Eternal are quite enjoyable and can lead to some very well hidden secrets. Platforming makes full use of the double jump, swing bars, dash and wall climbing, and keen eyed players might spot out of place platforming sections that may lead to a secret of some kind. However, some secrets I feel were very cheaply hidden within levels when compared to how clever some locations are for other secrets.

The story of the game is alright. There really isn't much to touch on as it doesn't try to do anything too special. For what it is, it works in context of what kind of game DOOM Eternal is.

Overall, I highly recommend DOOM Eternal to anyone who enjoys first person shooters and single player games. There is a lot of fun to be had playing and replaying the campaign, and I'm sure that will extend into the first expansion that's releasing soon.",1598397481,1598397481,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198062625286,163,3,2924,125,1640,1601027105,,

The campaign is one of the best FPS experiences ever, period. Definitely has a couple rough difficulty spikes thanks to Marauders, but otherwise the game is full of intense action, excellent music and sound design, and tastefully excessive violence against the armies of Hell. The platforming is also significantly less garbage and more forgiving than DOOM 2016's, becoming a fluid and mostly seamless part of the Eternal death ballet. 
Ultra-violence is a totally doable and exciting challenge, and Nightmare isn't impossible on a second run. 
The first run is the least fun. The replay value is pretty good, and once it all clicks, the aggressive combat starts to feel natural after a few levels. 
[spoiler]If Marauders kick your ass too often, quickly switch between the super shotty and ballista. Once you fiogure out the timing for a parry, it's mostly over with. [/spoiler]

[h1]MULTIPLAYER: [/h1]
Battlemode is kinda 'meh'. It's not horrible, and thankfully bad games are over with quickly. That said, the Slayer player seems to be either horribly underpowered or overpowered versus the two demon players. Mostly seems to be a product of Slayer mobility and how many fodder enemies demons can lob at the arena. Starting Battlemode for the first time also locks you into the only totally unskippable tutorial in the game, and I think that helps say something about how unnatural the gamemode feels at first. 
Don't rely on text chat for anything worthwhile- it's inaccessible for most of the game, and seems to go by too fast to effectively communicate.

The only issue I have with the game is that you can be having a grand time. Flying all over the map killing a bunch of demons, and then the game grinds to a screeching halt. (I’m looking at you Marauder).

[b] Plot [/b]
Sometime after the events on Mars, Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have joined the Armored Response Coalition, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion, which has gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and teleported away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the AI VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests: Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to a destroyed city and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr transports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.

I'm leaving the original Denuvo part here as a reminder of something that *was* bad that is now GONE

I can never recommend a anti-cheat like this as it introduces more problems than it solves and considering most people will play the campaign rather than battlemode (which has its own problems that I dont have enough experience in the mode to talk about) they won't NEED the anti cheat.

31,74859543,english,"This game trudges dangerous territory for me. On one hand, some of the mechanics introduced in Doom 2016 have been refined and polished to near perfection. You will balance abilities in a very satisfying gameplay loop once you get a feel for it. Gun, level, and enemy design are very much on point. On the other hand, I knew this game would make mistakes when it came to some of the lore established in 2016. Of course, this one is very much up its own a** when it comes to the mythos, but at least the cutscenes are skipable. It's not unenjoyable, but things are certainly much more fleshed out than they probably need to be. It comes as extremely juxtaposed by how much the game knows it is a video game. By which I mean, 1-ups, easter eggs, floating guns/powerups and collectables, as well as Doomguy's (sorry, The Doom Slayer's) comedic timing. Also, those expecting to be able to tear through demonic hordes without thinking too hard will be quickly frustrated by how fast guns run out of ammo, or potentially even by the break in pacing granted via the small platforming segments. To me, these certainly don't pose an issue, as they are short and fairly enjoyable and really don't make you think too hard, and I enjoy how the game forces you into utilizing all of the mechanics.

I can't comment on the multiplayer because I didn't play it, but I've heard it's fun. I can't really say.
The exclusion of Snapmaps feels like a missed opportunity.
I can feel the icy Hand of Bethesda clawing at my back when it comes to how hard XP/leveling and participating in community events is thrown at you, especially with all the confetti screens and skins. That isn't to say participating in any of that isn't fun, but this game didn't really need all that. And all the extra fluff around what I consider an already solid game feels pointless, even a bit detracting with the exclusion of snapmaps. At least there's no abusive monetary schemes hidden away in all this.

In the end, I do recommend playing this game. And definitely play on a harder difficulty. Don't get filtered by the Marauder.",1598307364,1598307364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197994048801,502,15,2829,35,2793,1601138761,,

I try to play and... there's no sound? This one is tricky. Turns out that the game sometimes can't be heard on bluetooth headphones. Other games don't care where I get my sound from, but ok.

Back into the game... Now every time I launch it, there's a 50% change that it won't receive input from my mouse and keyboard. I have to terminate the game from the task manager and restart. REALLY?? You make a AAA title for one of the most famous franchises, and you don't know how to read my mouse?!

Update: I managed to finish the campaign. Loved it. What I didn't love was being interrupted by a pop-up 2-3 times per hour, saying that connection to the Bethesda servers has been lost. A connection which, mind you, adds practically nothing to the campaign. About to score a mid-air headshot? Not before accepting a popup about Bethesda's servers being useless again.

The game itself is a solid shooter, but it can't be recommended when it fails in such basic ways.

PRO :
The benefit for player for me because of this doom installment I've felt it try to train me into a better FPS player with good reflex from keyboard setup from UnderTheMayo it made me experience more fun in playing this game than ever. I Finished this game in the Ultra-Violence Difficulty which is not too easy and too hard which is perfect ultra nightmare in this game itself has poor shame its prequel of Doom 2016. This game has also very pleasant A.I improvement especially in Nightmare Difficulty all the enemy is least ""cheeky smart to piss you off"" mechanic kinda torture you like in dark soul but in more fast paced gameplay, also one feature of the A.I is The Marauder which gives a hard slap for casual feel of this game i got too say hes the innovation of this game hes the enemy without pattern we cant really easily read his action and a very good at social distancing, DOOM Eternal also has the best Performance for optimization with the beutiful-beutiful background and level in only 45 GB ,those are the best aspects of Doom Eternal.

CONS :
As Much i Like the Game this game has some problems such as performance issue which sometime made me get pissed eternally with some suddent stuterring, crashes and hang, Also this is fully on my opinion DOOM games never really felt deep in lore i got to say story of this game felt like stories in Godzilla franchise which is just full of exposition and sometime kinda dull but atleast itd already give very great experience to players to play this game.

97,74806404,english,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about DOOM Eternal compared to its predecessor, DOOM.
Pros: DOOM Eternal has a much better movement system and level design. You'll be zooming all over the map in seconds. Additionally, the Super Shotgun chain hook is amazing design.
Cons: DOOM Eternal really restricts your gameplay to how the developer wants you to play. You'll be forced to micromanage multiple resource bars as well as your ammo, and switch between all of your weapons constantly. Additionally, there were some enemies that were designed to be killed a certain way; run out of ammo for that weapon and you'll be stuck trying to fight them inefficiently and getting destroyed for it. In fact, on higher difficulties, the ammo cap is extremely insufficient; you'll spend a larger portion of your time running around looking for a random mook to chainsaw for ammo than actually fighting, and that's simply not a fun experience. In some levels, especially those with minibosses, you'll run out of ammo for all your weapons before killing them about five to six times; this means you have to run around and dodge looking for a mook, chainsaw, shoot, then run around again. The gameplay loop simply isn't fun.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend DOOM Eternal. It just isn't satisfying to play.",1598222807,1598222807,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False,76561198090509104,97,12,939,0,939,1593730439,,

I had to wait until after the latest patch in August to write this review since a bug would crash my game upon completion of a Slayer Gate. I finished the last 3 missions and the game, and they felt so much like a chore that writing this review was almost too much.

To keep it short, the team took DOOM 2016 and tried to make it ""faster"" - cramming you in small environments with too many weapons to use effectively all while zooming around like an asshole. Nothing about this game is polished; attacks often don't activate when they're supposed to (Blood Fist) while the platforming bits will result in you punching the wall instead of grabbing it and then falling to your death. In fact all the platforming bits in this game feel more like a crappy diversion than anything thought out or involving. 

Combat is alright, but having a dozen different weapons with different firing modes means you're switching through weapons as often as you're firing them, trying to find the right weapon for the right enemy. Then about halfway through the game a new enemy type is introduced that completely ruins any ""flow"" the developers thought they had. Couple tips: upgrade the Super Shotgun all the way first, and farm like 30 extra lives in the first couple levels. Then it wont be as annoying when the enemies box you into a corner and kill you over and over since you're out of ammo and the chainsaw can't kill heavy enemies. Don't worry, that only happened at least once in every single mission. 

All in all buy this when it's half off and don't pay a penny more. I loved DOOM 2016 and consider it one of the best shooters of all time. This is a disappointing sequel, one that feels like the developers sacrificed enjoyable game play and well-thought out levels in order for things to be ""faster"" - but instead feels cramped, unimaginative and repetitive.",1594171145,1598219811,False,1,0,0.474784761667251587,0,True,False,False,76561198210073287,135,3,2359,0,1586,1598139944,,

Basically, this game is wall-to-wall demon smashing.  Chainsaws, laser swords, rocket launchers, four barrelled machine guns, shoulder mounted combination flamethrower/grenade launchers, it has it all.  But it doesn't have it all *right away.*  The early game has you existing on much thinner margins than the late game, and simple mistakes (like putting 4 rounds into an Imp instead of 3) can be the difference between crushing an encounter and having to start over.

All that said, this game is great.  It's a Zdzisław Beksiński painting come to life.  Loud, angry, extremely violent life.  There's a ton more story and setpieces than the 2016 game, and (somehow) way more badassery.

[list]
[*] I hated the menu screens/interface. Not completely sure why, but the horrible, almost unreadable font certainly didn't help.
[*] The parkour and puzzle elements were not welcome. I play Doom to kill demons, not to think - the puzzles in particular introduced a weird pacing into the gameplay.
[*] The Marauder. What a load of bullshit. I get the need to introduce greater variation in the enemies, including tougher enemies, but this is taking it too far. That thing NEEDS to be adjusted somehow, it completely messes with the pacing of the game.
[*] Also way too many progression paths and buttons to press. This should also have been toned down.

Despite all this, I had fun playing it. Getting into the game took way longer than it had any rights doing, but it ended up being ok fun and entertaining. Whatever, maybe I'm just an old fart :)

TL:DR, there's too many things going on, but if you can live with that and stick with it, there's a good game underneath.

19,74796050,english,"Its been said enough but this is one of the best fps games I'v ever played. lets go over what makes this game so fun.

1.  The combat in this game stays fresh even after 200 hours of game play. The feeling of melting even the strongest of demons with bone crunching combos as you whirl around shoot in every direction is amazing. 

Each of the guns has its own feel: the super shot gun lets you stun bigger demons and shred though fodder like a crucible though a tyrant, the lock on mod for the rocket launcher can kill most heavy demons with only one charge and do massive damage to super heavies, lets not forget the sheer rush we get when sniping a drone from across the map with the ballista or the combat rifle.
 
2. the movement in this game compliments the combat perfectly, this is one of the things that keeps me coming back. Its hard not to fall in love in this game while you're flying though the air raining down bullet and explosive like and angel of death. Its a good thing the movement feels so good because you won't be standing still at all if you're playing the game right. You'll be dodging though claws and fireballs and you launch out your own attacks as the demons hopelessly try to catch you. 

3. The replay value is amazing, even though you'll just be playing the same levels over again each fight feel new. You'll be moving in all different directions learning how to better use your weapons and your skill level keeps rising. another thing is how good it feels when you get good. Its very cathartic when you go from getting killed by the same one mancubus to slaughtering 4 at a time while flying though the air sniping arachnotron turrets. 

Though my one major gripe with this game is the terrible lock on. More often then not when you're going for that one chainsaw, blood punch, or meat hook grapple. there is about a 10% chance the lock on won't trigger. 

Over all a really good game that is very much worth time to play and get good at. Are there bugs in this game and can it cause rage? YES it very much can but what game dose not?

- You hunt for Ammo / Health / Armor by glory-killing and chainsawing you way through the 
   low level enemies. Even more than in 2016

- Jump and Run mechanics with some puzzle events give you a refreshing gameplay.
 
- You need to learn the new weakspots and Weapon abilities that id created.

- Heavy Story/Lore focus 

- If you dont learn how to quickswitch you will fail in high difficulty

If you dont want to have a DOOM game that is focused around Story, Jump and Run sections and learning your Enemy then its not your Game. In that case i would reccommend DOOM 2016 for its simple and brutal Gameplay.
 But if you want to play a Doom-Game where you need Skill and have to invest time to master it then buy it. Story completion time is about 30h. If you want it to be 100% then u have to put multiple 50h into it. One of the best Singleplayer FPS Games ever created = 9/10

A game that doesn't fully come together until a fair bit in and until that point is an exercise in frustration.

With the constant battering the game takes from the bipolar community who cant decide if its love or hate with every decision the developers make post launch, that perfectly reflects the game. sometimes highs sometimes lows.

42,74774700,english,"My first few hours in the game brought a lot of frustration. The flow of the game was different than DOOM 2016, melee attacks dealt no damage and a bunch of new mechanics were being thrown in my face. However once I got used to the way things work now, I found myself having a lot of fun. The constant juggling of health,armor and ammunition while trying to stay mobile and slay demons keeps you on your toes and provides immense satisfaction. 

The enemy design is phenomenal both artistic and mechanic-wise. The demons' designs convey their intents and fighting style successfully while also being pleasing to the eye and fitting the game's atmosphere. Returning enemies from DOOM 2016 have been slightly redesigned (can't call this bad or good as it depends on taste but it was a welcome change) and pre-2016 veterans and fresh newcomers make up a seamless opposition ready to be ripped and torn. Contrary to the previous installment, each demon requires a different approach and forces the player to get out of their comfort zone and use their entire arsenal instead of just relying on their favourite weapon.

Again stepping on the predecessors's flaws, DOOM Eternal takes the personal upgrade system and works on it. Weapon mods are now more meaningful as they can change drastically how the weapon plays against certain demons and personal upgrades feel a bit more impactful.

Having the heart of a classic DOOM game, the theatrical evisceration Eternal provides wouldn't be complete without a proper stage to be performed on. The levels feel more grandiose now, taking the slayer to a variety of locations. Design-wise they take advantage of the Slayer's newfound mobility, adding some rather controversial platforming segments and introducing verticality to the arenas. While some can find the parkour segments of the game tedious, I thought they were a welcome break outside of combat and added some extra complexity in the heat of battle.

There seems to be a greater focus on story this time. In addition to the logs you find about the world and the demons, there's also an increase in cutscenes and character dialogue compared to DOOM 2016. Nothing to go crazy about, but a nice addition.

Unfortunately with all the good the game has, some bad things come in its performance. While having the recommended specs, I find myself unable to get to the main menu at times (fortunately restarting the game seems to solve this). There's also the occasional stutter here and the weird demon behaviour there. However, these setbacks are not enough to ruin the experience, although I don't know how it would perform on lower-end PCs.

All in all, while alienating at first, the game forces you to adapt and combines the brutal violence the series is known for with a much needed tactical approach, resulting in a delightful explosion of blood and guts and a satisfactory loop of completing an encounter and preparing for the next one.

63,74754257,english,"To preface, I wish I could review this as ""Neutral"" or ""Undecided.""
If you enjoyed the first DOOM, you may enjoy this one as well.  I stress: ""may.""  I don't think I need to sell the positives of this game, all the action and gore of the first game can be found in its sequel, so I'll highlight the differences that could be negatives to some.
The vibe of the game is entirely different to the first game, which I'm not entirely a fan of.  The story of the first game was very driven; you were traversing Mars and Hell to complete concrete goals, and your many fights were simply obstacles to tear through.  In the sequel, you begin after a large time skip, traversing large, disconnected locations to kill priests and stop the invasion of Earth.  This scenario, along with the gameplay changes, make the story feel irrelevant.  I feel completely disconnected from whatever objectives I'm supposed to be completing, I don't feel invested beyond ""shoot and collect until the stage ends.""

The mentioned gameplay changes are my bigger gripe with the sequel.  In the first game, much in line with the objective-centric story, you collect weapons along the way to aid your progression.  With a wide arsenal, and a weak pistol to fall back on, your weapons were tools; you can largely use what weapons you will, and while some weapons were far more effective versus specific enemies, you could largely neglect some weapons if you didn't care for them.  While you may have run short on ammo near the beginning of the game, as long as you didn't neglect upgrading your ammo count, you probably had a decent amount of breathing room.  None of this is applicable to DOOM Eternal.  The sequel heavy-handedly adopts an arcade-esque playstyle.  While you have an even more versatile kit, the game demands that you use all of it.  You will frequently run short on ammo, forcing you to chainsaw enemies.  The new flame belch weapon allows you to acquire armor from enemies; with more plentiful encounters, and more deadly foes, this too is mandatory.  You earn a dash early on for greater mobility.  Where dash in the first game would have felt very liberating, the enemies in this sequel are far more aggressive, and once again you must use your new tool or die.

Combined, these two factors make DOOM Eternal feel very different from the first game.  In DOOM, I felt like I was exploring proper facilities or messy hellscape, rip-and-tearing whatever tried to oppose me.  I felt powerful, and the story was dense enough to feel meaningful.  In Eternal, the stages are larger, and the space between any story is as well.  Because of the more demanding and limiting combat, I no longer feel accomplished in battle.  With the game demanding you to perform certain functions just in order to survive, even my best of fights don't feel rewarding.  I don't enjoy any feeling of prowess, just an appreciation that I didn't expend too many resources.  Many levels feel like they're just room after room of fights, plus the mandatory collectables.

Again, I didn't include the positives as they are largely the same as the first game, which I am assuming the vast majority would have played prior to Eternal;.  While I favor the first game, DOOM Eternal is still very good, it's just not what I was expecting out of the sequel.  If you have any interest following DOOM, I'd recommend trying Eternal, but if you have not played the first game, you should definitely play DOOM first.",1598145007,1598145007,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198148214188,174,14,399,0,257,1600386179,,

tl;dr: Worth the price for the Campaign. Multiplayer is a joke. 

DOOM: Eternal's Singleplayer campaign is crazy fun. I loved every minute of it. It can get overwhelmingly hard at times, but that just makes it all the more enjoyable once you've reached the end.

I haven't played the multiplayer all that much, but from what I have played, it's woefully dull compared to 2016's multiplayer, which frankly wasn't all that good either. Then, there is all the ""lowest common denominator"" bullcrap all too common in games like Fortnite. The stupid timed events only serve as a glaringly obvious attempt to appeal to the masses by adding flashy, childish and irrelevant content. Does anyone really want to go around shooting a mancubus dressed like Elvis? That's the multiplayer in a nutshell. Also, the decision to not include some form of Deathmatch in a DOOM game is asinine, and I will be knocking a point off for that reason alone.*

69,74752711,english,"There was sooooo much hype surrounding this game. I'm incredibly disappointed. I wasn't expecting a copy of Doom 2016... But anyone who would even consider comparing this shitty arcade game to that masterpiece should be embarrassed. This would have been mind-blowing... On the original Xbox. Also, it honestly feels like work instead of fun. 0/10 would play again.

2016 was hard from the beginning too... But literally from the first, it was FUN. And I get that it's meant to be played a certain way, blah blah blah - it just feels like they went out of their way to make it impossible to play the game any OTHER way, aside from the specific, narrow, and repetitive one that they have in mind. This should be shameful for modern game developers - and is one of the bigger things that makes the game un-enjoyable. Give me more than one way to play, wtf - and fuck everyone who only ever used the super shotgun in 2016, leading the devs to think this would be a good idea.

Every death in 2016 felt excruciating but fair. Not one ever felt like a cheap death. In Eternal... It's unique NOT to get a ""cheap"" death, even ""playing how it's meant to be played"". Apologists will say this is part of the ""learning curve"", but I've probably been playing Doom since before a lot of them were born, lol. 

After 2016, I wasn't expecting a copy, but I was at LEAST hoping for another immersive experience. This truly and honestly feels like an arcade game, whereas 2016 felt like a legitimate, fully-developed, in-depth modern title. There is no immersion at all, the environments and game itself are cartooney, and nothing happening in front of me feels ""natural"", if that makes any sense. Also, I don't need to see a f---ing cutscene of a door opening, wtf!

The expanded story just feels forced; 2016 told a better story with seemingly 100% less material. Idk why these guys felt the need to fix what wasn't broken... But in doing so, they somehow turned the f-ing DOOM story into some weird ""fantasy tale"" and bolted it onto an action game. And the story itself is a huge disappointment, big step down from the how and what of the 2016 story.

I actually 100% agree with how much parkour is in this game; it makes sense considering the scale of the cliche-looking cartoon world pulled from 1998 that we're traversing. But from how much other forced bs I've seen in this game, I won't be surprised to see extra platforming be forced into gameplay later (as other reviews have mentioned). Also, environment objects are inconsistent - when am I gonna be able to ledge-grab, and when am I not? Who knows! More cheap deaths.

Or maybe I'll learn my lesson from these initial few stages and just stay away from the rest of this giant step backwards after the 2016 masterpiece.",1598142216,1598143776,False,0,0,0.474219709634780884,0,True,False,False,76561199015284068,15,2,477,318,72,1602080367,,

DOOM Eternal surpasses fast-paced. It's lightning-paced.

When you begin, you will constantly be starved out of ammo and often times health. They game tries its best to adjust the new pace to the player, yet sometimes it still takes longer than necessary. New mechanics are dropped on you within minutes and it can get overwhelming.

But...within a few missions, I started to adjust. Because once you begin getting upgrades, the game becomes way more smoothly with battles getting utterly dominated by the player. At times it becomes an exhilarating power fantasy. Even more so when you replay missions with unlocked cheats. Definitely some of the more fun unlocks you can get, along with records containing music from other id games and the little figurines of every enemy in the game.

Graphics

The game is absolutely full of eye candy much like Doom 2016 but better. The environments are glorious. I found myself excited to get into each level to explore them and take it all in. Art direction is top notch and there is a very nice variation of themes in the levels. It's like Doom 2016 but everything looks a little better. Monsters have mostly been redesigned to resemble Doom and Doom 2's designs which as a long time fan I absolutely LOVE. My beloved Plasma Rifle has also had this treatment which I also love. Doom Eternal is wonderfully optimised, I have locked 60fps no matter how much absolute chaos is on screen and there is a LOT of that haha.

Sound

Not too much to say, like Doom 2016 in many ways which is to say brilliant. There's so many different sounds, monsters roaring, all manner of different weapons and explosions happening at once and yet you can discern it all, weapons are very punchy with brilliant bass usage. The music has had criticism from other players but I don't get that at all. I find the soundtrack is fantastic, crunching heavy rock riffs that get my blood pumping and some techno elements, it all fits well making every encounter seem epic. Which they are.

Gameplay

What can I say... I am dumbfounded by the quality of this games gunplay and balancing. Doom 2016 obviously brought us a new take on the classic Doom run and gun. Combat flowed brilliantly with all kinds of synergies between weapons and secondaries that led to some of the most fun combat in FPS history.

Doom Eternal refines this and distils it into what I can describe as chaotic perfection.

The synergy between your abilities, weapons, weapon secondaries, runes etc. work together in perfect harmony if you know what you're doing. Tactically utilising your flamer to get armour (or your upgraded Super Shotgun, what a game changer that is!), glory killing or blood punching for health (or using freeze grenade with right upgrades) and chainsaw for collecting ammo. Whilst your running around getting attacked by huge waves of demons it is extraordinarily satisfying to pull off your different techniques and utilise different weapons as needed. The game makes all of the weapons useful, and due to ammo constraints (which I will say are NOWAY near as bad as people make out, you can always get ammo if you play correctly), you have to switch quite often on the fly, certain enemies require certain guns and it just makes you feel....amazing as you rip and tear using all the arsenal available to you. I am blown away with how well made this game is and just how delightfully fun it is.

Another worthwhile mention is the Doom Fortress. You return here after each mission and you can unlock power ups here as well as practice with your guns, and take a breather before entering the next stage. Important when you've had a heart rate of 200 for the last hour xD

Story

It's good! There's actually a decent amount of exposition and lore for a Doom game, something I have always wanted a bit more of ever since reading the Doom 1993 manual back in the day. It isn't intrusive or slow, but it's enough to heighten your interest in what's happening. The codex is also great.

Not quite, but that doesn't mean it isn't an incredible game

Short version: The new mechanics and increased difficulty caused by them does damnpen your feeling of being an indestructable god. But if you endure and adapt, you'll find plenty of carnage to unleash in the campaign!

However the servers are simply innexcusably poor; you lose connection constantly even with the numerous workarounds so multiplayer often is impossible.

Long Version:
Looks incredible with detailed and well designed environments

The Maps are fun to explore with plenty of unique battle grounds

The gameplay is where the issue is. The new options in combat add a layer of complexity to the previous games run-n-gun play, which can be very off putting to begin with. They work very well however once you get used to them.

Worst of all is the Marauder, the recurring mini-boss. Unless you cheese it by rockets to the feet or detonated mid air it requires stunning reaction times. It often pops up in the game and ruins perfectly good set pieces and you learn not to treat it as a priority target but instead as a chore.

Worser still is Bethesdas' servers. You will disconnect constantly even with the best internet in the world which means the multiplayer is often just unplayable even with various workarounds including fiddling with your router access.

All in all excusing the server issues and party pooper marauder, I recommend Doom Eternal as a challenging and visceral sequal to Doom 2016 due to plenty of content and great combat.

91,65492329,english,"I originally wrote a positive review for Doom Eternal, having played 18 hours, after which point I had gotten to grips with the new mechanics.

Fast forward a lot more hours, and I am starting to dislike this game more and more.  Here is a short and very brief list of everything that I dislike about the game:

-  The dodge dashing allows for far too much movement, especially when you are in the air.  You can just dodge dash and double jump around the map, essentially kiting the demons behind you (unless the arena is small, and many of them are).  This means you spend more time running than you do gunning, especially on the harder difficulties.

-  The boss fights are trash compared to Doom 2016.  Not a single boss fight is an enjoyable experience.  The only one that is remotely enjoyable is the Doom Hunter, and that becomes a standard mob in the later levels.  The Gladiator is a boring fight, and the final boss, the Icon of Sin, is even worse.

-  The resource management is not necessary in the slightest in the single player mode.  I suspect that the devs were more interested in their PvP Battle Mode for the sake of eSports, that they shoehorned the same mechanics into the single player game (and this also applies to the double dash mechanic).  As a result, Doom 2016 is a far more enjoyable game to play, because you are not forced to lock into Glory Kill/Chainsaw animations as often.

-  The extra life mechanic feels like papering over the cracks.  When you play on Nightmare difficulty, you can die really easily, but what makes it worse, is that you can corner and body block yourself if your dash leaves you stuck in a corner.  This can result in a Hell Knight leaping at you (or a group of Imps), cornering you, and preventing you from escaping until you kill them.  To me, it feels like the devs added extra lives to the game, to compensate for the amount of times you die to their new mechanics, and rather than find a solid solution, they took the easy option, and then tried to sell it to the public as an innovative mechanic.  It isn't, it is just a crutch.

-  The story is very mediocre.  One of the bigger complaints regarding Doom 2016 was the lack of colour, given that it was set on Mars.  So the devs have created more colourful environments, at the expense of a decent plot.  You now have a fortress in space, that you teleport back to at the end of every mission.  This means you often have to visit different planets, and all to service an incredibly boring story (three Hell Priests are leading the invasion of Earth, kill all three and the invasion ends zzzzzzzz).  So you need to find locating devices to find them, and then you need to get a sword to kill a Titan etc, and it is all really boring and just an excuse to push you through a variety of different looking areas.  I liked the first game and the feeling that you start at one end of the facility, and work your way through until the end (with the occasional trip to Hell).  All in all, it just isn't as enjoyable (with the exception of a couple of levels).

-  The PvP mode has potential, but the training mode is extremely limited, and the actual matches leave very little room to actually learn as you play.  My first experience of it, I was playing as the Slayer, and got matched with a pair of Demons who were decent, but not great.  They beat me every match, but I started to improve to the point where I was winning rounds, and giving them a good run.  Sadly though, they left after 4-5 matches.  Then in my next match, despite being green as grass, I was matched against a pair of Demons who were 250+, and incredibly good and co-ordinated.  They wrecked me easily in every match we played (probably around 3), and I eventually quit, because I was dying too quickly to learn anything.  And when I queued again, I got matched against the same guys again.  As it turns out, they are actually very high level/pro players, and I was a complete noob.  So basically, the matchmaking is non-existent, which is probably why so few people are playing the PvP.

So yeah, I am giving this a thumbs down.  It just isn't as enjoyable an FPS as Doom 2016 is.  It feels like a game where the PvP was the priority, and the new mechanics were shoehorned into the single player mode (including the extremely boring platforming elements, to justify the new mobility).  

Ultimately, I would say, if you don't own the game already, buy it on sale.  It isn't worth the full asking price, and Doom 2016 is (in my opinion) a far superior FPS, and you can buy that very cheaply these days.

1,74741424,english,"While not as good as Doom 2016, Eternal is still a fun game.

Doom 2016 I was not able to put down once I started playing. Eternal on the other hand takes a while before it starts to pull you in, and for the first two thirds of the game I didn't really feel like playing more than a mission a day. The final couple of missions however were very chaotic and fun, and reminded me more of the 2016 game.

The main problem is that things get a bit too complicated. You have to manage your ammo, certain enemies are only weak to certain weapons, there is more platforming involved, two types of grenades, a fire-thrower to refill armor, a powerful Blood Punch... I prefer the more run and gun style of the Doom 2016 over the more complicated (and harder) playstyle of Doom Eternal.

Some things like the grapple hook felt a bit like a pointless gimmick, however the Blood Punch (which is a powerful punch that one shots weak demons and deals a decent amount of damage to heavy ones) was a nice addition.

I don't think a lot of people play Doom for the multiplayer, which is good, because the Doom Eternal multiplayer is pure garbage. I actually enjoyed the Doom 2016 multiplayer, it just had too few players and too many cheaters. The Eternal multiplayer however, which is 1 Doomslayer vs 2 demons, is not fun. If the demons work well together, they almost always win. If they don't, the Doomslayer almost always wins. So if you plan to play solo then play as the Doomslayer and hope that you don't get matched up against a pair of demons on teamspeak.

Doom Eternal is a fun FPS game - just not as fun as its prequel. However, it's harder and more complicated, which I'm sure a lot of people will see as a good thing.

22,73963617,english,"Amazing game.  Campaign [b]10/10[/b].  Multiplayer [b]7/10[/b].

Doom Eternal does what any great sequel should do; keeps everything great about the original and expands on it further with new content and mechanics.
For context, I played through Doom Eternal on Nightmare difficulty, and I’ll start by saying, the Slayer Gates, and many of the encounters throughout the game, gave me such an adrenaline rush after beating them that my hands would be shaking for 15 minutes afterwards.


[h1]Pros:[/h1]

[b]Movement and Abilities[/b]
The gameplay is fluid and in-depth, it balances platforming and arena FPS mechanics perfectly.  There are a lot of abilities to get the hang of, frag grenades, ice bomb, flame belch, glory kills, blood punching, crucible, weapon mods, weapon upgrades, runes, dashing, double jumping, jump-pads, teleporters, and monkey bar flips, but once you do master it, you feel like a badass.  For a casual gamer, this might be overwhelming, rather than a positive.

[b]Weapons[/b]
[list]
[*]All the weapons are useful and satisfying as well as most of the weapon mods.  I found myself favouring each weapon surprisingly equally.
[*]Weapons are able to be swapped quickly, allowing for some incredibly potent combos.
[*]Glory Kills feel amazing, ripping and tearing from one demon to another, and with the new Blood Punch mechanic, you can now straight up gib several enemies in one punch (Saitama approves).
[/list]

[b]Enemies[/b]
[list]
[*]Returning enemies and the new enemy additions are all fantastic, with each having unique mechanics, models, sound, and movement.
[*]The new weak point mechanic brings a whole new tactical element to disabling certain demons that is satisfying and rewards aim.
[*]Empowered demons are a cool way of bringing a soft multiplayer element.
[*]Every enemy can be defeated in multiple ways.  I never felt locked in to any one strategy, so combat felt very instinctual, doing whatever seemed the best in the moment.
[/list]

[b]Puzzles and Secrets[/b]
Even for someone like myself with limited patience for puzzles I managed to solve nearly all the main progression puzzles quickly and by myself.  As for collectibles and progression items, Doom Eternal incorporates them perfectly into gameplay.  Most only involve a simple puzzle in the same area they’re found (rarely any backtracking).  Best of all, is once you explore close to the area of a collectible it will become visible as a ‘?’ on the handy 3D map.  Lastly, once you near the end of a level you unlock the ability to fast travel to any section of the map.

[b]Graphics[/b]
You get several fleshed out and vastly different environments in Doom Eternal, Sentinel cityscapes, Hell Growth, Mars, Hell, and Makyr environments.  From a design perspective it’s almost unbelievable how many varied, optimised, quality assets they must have created for this game.  Throughout all the environments there are tons of easter eggs as well, and references to other Doom games (like the enemies infighting in the windows of the skyscrapers).

[b]Sound[/b]
The soundtrack is incredible as always and a large source of the adrenaline fuel.  I loved the build-up for the Doom Hunter, and the angelic but dissonant music for Urdak.  Sound effects and voice acting are all AAA quality as well, I never found myself lacking audio cues to understand what was going on during all the action.

[b]Story[/b]
The inclusion of more story and lore was, personally, very welcome, especially the Makyrs.  Doom Eternal kept the stoic, badass nature of the Doom Slayer intact while still fleshing out his backstory and the Doom universe’s backstory.  It has opened the gates for more story driven future Doom games.  It’s worth noting though that a lot of the lore and backstory is introduced through lengthy text, so if you’re not a fan of reading this might be annoying.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
Battlemode is a 3-player mode with 2 buffed up demons up against a Slayer in a best of 3.  For the most part I've enjoyed the Battlemode multiplayer, when the matches are even it gives me the same adrenaline rushes that I found in the campaign.  To top it off, games have only taken 1-3 minutes to find and I’ve had very few problems with latency (from Australia).


[h1]Cons[/h1]

[b]Gameplay[/b]
[list]
[*]Blood Punching uses the same button as Glory Kills, so it's really easy to waste your Blood Punch on a preempted Glory Kill.  Also, you can still punch as a regular melee attack, but weirdly it does next to no damage at all, I would rather only be able to melee when Blood Punch is full than have Doom Guy feel weak.
[*]I would prefer if Glory Kills slowed time for enemies to prevent them from crowding the player while they're locked in the animation.
[*]The weapon point system is okay, but a lot of the weapon point upgrades (upgrades for the weapon mods) felt insignificant, and others felt more like the weapons were pre-nerfed and the upgrades then make the weapon mods usable rather than feel extra powerful (e.g. Mobile Turret or Arbalest mobility upgrades).  Not to mention this system adds to the already large list of RPG mechanics the player needs to learn.
[/list]

[b]Enemies[/b]
Marauders (despite how cool they are) and Buff Demons (from Buff Totems or Archvile Summons) are too “in your face”, I feel as if they needed to be toned down.

[b]Boss Battles[/b]
The final boss battle, [spoiler]the Icon of Sin[/spoiler], was more tedious than fun with hp sponge mechanics and annoying attacks, which are made harder to keep track of because of the enemy spam.  The [spoiler]Gladiator[/spoiler] boss battle was okay, but some of its attacks were a little strange for a brawler, especially the one where he’s trying to play jump-rope with Doomguy (you’ll understand when you see it).  The non-unique boss battles though were great, especially the Doom Hunter.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
[list]
[*]With all the mobility, weapons, and combos I have access to as the Slayer the games tend to feel very unfair for the demons.  The demons also have the added complexity of being a duo, which is harder to coordinate than simply being the Slayer.  However, that said, I have run into demons that have completely wrecked me.
[*]The demon resurrection mechanic encourages running and hiding as a strategy after one demon dies, which doesn’t feel very demon-like.
[*]Even though there’s a demon tutorial, there’s still a lot to get the hang of, and those initial games can be rough against Slayers who have had the entire campaign to practice.
[/list]

[b]Bugs[/b] (as of July 2020)
Each bug required a restart from the most recent checkpoint.
[list]
[*][i]Invincible demons[/i]: Sometimes if you fail to outright kill, or glory kill, a staggered demon they will recover and become invincible.  I encountered this 4 times, and that was while trying to kill every staggered enemy to avoid the bug.
[*][i]Slayer Gate crashes[/i]: Can occur after completing a Slayer Gate, which is when you REALLY don’t want a crash to happen.  Happened to me twice, the first time it didn’t auto-save, the second time it did manage to auto-save.
[*][i]Unclearable encounters[/i]: Defeating all enemies in an encounter, yet it won’t be marked as completed.  Happened to me once.
[/list]
Hopefully, in time, these bugs will be patched (Covid may have slowed this process down).

You just take some damage and return to where you fell off. I don't really understand the point of having the basic melee punch. It does next to no damage, so little. I guess you need it for punching walls and such but eh... Could've given it a tad more dmg. This game is a bit more hectic and challenging compared to DOOM (2016). You need to manage your resources. I like the platforming too, I've always liked platformers so it's nice to see some more platforming in an FPS game. Eternal runs very well, it's well optimised. I'm playing at 1080p on Ultra Nightmare gfx (except water quality which is on Nightmare) at 100 FOV. It runs smoothly, 100-170 FPS most of the time with occasional dips down to <100 FPS. I've encountered some crashes which is a shame. Once after completing a slayer gate and once all of a sudden during a level.

Great OST, perhaps even better than DOOM 2016's. I just wish it came to Spotify :/. I hope they add some multiplayer modes as there's only battlemode and they also left out SnapMap which was cool in DOOM 2016. But they did make just about enough improvements and additions to the campaign to make up for the lost features. I love the attention to detail. You can collect vinyl records and spot Doomguy's rabbit ""Daisy"" in each level, there's lots of references to pop culture (music, literature, etc.). This game is addictive and makes me smile :).

TL:DR It's a fun game for people that like fast paced shooters but they lost a lot of what made Doom 2016 great.

OK, lets starts with pros and cons:

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*]Enemy weak points
[*]Fast paced action sequences
[*]Beautiful scenery and backdrops
[*]Variety of enemies
[*]Skins that showed during gameplay
[*]Expanded story line
[*]They brought back the Tyrant
[*]Sound design
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*]Lack of atmosphere
[*]Hand holding (Weak points, Runes, Mastery)
[*]Shoehorned plot points
[*]Platforming
[*]Overwhelming enemies
[*]Extra lives
[*]Overuse of flesh
[/list]

Let me start by saying this review applies just to the campaign and it may change after the DLC is released. 

There was a defining moment in Doom 2016 where I had to stop playing because of a very visceral reaction I had to the environment. I was walking on guts and became nauseous. I knew then they nailed the ambiance of the game. Doom E tries this but there are a couple things that ruin the flow and take the player out of the Hellscape. 

A few things I liked while playing that made me say ""that's cool"" were the enemy weak points, backround scenery, interactive environments, and skins that showed up during gory kills/cut scenes. The fast paced combat with periods of rest between reminded me of the feels I got playing Halo CE for the first time. All of this made for engaging gameplay that made my palms sweaty. I enjoyed it until I started noticing the little things that broke the aesthetic of the game.

Every time a new enemy appears a pop-up appears telling you its weak points and how to kill it. Early on it breaks the flow (cause it's a pop-up) and later it breaks flow again cause you're focusing on trying to kill something according to developer design. Some may appreciate this but I felt it takes away from the 'jump in and shoot it til it dies' mentality.

Skull switch shrines were metal. in D2016 there was a sense that a body had been destroyed and the skull made to be that switch. The imagery of it being encased in bones means hell didn't waste any part of the body. A metal skull shrine might as well be a light switch.

There's flesh everywhere and it gets boring quick. Its just piles of flesh, not bodies, just mounds of flesh. If there are no human remains there's no sense there was a human population being massacred. The first game nailed this by putting ribcages, femurs, spinal cords, and other body parts in the flesh shrines scattered throughout the UAC. Also in D2016 you had to rib off limbs for fingerprint ID door scans and use a dead guys face for retinal ID. 

I could go on but all these little things take away from the sense of a real catastrophe that the slayer is fighting against. Doom 2016 was up there with the original Bioshock in they both nailed that environment/gameplay/story/lore balance. Both of those games made me not want to put the controller down. I had high hopes that this game would do the same but in the end I was just playing to get through it and not really enjoying the game. 

P.S. You can get a sense of what I mean by simply watching the credits of both Doom games and asking yourself how each one feels.

If you are an experienced FPS player you WILL absolutely love the way Doom Eternal plays on the highest difficulty. Once you learn how to use each weapon on each demon and understand a few key mechanics such as quickswitching to avoid cooldowns and keeping movement going nothing will be able to stop you.

The game rewards players for taking risks by getting in close with demons to replenish ammo, health and armour. It does this by introducing new combat and movement mechanics to raise the skill-ceiling on top of the already stellar Doom (2016). The dash is a much appreciated mechanic increasing the pacing of the game and allowing players to traverse the arenas in a much more interesting way. Getting in close with the shotgun and dashing out again, flame belching and nading on a group of small fodder replenishing armour etc. It also introduces weak points on enemies rewarding players for using specific weapons against certain demons, decreasing TTK and allowing you to kill more demons faster.

The ""bloat"" of a man cave, wothless XP system for unlocking stuff for a multi player I will never touch just irritated me. What also irritated me was the infamous Marauder. A very overtuned enemy I think they designed soley to flirt with the elitist ""git gud"" minority.

Did I feel euphoric when I finally beat him? Not in the slightest, I was just annoyed. I do not enjoy sadistic difficlty spikes, even if it fits the theme of batteling hell itself.

The multi-player part, I can't comment on, as for me it's been completely broken since release - I could not connect to any matches, matchmaking kept hanging indefinitely, and the like.
I should specify here, I use Linux as my main operating system, and I don't dual-boot, thus I can't say how much of that is due to my OS of choice, and how much of that is multi-player being broken. If you're looking at titles to play with others, there are likely better titles out there, but I personally didn't lament it that much; my interest was strictly in single-player portion.

A word of caution:

With Update 1, id Software has snuck an invasive kernel-level anti-cheat into the game, but has done so in such manner that none of the Linux users were able to access the game at all - not just the multiplayer component, but [b]anything[/b].
Update 1.1 has removed the anti-cheat following feedback, but keep in mind it [i]might[/i] happen again, and if you've non-standard machine, or play on Linux, or if you just don't want invasive software with unlimited permissions snooping on your system, you might not be able to play the game any more.

DOOM Eternal is the best game I've ever played. Period. It's the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. Ever. It's a game that you immediately want to pick up and play again right after you stop playing. Everything is just right. The gameplay is fluid. The graphics are quite possibly the best video game graphics to date. The soundtrack is outstanding. The story is captivating. And then, there's the combat... The combat is brutal, relentless, intense, tough, challenging, and uncompromising, but never unfair. If there's a particular combat encounter you're struggling with, you always know what you're doing wrong, and what you have to do to achieve victory instead.

There's also something deeply satisfying about DOOM Eternal's retro, old-school, and manly presentation. Mick Gordon's heavy metal soundtrack is essential. Sound effects like audio prompts, equipment/chainsaw, powerups, and glory kills, etc. are all top-notch and sound crisp and punchy with a strong sense of machismo. I personally love the ""low ammo"" prompt sound while firing the rocket launcher, ballista, or super shotgun. The weapons look great and have this satisfying mechanical/manual feel and sound to them. From over the top glory kills, gorgeous hellscapes, a self-aware story that never takes itself too seriously, to collectibles such as toy figurines, floppy disk cheat codes, and vinyl LPs of past id Software soundtracks, this game is an absolute joy to behold and experience.

DOOM Eternal is a game that genuinely respects your skill as a player, but expects it from you in return. It constantly challenges you to become a better player. It is intuitive enough to adapt to your personal playstyle while you master all the mechanics. Basically, DOOM Eternal gives you all the tools to feel like the ultimate badass, but puts you to the test to become one.

id Software went all-in with the DOOM 2016 formula by further improving all aspects of what was an already stellar FPS experience. DOOM 2016 was intense, but DOOM Eternal is on another level of intense. The result is a game that is bigger, better, faster, and stronger than its predecessor, making DOOM Eternal one of the best, if not the best, FPS game. This game is pure gold. It sets a new standard for the FPS genre that few titles may ever dream of reaching. A masterpiece in every sense of the word and a must-play for any gamer.

13,65417219,english,"DOOM Eternal is quite literally the best single player FPS to date (coming from a long time Halo fan). It's much faster paced than 2016, and much more challenging (but for the better).

+ The game is best played on nightmare, and many of the new additions spice up the combat enough to make the game highly re-playable.

+ There's no micro-transaction BS, you're getting a complete game. 

+ The game will kick your a** at first, but provided you persevere and master the combat loop, the game becomes much more manageable. There is a high skill ceiling which is often lacking in other shooter campaigns!

+ Level design is great, and there's plenty of hidden secrets to find.

+ Plenty of extra side missions to do, namely the secret encounters and slayer gates. The slayer gates will make your heart pound like crazy!

+ All the weapons are better than ever, and they all have a purpose (which was a key issue in 2016, as once you picked up the bigger guns, there wasn't much incentive to use the starting weapons again.

+ The soundtrack is f***ing amazing! It's a shame Mick Gordon wont be returning as he has composed some of the best tracks for both DOOM 2016 and Eternal. I can't imagine how the next game will cope without Mick as the composer.

+ Battlemode is fun and very intense, although it's not for everyone.

Most of the negativity comes from people who don't want an engaging combat system and are content with just a generic mindless system (as is the case with the COD stories). The complaints about the marauder and some other demons being too hard are baffling, as the game literally tells you how to defeat them!

The reduced ammo count and the enemy weak-points system forces the player to better manage their resources and learn to weapon/ mod switch on the fly. Quick decision making/ reflexes on the higher difficulties is important. Some hate the changes, and prefer to just spam the super shotgun throughout the entire game (like in 2016), however these changes make the game much more engaging, which sets the game apart from others in the genre. Instead of learning to play, some just jump to the typical (this doesn't feel like a DOOM game) train, when in fact they are simply bad and want to blame the game instead of accepting they just need to get better!

- A few minor bugs here and there, but not experienced anything game breaking.

- Blood punch can be inconsistent, which can get you killed quickly as some of the tankier demons punish you in mere milliseconds!

24,74640403,english,"I've been wondering how to phrase this to properly express my experience with Doom Eternal. On one hand it's basically an okay game, with some great visuals, great soundtrack, fine selection of glory kills and the gory, bloody, pinnicle to the pit atmosphere that we all know and love. The carving out of the revamped Doom univers is also interresting, albeit a bit overly convoluted. Hell is bad, earth is bad and heaven... is also bad? 

However, there are so many details that made my journey through this game more annoying and aggitating than entertaining and enjoyable. Most important of all: WHY AM I STARVING FOR AMMO ALL THE TIME!?
I found myself low or out of ammo on most guns after most encounters of larger groups. I am aware that the chainsaw is there for the low ammo situations but for some reason Doom (2016) balanced the amount of ammo and the need for the chainsaw perfectly, never leaving me with the feeling of truly running out. In Doom Eternal I did actually run out of ammo, several times especially during the early stages, where I would be down to nothing but the chainsaw. Now in theory this is probably how it was meant to be but while the game is ment to be fast paced and you should constantly be moving, it should be because you are actually running away from the demons trying desperately to find a scrap of ammo or some chainsaw fuel. This took a lot of the fun out of the encounters I had enjoyed so very much in Doom (2016). Despite constantly dashing and double jumping I was constantly being hit, dropping my hp and armor so low that it forced me to get into a glory kill to save my life, which did give me some health back but also sent another barrage of hits my way, dropping me low yet again, feeding the vicious cycle. It only add insult to injury that the team that designed the fighting areas do not seem to have communicated with the people designing the monsters and encounters, at all. Once you become fully upgraded, however, things do improve, slightly. 

I played though this game out of sheer spite in the end. I completed my run on the ""Hurt me plenty"" difficulty as I though it would be challenging enough to be entertaining but doable enough so I would have to waste too much time doing encounters over and over again. I like to game for the story and experience more so than the actually top shelf challenge. But this difficulty proved fitting at times and then just unbalanced at others. During an encounter I found myself boxed into a corner by a Cacodemon and another (think it was a hell knight plus some cannonfodder demons) and I was stuck there getting pounded into a bloody pulp. This happened only a few times but it was still enough to annoy me. I don't remember this happening in Doom (2016). As mentioned before that fact that you get hit all the time just seems weird. In the story they specifically mention that the slayer is faster than demons, so why I can not outrun the damage? I never expected to finish a fight without a scratch but this just seems broken. Especially the Hell Knight and their variants seem perticularly difficult to avoid taking damage from. 

The platforming elements of the game were generally fairly well done, with some minor non-sensical decisions made along the way. Wether this element fits into a Doom game is subjective, but apart from that, the platforming and ""base"" elements are fairly well done. 

Oh, before I forget: Fu*k the Marauders. These are some of the more challenging enemies in the game, but from my experience, this is more due to some weird design choices than actual difficulty. The range which triggeres the attack didn't seem consistant and most of the time it would shimmer from side to side, making targeting very tricky. The first one you meet is doable, since it's only that one with some feeder demons for health and ammo options, but later on you'll meet these bastards alongside other powerful demons, sometimes reducing your chances of winning the battle to random chance. These guys can corner you as well, so there's that. The Gladiator also seems to have some range anormalities, but maybe that one was just me. 

I should mention that Cyberdemons are a delight to fight in this game. I enjoyed those encounters as they felt more like what the game should have been overall. 

Overall I found myself more frustrated at the above mentioned designs and executions than enjoying myself, which is the bottom line for the negative score. There are so many small annoyances in this game that it simply shatteres the good aspects. If you haven't played Doom (2016) then Doom Eternal will be an okay game, but if you ride on the wave of Doom (2016) you may end up disappointed.

Actually, on further reflection. This is not an okay game. Bethesda, with it's recources and experience, not to mention that all the had to do was build upon Doom (2016), should have done better. This is bad, Bethesda, bad.

And by the way Bethesda, if you are going to make a challenge for ""left side"" glory kills, how about you make a ""left side"" glory kill mechanic that actually works?",1597968328,1597968328,False,1,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197964470840,614,6,1338,0,1338,1597968223,,

For me this was meh. I had fun, and appreciate how hard it was, but it never sucked me in the way Doom 2016 did. It wasn't immersive at all, constantly hitting you over the head with the fact that its a video game. The difficulty can be summed up as MOAR DEMONS = HARD, and I didn't really care for the fact that every enemy had a specific weakness that you are more or less forced to exploit to survive on higher difficulties. Some levels were beautiful, and others were over the top, yet somehow cliche and generic all at once. The music was lackluster this time around, and the pacing feels tedious more often than not. The platforming was especially annoying and out of place, further removing you from immersion. 

TLDR  Doom 2016 was Death Metal, Doom Eternal is Metal Mario.   The best part of this game is playing original Doom 1 and 2 on your Doom castle pc. 6/10 for me, and I choose not to recommend it mostly to offset the plethora of fanboys ignoring it's many issues and saying you don't like it because you need to ""git gud""",1597950709,1597950709,False,3,0,0.467462807893753052,0,True,False,False,76561198054036422,357,49,2344,0,1658,1600075957,,
39,69186496,english,"[b]Update:[/b]
I recommend this game to everyone searching for great, fast and challenging single-player shooters. One of the best of the last decades. 
Just make sure that the kernel-level anti-cheat is still removed and never comes back please.. (See my previous review for this)

[b]Before anti-cheat removal:[/b]

First of all, it´s a great Game.. Doom-Slaying at its finest.. 
[i] Now straight for the – I guess recently obvious – “but(t)”: [/i]

I uninstalled right after the new “Update1”-Patch because of the newly introduced [b] Kernel-Level-Anti-Cheat [/b] for a game that is probably mostly enjoyed as a single-player experience. (Preventing Linux-Systems to run this at all) Well OK, maybe the new multi-player modes and experience will be great, but that's not where my personal focus goes to with the Doom-Series.
I will not install a major potential security flaw onto my system – granting kernel-system wide access to anything attached or running on my PC – only for a game (or any entertainment software) to be played – even if the risk could be low. That, in fact, should be a ""big no-no"" for almost any software out there. Even if it is potentially ""only"" active while the game is running – unlike RIOT-Games “PC-startup-time always running Spyware”.. There is no guaranty that even software especially made for security purposes is unflawed and completely risk-free. This stuff is already made for cheat detection – hence spying at least into my active processes. Even if this is handled with care, or thoroughly reviewed, the potential harm compared to its use is nothing I'll personally agree to.

This shouldn't be a direction that the games marked should be heading to. A game should never need that deep level of access onto a system. Hopefully this trend will not be continued and picked up by every new game now. One day this will likely fail, resulting in potential complete loss of control and all of your data – traded for a few hours of fun you had playing.

Sadly I wouldn't have bought this game if this would have been clearly stated from the beginning and not introduced as an afterthought.

Sorry for the little rant. Just be aware of the potential risk if you don't have a dedicated “gaming machine” or your network stores reachable private data. Otherwise, like I said in the beginning, it's still a great game. If the “potential risks” are acceptable.. go for it.",1589562623,1597946744,True,0,0,0.528346836566925049,0,True,False,False,76561198054856569,920,1,365,0,365,1585480137,1597269426.0,"Hello,

We are sorry to hear that your experience with Doom: Eternal was not a positive one. 

If you are struggling to complete objectives in Doom, the best mode to play on is I'm Too Young to Die (Easy mode). You should also take advantage of the chainsaw to ensure you have a steady supply of ammo. Spending weapon points immediately is also a good idea.

Doom is a beloved series and our devs strive to create quality content, including story content, for all our games, Doom especially. We value our player's opinions and encourage you to submit any and all feedback via a feedback ticket at help.bethesda.net/ so that our devs might understand how our game could better match the experience you are looking for.

Thank you for taking the time to review our game in such detail and we hope you will give Doom: Eternal another shot.

71,74597370,english,"If you liked DOOM 2016 because it let you rip and tear however you wanted to, this game isn't what you're looking for.

If all you want is is MORE of everything, maybe this is what you're after. Just be careful what you wish for. 

I can't recommend this game to anyone. The story is incoherent, the game-play loop forces you to play how the devs want you to, and there are entirely too many equipment buttons to manage in combat. 

One of the worst sins of this game is that the BFG and Unmakyr are in the normal scroll/auto-change weapon loop so in late-game you'll frequently find yourself wasting valuable BFG ammo. The devs wanted the Crucible to be the new hotness but honestly its just a reskinned DOOM 2016 chainsaw. At least the D16 chainsaw was fun to use as an oh-shit button occasionally, the Crucible is such a boring tool its not even worth using.

I am still somewhat early in the game, but there is much more offered in this version than past games.  The fighting is amazing, the music and intensity is out of this world.  Don't be afraid to wait for it to go on sale again before you buy, but when it does, don't hesitate.

By the way, I just read some reviews and saw some complaints about the parkour sections.  Personally, I love them.  I thoroughly enjoy getting some ""rest"" in between the bloodbaths, and the parkour works nicely for that.  It is fun to use combinations of your double-jump and dash, while jumping from cliffs or on bars.  I can absolutely see why it would be annoying to some though, especially because the ones I've done thus far are not that easy, and I am pretty good at them overall.  But, if you like that stuff as I do, then you will enjoy those parts because they are challenging and test your skills.

Also, I have to mention the improvement to the map.  I just love it and every game should use a map like this for FPS.  You are actually a 3D character on the map, not just a triangle, and they make it extremely easy to see where you are and operate the map smoothly.  It is tremendous to have a map system that is very useful and I have to call it out because they clearly put some time and effort into helping the player have a good sense of where he is and where he needs to get to.

Glory kills are even more brutal & bloody (didn't think it was possible).

33,74529925,english,"To start off, this game is definitely not for everyone. Some don't want to be strategic at all in their gameplay. Some just want to go crazy and obliterate every demon in sight with little to no effort.

But for the right people, this game is freaking INCREDIBLE. And I am one of those people.

There isn't any other game where most arguments can mostly just be boiled down to ""Get Good"" just as much as this one. Because that's just the reality of this game. It's hard. And some people just aren't as dedicated to get better at the game as others. But if you learn to master its systems, like faltering, all the weapons and their mods, resource management, and other tactics, then you'll overcome the demons. And that's probably the most important thing about this game's power fantasy. It doesn't just straight up grant you the power fantasy, because there isn't any satisfaction from that.

You have to earn the power fantasy this time. And that's what I love about DOOM Eternal.
Every mechanic in this game is useful in its own way. Some other reviewer on YouTube said something similar, but think about it this way: A wide variety of ways to kill things in a fps game isn't that great if said ways don't really have their own purpose other than to just kill things in any situation. It'll feel overwhelming.

But in DOOM Eternal's case, every mechanic has its own use. Weapons are damage dealers, and certain weapons are better for certain situations. Like how Hugo Martin said himself, the demons are your problems. Your weapons and other equipment are your tools to solving these problems. You use your chainsaw if you're running low on ammo, or to get invincibility frames so you can catch a breather from all the action. You can also use the moments of downtime from a glory kill or a chainsaw kill to check your resources. The flame belch is used on groups of enemies for armor if you're running low on that. You can stagger demons in order to glory kill them, which drops plenty of health. Grenades are useful for lots of crowd control damage or faltering large targets, which gives you openings to attack them. Ice bombs freeze enemies for moments of downtime if you're cornered or need a quick breather.

Dashing is an amazing mechanic. It allows you to dodge projectiles and just general attacks with more ease. Blood punch is good for a large group of fodder, or to chain into combos on really heavy demons. There's also the weapon mods and their uses. But I don't want to stretch this review to the length of the Bible, so I won't talk about those.

Also, I'm not sure how people are always complaining about the platforming. It's fun and kind of jaw dropping, considering the distances you travel in the platforming sections.

If you don't use the mechanics effectively, stand still, or make tons of mistakes in your gameplay, then the demons will definitely maul you, especially on higher difficulties.

The marauder, while still difficult in his own right, really isn't that bad. And by now, I would think most people would get it. Stand far away from him, dodge his axe throw, let him run towards you. After he swings his axe, dodge the swing and shoot him with a Super Shotgun + Ballista + Super Shotgun combo. Or the other way around. Repeat this, and it'll make it easy to take him out.

Anyway, I don't want to keep stretching out this review, so I'll reiterate: This game isn't for everyone. But if you like fast-paced gameplay with tons of useful mechanics to keep in mind for every situation, tons of secrets and collectibles, fun platforming sections and one of the greatest power fantasies of gaming (which you have to earn, btw), then you'll love DOOM Eternal.",1597790299,1597820584,True,2,0,0.516483545303344727,0,True,False,False,76561198346699110,43,5,12714,673,10261,1602034341,,

After a few hours I am just not enjoying this game and I really came in to this wanting to love it. By contrast thoroughly enjoyed the first 85-90% of Doom (2016) only finding the arena fights a bit excessive towards the very end. Doom: Eternal unfortunately appears to be almost exclusively arena fights which last too long. Every fight now seems to be like a late game arena fight form the previous game AND IT'S JUST SO BORING! To compound this combat is weighed down by lots of little mechanics that get in the way of some good run and gun fun. Whenever you finish slogging through endless waves of enemies in a tiny locked room, expect to have to do bunch of stiff and awkward parcour through convoluted jumping puzzles, literally being made to jump through hoops just to get to the next overdrawn arena.

Nah Nah Nah. I'm telling you right now that DOOM: Eternal is by far a sequel done right and pumped up by 1000x notches. You thought DOOM (2016) was great? Well, then you haven't played DOOM: Eternal yet. All these people complaining about how the game is no longer DOOM or how they are forced to play a certain style have literally no idea what they are talking about and are just chatting nonsense. Because Eternal does everything that DOOM (2016) did right and increases it. You get new demons to fight. You get MORE demons to fight. You get new weapons and killing machines to play with. You get a classic DOOM experience in modern gameplay.

DOOM: Eternal is set two years after the events of DOOM. (2016) The armies of Hell had begun their conquest of Earth and are slowly overruning Earth's Military powers. On the first day, 60% of the human population had been wiped out. The UAC from the previous game has now become a technological cult that worships the powers of Hell. (Traitors to mankind) But unknowingly to them. The DOOM Slayer has been watching from his flying fortress in outer space, he is now ready to kill some old and new demons once again. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● Stunning graphics
● Achievements
● Steam trading cards
● Collectibles and Secrets
● Very well optimized [b](By far the best-optimized game since Gears of War 5. Lots of graphical options and impressive performance. Was playing at a mix of high-ultra and was able to keep a framerate of 140-150. Even in big areas with lots of enemies.)[/b]

● Gameplay on crack [b](Gameplay has been improved by a huge margin. You now have a shoulder-mounted grenade launcher, flamethrower, and even an arm blade. You can now dash as well as double jump and trust me. This changes the movement flow so much. You still have your classic weapons from DOOM (2016) but with new functions like the pump shotgun now has a Gatling barrel installed.)[/b]

● New demons [b](Classic demons from older games with new looks as well as totally new demons are here. The remains of the Spider Mastermind had given life to the nimble Arachnotron. The abhorrent Pain Elemental is here to mess up your day. The DOOM Hunter has been designed to hunt you and only you down and my favorite of the bunch. The menacing Arch-Vile is back and bigger/bad-As*er than ever. This is just a small list because there is a ton of more demons for you to kill.)[/b]

● Classic Demon design [b](Existing Demons like the Mancubus, Cyberdemon, and Cacodemon have been given their original design look from the classic DOOM games and if you ask me. They look awesome and more akin to who they were meant to represent. DOOM fans will love it.)[/b]

● More brutal glory kills [b](You think that DOOM (2016) had brutal glory kills? Well, then you haven't played Eternal. I literally witnessed Doomguy pick up a b*tch and throw her in the air and slice her down on the way. Some of them are funny too lol. Like the time when Doomguy pushes the Arachnatron upside down. Or when he kicks the Arch-Vile down on his butt.)[/b]

● Impressive gore [b](You can now see the damage you do to enemies in real-time. Such as skin coming off or bone being exposed. It's a brutal mess and I love it!)[/b]

● Classic weapon design [b](Weapons like the Plasma rifle have been given their classic design look from the original DOOM games. Combined that with the new sound effect and it is so much fun to use!)[/b]

● Plentiful of gameplay options [b](From the ability to play in classic weapon pose to the ability to change your HUD style or even having a simple thing like hitmakers. DOOM: Eternal has it all.)[/b]

● Super Shotgun improvement [b](One might ask. How can you improve the Super Shotgun? How about the addition of a meat hook that allows you to perform a quick trip around an enemy or the ability to get up close and personal?)[/b]

● More chainsaw action [b](Some people will say this is bad because one now has to constantly use the chainsaw in order to get ammo but honestly? I like this change. I almost never saw myself using the chainsaw in DOOM (2016) because there was ammo around every corner. It became really a last-ditch weapon that was a very rare use. But now I tend to use it a lot more since there will always be enough fuel to kill a weakling.)[/b]

● More demons per encounter [b](Remember VEGA Core level in DOOM? (2016) Yea Eternal is like that entire level. The game is no longer scared to throw you harder demons and more of them per encounter. You will face the Cyberdemon, DOOM Hunter, and Marauder multiple times throughout the game. Sometimes even two at once. Beautiful change.)[/b]

● Master levels [b](Only two levels exist but there needs to be more. If you're looking for an even bigger challenge then master levels are it. You will be able to replay an existing level but the demon spawns are completely changed. In a location where you might have founded a Hellknight you will now find a Baron of Hell and so on.)[/b]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Arch-Vile solid spawns [b](Arch-Viles can spawn enemies when they are in the field being the Demon sorcerer and all. I have no problem with that. I have a problem with their spawn outline. You see when they are beginning the spawning of an enemy wherever it is a Mancubus, Pinky, or even a Baron. There is a red outline hologram style of thing to indicate that he is spawning that enemy. Yea that thing is solid meaning that you cannot pass through it. Why the f*ck is that a thing? The demon isn't spawned yet so why can't I pass through it? If he spawns one in front of you and one behind you then you're fu*ked.)[/b]

● Shotgun ammo [b](With all of the upgrades the shotgun can only carry 24 shells. A really dumb decision if you ask me. You should be able to carry 30-50 shells and not a measly 24.)[/b]

● Steam overlay [b](I had to disable the Steam overlay in order to be able to play the game. I got no idea how this went unnoticed. I use the Steam overlay every day and having to turn it off in order to get the game to work was really annoying. It has been 3 weeks and there still isn't a patch to this. Not a good look ID.)[/b]

● Soundtrack [b](The soundtrack was barely active throughout the game. I don't know what it was but it was kind of lame. The only soundtrack during combat that I heard without a problem was ""The only thing they fear is you"" the rest of the soundtracks there was almost no presence off. It really felt odd, especially since DOOM (2016) had such a beautiful soundtrack. The Eternal soundtrack, on the other hand, is barely memorable or adrenaline pumping.)[/b]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you're looking for an action-packed game that will get your testosterone up and running then this is the game for you. I see a lot of people complaining about how the game forces you to play a certain style but honestly it doesn't. A common complaint was that you need certain weapons to kill certain enemies. The shielded enemy for an example. That was also a thing in DOOM. (2016) You can easily use a single weapon throughout the entire game. You're not forced to use weapons you don't want. The same applies to the glory kills, shoulder-mounted flamethrower, and grenade launcher. They are all optional. People say that the game is slower. I got no idea what they are smoking. Eternal is 10x faster than DOOM (2016) with the addition of all of the new movement fluidity options. Some people will say the game is harder and it might be at first but once you start using everything given to you. You will feel like a God. The DOOM Hunter? More like a waste of metal. The Mauruder? What a p*ssy, he drops faster than the Greek economy. This is a sequel done right by passionate developers. Buy it now and feel what it is like to be the DOOM Slayer!

denuvo installs itself so deep in your operating system it opens up security risks that hackers can exploit, aswell as giving the program access to most of your pc. 

cannot recommend so long as this is the case.

97,74493799,english,"DOOM Eternal is a beautiful FPS game that follows up on almost all of the things that DOOM 2016 did so right. This game improves the experience in many ways, such as more diverse locations for the levels (DOOM 2016 only really featured two different locations, as where DOOM Eternal features idk maybe 5-6 different locations that you explore during your demon rampaging).

This game looks and sounds amazing, although the OST did not feel as powerful compared to DOOM 2016. I read somewhere that Mick Gordon didn't perform the music on time so ID Software had to make due in other ways. Which is a shame since the Mick Gordon OST from DOOM 2016 was a big reason so many picked up the DOOM franchise once again. This does not mean that the DOOM Eternal OST is bad in any way. It's not just as good as it might've been,

As mentioned - the game features several locations with different themes ranging from snowy mountains, a green futuristic eutopia and to the deepest layers of burning hell. DOOM Eternal hosts more varying demons and almost everyone feels like they belong in the arenas. The Marauder is a really dope enemy that can send wolfs at you, shoot you with a shotgun, throw an axe at you and BLOCK every fucking attack that you throw at him UNLESS you counter him during one of his attacks which only is available if you stand at a precise distance from him. He was interesting the first time around when you fought him in a boss encounter type of way - but became dull and for me broke the general gameplay loop that DOOM lives upon. Instead of keeping on the move you are forced to more or less stand still in the accurate range and wait for him to do an attack which you can counter. Maybe they should have used the enemy less, and in a more powerful way instead of throwing him in every fucking encounter for the latter part of the game...

All of the models look great and I still can't grasp how ID Software managed to compress it to 42GB, something that otherwise is getting rather ridiculous... Looking at you GTA V, RDR2, COD. I think they are releasing new content for DOOM Eternal, but I live under a rock so I don't really know about that. Anyway that will most probably be rather pricy - which the base game already is when it's on retail. So my recommendation is to pick up DOOM Eternal on sale, as I don't really like the €59.99 meta of AAA games...

26,72236121,english,"Good fun game apart from the awful parkour / jumping puzzles. Absolutely suck balls. Who on earth thought all those stupid jumping puzzles was a good idea? Ruined a good game. This is a FPS shooter not Mario World.

Update after 20 hours play: This game needs a lot of patience to play if you are not used to platformers. It is NOT a straightforward FPS and much harder than Doom 2016. After a LOT of practice the jumping puzzles are do-able but the puzzles towards the end of the game really tested my patience. To make matters worse I'm getting random crash to desktops more frequently on the last mission of the game. 

Now to make matters worse, you need the meat hook ability on your shotgun to defeat the final boss. This never worked during the game which wasn't an issue but the game cannot be completed if this does not work. Doing a bit of googling reveals its a known bug and restarting your game from the beginning is the only fix. Well good job guys. A game I can't finish due to a game breaking bug.

28,66597153,english,"DOOM Eternal makes DOOM 2016 seem like a game for toddlers. It's faster, harder and better. There are however complaints which I find overdramatic and strange: ""This is not DOOM 2016"", ""No ammo for anything"" or ""Game restricts how you play"". There are hints of truth in every complaint of course, but only if you do not look at the whole picture.

PROS

- Story is actually good. While I liked DOOM 2016 because it was straight forward and did not care much about the story, I found myself more engaged in it this time around. This also means there are more cutscenes and dialogue, but most of the story is actually told in codex pages. Basically, for those who do not care, they can skip it all, but lore enthusiasts will be satisfied as well.

- Gameplay could not have been better. I have always hated playing shooters on harder difficulties, because that would warrant abandoning your balls for the sake of taking cover every second. Here, it is more organic with the movement system of dashing, jumping sprinting around the arena. Every weapon matters and moreso after unlocking certain mods.as enemies require you to use specific ones to take advantage of their weak spots. I do not understand why this is a bad thing for some people. Instead of ""restricting your playstyle"", it is more about using your entire arsenal to achieve victory. This is certainly better than using supershotgun to solve everything.  Grenades are actually useful this time around with the option to switch to freeze grenades as well. I thought freeze grenades would be overpowered, but they are balanced by the high cooldown. The game also encourages you to use gory kills for health and chainsaw enemies to replenish your ammo, which, in fact, trivializes the need of ammo. There are always fodder demon around to chainsaw which allows you to use heavy weapons more frequently. There is also the flame belch for dropping armor. The mixture of all these elements is what makes this game great. I cannot stress enough how fun and satisfying it is to go through a master level on nightmare difficulty.

- Soundtrack is as good as expected. Nothing I can say that has not been said about it

- There are so many meaningful upgrades and collectibles to go through. Weapon mods, suit upgrades, runes, batteries, mastery tokens, and dolls, music albums, cheat codes and even skins. The most important thing is that they are all meaningful. They grant the player something instead of a counter of how many of them you actually have.

- Performance and graphics are fantastic. Levels have way more variety and incredible aesthetic. Especially [spoiler] Urdak [/spoiler]. Levels load incredibly fast is unreal. it takes me 2-3 seconds to respawn after death on an nvme SSD. The game is incredibly optimized and I had no issues with the PC port.

- Master levels which are harder versions of campaign levels, are well designed and do not feel unfair to the player. Granted they are only for those who seek extra challenge. I am only disappointed that there are only two so far, but more of them are on the way.

- Goddamn slayer gates.

MIXED

- Platforming is actually fun but I understand it is not for everyone. I like it but it would be better if it was less gamey and instead, implemented more organically in the level.

- Story, while great, does not give you context unless you read codex pages. Many people prefer the story being told directly, but that would also alienate those who do not give a crap about it. There is also a gap between 2016 and eternal that is not fully explored. I did not mind the way it was told, but it is worth mentioning.

- I could not care less about the multiplayer. I did not even bother launching it.

- Bosses. There aren't that many but, some of them are fun and some of them are frustrating. Your mileage may vary.
 
CONS

- Invisible walls are prevalent, which is odd in a game that encourages platforming and exploration.

- Some levels have narrow corridors of death which do not mesh well with the freedom in the movement system. There is one section in the first level that I am sure everyone found annoying.

- Challenge gates are hit or miss. They are uneven in difficulty and can be frustrating.

- Mission challenges, especially directional glory kills ones, are annoying to do. I had to repeat many sections to just to complete them because an enemy would not stagger or I would not trigger the right one. Luckily there are only a handful of them unlike DOOM 2016.

- The crucible feels floaty and buggy. I am not sure if it is the same for everyone but I died a couple of times because it would not work as expected.

Overall, I highly recommend it for shooter fans. Most of my complaints are really small and do not hurt the incredible gameplay of this highly polished title. I cannot wait to experience the future of this game.",1586012496,1597693828,True,188,4,0.865634024143218994,13,True,False,False,76561198006553244,171,43,1895,0,1895,1589489620,,

I bring this up because TF2 is a great example of a game that has a high skill ceiling by focusing on the making the core mechanics of the game revolve around objective skill, (aiming, movement, etc.) And mind-games or Subjective skill which will change depending on what you are against and who you are against. TF2 Uses this as an anchor point to build off of very similarly as to how ID has done with doom eternal. Now what I just stated may seem like it would only apply to battle mode but it applies to the campaign as well. Yes you are up against AI, however the AI can be exploited all be it in different ways than predicting humans. The AI will always be easier to predict than a human, (with modern technology anyway.) Therefore leaving the skill on the mind games part a bit lower for the campaign but that's only because the game is trying to be a gateway game where low skilled players can go to train and hone there skills in things that will assist them not only in doom eternal. This is a great game to use as both movement and aim practice... Now for those of you who will point out the very specific way I have worded things to avoid the controversies (up until this point anyway) I would like to state my stances here and now: The anti-cheat was lazy on ID's part, The marauder is way easier than People make him out to be, (I beet him first try on nightmare difficulty even to my own surprise) and the music being removed from Youtube wasn't ID's doing and I am more or less mildly concerned but I stand with ID on their confusion. I will not be updating this review (at least I have no plans on it) so more information or content/updates may be released that cancel out what I have said.

Certainly the best aspect of this game is the mechanics. The movement and combat are both superb and satisfying as hell. There hasn't been a Doom game that has pressured me this much since Plutonia on Ultra Violence. There hasn't been a Quake game that's pressured me this much since Quake 3 / Live. Nightmare mode on Doom Eternal is just... awesome. Couldn't praise the gameplay enough.

Doom 2016 felt like industrial metal, there were obvious signs of torture and death everywhere. This game has glimpses of that, but feels more like a heavy metal comic book than a violent graphic novel.

Do I love it? Yes.
Did I want more Doom 2016 and less Doom II: Hell on Earth? Yes.

I guess, as a classic Doom fan, I couldn't ask for a better mainline Doom game than this. Simply making Doom 64 canon was one of the best decisions Id could have made. I love what they've done with the story in terms of the content itself... Still though, there are aspects of Doom 2016's storytelling, music, and atmosphere that are lost with this game. I was more immersed in Doom 2016 because they made a real effort to never take the player out of first person. This game does away with that, for better and for worse depending on which cutscenes you're talking about.

This game is beyond fun. The gameplay expands on from Doom 2016 in a such a way that makes Doom 2016 feel outdated when I went to go play it back just to see how it feels and it feels archaic with how the movement and gunplay has evolved from one game to another. The glory kill system from the last game is back and more brutal than before, the guns are more dynamic than before, like the plasma gun is actually usable now than before. Everything is just better in this game.

The graphics are beautiful, the environments are detailed and tells a visable story as to what happened to earth and the hellification the planet is going through.

Now the story is what has improved the most from Doom 2016. While Doom 2016 had a story it wasn't mindblowing, it was decent and usable for the game but Doom Eternal blowed that out of the park. The Story expands on everything that was placed in Doom 2016, answering some questions while adding more. The worldbuilding of this game is fantastic, I was hooked reading every codex learning about the world that Doom Guy inhabits.

Overall, this is my game of the year. It blows everything out of the park of what I expected for this game. Id Software has done a great job with this game and cannot wait for the next Doom game and will see how they expand upon the greatness that is Doom eternal

I am ""doom player"" from day one (basically) and enjoyed every title in the whole series.
With DOOM Reboot from 2016 as a definite highlight I was really keen on DOOM Eternal.

And man, the first few seconds feel instant great, super nice gun feedback, swift movement, smashing and slicing the first few lesser beings from hell... and yet, it strted very soon to feel kind of odd what was done to the game.
First thing noticed was this ""arena"" charakter of the maps where you need to kill a given number of mobs to proceed and then it got even worse with those unholy and super anoying jumping b/s in the maps.

DOOM is not a platformer, was not and will hopefully never ever be again. jump-dash-dash, fall start all over.
Kinde suxx right after the first encounter.
Sorry, maybe I am alone with my massive dislike on this game mechanic, but when I play DOOM, I want to godlike cut-and-slice demons and blow freaking body limbs apart and not ""Mario-esk"" jump from one floating platform to the next - fail miserably a dozen times and redo all the level from the beginning.

he fighting itself is still DOOM, sure, fast paced and un-forgiving - which I am perfectly fine with.
Also the new Ammo-Management makes it realyl tough sometimes and you fail because in the middle of a fight you end up all empty.... sure, not well enough planed and executed, I love to start over for that purpose.

71,73251942,english,"Oh boy, CAN YOU TELL this is a sequel. [strike] I guess the game is good if you wanted more ""refined?"" bullet hell than was in the first, but the story from the last game feels like it has nothing to do with this one. The only real hints I have that the games are even related is the occasional mention in a codex (log) entry, aside from that the game looks completely different (daemons ,weapons, and items are 3d Doom2esqu models). There are a lot of codex entries... [/strike]

I've found a little plot twist I forgot from the first game but I still find the dramatic style change from D 2016 to D Eternal odd to say the least.

Edit after playthrough:

I may be a little harsh on this game but please understand that it's out of disappointment, I had no expectations really until I finished D 2016. ""Oh boy, there's more, and gritty epic story to boot"" followed by ""Did... did they piss off the development team?"". Perhaps like I said in the comments, my complaints stem from the shock of immediately playing D Eternal after D 2016. In an effort to refine what I mean between the two games I have made a list.

Doom 4:
- Brutal Doomesque
- super intense game
- epic music
- Doom Slayer feels alot slower than Doom Guy
- cool guns n mods
- bit of a power trip
- funky platforming moments but it works
- silly barrels wont stop moving (they don't believe in the law of entropy)
- edgy scifi atmosphere
- rough around the edges mysteriousish story
- cool looking Daemons
- pretty maps
- linear game feel
- little to no enemies sneaking up on you
- why are all weapon slots moved down one, I know the chainsaw is special but god damn why is it G!? (the nerves in my fingers don't understand, it's changeable though)

Doom 5:
- Brutal Doomesque
- super-ultra intense game
- epic music
- Doom Slayer feels even slower because all of Hell wants a hug! Projectiles out pace you
- guns n mods you WILL need to survive
- that power trip is gone, there is only pain
- platforming is a special mechanic required in order to progress
- annoying platforming puzzles, to death metal, right after an adrenaline rush, required in order to progress
- everything feels bright. I don't remember a single shadowy corner, even in hell
- some super brutal moments (don't read codex as you get if you don't want spoilers)
- kinda cool maps, I liked them. Not the platforming that ruined it
- encounters are visible on the map and you are locked in the room the moment fighting starts
- why are the weapon moved down two slots!? The pistol would be silly in this though
- bugs. I found three or so abnormalities that seemed like apart of the game, like a duplicate Doom Slayer mapped to my mouse and being able to unlock cosmetic items with energy cells I had already used (If you open any door with them and restart the Doom Fortress hub level you'll have unlocked the item while not having opened the door or used any cells)
- maps are incredibly linear. You'll never get lost, even in hell, because green lights
- only 3 monsters in total bigger than basic zombies tried to attack without indicators the whole game (nothing is sneaky in the least, the Caco is the quietest I think)
- it feels like a none stop slaughter fest, little to no real pauses, every new fight starts to feel like the same grind even with new enemies to deal with
- secrets don't feel all that secret (alot glow green, have a giant question mark, or they didn't even bother obstructing your path to the secret), because of this upgrades are no problem
- everything feels like it's spoon fed to you. Between the green lights, the cut and pasted interactable environmental platforms (climbing walls, and monkey bars in bizarre places that stick out like sore thumbs), the notifications that you're about to meet a new enemy types (I could have turned it off come to find out) and how to beat it, the game feels babyish. Doom 2016 felt so much more like each corner was unique. In this if you die enough they even ask if you want to use special armor to make things easier.

Now after all that I'm willing to say D Eternal feels like the stronger of the two gameplay (action) wise (not the puzzles, fuck the puzzles). That's hard to say because I haven't beaten it and I'm stuck at the second to last boss and I may not try to finish without help (I'm on Ultra Violent but since 08/08/2020 I found a way to beat the game). I just wont call D Eternal an FPS any more, that's left in the realm of D 2016, this is a bullet hell platformer.

P.s.: I can not however, forgive either game for dumbing down the Lost Souls. They will only attack one at a time...

TLDR and Conclusion:
I guess if you look at ""all"" the Doom games after Doom 2, ID is playing with the feel of the Doom theme. Doom 3 is all creepy dark and Doom 4/5 are all brutal, back in 1993 Doom was both of these in one package. I wont say lazy (lazy) I'd say an experiment that was catered toward people who require constant input/reward, silly little easy things to complete in order to feel motivated and interested. I don't know who's cute idea it was to make the whole game/the fate of earth about climbing walls, monkey bars, and obnoxious glowing green interactables but I feel they did it thinking anything more complicated looking would scare people away. I understand now, but my heart still felt broken when I started. Other than that, I found I enjoyed the game and the story is okayish kinda i guess. Keep in mind, I got this for $35. I'm glad but I almost wish I could go back to, the Before Time, when I still thought D Eternal was cool and I still had $35...

ps: After some thought, what's impressed me is how the story outright doesn't change anything. ID's original idea of the Doom Guy being something people project onto remains despite the Doom Slayer. And in final I guess I'll give it 6.5/10. I'm being mean but so is this game.

94,74429532,english,"     After 28 hours of gameplay, I can without a doubt say that this game is one of, if not, the best FPS games I have ever played. I have a lot of praise, and some complaints as well. I'll start with the soundtrack. Doom Eternal's soundtrack is a step up from Doom 2016's soundtrack, and includes some returning songs. I feel like I am an unstoppable force while listening to the music and slaughtering demons left and right. Mick Gordon was spot-on with these songs, and really hypes me up for more fun. 
     Secondly, visual art and overall style of the game. Doom Eternal looks leagues better than Doom 2016, and I can't get over the level design. It just looks amazing. The levels feel like they are a part of the Doom universe, and I love every inch of it!
     Gameplay is also better than the previous game. The Arenas give you so much more room to move around and use each ability and weapon to their highest potential. Platforming is a great addition to the game and helps add to how each map feels.
     As for complaints, I think the Unmayker is a bit underwhelming. It was originally a gun you could upgrade into a beast of a weapon, but in Eternal it feels weak, and the BFG is just a better option when it comes to the two.

When there's action DOOM is at it's best. When the action is gone, the game becomes surprisingly boring. Sadly DOOM Eternal get's boring a bit too often.

They upped the Ultra Violence difficulty. That's a good thing. The marauder fights though.. are annoying.. they basically 2 shot you. Are completely untouchable unless they do their special attack which they only engage when you are at the right distance. They are also bullet sponges. All this would be fine.. if the arena's where you fight them give you the space to avoid their near constant barrage of attacks. But half the marauder fights are in dead end narrow lanes making the experience at best frustrating and not fun and challenging. 

So why the recommendation? When DOOM Eternal does it's DOOM thing it's so addictive.

The need to constantly manage resources, figure out an attack plan on whatever demons are clawing at you & execute that plan, moving around the arena at a blistering pace is an amazing rush that makes every victory feel earned (whereas '16 was quite simplistic & after a certain point became rather stale with its limited range of tools), & the movement capacity makes the game at its top level feel silky smooth to get around. 
The game could definitely cut back on the unskippable cutscenes for stuff like doors opening, or at least an option to disable it as it makes reruns a little annoying constantly taking the control away, but it's a generally minor complaint.

of course, I played Doom. I remember being so young that I just felt like ""beating the game"" was the goal. So, I did not feel compelled to replay the game and moved on. I tried playing Doom II and other sequels, but felt like Quake was where it was at with the multiplayer and re-playability, not to mention the 3d graphics. Also, I can't say I was happy with Doom 3 and didn't finish.

Everything changed with Doom 2016. I am so happy I gave it a shot and thought it was the best game at that time. It had everything I was looking for; it was simple (no 50 things to keep track of and man do I dislike ""crafting,"" it's just not for me to learn encyclopedic knowledge of a game for marginal benefit - or grinding). I honestly thought it was the best game.

Then, Doom Eternal came out.

Hands down, the best game I have ever played. 
It is ideal - I can put it down and come back weeks later and not feel like I'm lost in the story. It's fast and beautiful, every little thing is rewarding - and there is lots of humor and Easter Eggs. At this point, I've gone back and gotten every secret, and am only short of finishing at Ultra-Nightmare, having put Nightmare behind me in an epic couple of weeks. 

I feel like Doom Eternal is punishing in how challenging it is, but going back to missions where I had the most trouble after the fact I am surprised at how clean I play. I can't imagine a better system that is fair and balanced, and that's why I love this game. 

Absolutely recommend it, especially if you love First Person Shooters.

17,74420232,english,"The ""No"" here is namely considered against a full AAA price and up against Doom 2016.

Doom Eternal does accomplish, in gameplay, the very specific objectives it set out to achieve: creating a ""Doom Dance"" of evasion, resource management, and offense that gets ever-more complicated as time goes on. But overall, the combat portion becomes outright repetitive quickly as you are *required* to approach every single fight using nearly every single weapon and trick. Gameplay is reduced to two major modes: combat arenas and platforming sections. Most combat arenas start blurring together as ""the same"" since the vast majority of enemies are reduced to ""exploit weak point/weapon weakness"". The only change to this is Marauders and Archviles/runes, which just alter the cadence of the Doom Dance. The combat portion of gameplay tends to rob a player of freer carnage than the predecessor. The platforming bits contribute to convoluted level design aesthetics that feel much more in place with a Metroid Prime game (where an obstacle appears for no other reason than the developer wanted say...a climbing wall health hazard obstacle) as opposed to a Half-Life game (where an obstacle felt like a consequence of the natural environment).

And then there's the story. It's...dull, inconsistent, and much more ham-fisted than its predecessor. You are directed by and exposited to on a near-constant basis. You are told by the opening narration to rip and tear, but the very character who delivered that command tells you to be cautious. Major elements show up with zero introduction, assuming that you collected codex pages or read supplemental material. A major villain goes full Bond Bad Guy with both exposition and manner of attempting to stop you. Just to prove the laziness of story-writing and gameplay design on display, the Phobos/BFG10K level introduction plays out exactly like the trailer released last year. Sounds great. Except the game gave you a plasma rifle a few levels prior...so there's absolutely zero reason for the Slayer to take a plasma rifle from the UAC trooper except because it was part of the demo.

Looking back at developer comments and ""crunch time"" coupled with release delay, I can deduce that a number of major management failures occurred during development that id and Bethesda really ought to work on before attempting a third title in the Doom revival series.

And this boils down to the thesis: Doom Eternal is not a BAD game, by any means. But it is an inferior game to Doom 2016 and I would recommend waiting for a Steam sale rather than pay full price.",1597606487,1597606487,False,7,0,0.506027519702911377,0,True,False,False,76561197963772196,190,3,1325,0,1325,1589501477,1597689042.0,"Greetings!

This is a worthy successor to Doom 2016. If you liked that game, you'll like this too. There's more of the same great movement and combat mechanics here, fighting in and navigating through the levels is a joy. Upgrading your armor, weapons and abilities is back as well with a few tweaks, but they work well and the sense of progression you feel here is really well done. There's new movement possibilities compared to Doom 2016, including swinging from bars, and climbing along certain textured walls which both feel really satisfying.

The game has bunch of additional game mechanics, involving one's movement as well as available arsenal of weapons. And another change that's been emphasized is variety of enemies, that will force you to think about your offensive as well as defensive approach to any situation (this is especially prominent in higher game difficulties).  I can understand some people wanting more simplistic gameplay (and also less story telling), but for me I feel like Id Software and Hugo Martin did an excelled job in modernizing the series with additional mechanics, as well as bringing back the old enemies to the game, such as the Archville (well, at least for 3 seconds, until you delete it with the crucible)",1597602521,1597602521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198033523446,452,7,2010,0,2010,1597410088,,

I have played every doom game since they came out.

I honestly think that the last boss was... easy; in comparison to random encounters throughout the game, surrounded by mobs that pick you off for the smallest mistakes.  This isn't a bad thing, I think it was sufficiently fun, and kind of an epic fight, but definitely not the hardest thing you have to do in the game, just a long, drawn-out culmination of using your best movement, chainsaw, keep the little guys at bay while you hack way at the boss.

What was fantastic:

- Doomguy/Slayer is the single angriest and most brutal character in gaming; Kratos has nothing on this guy. He gets a really fleshed out back story and it is truly epic. They really focused in on his history and craft some truly badass story elements in the collectible texts. This is the ultimate machismo power fantasy.

- The graphics are optimized to perfection. My rig is pretty beefy with a couple aging components at this point, and this game runs smooth as butter with all the bells and whistles on.

- Gorgeous environments and set pieces invoke games like God of War, Halo, and Gears of War. There are things that, when I saw them for the first time, made be think ""Wow, what's the story behind that?""

- The Doom Fortress is one of the best, if not the best, hubs in gaming history. Some of my favorites are the Hunter's Dream in Bloodborne, the three hubs in Starcraft 2, and Firelink Shrine of the Souls series. Doom Fortress rivals them all, being large enough to explore but not so large it's a hassle to navigate. The various collectibles you gather are put on display, allowing you to view them and associated models up close, and play music tracks for records you discover. Doomguy has a man-cave with a portrait of him and the only living creature he's ever truly loved. Doom Fortress also contains some skins and powerups you can unlock with energy cells you collect in game.

- The original Doom and Doom 2 are available to play in full after meeting their unlock requirements, with isolated progression saves so you can pick up where you leave off at any point.

- The lore overall is pretty well fleshed-out. Has the occasional inconsistency, but very clearly a lot of time was put into expanding on a lot of aspects of the story.

- The glory kill variety has been increased, and there are some truly satisfying things you can pull off.


What was serviceable:

- The combat is a bit different this time around, I would describe it as the Diablo 3 of FPSes; it's extremely fast paced and you're lambasted and inundated with enemies to chew through -constantly-. Not many true boss fights or slower points for you to appreciate the impact of combat. Your enemies have targeted weak spots that will benefit you greatly if you prioritize over just pumping lead into them. Targeting these areas will weaken them greatly and likely save your skin a few times, as well as expedite killing them. It's combined with a new emphasis on certain enemies being weak to specific weapon types. It's a nifty enough idea, but not one that was probably necessary. I really enjoyed the gun play in Doom 2016, and trying to force specific combat behavior out of the player doesn't really add anything to the game in my opinion. It's enjoyable, but did take a little getting used to initially and became a little monotonous due to the sheer volume of combat by the end.

- There's a much greater emphasis on platforming in Doom Eternal than there was in Doom 2016. It functions well enough I guess, but again, probably isn't providing anything additive to the experience. It's a feature which I would describe as just being okay.

- The music is more of the same from Doom 2016. It gets you amped up to fight with some more orchestral pieces to emphasize the tone of certain moments. 


What was disappointing:

- There's not enough ammo to accommodate the aggressive gameplay the game encourages. As I mentioned earlier, there is more emphasis on strategy here, and part of that is having to ensure you're using your ammo extremely efficiently. It wasn't impossible or difficult to manage, I just felt like I'd been unnecessarily gimped most of the time.

- There are a couple of really cool moments where you get to fire particularly giant guns, but rather than allowing the player to do it, it's just a brief cinematic. It's still cool to see, but really would have benefited from at least letting the player pull the trigger rather than take control away for 15-30 seconds.

- There is a new enemy type, the Marauder. Marauders didn't ruin the game, just the flow (pacing and play style) of combat. They require you to follow sweet-spot-range and perry mechanics while simultaneously being thrown into a clusterfuck of other demons to micromanage. They're designed to take priority during combat or harass you with more aggression than other demons, effectively acting as add-management mini bosses during each encounter after the first. They are manageable once you learn them, but they're the only enemy that complex in the game for some reason. Because if that, they really feel out of place. I think they would have fit better if they weren't the only enemy this demanding, with other enemies requiring specific/skilled strategy to dispatch at that level (sans Soulsbornekiro). Here, the Marauder is in a league of its own, an apex opponent that doesn't have any peers as a point of reference when it is absent. This is to say, it sticks out above the rest of the fodder a little -too- much. I think it would have been better either as an isolated mini boss every time (as in the first encounter), or as one type amongst other similarly advanced enemies.

- The last two boss fights almost ruined the game for me (spoilers). 

+ The Khan Maykr fight requires you to use Blood Punch after chaining up to her, and I frequently found my Blood Punch bugging out and missing her even though I was straight up in her hitbox. 

+ The Icon of Sin... Was just a let down. It's more or less just an add-management fight, in which you blast parts of its body off in between fighting the infinitely spawning demons rushing you. The Icon of Sin just feels like a bullet sponge prop you occasionally shoot at, rather than an interactive boss fight with mechanics to overcome. In the Doom Fortress, there is a giant mecha suit similar to those found throughout the game- I had been hoping/assuming you would actually be able to don that armor to fight the Icon of Sin. Turns out it was just there for show.

- The limited time skins is a really shitty aspect of the game. There are so many skins in the game that you'll never be able to get because you didn't play at a certain time. People like me who didn't buy the game on release and waited, or don't have the time to play but periodically, just don't get various skins. It really doesn't incentivize me to stay tuned into and constantly play the game, just burns me for not being around 3 months ago. This is a live service model that I have never cared for in non-mmo games (mmo's having a constant stream of updated content, not just events, to keep people tuned in).

- The multiplayer is just bad. It's a 1v2 system, where one player is the Doom Slayer against two demon players. I've dabbled in it a bit, and it is comparatively bad even for an asymmetrical multiplayer system. There is no balanced matchmaking system, so very experienced players are constantly matched with very inexperienced players. I've also had the issue of people randomly leaving the middle of a match, with no form of backfilling or bot replacement. Occasionally this just means the match is over outright if the Doom Slayer player leaves.


Overall, this game is definitely worth buying on sale. The campaign is especially robust and really expands on the story.

64,72204255,english,"[h1]Fan Service[/h1]

Instead of relying solely on slim pickings in a form of an unending chain of leftover references and useless toys, I'd always prefer for all possible homage to be integrated into gameplay and visuals, which is exactly what we have here. From the point of view of an old fan who periodically replays the originals and watches decino daily, Eternal is closer to classic Doom than anything before it. In terms of fan service, this one delivers the goods. Overall, the only thing about the game that I don't feel any reverence for is the pompous plot. He's just a doomguy, a marine, okay? I'll never call him Doomslayer, this is ludicrous! The story is so grotesquely epic that it could as well be a parody. Maybe it is and I missed the point, dunno.

[h1]Graphics and Guns[/h1]

What immediately catches the eye is that they've dropped that brown filter, so the color palette is much more vibrant and authentic than in Doom 2016. As a result, the game is as pretty as a picture and I loved almost all of its fantastic designs. Monsters, levels and most of the weapons look utterly inspired, everything is devilishly well-crafted. Could be slightly less cartoonish though.

The sights are fantastic - who can resist Apocalyptic hellscapes and occasional Akira goodness? The final levels, in particular, Nekravol and Urdak feature, hands down, the most stunningly gorgeous environments that I've ever seen. And I don't make this statement lightly! Besides, all that beauty runs surprisingly smoothly on my mid-tier rig, but I didn't expect anything less from id.

Countless times I had to stop in my tracks not only to absorb the vistas but to examine my arsenal. Even your simple combat shotgun is such an eye-candy! Unfortunately, just like in the previous game, it's only good for sticky bombs. That vintage plasma though, mmmm... The SSG, every connoisseur's weapon of choice, is perfect, too. What I don't understand is why they did the chaingun so dirty, the default skin is too futuristic and indistinct for my liking.

I also can't say that I appreciate the tendency to make some weapons unreasonably wide, it doesn't meet my taste. Anyway, what's more important, when you start shooting these nitpicks seize to matter - the feedback from them guns is superb, you can feel the impact in your balls. Except for the Unmaykr, that over-designed steam mop, from which I expected simply more oomph.

[h1]Monsters[/h1]

Enemies are a pain, so it's very pleasant to observe chunks of flesh tearing off their bodies when they get hit and to hear their bare bones cracking when you break them like twigs. Makes you see why serving in Hell's army is a punishment. Some of the enemies, like Mancubus, Cyberdemons (Tyrants), Pain Elementals, Arachnotrons, Archviles and Cacos, bear strong resemblance to their classical counterparts, making my heart melt. To faithfully replicate the original designs was the best thing they could do without having to send for Romero.

Monsters don't only look good but also have complex behavioral patterns, weak points and even the most basic chainsaw fodder comes in different variations. When you'll get to powerful enough weapons you won't care much about no weak points, so I don't  see why some people oppose them. Or Marauders! They're like fun (okay, this is arguable) mini-bosses, there're less than a dozen of them in the whole game, but people are still angry for some reason. I don't get it.

[h1]Tricks and Traps[/h1]

It happens sparingly, but sometimes a small ambush can be triggered if you pick up an item during an ""exploration phase"", which somewhat disturbs the whole predictable arena structure of the game. I'm not talking about them special nest encounters right now, although they are a nice novelty, too. Sadly, these events are extremely rare, the game remains a far cry from the original in this regard since the levels are still divided into combat and non-combat areas pretty strictly.

Cards and keys are a nice touch, but It's still the same stop-and-start level design where you're going through alternating phases, which never felt organic to me. The technology is not there yet, I assume, but I'm glad that id tried to do something about it nevertheless. Shows that they're thinking of more ways to meaningfully merge modernity and oldschool. Speaking of oldschool, monster infighting is back! Sort of. Unlike in the originals, I didn't get to use it to my advantage, and I'm not even sure if it works properly (but it's not always scripted, for sure). Yet I'm glad that they've included it.

The one feature I deemed unnecessary was the abundance of platforming, but it's inconsequential since you don't even lose a life after falling into a pit, only a sliver of health. Frankly speaking, ""abundance"" is an exaggeration and it never gets as frustrating as in, say, The Chasm. Yeah, it can be a bit annoying, it's definitely padding, and I'd prefer to see it only in combat where it really shines.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

Combat is all about dashing all over the place like a monkey, swapping weapons and resource management. I like the fact that the player is given so much control over the latter. With a stricter ammo limit, the chainsaw was reformed, it regenerates and now must be used all the time. Blood Punch is fueled by Glory Kills (that still give you health) and simply obliterates things, Flame Belch (always forgot about it) and SSG's hookshot drop armor, two types of grenades are both useful in different scenarios. Every ability can be enhanced by runes, for example, Ice Bombs can make it rain health when you shoot at monsters while they're frozen, Glory Kills can give you a significant speed boost, etc.

Doesn't sound like much, but try juggling these options in the heat of battle and you'll see that they're more than enough. Making these life-or-death decisions on the fly is what makes the game's combat truly tactical and hard to master. Most of the time, I felt like an old dog learning new tricks - humiliated, confused, but also very excited. Everyone expected that id would just fine-tune and tighten an already perfectly viable combat system, but they've modified and, in my opinion, improved, balanced and sped things up quite a bit. Some appreciate it, some are on the fence, some are just cranky and refuse to relearn.

[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]

Can't pass up the music. Obviously, I'm as huge of a fan of Mick Gordon's masterpiece as the other guy, I can't praise the OST enough - it gets me PUMPED. Too bad that he had some kind of fall out with id over bad mixing and they won't work together anymore, which is pretty damn sad. Now, the sound design... not a fan! You know how in classic games one could immediately tell what monsters were in the room, which of them got damaged or killed just by listening? Here it's all PEW GRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAH PEW PEW BANG BANG GRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH PEW PEW ROOOAAAAARRRR PEW PEW!!! Eh, even if the sounds were more distinct, to turn down that music would be blasphemous.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

This game kicked my ass extremely hard, this is definitely one of the hardest shooters ever made. And I didn't even get a single lousy achievement for beating it on Ultra-Violence! Again. Not that it matters, really, but I was slightly disappointed due to how conditioned I am to expect a cookie for my every fart. At least I felt like I deserved and genuinely needed these sweet rewards after winning them battles, I guess.

But when I'd play the game again, I'd go for Hurt Me Plenty just to have a semblance of power trip instead of experiencing that ludonarrative dissonance after dying like a little bitch during every possible encounter to then watch cutscenes where everyone literally calls me the DOOM itself, a saint, kisses my ass and bends the knee like I didn't just happily suck all of Hell's supply of cocks dry nine times in a row.

65,69196333,english,"BE CAUTIOUS OF ALL REVIEWS BEFORE THE UPDATE OF 5/15/2020!

This honestly feels so wrong to be giving this game a negative review. id Software deserves all the praise in the world for this game. Doom Eternal is a masterpiece of a first-person shooter, completely overhauling the majority of the gameplay elements that were present in 2016. The ENTIRE campaign feels like an all out brawl that forces your foot to be on the gas at all times. Phenomenal work, id. 

But requiring a kernel access driver to even play the SINGLEPLAYER? Are you actually fucking serious? And to hide this behind the fact that you're protecting legitimate players is disgusting. I earned 100% achievements shortly after the game came out, and there were multiple achievements that were in the 0.2% range. And to think that any of this has to do with battlemode is beyond me. I've played at least 15 hours and didn't run into a cheater. I'm on multiple discords, including Eternal + 2016, and I haven't heard a single complaint about cheating. The fact of the matter is, the multiplayer in this game is GARBAGE and no one enjoys playing it. That forces all of us to wonder why this is happening in the first place - and EVEN IF they had decent reasons for it, that doesn't mean that kernel access drivers are okay at all. People who enjoy playing games DO NOT want these invasive additions that deteriorate your machine, ESPECIALLY FOR SINGLE PLAYER GAMES. 

In my opinion, the worst part about this whole situation is the fact that I purchased the Deluxe Edition, because i LOVE DOOM. I was more than excited for the new levels and upcoming DLC. But adding Denuvo without our permission, AFTER we purchased the game is one of the most disappointing publishing choices I've seen in my life. This is the franchise that I have enjoyed dearly since I could remember. But, leave it to the publishers to destroy one of the best games of modern times. 

I will not change this review or install the game again until this kernel access driver is completely removed. Shame on you for ruining a masterpiece, Bethesda.",1589575193,1597554397,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198140084896,224,3,2359,0,2359,1585509241,1597267302.0,"Hello,

This game is my favorite FPS of 2020 (not like there was a whole lot of competition for that but yeah)

0,74371381,english,"[b]Doom is Eternal[/b]. I can say that for sure after beating the game for 5 times and spending nearly 100 hours in it. I think the sequel drags bar for arcade FPSes even higher, setting new standard as Titanfall 2 did several years ago. 

	Maybe I could even go as far as to say Eternal is a masterpiece. Almost. Even though the gameplay loop is practically flawless, as game overall it has some places where it falls short in comparison to the DOOM 2016 imo. And before I start praising and kneeling before Eternal, I would like to bring up all these places.

[h1]Where DOOM is not eternal[/h1]

	First of all, DOOM 2016 provides more immersive atmosphere, I would say. The UAC facilities look like real places that had some purpose and meaning before invasion. Having no damage from falling is presented as a separate feature of the Praetor suit. The pick-ups scattered around levels look as subtle as possible, and on top of that, the HUD immerses player in the game even more by being diegetic. Such details make the experience more natural and cinematic. 
	On the contrary, Eternal’s level design often gives some Mario’s vibes and simply contradicts any common sense. Levitating tombstones, monkey bars, dash refills scattered around platforming sections of the game, rotating fire obstacles are literally borrowed from Super Mario Bros. I understand that DOOM was never trying to be associated with realism and whatsoever, but the sequel just constantly reminds you that [i]it is a game[/i]. You are not on the Mars research station invaded hell, you are on the demon-slaying playground. 

	
	The second problem was probably the most unexpected one for me. I could never think that I would have questions to the [b]story[/b] in this franchise. The first part of reboot was as simple as possible, you always had clear objective and understanding of what is going on in the story. In the meantime, however, Eternal confuses you with what’s going on from the start. Having expected the story continue from where it had ended previous game, I suddenly find myself on interstellar fortress (what?), hunt some hellish priests(WHAT?) and encounter interdimenstional god-like creature([b]NANI?[/b]). It is outright confusing and the gap between the first and second parts is never addressed here. Although, eventually, I really enjoyed the lore and the backstory game tells, almost all of it I’ve learned from the Codex pages and other text documents. And they are supposed to be [i]optional[/i]. So if you are not going to bother yourself with them, the story will look like a mess until the very end. 

	The third complaint is multiplayer. I don't know why, but ID Software decided that they do not want classical multiplayer, so they made this strange battlemode with only one type of game where you do not even always play as doomslayer but an ass-boring demon. Well, it is purely subjective of course, however in all reviews I've seen nobody has given this experiment more accomplishing than ""meh"" reaction. For me it is sad because we could have had a new Quake-like arena shooter platform which would be [b]ACTUALLY ALIVE [/b] (rip Quake Champions).

	The fourth complaint is about certain type of enemy. I want to rant about it a lot, but it is not worth it because breaking pace and making player change their in-game behaviour from proactive to reactive gameplay [b]IN THE FUCKING DOOM[/b] is already enough reason to call him shit. I don't want to spoil it for you, but you will get who I'm talking about as soon as you get to there. 

	Finally it is [i]small things[/i]. Like, you know, having some weapon mods being useless or seemingly worse than alternative is a trifle matter on itself, but when you have a bunch of such problems, it is getting as serious as previous complaints. I have to be short, so I will just list some examples of  [i]small things[/i] I had problem with: (already mentioned) useless weapon mods, magnetic monkey bars, dash refills (lazy design decision really), how are secret challenges made, replaying levels with cheat codes and some other [i]small things[/i]. 

[h1]Where DOOM is eternal[/h1]
	
	Well, everywhere else, I guess… Graphics, soundtrack, art design, and gameplay of course.

	Soundtrack is as fantastic as in the previous DOOM, I would say even better. Each theme has several presets befitting a certain type of situation, and they all do sound perfect. A plenty of times I found myself unintentionally bobbing the head during high-octane battles or calm intermissions. The soundtrack defines what the game wants you to do at the certain part: should you rip and tear, eagerly move towards the next battle arena or even occasionally stop for a moment and enjoy the beauty surrounding you. Well, what else can I say here — [b]damn, our boy Mick is at it again[/b].

	Graphics is decent and that’s pretty much it, game looks good both on low and ultra settings. I would rather like to focus on the art design instead, it’s gorgeous. All locations are saturated through with a theme of gigantism, constantly having something of enormous size around the player: either that be buildings, mechas, bizarre structures or some hellish titans roaming at the background. 

	Heck, even if I ranted about the story just some paragraphs before, all of the cutscenes are gold. If they are not over-the-top badass, they are over-the-top hilarious. The 80s-90s TV shows and blockbusters fit these two traits perfectly as well and serve as a good comparison, and that explains everything pretty much. (I mean, one of the most significant cut scenes in the game is [b]literally[/b] a recreation of scene from ""He-man"").

	And gameplay... to be honest, I wanted to write a critique on game, analyzing the mechanics and what makes gameplay so engaging and how. However, I discovered that steam reviews have pretty short character limitation, so... can I just paste here a bunch of hearts here to shower it with my pure innocent love and appreciation here? Thanks.  [b]♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥[/b]
	No, I'm serious, it's gorgeous. All newly added mechanics, restructurized demon bestiary and low ammo capacity entangle and create fast-pased hardcore gameplay which actually forces you to think with your head a lot unti your gameplay loop turns into a reflex-perfect consequence of actions. These gamedesign changes might be seen as controversial because they won't really allow players, wanting casual mindless experience of old-school shooter, enjoy the game, but I personally love the gameplay changes they've made. I am against stagnation in industry and I like games with deep gameplay mechanics which allow you to clearly see progress in your skills throughout time. 

[h1]Is DOOM eternal to you?[/h1]
	I am quite sure you will greatly enjoy new DOOM if you [b]do not[/b] expect from it ""The same DOOM 2016 [b]BuT mOrE[/b]"" and you welcome challenging experiences in games. Eternal gifted me truly new and unique experience in arcade FPS genre and sadly I couldn't get enough of it. Patiently waiting for both of game expansions to come out to download DOOM again and poke out some cute Cacodemon's eyeballs.

5,65588682,english,"Ok, after buying on sale and giving this another try, it's good.  Really good.  Still a little mixed bag, but damn it is worthy and I fully recommend.

No, it's not quite like Doom 2016, but once you get used to the differences, it's still great in its own right.  It's kinda like they took a step back, and a step forward.  Yeah, the limited ammo is just awful, but infinite regenerating chainsaw works just jam dandy when you really get a feel for the juggling of the fuel regeneration.  In fact, that's a big part of this game that was really off-putting at first, but can really grow on you.  You appreciate their presence, and you work to get better and better at juggling them into your combat strategy.  There's now TONS of stuff to upgrade and build over time, which makes you feel more and more badass.

The scenery and atmosphere are really fun and cool, and it's awesome to see new places like a city corrupted and ripped to pieces by a demonic invasion, with behemoth monstrosities in the background carrying literal cathedrals on their backs.  There's new enemies that flesh out the diversity of your victims, and the redesign of the others to better resemble classic Doom designs is superb and welcomed. 

And of course, the cheeky throwbacks and references are great.  And if Funko would actually make figurines with half as much personality as the collectibles in this game, I wouldn't hate Funko Pop with quite so much ferocity.

THAT SAID, there's some bad sides.
Yes, the ammo is extremely limited, and that put me right off the first time I played.  Even with full capacity upgrades, it's still much less than Doom 2016, and of course, a FAR CRY BELOW the grandpappy classics.  Some of the weapon upgrades don't really feel as useful this time, and I miss some of the old ones like how the plasma rifle used to have an upgrade to charge the secondary fire blast without having to fire the gun at all.  There's a few BS encounters where you're suddenly backed into a corner against several super heavy enemies and it's kinda just dumb, and there's some puzzles and level progression that isn't entirely clear.  And still, the thing that makes me MOST angry even though I love this game, is there's no infinite ammo pea shooter, and melee attacks don't inherently do any damage, and monster in-fighting is purely cosmetic.  Womp-womp. 

Flaws and (sometimes unwelcome) changes aside, it's a damn good game, and still retains that frantic bloodlust-fueled violence of Doom 2016, and I think it's a good modern rebirth of what made the classics so amazing in their day.



(KEEPING THE OLD REVIEW FOR POSTERITY)
If you liked 2016, you'll hate this.  The theme and imagery is the only cool part.  You can't kill enemies with melee attacks, your ammo capacity is garbage, leaving you totally unable to fight certain enemies if you didn't know they were coming ahead of time, the game keeps pulling you out for tutorials, and every enemy is a tank, yet feels like a waste of ammo all at the same time.  They took everything right about the first game and fucking obliterated it into eye candy and trash.",1584919784,1597526960,True,0,0,0.51220470666885376,0,True,False,False,76561197972924033,226,47,2082,1,96,1601589160,,

Doom 2016 and Doom eternal feel like the Del Toro Hellboy series. The first Hellboy was gritty and dark while the second was more modern fantasy.

The Doom Series does the same thing making Doom 2016 about the horrors of the Mars base while Eternal focuses on a crusade against the demon threat. Doom Eternal is a must buy for anyone who wants an enjoyable first person action game.

30,74358421,english,"TLDR: Faster, harder, better. Everything you loved (or hated) about DOOM 2016 is amplified in this sequel. I enjoyed it and can only recommend it. I bought the game on release day and didn't regret a penny. 

[b]Story[/b]
The story takes us back to the Earth as demon forces have begun the invasion. From your space headquarters with help from VEGA AI from the first game, you are on the hunt for demons to stop them and save the Earth. With time you encounter new species and learn about the history of Earth, your Slayer Guild and these new species. The story is told via cutscenes and Codex pages found in each level. Most of the history can be accessed and read via the Codex menu anytime in the game, which is in my opinion, a great way of separating the story from the ""Rip and Tear"" gameplay. Thanks to that you are not overwhelmed with a ton of story throughout the game and can read it when you want it if you are interested in it.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Doom Eternal is even faster and more aggressive then it's predecessor, making it a little bit of an (Ultra) nightmare for people not used to the fast pace of the previous game. Thankfully, you are given new ways of dealing with the demons and means of increasing your survivability throughout the game. New mechanics involve flamethrower to get armor, glory kills now replenish HP only, grenades for damage, freezing grenades for crowd control and a good old chainsaw for ammo. Levels got more platforming so it's also as much about vertical movement as about horizontal. All of these new features made the game, at least for me, more pumped with content and enjoyable in a long run.

[b]Enemies[/b]
Old enemies from the previous game are present, but you will encounter new enemies that are more aggressive and require a specific approach when dealing with them. For example, Arch-vile which summons new demons on the battlefield, so he becomes your main objective in fight. Some old demons got upgraded like Cyberdemon or Baron of Hell, being more aggressive and durable. What felt a little underwhelming were last two bossfight, penultimate boss was honestly, insultingly easy and that was rather disappointing to me. The last bossfight, for the amount of hype throughout the game, felt extremely monotonous. Second phase was just a first phase  in a ""new cloak"" (or should I said without the cloak?).  It was too long and too much of the same thing. Otherwise I enjoyed other encounters. Some of the bosses become regular enemies after you defeated them for the first time but they didn't lose their strength and remain a serious threat in subsequent battles.

[b]Headquarters (base)[/b]
Between each level you return to your base in space where you can unlock either skins for Doom Guy, or upgrade points for your suit and weapons. You can train in special arena in lower part of the base or check your unlocked weapons and collectibles. Over all it created this unique place where you always return and plan ahead with help of VEGA who's in control of everything. I liked this a lot.

[b]Upgrades[/b]
Weapons are upgraded the same way as before, but now you can also upgrade your suit, giving you  advantages in certain enviroments or boost your grenade launcher and flamethrower. You can also get special traits, after every upgrade of your maximum health/armor/ammo. Same as before you also acquire runes, of which you can have 3 active at the same time. There's a lot of upgrade and progress and I find it well balanced.

[b]Levels[/b]
There's a lot variety to locations, each having completely different style and design of platforming elements, perfectly fitting for the area. Secrets are in every level like before and most of them are easier to find thanks to the map showing you a lot of information, for someone this might be downside but I felt more comfortable about it. There were a few secrets that, in my opinion, needed more thorough searching but otherwise, collectables are pretty straight forward. At the end of almost every level you can teleport around several checkpoints on the map and look for things you missed. I liked this feature a lot.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
I tried multiplayer only for like 2 or 3 games, it's format is different than classic DM. It's 2-3 player controlled demons vs 1 player controlled demon slayer. I don't think it's evenly balanced and wasn't very enjoyable on either side for me.

In the end, for singleplayer alone this game is worth it. If you are not a DOOM franchise fan, just wait for some, for you, acceptable sale and buy it. It's a great game. 9/10",1597510816,1597514898,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198048523506,389,22,1816,0,1816,1586473076,,

It's a game that demands your attention as you dance between enemies, constantly swapping weapons and keeping your ammo topped off with strategically timed chainsaws swipes. Added mobility options like dashing and grappling around the arenas takes the destructive ballet of the first game and one-ups it to a point where it will be difficult go back to the old gameplay ever again.

35,69259650,english,"Well the game used to be the textbook definition of ""fine""

Then they added spyware. Oh well!

Maybe they'll see the light and remove it down the line, though Bethesda gotta be Bethesda.

-Edit!-

Before getting started, let's be clear I'm not trying to blister the individual from Bethesda who left the very diplomatic response to my original review. I'm sure they're a lovely individual just trying to put dinner on their table.

Now, I will not be giving the game another try. I got most of the way through the story when I dropped it so I'm pretty sure I'm not missing anything life changing. Plus I cannot trust that there isn't something else that's been added that's similar to the ""anti-cheat"" they tried in the first place and I can't trust a corporation to not do what they do.

I also will not be changing my original review (other than this long winded diatribe) as it represents the opinion I still hold. The game was, indeed, fine. Want to know how fine? Read the review from literally anyone else, they'll tell you. I probably would have finished the story if the above rigmarole hadn't occurred. In addition, Bethesda did still add what is widely considered to be little more than a virus and there's no amount of updates that will erase that event from the timeline. Finally, I'll reiterate I don't trust that they haven't tried to sneak something else into the code that is just as damaging.

To close out, I'd like to pose the following question: why does Bethesda care now? Why have they hired someone with infinite patience to contact some random dork who said he didn't like their game. It's not like I hold any sort of clout when it comes to opinions on the internet. Plus I've already bought the game, right? I've already given them my money so why care if I said I'm not playing it again, right? No real reason to try to get as many people as possible habitually playing, Right? Probably not going to try to add in a bunch of microtransactions to the multiplayer in an attempt to milk people for all their worth, right? Right?

I would quickly compare it to previous Doom game with a bit less shooting, nearly all shooting happens on arena battles with some platforming on top.
Story's pretty interesting but does not explain much, loose continuation of previous game story.

You need to keep switching weapons quickly depending on enemies you're facing as game throws tens of them at you.
If not, you will often face issues with ammo efficiency (pretty poor for arcade/fast-paced shooting).
Single player campaign will take you around 20 hours, completing + achievements (single player) should take below 30h.

There are some parts of the game that feel unfinished (ie. big statue/robot-like inside you base, below the main deck that feels you should be able to use/control). 

Where the game shines for me and brings most fun is re-running levels with built in-game cheats, that makes battles more bloody, faster/dynamic and you don't care about either dying too fast or running out of ammo. 
Certainly feels that some default game balance/mechanics are not as well designed as they could be.

50,66751843,english,"[h1] DOOM Eternal - 9/10 [/h1]

[i] Rip & Tear [/i]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

If you are looking for an arcade-style first-person shooter, then this game is for you. It is a direct sequel of the Doom 2016 game, and it improves and adds so much from its predecessor in almost every way, such as the movement, weapons, perks, and more. Note: For this review, I will not talk about the story - only pure gameplay.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The shooting is much more satisfying now; the way the guns sound and bullet splashing through demons feels awesome. In this game, ammo is more scarce than the previous game. This forces you into utilizing all of your weapons as much as possible. Especially considering each individual demon now has a weakness from certain weapons or abilities, it adds more variety in gunplay rather than just use the most powerful weapon in your arsenal. I didn't find any gun to be overpowered. I thought they were all perfectly balanced and fun to use, as opposed to the previous game where I used about only 2-3 out of 8 guns only.

What makes this game so intense is how improved and much more intelligent the AI is. They will track you like it is their last day on Earth. In that, the demons are much more brutal now and all they want to do is kill the mighty DOOM SLAYER.

This game adds new movement variety. You can use monkey bars to swing to certain places for better positioning. You can jetpack dash to avoid demon's projectiles. Also, you can stick to specific walls to navigate through certain areas.

Levels are way more fun in this game than D2016. This is mainly due to the levels being longer, and the overall aesthetic of the game. D2016 had a darker. grittier style, while DOOM Eternal returns to its classic roots with the art design like the loot items and the main Doom Slayer skin. Moreover, this game has more variety in collectibles. You can collect toys of different demons, soundtracks of different classic Doom or Quake games, cheat codes that you can later use to have fun with when backtracking. Additionally, once you are done with a level, you go back to the Fortress of Doom, which is essentially the Doom Slayer's base that you can explore and find your collectibles shelf. guns on your gun rack, etc. It is also where you can mission select and activate a portal to travel through.

One thing I want to say about the story is that the game is more lore-focused than D2016, so I recommend you read the codex's to understand what is going on.

[h1] Audio [/h1]

DOOM always had amazing soundtracks. In this game, you can feel the intensity of the action through the crazy metal music that will keep your adrenaline pumping. You can also collect soundtracks from various classic DOOM games and other id Software games as collectibles.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I was hesitant of getting this game at first because I didn't expect this game to be worth $60. I thought it was gonna be a short 13 hour game like the previous one with fun repetitiveness. But, boy, was i wrong. It is worth every penny. So much content for a simple FPS game. If there is one negative thing I could say about this game is the Multiplayer achievements. Yes, for someone who enjoys achievement hunting, I think this is a pathetic way of forcing you to play their multiplayer. Apart from that minor complaint, this game is a must get for someone who wants to simply turn their brain off and just rely on reflexes and aim like old school games.

75,74322947,english,"After finishing my third play through of Doom 2016, I thought it was the right time to check out Doom Eternal. The game had glowing reviews and the consensus being that it's one of the best shooters of the year. I slapped down £25 when the game went on sale and got stuck in. 

My first initial reaction is at just how good the game looks and performs. It has a similar visual style as Doom 2016 and runs much smoother. The graphic style has a lot of colour and a lot of cool grotesque designs. I didn't have a singles stutter or slow down at all throughout my 20 hrs with the game. I found the controls very easy to handle. Doom Guy moved very smooth and the default control layout worked just fine. The music by Mick Gordon is just as good as it was for Doom 2016. The mix of pounding metal music and industrial beats under the weapon fire etc is very well done. 

After playing a few hours, I found myself a bit concerned in regards to my thoughts on the game. I didn't find myself enjoying it nearly as much as I thought I would. I found the extra long level design to be very tedious. They all looked fantastic but whoever designed them failed to capture the tight pacing that Doom 2016 had. A majority of the levels could literally be cut in half and you wouldn't miss anything in terms of content. It's the same thing over and over for a good hour at a time. Take the last three levels for example, (ignore the fact that the final two bosses are absolutely awful design) you spent your time going from one large fight to another by huge jumping platforms. If it was trimmed down considerably, it would be okay. But the tedium just goes through the roof. It left me wishing the level was done, instead of dying to slaughter more demons.

The biggest problem is the fact that the game is basically an open area of puzzles, a battle arena and then some platform jumping. It repeats this process several times over in each level without anything new or interesting to do. When you compare Doom Eternal to Doom 2016, you can see the big problem I had with the levels by a mile. The first game looked and felt like an actual Mars colony. You wondered your way through different sections, seeing all sorts of different sights and felt like you were actually making progress. Doom Eternal's levels on the other just feel considerably more gamey. The platform puzzles look so out of place in the environment. Large spinning flame columns, oddly placed flaming chains, breakable platforms etc. It honestly looked like some idiot was playing Super Mario Bros and decided to take the exact same platforming sections and place them in Doom. They don't fit at all.

You also have to look at how the enemies spawn in these levels. They spawned with just enough time to give you a breather in Doom 2016. In Eternal however, they just sort of come at you all in one large group. It gives you very little time to react. The later levels are especially bad for this. It's constant hordes of bad guys coming at you and it's very over whelming. Some people might like that experience but I felt it was a bit too much. 

Combat is generally okay throughout. I mean, it's basically the same thing as Doom 2016 for the most. You run around an arena and swap through weapons as you tear demons a new hole. The change in how you acquire armour and chainsaw is where the combat grew tedious for me. In Doom 2016, you were a legit bad ass who could demolish a group of demons without hesitation. In Doom Eternal, well... it's clear that he's been drinking too much soy or something. Doom Guy's health drains much quicker and his ammo pool is embarrassingly small. This means that you have to use the flamethrower, chainsaw and quick kills considerably more to top up your health, armour and ammo. It's fun to begin with but the bigger the battles get, the more you do it and the resource management just does not feel fun. Especially by the end game.

The enemy design is (for the most part) okay. You get your traditional Doom bad guys, all of which are easy enough for any Doom Slayer to disperse. The newer enemies on the other hand, they're clearly there to give you a bit of challenge. Each one of the new opponents are fast, powerful and incredibly hard to dodge. They always pop up when you've got a good rhythm with all the classic enemies and ruin the fun. The worst of the bunch is by far the Marauder. He's faster than you. Get too close and he shoots you with a shotgun. Get too far and he flings laser beams at you. Fire at him and he whips out a shield. You have only one time to hit him and that's when his eyes glow green (for some reason). He's okay enough to deal with by himself. But when he summons his stupid dog and chases you through a group of 10 demons, it gets annoying. He'd be fine as a big boss fight (which he was to begin with) but when he shows up more frequently, I hated it. 

I could go into more detail about what I didn't like about this game but it's just pointless. Everyone's of the same opinion that it's some modern classic. If that's you, I'm happy you think so. But as someone who has been playing these Doom games for nearly 30 yrs, I couldn't get into it at all. It's a well made game technically but the game play is just too hit or miss for me.

revised review: this game is very cool recommended

Old review:

honestly the game looks good and runs good but there are way too many technical issues. I had to spend around 1 hour to find a way to make the game start as it wasn't properly detecting my gpu and defaulting to the integrated one (sadly the solutions you find on google couldn't be applied immediately on my pc, then found out it was a simple setting on the nvidia set up to always use the gpu). then I manage to run the game, now the game crashes after finishing loading the first level, hard crash with no description or error

Finally I'm able to play (after trouble shooting and looking on the internet. Turns out it's enough to start the game with low details then switch to the proper settings after the first level is loaded), i'm having a blast, i play 3 hours in a row. Today I start the game again by picking up from the last save, loads no problem - and crashes 2 minutes into game play (same battle I was playing yesterday nothing new)

not sure who messed up and where but this is embarassing, a fully deserved bad review. Game seems to be fun but all these crashes and issues are embarassing, I suspect it's something about how it is integrated on steam or bethesda, the game itself seems to be competently programmed judging on how smooth it runs (when it runs) even during the most frantic battles

italiano: sembra figo ma ha troppi problemi tecnici, troppi smanettamenti solo per farlo partire, ieri  dopo aver risolto vari problemi l'ho giocato per ore di fila oggi dopo aver ripreso dall'ultimo checkpoint  crasha 2 minuti dopo senza motivo, quando ieri avevo fatto la stessa battaglia senza problemi. Un po vergognoso, anche se il gioco sembra bello una recensione negativa non glie la toglie nessuno. Il gioco di per se gira fluido che e' un piacere quindi tutti questi problemi di contorno solo per farlo partire mi sembrano assurdi, leggendo su internet altri hanno avuto questi problemi quindi e' scandaloso non abbiano ancora trovato una soluzione. Cercando consigli su google si trovano troppe possibili risoluzioni ad ogni problema, una perdita di tempo infinita per provarle tutte finche non si trova quella giusta",1588502851,1597435630,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561197975360926,41,2,5120,0,506,1597437633,,

Games just don't give that destructive power fantasy like Doom does. You need to experience it for yourself.

You won't just be able to rocket launch or SSG+Ballista your way through it all, but you can sure try if you really are a superfan of those weapons.

Play it on Ultra-Violence for a fair but firm challenge. It's honestly not that difficult compared to the modes above or below it. It just forces you to use the systems somewhat or you'll die quickly.

But DOOM never tickeld my nerves an so the last interation i played was DOOM³ from 2004 (yes im old). But i realy like this version. It feels fresh, fast (maybe even a little bit too fast for me, at least for the harder difficulty levels) and alive. The last time i had this much fun with a single player shooter was propably with Wolfenstein the new Order. 

It is also tough as a nut. I tried to play it on ""ultra violent"" the 3rd difficulty level but in the 4th level i gave up and just turned it down. I like a challenge and i used to play allmost all shooters on the hardest difficulty levels but, nowadays i dont have the time for that anymore and somehow it is way more fun not to die every 10 seconds with hords of Deamons, Spidersbrain-thingys and Hellnights comming at you.

30,74286247,english,"Thanks to Doom Eternal I've lost interest in the Doom series. The game was somewhat fun to play, but after playing through I've lost interest in the game. During the last levels I just thought ""Let's get over with it now..."". 

With all the Easter eggs, the remixed music from Doom 1 and 2 and the designs resembling the weapons and monsters from the original games from the 90s, I thought this must be the best Doom game ever. But I was disappointed.

Pros:
Good graphics, constantly 60 FPS
Short loading times
Lot's of achievements, some of them resulting in new skins etc.
The story is rather short and finally explains how the Doom guy got his strength.

Cons:
Level design: Nearly all levels are completely linear. You start in a passage with some platforming elements. You enter some kind of arena where wave after wave of enemies spawns. You are locked inside this small arena and have to parkour your way around enemies until the last wave is defeated. Then you continue to the next passage. 

Game play: You constantly run out of ammo. So you have to use the special attack with the chainsaw to get new ammo drops. All enemies deal a lot of damage. One constantly has to replenish it via glory kills. As a result the game felt more like resource management than shooting. 

Enemies: Most of them were quite fun to fight and kill, except for the marauder: This enemy was just utterly annoying.

37,74282681,english,"Cluttered gameplay.  Combat was redesigned to focus primarily on using the chainsaw, glory kills, and flame belcher to get supplies, and all of these abilities have cool down time.  Carrying capacity is low and pickups are limited, so ammo and health have to be obtained with extensive use of every ability.  The shooting is a lot of fun, but it gets constantly interrupted by the need use a chainsaw with regenerating fuel to trigger several scripted animations over and over again to get ammo.  That, or it gets interrupted by the need to use a glory kill to trigger several scripted animations over and over again to get health.  Or you use the flame belcher to get armor tiles.  It´s all the same, because all three of these resources have an identical impact on the gameplay: they make the player stop dealing damage so that they can hit a key binding that will let them get back to doing damage (the chainsaw requires pick ups of fuel to kill anything that can defend itself).  They basically just added more stuff you have to do in addition to running around and picking up the stuff you need.

There's also the platforming.  It's tedious to figure out where the game wants you to go, and dying three times in a row by falling to your death when you can't find a ledge, in the dark, is irritating in a game that sold itself exclusively on combat.  I've spent almost as much time in this game doing platforming as I have in combat, and it'll be like that on every difficulty setting.  There really is a lot of platforming.  Most combat encounters have some kind of jumping and climbing in between them.  It's gotta be about a third of the game.

Doom Eternal feels bad as a shooter because the direction they took is moving away from shooting.  More fixed animations, more running around the map looking for stuff or waiting for stuff, it´s all more screen time that is not gun-play.

55,74270986,english,"I really wanted to like it. I was a huge fan of Doom 2016 but I didn't enjoy this game at all. I don't feel like the gameplay is very well tuned at all. Its not that the game is too difficult, its that the difficulty seems to come from poorly balanced enemies with too much health, poorly telegraphed moves, and indistinguishable models. For example, is that a normal imp or some elevated enemy that takes 4 times as much damage, and can only be chainsawed with 3 fuel bars? Its very difficult to tell by looking at him and takes a lot of trial an error. Then there are enemies which are easy to fight but take so much damage you have to wail on them for what feels like forever. Then you are constantly bum rushed by crowds, forced to fight big mobile enemies in tight hallways and on and on... 
its all focused on using attacks to refill your vitals (health, ammo, armor) using the appropriate attacks (glory kills, chainsaw, fire). This means that there are rarely any pickups for these things. I think they wanted to be able to eliminate the pickups for these things to keep you fighting, but the result is you are always running out. The strategy then is to kind of ignore the big demons and focus on the fodder. You essentially have to do this because every enemy can cheese your heath to zero in just a couple hits. So you are just jumping from zombie to zombie and occasionally firing at something bigger.   

Many people see this as part of a challenge to enjoy and I guess I'm happy for them, but to me this just poorly engineered gameplay hidden behind a lot of spectacle and riding the previous game's coattails. It feels like they had some other game in the works and rebranded it as a Doom sequel. 

Again, to preempt the obvious criticism, I didn't feel that this game was too difficult for me (I had no issue with the notorious Marauder for example, just more dancing from zombie to zombie like every other fight), I just don't find it engaging. Once you realize the game loop is designed to keep you almost dying and then refilling just in time, the emotional tension disappears and you're just playing the clock until the demons die.

Anyway, again, many people seem to enjoy this game. Maybe you will too? I hope so. But if you aren't having any fun after the first two hours return it while you still can. Don't do what I did and keep giving it more chances until its too late.

79,74264212,english,"Doom Eternal is a fantastic game. It's so much fun and a wild ride from start to finish. Though, while it is a phenomenal additon to the Doom series, it does have it fallbacks in certain areas and ultimately, it doesn't quite reach the same greatness Doom 2016 achieved.

Gameplay in Doom Eternal can be summed up as a strategic ballet of running, jumping, dashing, and killing. It's this strange yet addictive formula that makes up 90% of the game. Though it strays from 2016's ""shoot everything until it's pulp"" which focused more on a berserker-style action, Eternal forces you to plan out your onslaught and strategically use every single weapon at your disposal to drag through each arena. 

Weapons feel and sound phenomenal, they have a much heavier sound to them which makes you feel like you're tearing up demons with heavy-ass weaponry. Mods have much better variety to them as well as being much more useful like the Heavy Assault Rifle's Scope turning it into a sniper or the Combat Shotgun's burstfire being replaced with a revolving barrel. The only downside is that the weapon design's themselves feel strangely foreign compared to the last game, their design seems much more whimsical like the Hell-inspired rocket launcher which is a shame because despite their relative mundane appearance, I really liked the more mechanical and UAC inspired weapons of 2016.

Atmosphere is where Eternal inherently falls short though. While textures look much better and much less muddled than 2016's, the demon-invaded earth just doesn't really compare to the desolate feeling of abandoned corridors of the UAC facility on Mars or the gore strewn landscape of Hell itself. None of the arenas or environments of Eternal are really that memorable which I find incredibly disappointing especially when you had Hell, Earth, and Urdak yet none of them were especially fantastic in their presentation. 

Lastly is the narrative of Eternal which in all honesty, is a god forsaken trainwreck. You're thrown like halfway through the major conflict of earth with the demons and so many things are thrown at you like you're supposed to be aware of what's happening. You'll have people mindlessly tell you to read the lore collectibles but that can only do so much with an incredibly fragmented story. Hayden is no longer a human as he was portrayed in 2016. The Betrayer is suddenly a major key into the story. Sentinels now have a strangely huge connection to the game because of Slayer's ""mysterious"" past. Everything is horribly disjointed that even though it ""makes sense"" in terms of lore, it really doesn't because of how it's unraveled to you. Even Slayer himself, previously he was this faceless angry avatar of death and suffering for the demons but now with all these flashbacks Eternal introduces, he's displayed as this superhuman fixated on killing demons which while ok, seems like a downgrade from his more mysterious origins. Oh Fortress of Doom is cool and all but where the hell did it come from? One major thing I will note is that 2016's story was very minimal but it portrayed the idea that Doom didn't need a story very well.
(why does the Icon of Sin seem so comical in it's portrayal in Eternal than it's ominous appearance in 2016?)

Oh, also Mick Gordon does a fantastic job once again with his soundtrack in Eternal. It might not be quite as memorable as soundtracks from previous titles but it's still pretty damn good. It's hard to top BFG Division or E1M1 Hangar.

TLDR: Doom Eternal is a fantastic game when it's firing on all cylinders for it's main component, gameplay. If you focus outside of that too much, you'll start to notice the muddled material baked around it. Just don't think too much about it. While Eternal may not take the crown from Doom 2016, it sure as hell proves itself as a worthy successor to the Doom series.",1597360311,1597360864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198167945085,137,25,1026,0,1026,1588459693,,

Remove the Denuvo kernel mode driver or refund my money. Not touching the game until this SERIOUS security issue is eliminated.

93,74259123,english,"I loved Doom 2016 but this game is just oof 
I will basically compare this game to doom 2016 now, to keep it short 16 = Doom 2016

Story:
16 had a simple story and interesting lore in the codecs.
Eternal tries to be more story focussed but half of the time i'm like ""Who the fuck are they?"" because the game doesnt introduce them, it seems like i'm supposed to know them.
Another thing is the start of the game. Suddendly hes just there and has some space ship, this feels so lazy, they arent even trying to explain what happend between this time. They're like ""We know that Doom Guy will return so we just skip to the end of it"".

Gameplay:
16 was a simple shooter with a few nice jump&run moments. 
Eternal adds a bunch of weaknesses to the enemies and you now use the chainsaw for ammo and stuff like that. It isnt as simple anymore. This can be something that you might like but the fact that you often have to run through the same glory kill and chainsaw animations because ammo is a rarity now is just annoying. Another problem is that you cant save Ammo with the punches, the punch is almost useless, except its one of these power punches
Another problem are the jump & run sections. Sometimes they're fine and often you dont even know what the hell youre supposed to do and how to get access to the waypoint. You gotta look around and try to find places on which you can wallclimb or anything similar.
If I want to play Doom I dont want to search 5mins for some wallclimb wall. I want to kill demons.

Soundtrack is good in both of these btw.

Now you might see my problem with Eternal.
16 was simple, fun and understandable
Eternal tries to mix things up, tries to add a better story, tries to add deep gameplay but that just isnt what atleast i've wanted. 
Eternal fails to explain a story by not even trying to introduce characters correctly.
Eternal fails to keep it simple but fun
It tries to add things not many people asked for.

94,74258904,english,"This new Doom game is great, they really did make a game different to any other out there. 
I enjoyed doom 2016 more then Eternal.
Being a fan from the original Doom & Doom 2 i was expecting a lot of old memorys being replayed in much better graphics and game style, sadly the only memory that made me happy playing the game was the fact the guns looked kinda the same and they brought back the original demons e.g the spiders. No demons fighting themselfs this time..... so its not Doom then?
Making some boss fights amazing just to find out its going to be a standard demon to kill within the rest of the game, making it very annoying in battles and ruining the hype down the line. Every single demon has the same dash, jump and auto lock projectiles apart from maybe 3....no personality, they brought this mini version of the cyber demon with a sword which was very cool but wasnt even hard to kill just some other demon shooting rockets when ever it sees a little glimps of you. The demons are like having a ham and pineapple pizza its nice so lets add some more toppings yes thats even better now, finally lets add some grapes, skittles and peanut butter, wow slow down your over doing it now. 
Traps....oh yeah there is none. Jumping and grabbing was a really nice feel to the new doom but on this one its like you have to, if you dont theres no other way around fights or the story.

I liked:
Music
The different worlds
The feelings of each level
Bringing back classic items and so on
Video cuts
Story

You had options to weigh per encounter. That has not changed in Eternal, but now it feels bloated. There are a lot more things to keep track of, between enemy specific weaknesses, your different grenades, your blood punch, so on and so forth. 

I'm in favor of more depth in games, but this honestly feels like less depth and more ""if you don't play by these rules, you are going to be loading up a checkpoint"". This is more frustrating than fun most of the time, because your ability to freestyle is actively limited by what enemies you are fighting and the game will painfully remind you of this every time you have to reload a checkpoint with a primer on how to deal with the enemy that ended your life.

i mean its a doom game, take everything good about DOOM 2016 and amplify it by 100 the music is godly it kicks in at just the right moments and gets you into the mood needed to fully enjoy this game, im not gonna spoil the game but fuckin hell the missions are insane, you do one and when you finish it you think 'it cant get anymore intense' well your wrong each mission is better than the last, glory kills are as brutal as ever the story is interesting it provides lore if you want to read up on it the game looks great it runs great OH AND THE MUSIC, the range of demons is great (fuck the marauder tho) its kinda fun to learn all their weaknesses, like at first you spam everything you got at a hell knight then you learn how to take them down, also all the boss fights i've played are fun they are challenging but still enjoyable and fuckin absurd, the character designs are great, did i mention the music? in case you couldnt tell i fuckin love this game if it doesnt win game of the year i'll be quite annoyed and finally this is the most important thing to remember about this game it will help you tremendously, Cacodemon best demon

Doom eternal is one of those games where you pay it, and then realize it's 4:00 AM and you've been playing it for 5 hours straight.

It's like a symphony of just gore and violence and satisfaction in coming out of an encounter unscathed, the grapple hook on the super shotgun is very fun and a phenomenal utility tool allowing an upgrade to be earned that allows you to get armour pickups from grappling on to enemies.

IDs approach differs from the previous entry, having ammo be more scarce but also allowing your chainsaw to have essentially unlimited uses with a cool-down, this drives the player to diversify their loadout because they cannot rely on a singular weapon as they'll run out of ammo mid-encounter.

The fact that I've bought this on Steam, again on Xbox and finished the campaign multiple times should show an unhealthy obsession with the game. It's just awesome, good job id. I honestly can't wait for the DLC additions. Don't let me down!

Now, the complaints (of which there are only 2 but one's big).
1) The Music - Without getting into the cluster**** of Mick Gordon's departure, the combat music seems much slower paced than that of the 2016 predecessor. This could be easily overlooked as tracks from previous DOOM titles are hidden all over the game BUT you're only able to listen to these while in the Fortress of Doom and not while actually Ripping and Tearing. A playlist feature would be a nice addition to the in-game menu and would make multiple plays more fun.
2) The Multiplayer - Good god this is where the game falls apart. In an attempt to break away from traditional deathmatch modes, they built a well designed 2v1 game mode. That's it though. I like Battlemode, don't get me wrong, it's well balanced and fun when you can keep 3 players in a game. But it relies too much on all 3 people being in the same skill bracket, AND willing to stay for the whole match, AND do a rematch so everyone gets a turn as the slayer. In the 70+ hours I've put in, hardly any of it is multiplayer and that's a shame. I spend more time waiting in a lobby for an ultimately disappointing match and there's no variance. There's no different game modes to switch between like TDM or CTF. So when you get tired of Battlemode, or if it's not your style of game play, that's it. We're still promised the campaign invasion mode (where it's still only 2v1) but there's no news on when we'll actually get it. Adding one or two more game modes kind of seems like an easy addition considering you already have balanced slayers, demons, abilities, and maps. I sound super salty here, but the same old deathmatch in the new DOOM is one of the things I was expecting from it and the game didn't deliver.

You should still get this game. Just prep for a LOT of lobby waits.",1590700792,1597300298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197981501226,208,7,4594,0,4336,1599385268,,

What else is there to say about DOOM Eternal, except RIP AND TEAR!!!

Well, there's also lots of lore, SOOOO many easter eggs (one that makes me question if the devs for the game and story writing have ever seen a certain fanfiction crossover), new faster combat with new mechanics, music that gives me a RAGE *****.

I am slightly disappointed that certain important pieces of lore didn't turn out as I expected, but that's ok. A lot of the history and lore behind the DOOM franchise has been lots of speculation, and the stories that have resulted from nothing being set in stone has been amazing. I dare say that it's part of what captivates some of the audience of DOOM (it sort of is for me). 
Of course, there comes a time and place where concrete details and lore have to be laid. Perhaps that time is now, perhaps not. For me, only hindsight will tell. 
I'm fairly certain that whatever the lore turns out to be, I'll be very satisfied with it. 

[CAMPAIGN COMPLETED]

Edit 3/23/20: When it comes to key cards and such, it feels like those were just thrown into the story line. They don't really need to have lore or anything, and they're not that important, just a noteworthy difference I noticed from the last game. 
To be honest, I was expecting a short dialogue line from VEGA a couple of times in the first level, like if you approached a locked door, he'd say something like ""Scanners detect a keycard nearby, but you'll need to find it."" Eh, whatever.

Also, seems like the Sun was already devoured. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2033335526


Edit: 4/17/20: I went back to DOOM 2016 for a little bit to get another feel for it's story. I believe that DOOM Eternal's campaign feels a bit more sporadic then DOOM 2016, at least when it comes to 'cohesive story telling'. 
I wish the story did more to connect certain things together. 
For example, I wish I didn't get a head's up about the betrayer through a NOTIFICATION on the hud. I'd prefer if A: the information about the betrayer was subtly laid out there for me to want to discover and figure out; or B: the story itself had the information in it through dialogue.
It just felt like this story was more random then DOOM 2016, at first though. 

That first impression of the story is crucial to grabbing the attention of the audience, and it turned me off at first.


[CHARACTERS]

King Novik... Why is he in the game if he has like one line? I wanted him to be an antagonist SOOOO BADLY!!! Just listen to him in the first story trailer of DOOM Eternal! 

Khan Makyr: She played her role as an antagonist well I think, so no additional criticism needed. 

Marauder: Kind of wish he had a bigger role in the story beyond being another demon. What I mean is that I wish he had more personal significance to the Doomslayer, beyond what the lore describes about the Marauder. 

Deag Grav: I was anticipating for the Doomslayer to also be the betrayer, or to have some sort of deeper connection to the betrayer, so that the conflict between Deag Grav and the Doomslayer was that much more intense. 
I also wasn't expecting Deag Grav to be so wimpy, but my expectations probably stem from something I was reading online before DOOM Eternal was released.

[Multiplayer]

It's pretty fun. It's different from playing gunplay with other people, but it's pretty fun. I hope that more multiplayer games are added though, to add more variety.

[Weapons]
 
The only thing that could be better with the Super Shotgun's meathook is that it could acquire targets instantly. The reticle for the meathook should instantly snap to the target within range, as fast as an aimbot would.

80,74214922,english,"  Initially I refunded this game at the two hour point because it just felt like Doom 2016 all over again, not a bad thing but not something I was ready to pay $60 for.

When it went on sale for half off I picked it up only to once again regret my purchase and wonder if I could refund it again. 

As you get further in the game it does differ from Doom 2016, plenty of fun elements but it's overshadowed by far more annoying introductions of enemies and mechanics. 

There's more emphasis on the parkour element they had from the prior game, double jumps, air control, dashes, climbing, pole swinging and so on. The problem is that more often than not the climbing will be unresponsive. Plenty of times I've accidentally punched walls when I intended to climb them or smashed my face on a pole when I went to swing, plenty of times I went to grab an edge and instead of grabbing it I just slid down into the pit below me.

While it can make the combat seem more alive and dynamic, it doesn't do much since you're trying to avoid demons already because almost all of the arenas are claustrophobic sizes of small and they drop more and larger demons in on a regular basis, leaving you practically shoulder to shoulder with everything. This gets added onto with new demon types that have been added and make the experience even worse.

The new demons in question are primarily one that exists for the sole purpose of placing shields in your face to block your shots. There has been a time or two where I've blown myself up because he suddenly existed and stopped it. He can be easily countered if you switch to the Plasma rifle but to need to go out of your way and reach for a particular weapon to stop an enemy from stopping you from targeting others is obnoxious. Another is generally thin, very fast, and despite having the former two capabilities it does have a generous health pool, fast melee attacks, and very good tracking ranged attacks with equally substantial size.. And with little to no space to move at times it feels unavoidable at times.

  Lastly they introduced a lives mechanic to this game by default with no way of turning it off. Nothing feels more insulting than to be playing on the second hardest difficulty and proving your worth only to finally die and... Not even be remotely punished for doing so. You lose one life when you have a reserve of nineteen more and can power through the fight without a care in the world. The problem is you don't get to choose if you want to spend it, there are a couple of times where a fight is genuinely difficult and I want to use a life but I may have accidentally burned a couple on a fluke that got me killed (Or the terrible platforming) and I don't have as much or any.

  I can't and won't recommend this game. I highly suggest getting 2016 and avoiding this mess.",1597280172,1597280172,False,1,0,0.403846144676208496,0,True,False,False,76561198090476265,241,28,462,0,462,1597279268,,

89,69198426,english,"EDIT: 8/12/2020
I've been informed that the previously mentioned Denuvo Anti-Cheat has been removed from the game as of patch 1.1. Based on this, I absolutely have to recommend this game; it builds upon the predecessor in a multitude of ways, improving enemy weaknesses, ammunition types, enemy variety, customization, new abilities like the flame spitter and rechargeable grenades, ice grenades, and the complete adjustment to combat itself. Doom 2016 felt fast on release, but compared to this monster, it's like you're stuck in Atlanta traffic. Combat flows through multiple parts, each vital to not dying and slaughtering demonic hordes, utilizing movement options to reposition and close gaps, identifying enemy weaknesses and using the proper weapons to exploit them, and capitalizing on your abilities to keep your health and armor at max. It feels like a perfected version of Doom 2016, like a beautiful bloody waterfall. 10/10, buy this shit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At release, it was a fantastic game, and it still is today. However, Bethesda and id pushed an updating implementing Denuvo Anti-Cheat on the 14th of May, a few weeks after release. Being primarily a single player game with what feels like a tacked on game mode, this feels extremely anti-consumer. There's multiple problems with the anti-cheat as well, lowered performance, no way of disabling it for strictly single player modes, some players having issues with UPnP and of course, it running at Ring-0 while the game is running. While this isn't uncommon for anti-cheat programs, the fact is, they do bring along security concerns (See SecuROM and Sony's XCP Rootkit scandal), and the anti-cheat runs even when playing strictly SP. This removes the ability to experiment and mod using cheat engine, a program that should have no problems in a SP game. Until the developers remove this, I can't recommend the game anymore, and I hope Valve starts allowing users to refund their purchases, as this feels like an extreme bait and switch.",1589577973,1597276509,True,0,0,0.525096654891967773,0,True,False,False,76561198054841189,996,7,2337,0,2320,1600568812,1597266804.0,"Hello,

98,69193530,english,"Edit - the invasive anti-cheat has been removed and I can now recommend this game again with some caveats. Result!

As it is, Doom Eternal is a fast paced shooter with a much greater focus on movement and navigation than previous entries in the series. It's basically a game about moving as fast as possible and shooting things as much as possible. If you like those things, you will almost certainly enjoy this. It also feels like it doesn't quite know what kind of game it wants to be.

Max ammo count has been reduced across the board to try to make you use a variety of weapons in each combat engagement. There's a hub level full of interesting nooks and crannies, with upgrade collectables and shoutouts to various other id/Bethesda games. Levels are nice and varied in both visual design and in the different movement/navigation gimmicks they use. These are generally good things and they're all integrated with each other so they work well in combination.

Music and sound are also excellent. Provided you don't have an overwhelming hatred for dubstep and the like, you'll find plenty here to enjoy.

I think what works less is a suite of abilities on cooldowns, weakpoints on some of the enemies, and an even heavier emphasis on the ""glory kill"" mechanic from 2016's DOOM. These aspects of the game don't feel very ""Doom"" to me and I feel like they detract from the essence of what the series is about - move fast, shoot the things with your gun, don't get shot. That's what I'm looking for out of a Doom game, and those mechanics feel like they belong in other games and were added solve problems that didn't really exist.

I also have some issues with the tone of the writing because I'm not quite sure what it's trying to go for. DOOM (2016) takes a quite silly idea and runs it with a completely straight face; there's comedy but it's in spite of the tone, and it comes across as classy and understated. Eternal acts as a direct sequel so you'd think it would try and strike a similar balance, but it ends up trying too hard to be funny, often overshooting to the point you laugh at the game, not with it. When it happens, this is distracting.

In summary - shooting things as fast as possible is great fun. More of that sort of thing please.",1589571550,1597274482,True,0,0,0.535304784774780273,0,True,False,False,76561197979641789,340,2,771,0,771,1585179460,1597268001.0,"Greetings,

Positive things that delivered top notch game experience:
+Art, music and landscapes were amazing
+Improved movement mechanics like dash were fun
+Intense fight scenes were difficult and enjoyable

Negative things that frustrated or disappointed in the game:
-Too much jump puzzles to my taste
-Too few Slayer-gate type of intense fight scenes in the first half of the game, in later stages there was plenty of intense action.
-Biggest issue in the beginning were some of the combat mechanics. Very limited ammo feels awkward especially in the beginning of the game, overemphasis on weak points and chainsaw ammo limiting your options what monsters you are able to kill for ammo. Escaping fights altogether due to lack of ammo made me sad. Later on with ammo upgrades in the game this is no longer an issue.

Overall game experience is a bit of mixed feelings. Starting levels were not really keeping me interested and almost stopped and uninstalled. If I would have rated previous DOOM 10/10, this is 8/10.

13,69194379,english,"Invasive anti-cheat software in the game weeks after launch. It requires kernel level access to my system and it's a security risk I'm not willing to take. Hopefully Steam will allow refunds for people who played more than 2 hours. This is unacceptable.

EDIT: The anti-cheat has been removed for a while now, so I'm updating my review.

I'm giving it a thumbs up because there's no ""mixed"" or ""more or less"" recommendation. I'm saying this because while the game is good and fun to some extent, it's not what I expected. DOOM 2016 was great because it was pure, mindless ""rip and tear"" action. Doom Eternal? Not exactly. The way the gameplay was designed pretty much forces you to use all the different weapons and attacks otherwise you're gonna die fast and run out of ammo. You can't do it like 2016, which you could stick to your favorite weapons and roll with them as much as you liked. Some say it's a nice change of pace but to me is a strong negative. Doom Eternal is, in a way, more tactical than 2016 and pretty much all the previous Doom games, and it's not exactly my jam.

TL;DR: I acknowledge the game's quality (hence the thumbs up) but I'm not 100% the target audience for it.",1589572637,1597269150,True,0,0,0.50113379955291748,0,True,False,False,76561198018963096,1033,20,491,0,491,1585419821,1597267825.0,"Hello,

As of the most recent update (Friday 15th of May, 2020), the game has a kernel level anti-cheat driver which launches with the game and runs alongside it, which is made apparent only in the patch notes (and not on the pre-game splash screen or the store page as of this time).

If you've installed the update, you need to go manually uninstall ""Denuvo Anti Cheat"" from your list of programs and check your windows services (open the start menu, type run and ""services.msc"" and look for Denuvo Anti Cheat in the list of services and make sure it's not running).

Given Update 1.1 has removed Denuvo Anti-Cheat, I can again recommend this game. The single-player campaign was brutal and exhilarating, and I would love to go back and try to complete the last couple challenges I have left now that I don't need to rootkit my computer to play it

Old Review:

Up until yesterday, I would have wholeheartedly recommended this game. I enjoyed playing the campaign (and ignoring the multiplayer), and had fun ripping and tearing. But everything changed when Bethesda decided to try and sneak a kernel driver anti-cheat into my single-player game. There is literally no reason why an anti-cheat needs to a kernel driver to function. They are ineffective against cheating, as cheaters in Valorant (famously using a kernel-mode anticheat ""Vanguard"") show on a daily basis, and do little more than open my computer to security problems.

I have uninstalled this game, and already been denied a refund despite Bethesda changing the terms of purchase out from under my feet. Had this been in place on launch, I would have never bought the game. I need to trust the security profile of my PC, and I can no longer play DOOM Eternal and still trust my PC to be able to guard my data.",1589573903,1597267960,True,0,0,0.50113379955291748,1,True,False,False,76561197981727491,1085,4,1279,0,1279,1589064839,1597267627.0,"Greetings,

I am glad they listened to reason and now it only runs if you play multiplayer. The way it should be there is no need for it to run at all on the single player side of the game.

Love Doom, The story here is amazing and doom guys back for more though I still like Doom 2016 more.

Doom guy felt angrier in Doom 2016 and more like himself, When Olivia annoyed him the whole game by overloading the reactor and holding him back when eventually she got transformed into a spider mastermind he had enough and launched a BFG down her throat. Where is his violence. He still has the speed and momentum like doctor disrespect but I felt in Doom Eternal he just isn't the same.

The enemies are more challenging and that's fine but a lot of them can only be killed in one specific way. Call it nit picking but its still really annoying where are my options. Like the marauder I have to wait till there is a green flash of light to avoid its attack and attack it. Apart from that if the map has traps that helps, however sadly only one map had this and that was the demon base. 

Apart from that his new home base is awesome, the upgraded mechanics and more fluid game play is awesome. The game also runs extremely well especially now without Denuvo Anti Cheat forced in. 

I just hope they stop listening to China and add in the violence once again. We have democracy and a age rating for a reason.

53,74184394,english,"Love it.  Way harder than DOOM 2016 but in the best way possible.
The added movement mechanics  make DOOM 2016 feel slow.
The hard counter style combat does take some getting used to, but once you find the rhythm and  internalize how it all works you'll feel like a GOD. 
Everything is so perfectly balanced and tuned that when I die I know exactly WHY and how to prevent it next time.
Lots of cosmetic unlocks that you get just by playing, and a bunch of super interesting lore, if you're into that stuff (I definitely am!)
The Marauders are definitely a frustration until you really learn how to deal with them, and even still, they can get you raging pretty hard. That said, I do actually like them as enemies.

55,69201324,english,"EDIT: Denuvo Anti-Cheat has been removed and I can now recommend this game. 

As stated before, it's a lovely gameplay loop. Intense, challenging and brutal. It's just a better Doom 2016, less repetitive as 2016, better visuals, better sound, better music. 

While hard, it's fair. You never feel cheated or like you don't know what you did wrong when you die, except for some instances. One of those is the level design in some areas, I kept getting stuck on things on the ground that I didn't expect to. This doesn't happen that often, but often enough for me to get frustrated by it. 

The game has tutorials that can be turned off, however, I'd prefer if you can set the amount of tutorials for the first playthrough, because they tell you way to much. Like how to defeat a boss.. I wanna figure that out my self. But if turn of the tutorials, you risk missing some critical information about new weapons and gear.

But overall, I loved the game. If you loved Doom 2016, you'll love Eternal. 
Sorry for the negative review, Id Software. 
Keep up the good work, can't wait for the DLC:s!



----BEFORE DENUVO WAS REMOVED----
Well, I hate to jump onto this review bombing train, but this time it's really necessary..

I love this game. They took the gameplay loop from 2016 and made it even more intense and awesome.

But this low-level, anti-cheat driver from Denuvo is just awful. I was excited to go back, getting 100%, trying the master levels and maybe dive into the multiplayer. But when the game requires some shady software to run at kernel level... naa man, I'll go back to this game if and when they fix this. 

At this point in time, I do not recommend anyone playing this game on their personal PC.",1589582061,1597230269,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561197980962790,236,4,1187,0,1187,1588620275,1597182739.0,"Greetings,

6,74160814,english,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.",1597190070,1597190146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198447040435,34,5,2091,0,1255,1599228913,,

18,74157556,english,"Mechanically, this is the best shooter ever made.

A bold claim, but one that I stand behind. Except... it's not really a shooter. At least not in the way DOOM 2016 was. Try to play Eternal like a normal FPS, and you'll die. Almost instantly.

Eternal overloads you with different mechanics very quickly, and mastering each one is key to surviving. You restore health by damaging enemies enough that you can move in close and finish them with a melee kill. You get armor by setting enemies on fire. You get ammo by chainsawing them. Each gun has multiple alt-fire options that act very differently, and you'll have to master all of them too. Combat is what this game is all about, and the bulk of the game is spent in the midst of large combat encounters that take place in very open, very vertical arenas. They're designed to keep you moving constantly - if you stop, even for a second, you're most likely dead. Combat encounters become a bloody ballet of moving around these arenas at Mach 10, constantly assessing threats, switching weapons, managing resources and cooldowns, and dodging projectiles flying in from every direction.

I can see why many people bounced off Eternal. They were expecting a similar experience to DOOM 2016, but DOOM Eternal has more in common with the likes of Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's not enough to be good at shooters; you NEED to learn enemy weaknesses and every nuance of every weapon and ability to survive.

As for the other aspects of the game, well, there's a story. Far more of a story than in DOOM 2016. It's extremely cheesy, and you'll either love it, hate it, or, like me, just not care about it in the slightest. There is far less exploration than in DOOM 2016, but that doesn't really matter - Eternal is not about exploration. The music is still amazing, and the graphics are still gorgeous. But this is a game that's all about combat, and that's where it shines. It's mechanically dense, has a very steep learning curve, is extremely unforgiving, requires 100% of your attention all the time, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Also, the Marauder fights are great. Ignore the naysayers!",1597184181,1597184181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035322847,757,22,1128,0,1128,1597182848,,

34,74150584,english,"Doom is back and the thrilling and fast paced gameplay is also back, more so than the 2016 I would say. In Eternal you don't really find anything that will hinder your pace and there are no navigational challenges or puzzles to keep you in the same spot for any amount of time (I mean there are some but they are like finding the door knob to open a door so I'm not calling them puzzles).
You run through the level balls to the wall and the game is constantly throwing demons at you to mow down so you really do feel like the unstoppable force of anger issues, given the fact that this is mostly the reason we play Doom I would say it was successful on that front. 
I see some people complaining about the amount of ammo in the game and yes there are a lot less resources and you will run out if you don't mind the amount and the way you are using the ammo. But I didn't actually find this as a negative, quite the opposite: it gave me a reason to constantly switch between my weapons and actually use clever combos to shred the poor things to sticky mush in the most optimal way which was quite satisfying actually. The only qualms with the gameplay I have is that I never found much power ups, just a handful here and there (I think I used berserker powerup only once ONCE !) after some time I forgot to even look for them.
Lastly if I were to compare Eternal to 2016 (If I don't I can't say this game has any cons) the music and the ending was better in the 2016, honestly the blandness of the ending surprised me. But the entire gameplay wise I don't think Eternal would lose to 2016 also the story was quite a lot more engaging too.

49,74143794,english,"I loved DOOM2016 but varied reviews kept me from getting Eternal on launch. After getting it on sale, I can only say that I made the right choice waiting for a price drop. Eternal is very different from 2016. The story, atmosphere and weapons are quite similar but the gameplay is very different.

First of all, this is a very platform heavy FPS. You will spend a large portion of the game jumping around. You got a double jump and a double dash which makes you very flexible. I mostly enjoyed the platforming, but at times it could be very hard to get where you need to go. I sometimes spent minutes looking around before noticing a tiny climb-wall in the very distance. Besides that there are many 'puzzles' in the game that have you looking for switches and draining water from pits and such. It's frankly very dull and it can definitely hurt the pacing of the game. It doesn't have to be 100% action but the puzzles felt boring and forced instead of actually fun. 

Most Enemies in Eternal have a certain weakness and this is very pronounced this time. You can still kill most of them just by pumping their body weight in lead into them, but it's not the best stategy. This does mean that the game can get a little chaotic. You're running around with a crazy amount of enemies attacking you from all sides and you're constantly switching weapons and trying to take out weak spots. 

Ammo is very very scarce especially in the beginning of the game before upgrades. You have to chainsaw demons to get ammo but sometimes the game doesn't spawn enough fodder. There were plenty of times where I was just dashing around with literally zero ammo in all my guns waiting for more chainsaw-fodder to spawn. I understand the idea behind the ammo scarcity, but I feel like they overdid it slightly. It's not that much fun, honestly.

The weapons are great. They all have good punch and good sounds and most of them have fun alternative fire modes. You can upgrade them in different ways. You can also upgrade your suit and find ruins, which are basically perks. It was surprisingly easy to upgrade everything fully, especially since you can replay missions with cheats on and get everything easily. 

I found upgrading everything very much needed for the last two missions which are ridiculous with the amount of enemies. I played on normal (""Hurt me Plenty"") and usually had no trouble dying but I rushed through all my 13 extra lives in the second to last mission. Overall level design is amazing but some parts are too cramped for the amount of enemies that spawns, getting you stunlocked in a corner eating through your lives. 

Most enemies are fun to fight but I hated the marauder. This guy was fine as a boss but afterwards the game keeps throwing it at you combined with dozens of other enemies and it's just not fun as it requires constant focus. The re-use of bosses gets old quickly and I found myself annoyed instead of excited each time they spawned. The final boss was decent. The game is decently lengthy and worth the sales price for sure (I spent 15 hours but I replayed most levels to get secrets. Base game is probably around 8 to 10).

Overall I very much enjoyed Eternal but I must say I still prefer DOOM2016. It's way less in-depth, but honestly I liked that. I will definitely be playing through Eternal again with the cheat codes on, enjoying infinite ammo and just having mindless fun again instead of the regular gameplay which can get quite stressful at times.",1597163845,1597163845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976543995,1092,5,1184,0,1153,1597164051,,

55,65440449,english,"If you're looking for a really polished and chaotic action game, behold, I recommend this masterpiece to you. 

My experience of the game was based on the ultra violence difficulty but my words will remain true throughout the review.

I like it how they have really limited ammo and you would actually have to plan strategically with your ammo.  There are a lot of things that have been added to the gameplay like the shoulder flamethrower and new demons that pose more as a challenge. This game also made it feel satisfying with all of the glory kills and with the realistic tear down of a demon as you quickly shoot away its (Quoting doom guy here) ""big guts"" . As of writing this review I haven't completed the single player and rage quit the game in frustration of not being able to clear out a certain section to at least get this review down. The game can have the casualness and action mixed together with lower difficulties and at least paying attention. Speaking of attention, I absolutely love that this game will make sure you aren't gunning down demons just by just shooting that shotgun at anything, they'll always make sure there's some big factor like the spiderdemon exist, it MAKES you pay attention which basically makes the game less boring. Lets switch over to performance terms. I ran this game on a:

I7 8700k
GTX 1060 3GB
16 gigs of ram

I got the card last year (300$ at the time and now it's like 150$ lol) and I got a I7 since Amazon couldn't deliver my I5 and they gave me a I7 instead.

The game ran 45-60 FPS on the default settings (Most of them high with the texture pool being low.) pretty well. I say it's just me and my graphics card and say it's really optimized for cards better than mine. (Lowering the resolution would greatly help too.)

Where Doom 2016 was a labor of love through and through, this really doesn't feel like it. I don't mind the difficulty, but your grand opening act is a bunch of burnt grey buildings? Weird Contra-style wall cannons that shoot on proximity? Monsters constantly fighting each other as you arrive on scene? Besides that, the tougher enemies are clearly presented with ""this is how you kill them"" pop-ups. Sometimes the camera is hijacked to show you the opening of a demon barrier. Not to mention plain grey room tutorial areas to take you right out of the game and the flow. Enemies seem to have a clear-cut singular way to kill them, otherwise they become bullet sponges. I learned that as the game throws more variations of enemy groups, your fun is in solving the weapon-monster matchup puzzle and doing it the same every time. In Doom 2016 you tended to go in head-first, kick ass as you see fit, and get glorious complex dynamic music as the soundtrack. Not to mention the high level of gameplay/level polish and immersion that this game seems to lack. The soundtrack dynamics are pretty much removed in Eternal and they just recycled the main theme for menu. When you look over the edge of your map some of the scenery in the distance just looks plain awful and I maxed the settings on a 1660super. I am wholly unimpressed, but like I said the gameplay still felt cool and fast. Reminds me of things like Unreal Tournament and other 90s shooters. Fast paced, never stop moving, you die quick, they die quick. That's the one aspect I liked, but as I read more user impressions this flow is later broken up by frustrating platforming. The game felt like: keep pulling that trigger, cheese the tough enemies with the right gun, don't stop moving, repeat.

While this is not awful, it's not at the same level, they tried to cram too much in it and made the fluidity and ambience of the previous game disappear, also the Quake3 Sauce UI/Pickups are an abomination.

The ""strategic"" way to use different weapons and skills on specific enemies get in the way of fast action and would've been way better as suggestions rather than super punitive obligations. To me, Doom should be ""pick up your favourite weapons and destroy everything"" now I feel myself stopping, having to hide and snipe little canons on mobs' heads.... it just doesn't work for me. The fact that melee is now seemingly only effective for glory kills is also disappointing.

I remember starting 2016 thinking... platforming? Oh hell no! Only to be surprised on how fluid it was and how it served gameplay well. Now? I seriously have no patience for your little bland jumping puzzles which just slow down my slaughter.

Custscenes are slow and drawn out interrupting the flow of the game, the platforming also just slams the brakes on any fun I was having. 
Going from small room to small room blocked by giant glowing barriers just ins't particularly fun or interesting. 
The hub world feels like a step away from what I expected of Doom and it just isn't for me. The more I run around and swing cartoonishly from poles and getting whiplash from the game pulling away to show me I can now leave the tiny pit I was fighting in or slamming me into a custscene is just not what I want from a Doom game. This game feels more like some FPS/RPG wearing a Doom skin, it's just not what I wanted from the Doom '16 sequel or from any Doom honestly.

If you're a fan of arcade-y style action platformers this might be for you.
If you wanted something that looks like and plays like Doom 2016, I can't recommend this at all.


Original review: Was expecting the sequel to DOOM (2016), received DOOM: The Saturday Morning Cartoon.
I'll eventually finish the game and maybe update the review if my views change but I honestly can't recommend this game if you wanted an actual sequel to DOOM (2016).

I'm sure this is a fine game in it's own right, with a different style and more focus on platforming just being a choice for a new distinct instalment in the series, but as a sequel it feels pretty lacklustre. 

My list of current grievances:
X. Melee does literally 0 (zero) damage - it's intentional but that doesn't mean it's a good choice.
X. Changes to the designs - It feels to me like if you tried mixed Dead Rising into Doom.
X. The movement and grappling doesn't feel particularly satisfying, the wall climb so far is just slow and kind of tedious and serves nothing but to slow you down.
X. The weapons so far are really lacking the same amount of impact they had in the previous game.
X. A smaller one, but the giant floating question marks really detract from the style of the game for me.",1597118168,1597124701,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198016147107,281,8,94,0,62,1597123850,,

8,74114463,english,"Writing this makes me wonder if I am an old fogey. I grew up on the classics DOOM and DOOM 2 and was thrilled by DOOM 2016' interpretation that brought the franchise into the modern era but without frills. DOOM Eternal still has those fast-paced, up-close, bloody firefights but complications have been added to the combat and most irksome of all they are spaced out by parkour sessions more at home in an Assassin's Creed title.

DOOM 2016 has a pretty simple combat system. You shoot the demons until they are almost dead and then you Glory Kill for a bloody finale. Mix in alternate fire and a grenade or two for spice and double jump to move around the battlefield. You won't often be low on Ammo but if you are, Chainsaw a demon or two.
DOOM Eternal adds:
- A flamethrower (on cooldown) which gives you Armor
- A double dash (on cooldown) which can be used on ground or air
- Blood Punch, a powerful punch which must be charged by getting Glory Kills
- Critical damage spots to aim for on certain demons
- Meat Hook to fly toward enemies
- Chainsaw being much more necessary since you will be frequently low on ammo
So there is a lot more for you think about during a fight. But I came here to shoot demons until they are dead. These extra mechanics add complexity and complication.

So I came here to shoot demons until they are dead. I definitely didn't come here to platform, climb up walls, and spin around poles. In between nearly every major combat there will be parkour areas you need to traverse. Exploration has always been a part of the franchise. But the timing component of platforming along with the new mobility mechanics, like air dashing and the Meat Hook, means you can get stumped by a jumping puzzle. And even just slowing me down is too much. Because jumping isn't what I came here for.

All in all, DOOM Eternal has occasionally given me the same rush that DOOM 2016 consistently did. Since it's a sequel the developers needed to add on. This undercut the strength of DOOM 2016, it's mechanical purity, and the add-ons have weakened Eternal. Maybe I am an old fogey for wanting simpler combat and exploration. But that's what DOOM 2016 delivered so I was hoping the thrill would still be there.",1597115810,1597115810,False,297,58,0.595762968063354492,0,True,False,False,76561198027430154,159,8,877,0,240,1599275406,,
9,74113808,english,"I'm really picky on FPS games, because alot of them feel extremely ""cookie-cutter"" as of late (i.e. COD, Battlefield)

Doom Eternal is the furthest thing from cookie-cutter. While the game itself isnt particularly hard, the fights are challenging and can be made even more difficult with increased difficulty scaling. I can easily say, its is the most fun FPS I've ever played, and I enjoy seeing how extreme things get with each progression in the game.

Also - the game runs fantastic on my system (running GTX 1070 and i7-6700 CPU at 2k resolution). One weird hiccup in the hours of playing, otherwise entirely smooth, and the computer isn't struggling and overheating like some other games (looking at you Borderlands 3)

Some small cons-
1) I do prefer the ""style"" of Doom 2016 over Eternal. Eternals graphics are better, but Doom felt darker/scarier.
2) Battlemode multiplayer is kinda hit or miss. I personally dont love it, but its interesting. Looking forward to Invasion mode when that comes out

- DOOM's reminiscent of Doom 3 with its style and decor. In Eternal, the atmosphere is more relegated to the background focusing on Doom 2 with its certain cartoonishness. You can get used to it.
- DOOM was quite dynamic requiring the use of at least a few weapons. Eternal also expanded this by adding weak points and footprints(which allow you to evaluate the health of opponents). At the same time, there is a restriction of cartridges for filling which you need to use a chainsaw more often. Due to the lack of ammunition, the game forces you to use the entire Arsenal.
P. s the First missions initially create a sense of discomfort due to the lack of Arsenal until we get most of it.

The most difficult thing is to ""retrain"" when you have to do it to achieve high efficiency in combat.

Interestingly, Eternal differs from DOOM, which is not like Doom 3 exactly like Doom 1&2&Final (There is also Doom 64). All of them... Different.

That's not fun, that's not even strategical, it's just stressful and boring at the same time and not at all in line with the weapon-based focus of its predecessor. To win, press the buttons of all four abilities as soon as they have recharged like you're playing Overwatch. Weapons? We tell you what you may use against whom, and if you're out of ammo, well you didn't hammer the ability button enough like we told you. When I saw a group of enemies in Doom 2016, it was like a dish that made me rejoice in anticipation as I debated how I would take them out the slickest. When I see a group of enemies in Eternal, I look at my resource meters, spot the largest demon I currently see, and plan a route through the waves of trash to ensure that I'm not dead before I've killed my target, and then spend 50% of the time with my eyes on my abilties and resources to decide what I do in every given situation. Combat feels sloppy and chaotic instead of elegant, and it's not at all what I expected from a sequel. I can see that a lot of effort went into this and I am happy for everyone who thinks this is the best FPS ever made. I simply do not share that opinion at all.

Original review below. The latest update introduced an anti-cheat program that runs at kernel level. I obviously don't think that Id and Bethesda are after my information or would attempt to brick my PC, but all it takes is one breach and I have the biggest security breach in my life I could have. If this doesn't get removed I will try to get a refund. I will not update my game unless Denovo is gone.

No game other than DOOM 2016 ever gave me the absolute state of zen, being showered in demon guts and shotgunning your way around the arenas.

Until this game. Some lack of polish is evident, and I dislike the change in art direction, but the core gameplay is still the absolute ecstasy it was 4 years ago.

THIS REVIEW IS FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY

PROS:
Every mechanic has it's role, nothing is useless literally every tool that you have at your disposal you will use.
The biggest change from it's predecessor Doom (2016) it has reduced the amount ammo you have which gives the chainsaw a much more important role in the overall gameplay.

Low health and armor can be dealt with easier with the flame belch and the glory kill system, although the glory kill system hasn't changed one bit, the flame belch is something that you are entitled to when in combat.

The meat hook is a new addition to doom, you lock onto enemies with a massive hook that is under the super shotgun and grabs and pulls you towards enemies. This can be used to manoeuvre around the arena and figure out a plan.

Dashing is also a new mechanic which lets you move around much faster than usual.

The Maruder is a enemy introduced as a boss but becomes a rare enemy that will probably go down in the list of the fucking greatest enemies i have fought in a video game. There is plenty of different ways to fight him and i love that.

Scenery is beautiful it is astonishing how the world just blends in with the action. There isn't many games i just stop playing to look at the beautiful scenery.

Doom Eternal has a lot of action that lasts very long and is fun. Because of these long action parts of the game it should give you some relaxation, and it does. Platforming, doing puzzles and secrets is the pause from action which I personally like.

The also big but good change is the melee. Melee attack does next to nothing, but if you get enough glory kills it can contribute to a blood punch almost one hit killing a Hell Knight

More bosses would be great. This game takes much inspiration from old games and old games had bosses at almost every level.

Cons:
The purple goo is a slime which slows you down and limits you from jumping and holds you to the ground. There isn't many parts of the game which has Purple Goo but still takes the game down a step. I liked some parts of the purple goo but most of it is really just tedious. The thoughts behind purple goo isn't bad, believe me I didn't have a problem with it at start. But now playing it again and seeing how the purple goo limits you from exploring and playing the game differently isn't good because playing the game different is the hugest and greatest part of Doom Eternal in my opinion.

The Archvile and Cyber Demon is not how they was expected to be. The Archvile used to be a very hard enemy in Doom 2 which when you look at him your player would burn. Now he is a spawner. That is very disappointing. The Cyber demon used to be this big demon that would beat your ass and punish you for mistakes you made when fighting him. Now he is like a big tower in the middle of the arena that is easy as hell to kill. I think I have died more to a fodder than this fucking tower.

Additions:
A horde survival mode where you are in an arena fighting demons as long as you can. Because the game has 13 long levels and a multiplayer which is barely fun. To keep up the replay value this addition would be great.

It may be only me wanting this, but a coop campaign (which is also Lan supported) would be so fun. Exploring the game with your friends would be pretty sick.

88,74069983,english,"Mood, controls, degrees of freedom, challenge, and pacing; these are crucial elements of video games. 

The mood is overwhelming. A ceaseless attention to detail and current, hypnotic riffs bolster the cruel reality described by the lore. The controls are fluid and grant the player near limitless creativity. Each battle is a thoughtfully crafted theater of blood. The level of freedom seen by the player is very high. The upgrade/leveling system allows for childlike experimentation. Choices are rarely punished, and the ""meta"" is nowhere to be seen. Whether FPS, arena shooter god or still getting used to that whole ""feet move one way, head moves the other"" thing, there is a difficulty setting available, and each are finely tuned for challenging,   but not punishing, play. Finally, the tempo is decided by the audience. Make haste and brutally dominate all in one's way, or take a bit of time to do some item hunting. In this dynamic symphony of death, you are the conductor.

I do not like the abandonment of of the doom 2016's style of storytelling. It was great that the slayer had a ""I don't give a f*ck"" attitude in that game, but that is almost nowhere to be seen in this game. I don't like that they take themselves seriously in Eternal (Minor SPOILER  [spoiler]especially in the scene where the slayer talks, ugh... [/spoiler]). There are too many cut-scenes that don't really add anything at all. These pointless cut-scenes (the lore/world-building cut-scenes) should be optional and out of the way, like codex entries. Don't  get me wrong, there ARE important scenes (chiefly the ones that highlight the villain) that I do feel appropriate for the games' story, but more often than not the scenes are just... tedious. 

The new platforming element in level design didn't add anything for me. I did enjoy these new movement options in combat, though. Even though I wasn't excited by the platforming, I do think that the grappling hook having no use outside of combat is a missed opportunity in level design. 

I really and truly hated the return of the pop-up tutorials that were first introduced in Rage 2. Just let the player learn the guns and the demons on their own (or read up on them), don't force 'em by pausing the damn game every time.

SPOILER: [spoiler] I am disappointed I can't fight/kill Samuel Hayden. The bastard... [/spoiler]

Another minor nit-pick: I miss the summoner demon from Doom 2016. I think it could fill a niche that the Archvile does not.

Minor Boss SPOILER: [spoiler] I did not enjoy the gladiator boss battle. Arena is too small and restrictive, which is the opposite of modern Doom combat. [/spoiler]

The marauder is not very fun, and it just wastes my time. There was no sense of accomplishment after killing him. One can use certain use spammy tactics against him (so they will), but that is  a symptom, not the problem. The problem is that his design is too linear, it tries to force the player too much. Let me be a resource sink as well as his current design.

Over-all, the game is great and has amazing fluid combat that can make you feel like a god. I easily can recommend it despite the issues have brought up here.

31,74060331,english,"Doom is truly eternal. The series laid dormant after Doom 3 attempted to turn it into a slow-paced horror shooter; whether you liked D3 or not, Doom took a long slumber for over a decade. In 2016, it returned as DOOM, the annoyingly-titled soft reboot that had a ton to prove, and still managed to exceed expectations; it wasn't just an excellent shooter that proved old-school arcadey shooters are still relevant, but it proved to the world that iD is still a legendary team. After Doom 3 and RAGE, iD had a lot to prove, to themselves and to everyone.

So, here we are now; DOOM Eternal in 2020. How do I put this game simply?

Well...if DOOM 2016 was iD showing the world that they're still relevant, DOOM Eternal is telling [i]the universe[/i] that iD is once again a legendary studio. Despite their ups and downs and RAGE and---God forbid---RAGE 2, iD has put together nothing short of the best shooter of the generation. Forget grey-brown military shooters, forget The Order, forget all of that nonsense, because DOOM Eternal is THE shooter.

The game is an unabashed celebration of the FPSes of yore; if Doom and Quake had a baby, then that baby was given a BFG-9000, you'd probably get something like this game.

The story is actually pretty great this time around. iD took the feedback from DOOM 2016 (unskippable long cutscenes where someone just talks to you for 10-15 minutes) and embraced it; the story is much tighter, has better pacing, there's more and better-written lore (all optional and not really required to understand the plot), and the best part: YOU CAN SKIP CUTSCENES. ALL OF THEM. If you wanna just RIP AND TEAR through the game, and damn the plot, just hold R during a cutscene and it'll skip it, even if it's your first time watching the scene.

The gameplay is pure brutality and mayhem, as you tear through Hell's hordes! I'm not gonna spoil any of your arsenal, because 90% of the fun is playing with the guns in this game. Try everything out; you'll need them all!

The platforming is much better than it was in DOOM 2016. No more instant-death traps, no more ""Welp, I messed up the jump but I'm just too floaty to control myself, guess I'll die"", none of that. You have two charges of a dash to navigate levels and battlefields, a double-jump right out the gate, and a lot more control over the DOOM Slayer in general. Moving about the level has a kind of hypnotic satisfaction, just double-jumping, dashing, grabbing ledges and swinging on monkey bars; it all feels good.

Honestly, I don't even have anything to really complain about with this game. Even after getting thrashed by the Marauders over and over (and BODY-BLOCKED BY THEIR WOLF AGAIN), once I take 10-15 minutes to calm down or even just take a second attempt at the fight, my vitriol gets drained immediately because clearing each fight, finding the secrets, it's all just so satisfying that I can't complain about when the game hits a little road bump.

Absolutely worth $60, and if you can get it at a discount, it's a must-buy.",1597027802,1597027802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066932625,326,23,732,0,641,1597129783,,

2. The marauder, it is not fun to encounter this guy, it ruins the game to me.

45,74053900,english,"I like this game and I recommend it, however I'd say it's more of a 7/10 than a 9/10 as a lot of other people seem to think. I still think Doom (2016) was better overall but Doom Eternal is still a pretty dang good successor if I'm being honest.

What I like:

The gunplay of Doom is unmatched by any other game. For over 27 years Doom has been the gold standard for the FPS genre, in fact for a while any FPS game released was just called a ""Doom Clone"" and Doom Eternal takes the formula established by the other games and injects it with cocaine and steroids. The gameplay is so smooth and fluid in [i]most[/i] places that it honestly feels more like a souped up version of old school Quake than a Doom game. my words don't do the gameplay justice. Seriously try it out.

The story is also pretty good but it's pretty much optional, if you're just looking for a game to where you can turn your brain off and have fun, you can do that here [i]for the most part[/i].

What I hate:

Doom Eternal has one of the most finely tuned movement systems of any FPS game I have ever played and it's a lot of fun to mess around with. My problem is that it's held back by the level design. There are invisible walls, everywhere. Like you gave me this really neat kit and expect me to not try and use it? The level designs are super linear and samey because of this and they don't have to be. It's a lot of fun grabbing a cacodemon with the Super Shotgun and flinging yourself to another enemy. But you'd be hard pressed if you wanted to grab the cacodemon expecting to move around the level. I guess I'm super used to other games offering multiple solutions to a singular problem, in DE however all the puzzles have one solution and one solution only, meaning there isn't a ton of replay value unfortunately. 

Then there is probably (from what I can tell) the most polarizing enemy in all of Doom, i.e, you think it's really easy, or really overpowered. (spoilers ahead) [spoiler] The Marauder. Now I can see the purpose of the Marauder from a game design standpoint, it's a way to get the player to slow down and use their head a bit and pay more attention to what's going on in the battlefield. This sounds good in theory but in reality it feels kind of out of place in a doom game. For 27 years the Doom series has rewarded players for taking initiative. ""Go get in a fight! Be proactive!"". In reality the Marauder forces the player to be [i]reactive[/i], if this were a reactive game like say, Dark Souls or Super Smash Bros. this would be fine. But it really disrupts the flow of gameplay and is quite annoying to deal with when you see one. If it were a one off boss fight it would have been fine, but there are at least 2 per level and it gets old quick. [/spoiler]

TL;DR:

Doom Eternal is an amazing game that's held back by some rather poor and out of place game design decisions. Nevertheless I think the precedent established by this game will help inspire ID and other studios to further innovate game design disciplines and techniques. This game makes me super excited for what games in the future will be like.

64,73884840,english,"This game was a lot of fun, a big improvement from DOOM (2016). The movement additions, the new weapons, and even finding the collectibles was fun. One common criticism of the game is the parkour, which I didn't think was bad at all. Most people say that it's boring or unintuitive but I have to disagree. The parkour was really easy, and but it still felt satisfying to pull off. It only really added to my enjoyment of the game. When it comes to being unintuitive, that can be a fair point. The only criticism I could really give to it, is that grabbing onto a wall should be automatic all the time instead of just dashing into it. The game tells you to press E next to mountable walls, but if you dash into a wall you hop on automatically. This should be the default, and it'd make these sections more fluid. The guns were pretty fantastic, a big improvement from the last game. It does suffer from a similar issue from the last game, which is that some mods are just better the alternatives. Some examples:

Combat Shotgun: The sticky bombs don't use any more ammo then a normal shot, and they're great for crowd control early on.

Heavy Machine Gun: This weapon is one of my favorites for it's scope alone, getting rid of weak points is super satisfying. Honestly if it was a sniper rifle i'd enjoy it just as much, if not more since there could be interesting mods for it.

Plasma Gun: The stun from the beam cannon saved my life from some of the larger enemies a couple of times throughout my playthrough. Whenever I ran out of ammo for my standard shotgun it was also very useful for crowd control.

Ballista: The hell wave was immensely satisfying whenever I got a chance to use it. Clearing out every single enemy infront of me and seeing everything cut in half was always a blast.

Super Shotgun: The meat hook was perfectly executed. Grabbing onto a Tyrant and running circles around him, or latching onto an Arch Vile right before he finishes summoning were some of the highlights that made my day.

The Chain Gun: The pure destructive power of this gun is great on it's own but once you remove the cooling it's probably my favorite gun in the game.

BFG: Classic, near the end of the game you have to fight two Doom Hunters at the same time and throwing them into the second phase instantly is just one of the times this gun has saved my ass.

Unmaker: Really disappointing, I was only able to use it during the Icon of Sin fight. It was hyped up the entire game and I don't know what I was expecting but it sure as hell wasn't this. It's not bad, and the slayer gates were amazing so it wasn't a chore to get but I really wish it was something more exiting.

The best part of the game for me was the weak points that specific enemies had. I mentioned this before but the sound for sniping those off made the game a lot more exiting for me, especially in the slayer gates on higher difficulties. The only thing I thought was genuinely bad was the Marauder enemy. Sometimes he'd telegraph an attack and then pull out his shield, or whenever I had shot him when I was supposed to he wouldn't become stunned so i'd still take damage. The worst thing he did was run up to me and then do his shotgun move, which is supposed to punish players that get too close to him so it doesn't give you an opportunity to shoot at all. There were a lot of times where I just had to get hit because I couldn't avoid it. Another thing is that the BFG and Unmaker have no effect on him whatsoever, which was really annoying because I had such a problem with him. The only thing I could do was spam grenades on his dog and keep out the super shotgun anytime I saw him, because it was the most consistent weapon to fight him with.

73,74041529,english,"[h1]First-person Darksiders with more guns?[/h1]

I'll get this out of the way immediately: this game is fun but does not feel like a DOOM game. 

You know what I want and expect out of a DOOM game? Speed and violence, a few secrets, and one or two puzzles to progress areas. You know what totally kills the idea that you're this unstoppable killing machine? Pausing to read walls of text to figure out what this heck has happened because the lore is now suddenly existent, horribly long platforming sections (which felt more frequent and longer than combat...), and this weird rotation of abilities that is more reminiscent of playing WoW than any previous DOOM game. 

Slayer Gates were what I expected out of the main game's big arena fights, not optional content that is intentionally harder. During the main campaign these [i]six[/i] encounters were where I had the most fun. Replaying missions with infinite ammo on to avoid the ammo famine loop let me focus on approaching encounters how I wanted to rather than how I was forced to which made the underwhelming encounters significantly more exciting. The platforming should have been gutted.

I can't begin to explain how bad the last two boss fights were. 

The game's design does work smoothly and I didn't have a single performance issue (never dropped below 144 fps on highest settings). If this game had been a different franchise (rather than one which has existed for 27 years without God of War platforming or Darksiders lore and is still celebrated for its simplicity) I'd probably have nothing but praise. Instead I'm reminded of how disappointing DOOM 3 was too.",1596996099,1597002165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028475211,319,84,1044,0,1044,1596994508,,

[Overall] Just feels like a slog thru so much muck and confusion that we never stop and say, ""that was fun."" Way too much stuff happening. Too many buttons. Too many attacks. A couple extra jump features.
Aside from the main weapon line, they throw everything else at you in the first few maps.
No chance to learn. Poorly designed campaign for all but the most avid speed-FPS gamers.

[Game-play] is so overly intense as to cross the line into just plain sloppy. We then either play at ridiculous challenge levels or nerf the difficulty and play with horrendous slop (demons literally on top of you with others shooting you and still you just don't die.)

[Visuals] Graphics are AAA. Cool giant monsters and mechs litter the landscape. Better scenery than the last game; slightly worse unit skins. Strangely, they've done something with the creature ""looks"". Don't know what it is, but something's just off a little bit; weird since it was far less noticeable in the last game.



8 weapons, each with a couple of useful mods
3 melee attacks, each requires (health/armor/ammo) regular use
2 grenades (each cycling independently; both required to use since there's never enough ammo)
We're looking at 13-18 useful attacks. Not to be varied using one load-out per map or situation, but all 18 need to be fully incorporated into each level.

17,65485359,english,"The Good: 
The environments look better, and there are more of them.
It’s nice to see more enemies.
There is like one more boss fight, which was nice.
Movement is a lot faster, which gives the player more options to kill.
There is a sense of a larger universe, which they can expand on. 
There is a story (if you want to get the most out of it, you have to read the codex)  
More weapon attachments.
Enemy AI is a lot more intelligent than in Doom 2016.

The Bad: 
For some reason the boss fights are are not as hard as some of the Heavy enemies you encounter.
The Marauder is a massive piece of s**t (You will see)
The 2nd final and the final boss are almost the same, you shoot armor, and then you kill them. 
You can get stuck on terrain and other objects.
The climbing could be better.
In order to get the most out of the story, you must read all of the codex entries, which is a bit lazy by Id software. 
Demons which look like you would require no more than 2 chainsaw ammo might require a lot more.

Jokes aside, there are several pros and cons when comparing this game to the 2016 version.

Pros:
- Feel and flow of combat has been cranked up past 11 all the way to 666
- The polish of this game is damn near perfect
- Music is just as badass if not more badass than the original OST in some cases
- The sound design of weapons and abilities is somehow even meatier and punchier than before
- Enemy variety has been more than doubled
- Chainsaw now activates the same way as a melee
- Upgrades are more plentiful and more meaningful 
- Chasing collectibles is actually fun now
- Weapon skins and Doomguy skins pogchamp

Cons: 
- Weapon ammo has been reduced across the board (however, in favor of being able to counter enemies with different weapons)
- Story feels kinda corny... but you're not here for the story
- Marauder kinda ruins the flow of combat most of the time
- Final Boss fight is a trainwreck 
- No arcade mode, but there are ""cheat codes"" now I guess

I must admit, I was cocky and thought I could just throw on the second highest difficulty and I'd be okay. The game KICKED MY ASS every level and I LOVED IT. I've never been beaten so entirely by a game and enjoyed breaking through it's challenges.

DOOM Eternal is the best shooter this generation, and quite possibly THE best shooter on the market, period. id Software have outdone themselves once again, raising the bar for quality in the shooter genre and the video game industry as a whole like its the '90s all over again. The gameplay is so refined and excellently crafted, every part of it is done deliberately and with purpose and care and it shows so much. DOOM Eternal takes everything DOOM 2016 did and blows it out of the goddamn water. It takes 2016s speed, intensity and pure ferocity and amplifies it a thousandfold, making 2016 look like a slowpoke baby game. Musically, I think this is Mick Gordon's best work, usurping Killer Instincts' spot as my favorite of his. The more electronic sound of 2016 is put in the backseat a bit, and the heavy metal sound that 2016 was seemingly afraid to show off is put front and center with Eternal. Honestly, I can't even poorly describe how I feel about it like I did with the gameplay, you'll just have to play the game yourself to find out(or listen to the soundtrack on SoundCloud since its not officially released yet).

A ""mish mash"" that I'm not really sure quite what to think of.

But my biggest BIGGEST Bugbear by a long way - is the checkpoint system which forces you to repeat a level over and over again should you misjudge some jump or not spot something. Granted you're given another chance (albeit with diminished health) but seriously? Let me save the damn game. WHERE I WANT TO. Seriously FUCK checkpoints.

Graphics wise? It's fabulous. Pace wise it's about right. It's not a walking-flash-light-simulator-new-engine-show-off like the gawd awful Doom3. which Carmack left to his own devices, created. There IS a pleasant fast fluidity of movement and the controls (mouse + keyboard -what else would you use?) feels ""right""

Would I recommend it?

If you love GZDOOM, Brutal Doom / Project Brutality. You'll likely be disappointed. So  I'd give it a ""No"" Those mods offer FAR better and challenging gameplay (imho) with a vibrant and lively community behind them. 

If you're new to the Genre. Go ahead & buy it! It#s currently on sale at the time of writing  and at 50% off,  it's a buy.

As is. I'll reluctantly give it a ""thumbs up""  but it's more of an overall ""hmmmmm"" ? Not sure

You cannot play the game, even in single-player, without installing it.

Since I refuse to allow that on my PC, the update has effectively locked me out of a game I'd just recently bought.

Whilst the weapon system can seem overbearing, the ability to easily use the chainsaw over time allows you to use preferred weapons easily, and feel like a badass doing so. As introduced in the DOOM 2016, glory kills are reanimated, new and epic, giving the player the feeling of actually ripping out a Cacodemon's eye. Sound design is awesome, to the weaponry, demons or even the environment around you, this game keeps you immersed with the various realms of hell and the seemingly innocent plain of Urdak. Also, lore in this game is extremely in-depth, as entries into the codex allow the option for the player to explore more into the backstory of the Doomguy, Hell's presence on Earth, or just the various demons that you encounter on your rampage through the story. On the other hand, music in this game is extraordinary, as the predecessor, DOOM 2016, has proven before that Mick Gordon's brilliance on the mixture of different metal genres, gives you the badass feeling when playing this game, making it a core part of the experience overall. Lastly, the game includes a 3v1 multiplayer for you to play against your friends, or other randoms around the world.

This fast-paced FPS is definitely challenging, but I like that about it. You can't just mindlessly mow down your enemies. You have to be strategic about your ammo consumption and which abilities/guns you use.

IMO they improved upon the 2016 version in every way. They introduced some exciting new enemies and throw them at you more and more as you progress through the game. The final boss fight is just ridiculous, but they give you a way to beat it if you have trouble. 

The Marauder is by-far the most brutal addition to the game. The super-shotgun is your best friend to take him down. Though, it will take some practice to get proficient at killing him. I will say I managed to kill one in under 30 seconds with some practice and some luck lol. 

I see some folks aren't a fan of the 'parkour' they introduced. I really did not mind this addition. I think it helped break up the intense fight sections. Sure, I definitely died quite a few times from falling, but it just resets you pretty close and you lose some health. You need to do it to find all the secrets and level up your slayer. Once you know what you're doing, you can breeze through these parkour sections on subsequent playthroughs.

update 08-08-2020

Ok so i'd like to revise my previous review about this game, previously I complained about denuvo, since then, that has been removed, however, the game now suffers from frequent crashes after slayer gates, its unstable, with i'd say one random crash every 3 hrs of gametime.

The performance is now fine, as it was on version 1.0

Since 1.0 they've removed a few ""exploits"" such as the ice bomb marauder kill, i dont think thats a nice idea

The game suffers from poor narrative, presentation and a weak sense of escalation

However, the combat is really good, and i really mean that it's really good. I got no other reason to play this game other than its combat, cause it sucks in many other regards.

The music has also proven quite dissapointing compared to doom 2016, with a weak sense of escalation, the music has suffered alot. Its way too much in your face, and that becomes repetitive quite soon.

In 2016, the music only ""kicked in"" for about 15 seconds during each fight, and those 15 seconds were the shit, however, in eternal its in your face, all the time.

The weapon and suit upgrades are better than in its predecesor

Overall i'd say its does some stuff really well, and some really poorly.

id still recommend it cause the combat is real nice

At the time of this writing, I'm about 11 hours in and have made it through 2 or 3 Single Player Missions in the Campaign.  

For me:
Pros 
- Excellent graphics (RTX2060 Super 8GB)
- Phenomenal  Music
- Fast-Paced Play
- Moderately Difficult Even on the Easiest Settings (Waves of random spawning enemies really bring back the nostalgia for me)
- Cut-scenes are really well done and look great

Cons:
- Not a fan of the platforming (Parkour) or however you want to refer to it.
- Some of the climbing walls are not obvious and you can get stuck or lost in a level quick if you don't look around
- Chainsaw requires fuel so you can't use it at will unless you keep finding fuel for it
- (My own opinion) A little too much focus on melee combat.  I've personally always considered Doom to be first and foremost a shooter with some chainsaw thrown in for flavor.  

Overall, I do like the game and will be playing it completely through the single-player campaign as well as going back for the completionist in me to get all the rewards and achievements available for non-PVP/non-multiplayer modes.

The game is very difficult, but that may have something to do with me playing on Nightmare difficulty for my first playthrough, but so far, I haven't died for something that wasn't my fault and its never taken more than a dozen attempts to beat an arena.

There have been a lot of complaints about this game comparing it to Doom '16 and how its not more of the same, but I found that game very easy filled with slow, easy to kill enemies and while it was fun while it lasted, it wasn't a memorable experience for me. In Eternal, all the parts of '16 that I liked have been greatly expanded and improved on and the parts I didn't have been improved or cut out entirely. the new platforming is fine I guess, I dont mind it, but I dont much care for it either.

38,69150232,english,"It's been a bit since I updated my review of Doom Eternal.  I gave it a thumbs down when the Denuvo Anti-Cheat software was added.  With the update, that was removed.  

Doom Eternal is a great game.  I cannot deny that fact.  What I also cannot deny is the drop in quality with each successive update, for me at least. 

In the beginning, Doom Eternal stood on solid ground.  It was fun; it was fast paced; it was awesome to behold the Doom Slayer in all his adrenaline fueled, monstrous rage, ripping and tearing through hordes of enemies.  There was one or two little issues, but those were beyond negligible.  

What has happened, as others have pointed out, seems to be a steady decline into uncertainty.  First issue that came to light was the freezing whenever I tried to take a screen shot.  It spooked the crap out of me when the game went dark.  When I tried to re-load the game, it kept going to black screen.  I tried to fix it by uninstalling then reinstalling the game.  It still didn't work.  What fixed it was right-clicking on the Doom Eternal game, going to properties, local files, and directly loading Doom Eternal via the application.  

The more research I did, the more I found out this was due to a conflict with Steam Overlay where you can't use F12 or [insert key bind of your preference] to take screen shots.  No big deal, it doesn't ruin the game.  I'd like to take some screen shots, but, again, no big deal. 

On the otherhand, what has caused Doom Eternal to degrade for me in terms of enjoyment and replay value (replayability) are the new bugs that seemed to crop up with each new update.  One example is during the ARC facility when I go to exit the garage and into the main area before proceeding to the ARC HQ.  On two, near three separate occasions the game has booted me back to desktop.  This is one major gripe, and it's not the only instance of this happening.    

Another issue happened during the first portion of Taras Nabad.  The gates opened.  The Marauder came out.  I was victorious and stabbed him through his eye socket! The problem? Combat music was still on.  Why is it still on? Well, I look up to see a dang Pinkie stuck in the wall near the gate doing ****ing ballet, almost laughing at me that it's untouchable.  (It seems this issue might have been fixed where demons will die if they are stuck in wall or out of bounds for X amount of time.) 

What I'm getting at is the sheer disappointment I have for a game such as Doom Eternal.  It started of grand, almost untouchable.  Now it seems like a former shell of itself with the bugs, glitches, and general plague of nuances.  Other games I have run fine.  

Overall, I'd be cautious about Doom Eternal.  It has typical Bethesda issues/bugs.  However, the core game is rock solid.  

I'd recommend the game despite the current issues.  And though I recommend the game, I give that recommendation with caution.  Expect bugs, don't use Steam Overlay to take screenshots as it will cause issues/crashes.  

Grade Wise, it has gone down from a solid 10, but it's still good. (8.5/10) 

TL;DR
Decent game, updates caused more issues than fixed some, imho.  Requires the most up-to-date graphics card drivers for Nvidia (no big deal).  Since it is on sale right now during the Quake Con event (writing this 8/8/2020), I'd say get it or wait till it is on sale the next time around during Halloween, Xmas, or whatever.

40,73976585,english,"Doom 2016 was one of the best fps games of the last decade, and an excellent re-invention of the franchise. It was fast, fluid, looked beautiful, had great combat and a near perfect balance between corridor shooting and arena encounters. It also had a decent, unobtrusive story that was well presented. Doom Eternal has almost none of that. Yes it's fast, but just about everything else about it is significantly worse. The combat has been significantly changed - there's now virtually no corridor shooting, with almost every encounter being a succession of arena combats. Furthermore, the difficulty level has been ramped up to almost comical levels. The Doom Slayer has gone from being a demon killing badass into a one hit kill mobile punching bag. The number of enemies on screen at once has been significantly increased, but so has the level of demon. Rather than facing a gradually increasing hierarchy of demons over the course of the game, almost from the get go you'll be swamped by imps, arachnotrons, cacodemons, mancubi, hell knights and god knows what else - all in the same fight, often with more than one of each and several at the same time. To top this off, your ammo levels have been drastically reduced (in the first game you start off with 20 shotgun shells, and each upgrade gives 10 more. Here you start off with 16 and each upgrade gives you TWO(!) more), and armour and health disappear almost immediately. This means every fight becomes a desperate encounter for survival in which you're constantly running out of ammo and down to 1 health with no armour, and the only way to survive is to use the correct take downs to add just enough to keep going for a few shots more. On top of the stressful and frustrating combat, level design is generally greatly simplified save for the completely weird addition of endless environmental puzzles and platforming. These feel completely out of place in an fps and again it's difficult to understand why anyone at ID thought this was a good idea. Other letdowns include the graphics and general design - for some reason textures are significantly worse than in 2016, and several graphics options have been removed. Furthermore, the cool immersive storytelling from the first game (e.g. physically ripping the shotgun out of someone's dead hands,) has gone, with all items and power-ups now looking like poorly modelled icons. I kid you not, secret items are now just large, yellow floating question marks - I genuinely thought someone had left placeholder art in the game by mistake the first time I saw one. The levels themselves look for the most part like large, empty rooms. You start off coming to Earth and fighting through a ruined city. This amounts to a few simple, remarkably clean and tidy office buildings. Where is all the blood? Where are the dead bodies that littered the floor like in the first one? Finally, the story. 2016 had a fairly straightforward story with a limited number of characters, and some interesting back story hidden in codexes if you wanted to seek it out and learn more.  Eternal doesn't pick up directly after the first game, instead seeming to skip ahead an unspecified amount of time. Earth has now been almost entirely overrun by hell when the Doom Slayer suddenly arrives in orbit in some kind of weird flying castle. Where did this come from? Why does it have Vega on board?  Other than this strange disconnect, the game hamfistedly introduces a huge amount of back story - apparently the Doom Slayer is now part of some ancient group, serves a ghost King of some kind (and yet completely ignores a direct command from him), is part of a prophecy, plus there are now multiple alien/godlike groups introduced all with different aims and interconnected relationships. To have any idea as to what is going on you have to read pages and pages of codex entries. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the god-awful tutorials which keep popping up every five minutes, either covering over most of the game screen with windows of text or worse, literally transporting you to some kind of test room to explain how to use whatever you've just picked up. 

Overall, for me, if it wasn't obvious from the above, the game has been a massive disappointment. I know a lot of people absolutely love it and consider it one of the best FPS's around, and that's fine, but for me, there are just too many changes to the first game and almost none of them are for the better. I'm trying to persevere to finish it as I've spent the money on it and can't refund it, but at this point I'm not sure I'll ever get that far. I've already re-installed 2016 and re-started playing it from the beginning, and frankly it's a lot more enjoyable.",1596895734,1596895734,False,19,6,0.546838104724884033,8,True,False,False,76561197971140697,164,10,1359,29,487,1601401763,,

67,73956840,english,"I love the DOOM series of games. In-fact, I thought DOOM 2016 was the true modern-day version of DOOM. I was worried about that game forcing Glory Kills on you, because DOOM was always about guns not Melee. 

I have 27 minutes on this game and I immediately asked for a refund. Don't let the mindless monkies tell you the lies of the Game ""Magazines"" saying this game is a 8/10 at the lowest. 

This game is balls compared to the original. 


Remember the badass music? Not there. 

Remember how the original game opened up with like 30 seconds of a cutscene with no dialogue and the cutscene blended into the game play so you actually wake up and feel in the game immediately. Well, what did they do with this game? 5 minutes of Dialogue. During these 5 minutes they show Doom Slayer without his helmet (back of head) which is something I don't agree with. 

Remember how much personality Doom Slayer had, even though we were controlling him? That's gone. 

Remember how fun it was going around shooting enemies? NOT ANYMORE! The Ammo capacities on the weapons are insanely low. It FORCES you to use the Chainsaw and Glory kills. I was playing on Nightmare and I got the REALLY shitty assault file (or Heavy Rifle) and it took two shots to the head on the zombie enemies to get a headshot. IN DOOM 2016, that would have been 1 shot in Ultra-Nightmare. 

DOOM 2016's design made you feel you were in a place that potentially existed. Not Eternal! The literal title screen looks like a Toy-Playset for DOOM. The Doom Slayer toy is standing on the playset and is shiney in the way that plastic is. The enemies in the game all have that characteristic plastic sheen. The worlds LOOK like you're playing with toys in a playset. It's fucking crazy bad. 

You also know how it was a goal in 2016 to not interrupt gameplay with dialogue heavy cut scenes. In the 30 minutes I played it interrupted me twice for dialogue. 

It's like they fired the whole team from the original game and hired a fucking EA staff or something.

Being serious, it's a bit tough to recommend this game to just anyone. It's not as easy as just saying ""If you liked the previous Doom games, you'll enjoy Eternal."" It is fairly different from previous entries in a lot of regards. These changes, such as the extremely fast and aggressive ai, the low ammo capacities, and the new suit gimmicks are going to feel awkward at first. After a few hours of dedicated playing, the game should eventually click for you and will start to get really, really good.

That being said, it's still not a game for everyone.

And the climbling sessions... what are they there for?

The pace of the combat and general feel of the game is better than Doom 2016, but those things bug me enough to still think 2016 is better.

Then there's the fact they turned Doom Slayer into The Predator, with shoulder cannon and wristblade........ why? I LOVE Predator, but Doom Slayer shouldn't be him/it.

I loved DOOM 16, and I think I still prefer it due to its superior atmosphere and story presentation (Eternal is a little spergy on the writing side) but this is a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience moment-to-moment.

I haven't played the multiplayer.  Can't say I plan to.  It's actually the biggest con for this game, as I was hoping for id to refine their arena gameplay from '16, but instead we got asymmetrical oddity.  That said, the campaign is worth admission price, and maybe the general lack of interest in the MP will get id to stop goofing off on that front.

Don't let playtime fool you, I played the game thoroughly on PS4 and recently got back to playing on PC.  It's far better with M/KB (amazing, I know) and it's a shoe-in for my favorites list.

The player is put on an ammo diet. So it's chainsawing all the time or swap weaponry which I dislike. I play other Doom games primarily with the SSG but that's discouraged now and you have to do it their way. Pity since that gun is superb and the meat hook attachment is one of the best inventions since sliced bread.

The combat can be enjoying when they offer a decent amount of enemies. In every level though they crank up the difficulty with those high octane arena battles where a dozen of super heavy enemies are thrown at you in a confined space. It becomes more survival and running headless around instead of dodging attacks deliberately.

I also didn't like the lengthy multiple phase boss fights in which they throw anything at you.

Overall I didn't enjoy it too much. It has too many mechanics in it and too many aspects I don't like in a shooter.

42,73924567,english,"Its a FPS, but this is not DOOM
DOOM is Metal and this is not Metal at all.

In Doom the Demons should fear you, not this game.
You are too busy swapping weapons to use the alt fire of one gun type, or swapping to a gun that actually hurts another demon type. Meanwhile you are dance around doing parkour because you have so little ammo you need to wait for your chainsaw to recharge.  Nothing is Metal about that. My gun should be glowing red because it NEVER STOP FIRING. In Doom you F-up any demon with whatever you happen to have in your hands at the time.  And if you punch a demon, that demon knows it just got punched in the face.  In this game your fist is replaced by a wet sponge. Oh but they did build a sword into your suit now, too bad you cant use it unless you a doing a glory kill, that also feels way less Metal than the 2016 reboot. At least in 2016 I didn't have to glory kill every enemy as I HAD AMMO.  I could afford to use that extra slug if I wanted to.  Everything feels so forced now.

This game forces the new game mechanics on you so hard, that its just not nearly as fun anymore.  When I hear Doom, I am expecting to run and gun. You just don’t get that in Eternal. Too much effort, and I do mean effort. Energy is spent manipulating these new game mechanics.  Sure they might be fine in some FPS, but NO ONE ASKED FOR THEM IN DOOM. It changes the game far too much to be called a DOOM game.

I will slowly finish this game I think as I did pay for it.   But I am not glued to my seat.   Its actually more of a choir to finish than anything.  
Game play so far 4/10 thus this game gets my thumbs down.

Why do you want me, worst, force me to create an online account to play a solo game ? I don't care about online gaming, so just let me opt out of it, instead I have to put steam offline to trick my way in. Why do I have to ruse to play a game I F**KING PAID FOR ??? Just why ? To milk me more ? That's why Steam shows 5 min of playtime but believe me I've played it.

About the game, beautiful technically & artistically speaking, badass music, and for me that's it.

Too much gameplay mechanics : Flamethrower, Ice Bomb, Chainsaw, Blood Punch, Weapons Mod + Weapons point, Praetor suit + Praetor points, Sentinel crystals (increase health and co), Runes,  Double jump + Dash, grappling hook, Climbing on wall (oh god...), monkey bars ( Look how they massacred my boy ). It's more Darksiders than it's Doom.

Too much platform : I've read in the forum ""Previous Doom were about platforming"". Sure and Hidden objects games are Static first person object shooter...  For the love of god, NO, Doom has never been a platformer and if there was some precise movement moments in previous opus like in ""Chasm"" it was pure skill not this ""press the button at the right timing Assassin's Creedy smelly brown substance coming from the intestines"".

Too much cutscenes, too much npc : I witnessed a cutscene in a game calling itself Doom, nuff said... I witnessed an NPC in a game calling itself Doom (Not counting Doom 3, didn't play it, don't want to), Doom guy is alone in the middle of monsters that's it. No npc, no chat between battles.

Too much Hub: WTF ??? Fortress of Doom ??? Where 2016 succeded to have a marvelous continuity between levels, Eternal fails by giving nice and cosy apartment to the Doom guy. And more, knowing nothing about the character was part of the character, here to kill, period, and that's fine.

So to sum up, not a bad FPS, a good one if I may say, but failed as a Doom entry where 2016 succeeded by keeping it simple. Doom was always about running and gunning, Eternal feels bloated and too mainstreamed.

Take this critic with a grain of salt, it's just gaming, I don't care... And Thumb down because of the forced account creation.

61,71478093,english,"Review Update I bought a RTX 2070 Super for $530. There is a known bug where you can't run Doom Eternal at Ultra Nightmare on RTX series cards. This is Doom Eternal in a nutshell -> broken to the point of hostility towards the player, like Dommthousand and One, A Space Odyssey?). It also failed during both the Steam and Bethesda outages because of modern anti-gamer licensing. Original review below.

Doom used to set the course for the video game industry; Doom now follows the course set by the Little Sisters.

This is generic AAA game and a terrible Doom sequel. It's obvious Doom's synthesizer Zenimax owns all the FPS IP because this game is now interchangable with every other AAA game - there is even a flamethrower. Yeah, this game is so dumb that you use a flamethrower to stop demons from a classical, burning hell. Imagine if you used the squirting water in Super Mario Sunshine to fight the water - that's how stupid Doom has become. Call this Far Doom, or Assassin's Creed: Doom, Call of Doom, or Doom Wick - Doomguy even has a stupid dog now. Even the battle driven weapon upgrade path from last game is gone, replaced with something dumber that seems to give you more virtual stickers than weapon upgrades (Minecraft Doomgeons?).

Okay, we can ignore the feature creep that means the Doomguy now does rapid wall climbs after double air dashes launched from stripper poles (Doom Nukem 3d). These are the game mechanics the lowest common denominator wants, so let the braying paypigs have it. At least I have a gloomy, Doomy story about humanities irresponsible resource management... Nope. The story is moronic, incomplete and starts in media res retarded. Characters who were heroically self-sacrificed last game are just here, chillin, not even referring to their magical reincarnation (Doom Souls), where you got a brand new space station (Doom Space 4), or why all of a sudden the Doomslayer can't stop mugging for the camera like the Rock (Doomangi).

Don't believe me that Doom just took two huge airdashes backward yet? The UI is trash, as if made by George Romero on a G3 (Doomkaitana). It is genuinely hard to read text on the screen in 1080p. To read the oceans of lore you have to press one button to make the graphic go away, then another to scroll, and so on - things are so cluttered it genuinely feels like no on at Id knows how to put a graphic and a lot of text on a computer screen anymore so they force you to hide the graphic (Zork: Eternal Doom). Doom3's lore roledex was way more usable than this one. I'll admit the style and story are up for debate, but the illegibility of which button you have to push to make a dialog modal go away is either what you get when a megacorp can be sure their game will sell or is a wry meta-commentary on the state of the video game industry (Fallout Eternal: Doom Vegas).

Point blank: the sound sucks. The shotgun in Doom2 sounds way better. Every game in the series, including the Doom RPG port for Nokia phones, sounded better than this (Doomgry Birds Eternal). Constant UI blips and bloops drown out the oddly quiet phut phut of the assault rifle; a great example of the sound's quality is me googling to see if I accidentally equipped a silencer on the assault rifle. Imagine someone else was playing Doom and Id recorded the sound leaking from their headphones for Doom Eternal. It has a uniquely uncommitted, flat sound for any video game - let alone the heir to Doom 2.

That's where I want to leave it - Doom Eternal is a uniquely uncommitted, flat heir to hell on earth (Doomald Trump Jr).",1593254386,1596797149,False,9,6,0.509256064891815186,3,True,False,False,76561197970720338,73,4,606,0,193,1596887077,,

65,73905561,english,"Positives
The intense combat makes Doom 2016 look like a babies game in comparison and forces you to think at the same time or else you die. 
The details in the worlds and the demons really make it look next gen but you don't have to worry about performance because the id tech 7 engine is really optimized and can run really well. 
Although the story is weak in some places, the lore is still amazing and worth diving into.
Doom Eternal is absolutely worth it for the amazing singleplayer campaign which is a blast from start to finish.

Negatives:
The confusing story is one of the weaker aspects which requires you to read the codex to fully understand and there are some absolutely stupid pointless cutscenes that show things like doors opening and the doom slayer being unable to jam a power core into a machine.
The battlemode also isn't perfect and is the only multiplayer gamemode so the singleplayer really is the only thing that is worth playing with battlemode being a tiny little bonus on the side.

9,69205488,english,"Edit: This whole issue has been fixed with the removal of said Anti-Cheat tool. Therefore I remedy my prior recommendation.

Writing this review is a really though decision for me to make. Usually I do not write reviews (mostly because
I am too lazy to do so), but in this case I feel as if I have to.

First of all: 
DOOM ETERNAL, as in the core experience, is an amazing experience, worth every buck. The core 
gameplay is tight, the flow between fighting and exploring is seemless. The changes to the weapon system 
from the first game gives every weapon a reason to be used whilst streamlining the ammo system at the same.
Performancewise DOOM ETERNAL is a technical marvel and a treat to enjoy due to the great implementation of
the Vulcan API. The graphical fidelity is quite higher than in Doom 2016 yet keeping the demand in hardware quite
moderate. Good Job! The game puts you in the same trance/rampage state just like Doom 2016 empowering you 
and making you feel as if you ARE the Slayer. This immersiveness combined with the general gameplay loop and flow
is so much fun if you are into this rather old school ""run-and-gun"" Shooter type of game that puts gameplay above
all else. 

For this I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys these kind of games. No second thought here.

HOWEVER, 
as of now, May 16th, 2020, Bethesda released an update which includes Denuvo's implementation of an Anti-Cheat
that uses kernel-level drivers to enforce that purpose. The reason for this is supposedly to stop cheating in the MP 
portion of this game. I will not indulge into the details on what a kernel-level driver is, as this can be easily done with 
a couple of searches in a search engine. 

My biggest issue with this is: 
- This impacts the performance, tanking the FPS on many system including mine. (RTX2070S + i7-9700k)
- This breaks the support Linux/Proton, making it impossible to play this game on my laptop running Ubuntu
- Having access to the kernel, is like having the keys to the castle. You have to put faith into some company 
   somewhere in the world that they will do you no harm with this kind of access or keep their services save 
   from any third party access that could the enduser by proxy. 
- The inclusion of such an invasive software after the release and people spending their money on this, without 
   any kind of prior notice except for a simple remark in the patchnotes is just bad practice. On top of that a lazy 
   solution to a problem in MP that also impacts SP. Which is, in my opinion, the core focus of the game. Not the MP.

Simply put: I came here to buy a Game that has a great Single Player experience. I don't care or buy DLC. I don't care or 
play Multi Player. I can, just barely, stand with Denuvo Anti-Tamper. KNOWING this I dropped 60€ for this on release just to have some simple SINGLE PLAYER fun. And now, after just a month, I have an update forced upon me that includes a software driver, that never was part of the the deal and I refuse to install, for a mode I don't even play. And because of that, I am unable to access the Single Player Mode since the driver needs to be installed to boot the game. 

In conclusion:
Would I have known, that this lazy ""Anti-Cheat"" would be part of the game in the first place. I would not have bought this game at all. Despite it being so great...
I urge everyone to not purchase this game unless this issue is addressed. The game is broken at this point on a technical standpoint. People are locked out of the game because they are hustled to submit access to their whole PC which wasn't even part of the deal in the first place. Business practices to include such invasive measures well AFTER launch (possibly to avoid press backlash) is yet again a slap to the face to paying customers and overall a very shady and unacceptable business.

However, I can't with a good conscience recommend this game in its current state. Because of an anti cheat present that's named Denuvo.

You might be asking: What's so bad about an anti cheat?
Well, denuvo has level 0 access on your computer, which means that it has high priority to the files on your computer. This poses quite a security risk since the software can gain access to hardware an important files. For an anti cheat(which is always running in the background btw) this is completely unacceptable.

If Bethesda for some reason listens to the consumer and removes denuvo, this game is well worth it, but otherwise I do not recommend it.

If you want to educate yourself on this go check the wikipedia page on protection rings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring

The game itself is awesome. My personal favorite of 2020 so far.
The problem is that Update #2 brought frequent crashes that can happen randomly - when auto-saving, closing map and even during combat. Many people report this issue too, and it's not tied to PC components.
If you don't care about Online Components like Battlemode, Skins and Challenges, you can downgrade to a stable version. The save files are cross-compatible.
Othewise you might wanna hold off with purchase.

64,69393556,english,"This game is not forgiving.

All in all Doom Eternal is a great action packed game that greatly expands on the mechanics of Doom 2016 and really challenges the player to use all the weapons and mods throughout the game and to adapt to the rapid interchanging of them throughout an encounter. It's a highly tactical game, yet extremely fast-paced at the same time. It requires you to really build skills up and punishes you for settling into a ""comfort zone."" Don't get too comfortable with two guns and one mod each, or you will find yourself Eternally frustrated. Even a single heavy demon often cannot be feasibly or reasonably destroyed with a single weapon or mod, forcing you to have to go through stages of attack against a particular foe, each stage requiring a different weapon or mod and requiring you to change up your tactics, all while constantly moving to avoid being bombarded by a barrage of incoming enemy attacks. This installment of the franchise is far more challenging than the 2016 installment and the world and maps are, over all, far more fun to play through. The length of the game is rather short, but I see it as an episodic installment onto the 2016 release more so than an independent franchise installment, so I can easily forgive the brevity of the story. Regardless of the length of the story/game, there is great replay value and tons of features to unlock with exploration and additional playthroughs, as well as lots of Challenges to achieve and in each difficulty mode. Additionally, the game is so challenging on Nightmare that you will not notice how brief the story is because you will be too preoccupied retrying maps and encounters.

The game also features a very ambitious new style of 1v2 multiplayer mode, where one player plays the Doom Slayer and the other two play demons in a Support/Offense role, which greatly shakes up everything we know about multiplayer FPS and introduces something that not even Overwatch has covered.

As for the downsides, they did not include any kind of Death Match style PVP or co-op in this game and, according to the powers that be, they won't be adding this feature and they think that it's too ""old hat"" for us. That's really too bad. With the kind of game play mechanics this game has, I get that it would be awkward to fit it with a DM style scenario, but that doesn't change the fact that the world still loves DM games and Doom is the founder of this play style. I think the double dash and double jump game mechanics would make for a very interesting way of playing a DM game. Plus the game already has many arenas in it that would work well for 2 to 4 player death matches and co-op.",1589847712,1596702457,True,0,0,0.517887890338897705,0,True,False,False,76561197966550571,361,1,2599,0,1270,1599379033,,

DO NOT PURCHASE, in the process of requesting a refund they added DENUVO this should not be done after you already purchased the game, this is very anti consumer.

98,65654335,english,"Overall the game is fun but it definetly has a number of flaws.

The game takes around 16 hours to complete with all of the secrets found. At some points you just want to skip the battles as they aren't challenging even at higher difficulty making those 16 hours more like 14 hours of worthwhile gameplay. 

During the early stages of the game you get bombarded with weapons and around 5 different ways to upgrade your player and weapons through abilitys. This is not nececeraly overwelming but it is pointless as you will most likely stick to the same 2 guns and your first 3 skills for the rest of the game. This is because you can pick anything at anytime and these are your preferred / by far the best abilities. Weapon abilities also have the problem that by the end of the game you can get all of them. Fundamentally this is not bad but because there are so many upgrades you end up with a large amount of upgrade points you dont use becouse you dont want or need the other upgrades. At the end of the game I upgraded over 10 weapon abilities at once just to see if there was an achievement (there isent) and not for the ability itself as all of the abilities I wanted or looked interesting I already had unlocked.


Although the story is fine besides the ending which is a bit basic and boring most of the levels of the campaign have bad flow with certain areas often taking to long and becoming stale.

The main reason I don't recommend the game is because of the price tag. I havent played multiplayer yet but the rest of the game is not worth 60 euros. Its more like 20 to 30.

Edit: The multiplayer is just boring. It's a 2v1 monster vs slayer gamemode. The idea of playing the demons is cool but the execution is a bit stale. It plays in a very small arena where the only goal is to kill the slayer or the demons depending on wich side your on. Its basically a arena mode where there are 2 dumbed down but overall stronger demons controlled by players that have special abilities that allow them to spawn a small amount of normal demons and heal themselves.





[i][b] TLDR: The overall game is fun but to short. You will only play the campaign once, you will propably not like the multiplayer, the pacing of levels is too slow making levels get stale, There are to many abilities and weapon upgrades that you will never use because the others are clearly better or more fun.

It's good, but I found the previous Doom (2016) better.
They went a bit too far with doing the glory kills for health, fire thing for armor and chainsawing for ammo. You don't have a lot of health, armor and ammo so you find yourself constantly gathering this.
Combine this with the combat system where you essentially go from little arena to little arena where they throw waves of enemies at you, you find yourself constantly gathering resources (is the game Doom or is it Age of Empires?).
It made combat feel like a chore sometimes, and not really fun anymore. I found myself quitting the game sometimes after one of those long combat sequences with lots of waves of enemies, I felt kind of exhausted after some of them.
Which is a shame because the combat / gunplay itself is real fun.

13,73832642,english,"Doom: Youngblood is extremely disappointing, especially so if you played the far superior prequel. Although that's kind of the point, this sequel is so significantly different in so many ways I don't think you can genuinely call it a sequel to Doom 2016. I'd almost go so far as to say calling this a sequel to Doom 2016 is deceptive marketing.

First thing I noticed was how ""wrong"" the music sounds, even on the main menu. It all sounds like something someone made in their bedroom using only half of the tools available in a music editor because they don't know how to use the other half, just the same 4 second clip repeated over and over, with a few stings, changing in pitch and tone maybe, but so constant and boring I couldn't stand it after 20 minutes and just muted the in-game music altogether. They might as well not have bothered with music at all. I turned on the OST from Doom 2016 and it was like the difference between night and day. 

Even on the highest graphics settings this game looks... weird. I don't really care about graphics, but it stood out to me anyway. Some items in the game have ridiculously low-res textures, they look like something from 2002. The textures also wrap around and overlap at odd angles like this was someone's first custom map in an editor. The game genuinely feels like a significant dip in quality in this regard to Doom 2016. It doesn't look bad, but it definitely doesn't look good. 

The game controls weird. It feels similar enough to Doom 2016, enough that having replayed it recently I could feel the similarities, but it definitely feels different. The glory kill button and the melee button being the same button is a big mistake. Often I want to melee an enemy, but I'll be spun around to execute another enemy instead, getting disoriented and killed. That never happened to me in Doom 2016.

The jumping is just bad. I bounce off things, bounce off invisible walls, bounce off walls I can supposedly climb, it's a roll of the dice as to whether you will actually wind up where you want to be. Do not put platforming in your game if the platforming controls dont work. Know your limits.

Guns just don't have enough ammo, and I tried dropping it all the way to the lowest difficulty, it's still a problem there. Nothing more fun than having to stop every 10 seconds to go hunting for ammo. Definitely doesn't kill the pace of the combat at all. Also, even on the lowest difficulty, you cannot kill enemies with melee. I tried. No one tells you this, though, and it is ANOTHER big change from Doom 2016. I died in the first room because I thought ""surely the doom marine can punch these little zombies to death"", but no, turns out those raggedy zombies are tougher than the Doom marine. Great immersion there. That was what immediately told me they had done something wrong. 

The new mechanics of the grenade launcher shoulder weapon and other wacky stuff is neat, but it feels like too many cooks in the kitchen. It's hard to remember you have all these tools to hand when you're desperately trying to kill things. 

The game's art style and violence feel way more cartoony. Enemies look almost cartoonish. This is a real disappointment. Pretty much the entire tone of the original is dead. It almost looks like a saturday morning cartoon at times, and I mean that in the worst way possible.

Also, first level, giant robots everywhere that have been destroyed which look much more fun to play with than the game itself. Remember the old rule of writing? Your story should be about the most intersting part of the story. This feels like Star Wars Episode 2 where they keep talking about stuff that sounds way more interesting than what you're actually seeing. I'd much rather play with those than this crap.

The ironic thing is that many of these complaints are the same complaints people had about Wolfenstein Youngblood. Too many changes and none of them good. Tone and mechanics warped to a degree of unrecognizability. Hence why I say this is almost deceptive marketing to advertise this as a Doom game in the same line as Doom 2016. They really should have gone out of their way to say ""guys this is a very different experience it's not like Doom 2016 at all"", but obviously if they did that, they'd make way less, so no surprises.

It's just not a very good sequel to a very good game. It's ""okay"" as a game on it's own, 6/10 you tried, but extremely disappointing if you compare it to the game that came before it. I feel like a lot of the people who like this game are people who didn't play Doom 2016, but maybe that's just me. It is definitely suffering from all the same problems as Wolfenstein Youngblood. Who knows, maybe a future title will be able to win back some of the magic of the original, but for now this is just disappointing. They obviously could have done a much better job, but rushed this out (at least I hope this was rushed, otherwise that's just sad and there's no excuse).

35,71335210,english,"As of patch 6/25/2020 they have officially ruined the single player campaign (for hardcore players) all for the sake of their lackluster gamemode ""Battlemode"", if you enjoy Battlemode fine, cool, whatever i don't care. But once the gameplay changes effect single player, because you're trying to balance for a crappy game mode!? Thats not cool. 

I will change this review back to positive once they revert the singleplayer balance how it used to be, and not how certain weapon swap speeds stand.

Everything is just balanced so well it's incredible.  The master levels add another layer of challenge after you beat the game, and the mauraders are really not that bad once you get good (anyone can get good).  You don't need to be anything more than mediocre for ultra-violence and below, but if you try nightmare, you better be ready for it cause it'll kick your ass.  Basically you need to weapon switch... a LOT.  You either need to be the most agile player ever or adopt the weapon switching for it.  But weapon switching is pretty easy to learn after you reassign some key bindings.  I personally used the keys:
1 - shotgun
2- super shotgun
3 - ballista 
4 - rocket launcher
5 - heavy rifle
z - chain gun
x - plasma rifle
t - BFG

38,72391800,english,"Ah DOOM. What a game. Shame that it has console sickness and should be quarantined.

""Easy"" isn't easy. First of many, many weak points. The sound is not as consistent as in DOOM 2016, but good. The gunplay is weaker. Impact and handling feel much to soft. It crashed once, with no apparent reason. Not much new (in the first few hours) on the enemy front. Nice levels.
What do I mean by console sickness? It was clearly developed for consoles. A lot of convoluted upgrade systems. A lot of collectible stuff. A mandatory Bethesda account, even for single players like myself. WHY?
The campaign is a bit awkward storywise. But that is just because I am unused to the new direction. What I don't like about the campaign is the level design. Fighting arena --> platforming level --> fighting arena and so on, with a kind of menue world in between. WHY? I am talking Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider platforming, and I just can't see the DOOMGUY swinging around a pole to double jumb - double dash into a climbable wall. That doesn't feel right. I could do without those parts. Challenges, Weeklies, Time Trials, anything to pad out the game. At this point I wouldn't be surprised about side fetch quests. On many occations, I thought to myself, if they really had a meeting about what ""the modern gamer"" awaits in a AAA game these days, and just threw it in for no rhyme or reason, without thinking about its place in DOOM.
Good thing is, that they don't do the ""you lost all your powers, again"" shit. They throw the shotgun, the chainsaw and the first few upgrades in your face at the very beginning, so you feel like DOOMGUY right from the start. But when I saw arachnobots as one of the first enemies, I doubted the game. When they threw three at me in hour 4, I thought about what they will have left at the end. 
I will finish this, of course. But right now, I am just mildly motivated to go on. Nothing, really nothing compared to the euphoric rush of DOOM 2016.
PS: I don't want or need a menue that tells me, what cosmetic dumb pics or stickers I could grind for. I want to play the campaign. I don't need to customize DOOMGUY. I don't want my levels to be interrupted by this information waste, that doesn't add anything to my single player experience. Obviously, I cannot tell you now or ever anything about the multiplayer. 
The recommendation is a cautious one.

EDIT: I will NOT finish this. In fact, I already deinstalled it. DOOM Eternal didn't manage to motivate me to continue. Over the last week, I always found myself thinkung ""I should finish DOOM Eternal ... well I'll just play X instead"" with X being Witcher 3, Satisfactory, Hypnospace or random VNs. DOOM 2016 had me gripped from the beginning, and I played through in two sittings, collecting stuff and grinding some runes afterwards, with 4 playthroughs total. Eternal already bores me after 5h.

Rip & Tear... Until it is Done...

+Addicting fast-paced gameplay
+Great solo campaign with tons of unlockables and secrets to find
+Great graphics with pretty good sound design
+Very well optimized for PC

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-MP is a bit underwhelming compared to its predecessor
-Weird glitch that tanks performance if you use the Steam FPS counter

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Doom Eternal is a fantastic single player game with Non-Stop adrenaline pumping action. Its core gameplay Loop is addicting and will have you playing for hours on end trying to beat its story and finding all the collectibles hidden in its world, and even though I find its MP a bit lackluster, there's no doubt that Doom Eternal is still worth every cent of its purchase price for its single player alone.

If you die, it's because you forgot to use every piece of equipment or you stopped for some reason.

The story is actually surprisingly interesting. It's sorta vague. But like Metal Gear you can figure it out with dialog or reading a lore guide. It's kinda like ancient aliens but darker. It mixes spirituality with science fiction and it's really cool but harsh.

Thorgob wrote this and it says exactly what i wanted to so read this please

I hate to give this a 'No', but it feels like too much of a departure from the feel of Doom. I loved Doom 2016, I wanted a sequel to Doom 2016. This is something that uses Doom 2016 as a reference only. There is less feel of sci-fi horror. The art style is too bright, too comic bookish/cartoony. The fights are not about raw brutality. Extra lives are a thing to collect and fight difficulty even at Hurt Me Plenty is tuned to make you use them, Glory Kills are now something you must do if you want to keep your health up, chainsaw kills are required to gain ammo due to extreme ammo scarcity for even the basic weapons, switching weapon types to match monster 'weaknesses' is required to not run out of ammo trying to just gun them down, and worst of all (imo) is the introduction of a monster type that requires fighting at a specific range and timing your attacks as counter attacks. I'm sure some people will enjoy the new feel of the fights and the new art style, but it isn't for me. As I approach the end of the single player game I find the fights more frustrating than fun. If another Doom sequel is made in this same style I'll definitely pass on it.

90,69514602,english,"8/4/2020 UPDATE:
Great news - they removed the DAC integration, so I'll gladly recant my review to be solely based on the game.

Doom Eternal takes the Doom 2016 formula and changes it up to be a much faster beast. All weapons now have a purpose (or specifically, enemies are weak to a specific weapon) forcing you to change up your weaponry on the fly, making liberal use of dashes and glory kills on feeder demons (example: zombies), and some neat platforming too.

Here's the nitty gritty though: this is not Doom 2016. I liked the direction that Doom 2016 was going into. It seemed darker and much more gritty, but Doom Eternal adds a splash of awkward color into the world that is a little bit out of place.

If you're expecting more of Doom 2016, like I was, I do not recommend this at full price.
If you're wanting a highly-mobile shooting game that rewards you for playing on the fly, then I recommend this.

Unfortunately, I feel like I'll be going back to Doom 2016 more than Doom Eternal. There is just something missing from this game that made 2016 special, and I'm afraid that any future entries in the series will share the same fate.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Game is much different from Doom 2016 but still a blast. HOWEVER: the Denuvo Anti-Cheat program that was forced through the latest patch is an invasive program that I find unacceptable in 2020. Who the hell thinks it is okay to force a program onto users that gives Kernel-level access to their PC, just to play a goddamn game?

Terrible, and I STRONGLY SUGGEST you do not even purchase this game or install it until they remove DAC.",1590022318,1596602071,False,5,0,0.494648218154907227,0,True,False,False,76561198019853496,265,36,600,0,600,1588476783,1591801606.0,"Greetings!

0,67628244,english,"This game isn't worth more than 20$.  They're doing some weird platformer/puzzle/shooter thing and while this normally wouldn't bother me, in a game about ""slaying demons"" you do two or three times more not slaying demons. Most of the game is either getting stuck in a cutscene, or wandering around while either your trusty AI sidekick explains objectives, or a brain in a jar rattles at you about your epic backstory.

The platforming, is mediocre. While some of the new mobility additions are interesting and fun in their own respect, the platforming itself isn't challenging beyond clunky controls and buggy terrain. There are usually no demons in sight, and you can't even see your feet. You're also not typically slaying demons while platforming.  They're usually not even present in any capacity.

The ""puzzles"" might be challenging for a 4 year old, or game reviewer. The game is basically long hallway, the rooms are small and the puzzles are too simplistic and obvious to feel rewarding to solve and are just more time spent not actually slaying any demons. 

The ""secrets"" are actually pretty insulting. They're pretty much just laid out in the open but every time you collect one the game goes ""secret found!"" as if there's some amazing achievement to be had in collecting objects that catch in your field of vision as you hold down the W key en route to the next cutscene in the cleverly designed linear hallway. It reminds me of collecting riddler trophies in batman games, just 100 times easier.

The ""shooting"" has a few high points, and definitely picks up speed in the later levels despite being sprinkled in between momentum and immersion killing puzzles and platforming, but for some reason there are forced immobility cutscenes and i'm not talking about the ""press e to melee cutscene"" tier stuff that's in combat, but forced cinematic cutscenes where combat stops and you're forced to watch a door opening or something which completely kills whatever momentum you were feeling and pulls you out of the immersion of being the ""doom slayer."" this is usually accompanied by some epic force fed lore over comms about how great you are or how epic your backstory is or how badass your enemies are, which totally kills the mood because they've made sure that nothing noisy happens while you're being talked at (no demon killing.) This is partially solvable by setting voice to 0 but there is no option to disable the forced cutscenes, or an option to add more demons to the completely demon barren segments. 

There are a few points in the final level where the boss is lumbering around in the background which looks really good but at one point you're forced to stop what you're doing and watch him walk through a skywalk. Why not have it be an ambient environment hazard that you have to look out for? It would have been much more satisfying if that was a point at which you could be killed by environmental hazard (the icon of sin) if you werent paying attention and went into the crosswalk. Instead it's ""look! look! see! here he is the icon of sin! woww he's crashing through this skywalk! epic!"" and it completely kills the momentum you just picked up from the previous demon slaying segment. If there's a benefit to all the cutscening it's that you are immune to damage when doing a ""glory kill"" which could be used to tank certain attacks.


Also, there's the gadgets. This is a very worrying development that doomguy gets a batcave and gadgets and there's a section in his batcave that has crafting benches and an armor stand. While at present they do nothing, but as your base comes with a 3d printer (that produces a gun after a few levels,) you get cryo grenades as alternative to regular grenade, and you get narrative updates via radio, I fully expect the next game to feature picking through rubble for trash to craft a plasma rifle. Along with questing, factions, faction warfare, base building, base defense, You know, some kinda Doomout 76. I fully expect it. We've basically had VATS melee since doom 2016 but it's far more developed now and with the rest of the additions in doom eternal I feel comfortable saying we're going to get an elder scrolls style doom game, or doom fortnite.

My biggest pet peeve is the forced cutscenes on everything. press e c or v to melee cutscene, cant move, interact with something cant move for 3-8 seconds, get on elevator can't move.  Not being able to move on a game elevator as someone who has a lot of energy, i like to bounce around while i wait to help relieve stress or anxiety because i have to wait until i can continue playing game, but in this game you're forced to stand perfectly still in the middle or you're forced to watch some lore cutscene (which are thankfully skippable most of the time.) It feels claustrophobic and makes me anxious. In the middle of the game there are one or two elevators that let you move freely and when i encountered them It felt so relieving. This is also the case with both a train and a cart segment. Forced to stand perfectly still, cant shoot, demons are flying around but cant shoot, you just have to stand there and look around while you get talked at until the ride is over.  I can go on but it's all just so tiresome.

It really feels like the people who made this game were more interested with hyping doomguy than making a fun demon slaying game. 5/10 worth maybe 20$ don't buy it full price.",1587305009,1596596109,False,5,0,0.490528404712677002,0,True,False,False,76561197994001988,118,34,3078,0,2387,1587921551,,

It had too many bugs to name a few...
1. Glory Kill Wall Glitch 
2. Game Crash After Slayer Gate
3. Slayer Key NOT! Spawning (which made me very annoyed)

I don't mind the ammo/chainsaw system, and you get used to the combat dance relatively quickly and it's pretty enjoyable. I played the thing on nightmare, but those fucking marauders man, they kinda ruined the game for me. I would turn the difficulty down to 0 whenever one of them showed up on the screen. Boss fights kinda suck in general, but to have a standard enemy that is ten times harder show up around a dozen times in the game just deflated the experience for me, and I was soon eyeing the exit for an uninstall. I'm sorry to say I did not try the multiplayer, and wanted to get that sketchy DRM off my system.  For 30 bucks and only 40 gigs it's more or less a steal though.

97,73458064,english,"Doom 2016 was a very successful game that was very well received both from critics and users alike. A sequel to it was to be expected and to be looked forward to. I was very excited to see what they would do next with the story and gameplay, and what did they do? They added parkour….

[h1]What I like:[/h1]

+ The gameplay, though not without its flaws, feels like a massive step up from its predecessor. The intensity and high-power action are increased tenfold, especially on higher difficulties.

+ The new mechanics such as blood punch and the flame thrower are welcome additions that successfully make the combat feel more satisfying and rewarding. 

+ The levels are fantastic to look at. Seeing Earth in an apocalyptic state in the opening hours of the game is a brilliant first impression. Each location is iconic and unique in its design and feel. 

+ The story is pretty decent.  I can’t say I always knew what was going on, but that never really mattered too much to me since I had a general idea. It is a Doom game after all.

+ The increased emphasis on exploration is something that I wasn’t expecting, and in my opinion, it’s done very well. Not only does exploring provide you with various collectables that appear in your ship, it also provides you with an increase in your effectiveness in combat.

+ The weapons in this game are great. They all bring something new to the table, especially when modified. Returning weapons from the previous game are better than ever, and the new ones all feel like they belong.

+ The boss fights in this game are excellent. The last two in particular are some of the best boss fights I’ve ever experienced in gaming. The game’s build up to these fights really pays off. 

+ The voice acting is something that I feel is worth mentioning, especially with the main antagonist. Although there isn’t a vast variety of characters, the ones that are present all have very talented voice work behind them. 

+ The optimisation is surprisingly very good. I didn’t think I’d be able to run the game on max graphics, but alas I was. Never went below 60 frames. (I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070).

[h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]

- The parkour. Why does it exist? I didn’t mind the basic traversal sections and how its applied in combat, but whenever I went around a corner only to see tonnes of obstacles such as flamethrowers, spinning lasers, crushing doors, falling platforms etc., I wasn’t exactly filled with excitement. 

- The Marauders. I don’t know who thought they were a good idea. It’s not only that they are insanely annoying, they’re not fun to play against. Their gameplay loop consists of “Go around them in circles and shoot them when their eyes glow green, but don’t go too far away or too close to them.” I’m just glad they weren’t in the boss fights.

- Parts of the combat feel clunky. Unless your blood punch is fully charged, melee attacks do no damage. Enemy weak spots are an okay addition, but sometimes they just felt like they were getting in the way. 

- There are too many sections that take control away from the player. One scene literally consists of the main character walking through a long room with people being shocked by him. The player could’ve done that themselves.

- This is a rather small complaint, but it annoyed me nevertheless. The game encourages you to use the BFG way too much. When you run out of ammo on a weapon, you automatically switch to the next one. Sometimes you switch to the BFG, so when you’re firing away, you may accidentally waste it. It happened too many times.

[h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]

It took me some time to get used to Doom Eternal. Right off the bat it felt very different to the 2016 version. The more I played it however, the more I got used to it, and the more enjoyable it became. 

The combat feels very satisfying, and the new additions only improve the experience. The game feels a lot more intense and fast paced compared to its predecessor. The levels are horrifically gorgeous to look at, and the benefits of exploring these levels make side-tracking worthwhile.

Is it better than Doom 2016? Personally, I don’t think it is. What made the 2016 version so good was its simplistic yet highly addicting gameplay. It’s the things such as the over-used parkour, the marauders and various other clunky aspects of the game that let it down. They get in the way and interfere with the fun.  

Despite these flaws, Doom Eternal is still a really good game, and I had a blast playing it. I can’t comment on the multiplayer since I haven’t tried it out. If you’re more interested in the single player part of the game, I can tell you that it’s great fun, just not without its flaws. 

[h1]Final Rating:[/h1]
8/10.

By marmite I mean this is a game that you will either love as your new favourite shooter of all time, or hate with a fiery passion. I’m not sure about there being an in between simply because one of the things this game does well is have all of its mechanics and level design congeal with each other. They all work in tandem to make the player feel like they are an unstoppable killing machine when the game is played right.
The controversy comes from just that though. If you are playing the game the way it wants you to, which is very different from ’16.
You either grok the new play style and love it. Or don’t and hate the game for it. And I can absolutely see where you would be coming from by hating the game. It is a matter of taste. Doom Eternal is not Doom ’16. So do NOT go into this game expecting it to be.
If you go into this game with an open mind and take it on its own terms. You’ll either find one of your favourite games of all time. Or a frustrating game you’ll never play again. 

Worth the gamble imo.

However, I soon learned the ways of the Slayer and after some hours and several upgrades later, I felt like a beast; someone the demons should fear. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be? I don't know, but it's a special feeling nontheless.

19,73736475,english,"---{Graphics}---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☒ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Doom Eternal's graphics are essentially the same as Doom 2016, but it has some more gore and it revamps some of the demons.

---{Gameplay}---
☒ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It‘s just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

Gameplay is absolutely Doom Eternal's strongest aspect. You can dash, double jump, use a flamethrower, throw ice bombs, and much more. It's number one rule is to never stop moving when in combat, or else you will die from the dozens of demons swarming you.

---{Audio}---
☐ Eargasm
☒ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

The sountrack fits the mood extremely well, recapturing Doom 2016's mood soundtrack wise. This game is very intense, so expect a very intense soundtrack involving plenty of metal.

---{Audience}---
☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☒ Adults
☐ All

The only reason this would be for adults is because of the gore, but there's lots of it.

---{PC Requirements}---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☒ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

As weird as it is, I found Doom Eternal much easier to run than Doom 2016. I ran 2016 at Medium and still had some frame drops, while I ran Eternal on Ultra and had little to no frame drops at 60 FPS.

---{Difficulty}---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☒ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

The end game is easier than Doom 2016, but the first half of the game is introducing demons so fast that you have to adapt to fighting these demons quickly, as well as demons seeming much more aggressive, not to mention that you will run out of ammo extremely quick.

---{Grind}---
☒ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding

Nothing much to say here, there's no grind unless you consider killing demons a grind, but it's not a grind at all because of the unique locations you're fighting demons.

---{Story}---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☒ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It‘ll replace your life

The story is your basic 'good guy kills big bad guy and saves world and then is praised like a god', this isn't a problem at all as the story isn't supposed to particularly engaging since the main aspect of Doom games is the gameplay and killing demons.

---{Game Time}---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee (<4 hours)
☐ Short (4-11 hours)
☐ Average (12-26 hours)
☐ Long (26+)
☐ To infinity and beyond

---{Price}---
☐ It’s free!
☒ Worth the price
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

It's $60 (as of August 2020), so it's really up to you if you want to spend full price on this. Personally, I would say it's 100% worth it.

---{Bugs}---
☐ Never heard of
☒ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ Fallout 76

I encountered some bugs, but most bugs were just crashes after certain actions. In 21 hours I encountered about 6 crashes, all in the second half of my time and one actual glitch which was getting stuck in a wall.

Overall I'd give Doom Eternal a solid 9.4/10. The gameplay is the core aspect which is always a good thing. It can keep you coming back to it. Not only is the gameplay amazing, but's it's also not just a click to win. This game involves platforming and fast paced gameplay. The story is nothing special, it's not bad it's just basic. The graphics are nice to look at, but again nothing too breathtaking. I would recommend Doom Eternal to almost anyone.",1596526936,1596526936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198306697826,145,26,3250,140,1294,1601942506,,

This doesn't feel like AAA game, rather it feels like you are killing enemies in arenas that are procedurally generated; like an indie fps game.

Pros 
- Lore ( If you enjoy the franchise)
- Visuals 
- Musics 
- Performance ( It has a better performance than Doom 2016)

Cons 
- Game constantly punishes you with low ammo; even for lower level difficulties. 
- You end up trailing a low level demon with a chainsaw in order to get ammo rather than focusing combat. 
- This always blocks the flow of the game.
- Every Stage consists several arenas that you need to circle 1000 times to get ammo, health. 
- This is much more like a survival FPS rather than action FPS.
- Because of focusing too much to generate ammo/health/armor by punching,flaming, chainsawing enemies; you end up not using any weapon mods of your guns (except main weapons; shotgun, machine gun...).
- Because of the controversial anti-cheat none of my friends as well as me haven't installed the multiplayer. 
 
Extra Comments
-I have just finished 6th stage of the main campaign.  (I will update this review when I finish the game)
-It got really boring and levels feel same. 
-I will finish the game by playing time to time just to grasp the whole story. 
-It is now 2020 and there are lots of good examples of FPS games. 
-It is now 2020 and there are lots of good indie clones of DOOM. 
-I hope next time developers come up with a better Doom experience we all enjoy.",1596401784,1596467915,False,7,0,0.518046736717224121,0,True,False,False,76561197993780975,1037,1,1273,0,631,1598627330,,

After a kind nudge from a Bethesda rep, I've had time to take a look at the game following the update to remove the Denuvo Anti Cheat system. I'm pleased to confirm this has been removed and the game is great again - but I say it with caution. id have mentioned they'll re-evaluate, so I expect another system to appear eventually, and I hope that implementation will not affect the ability of paying customers to play the game in a normal way and without compromising their system.

The single player game is fantastic. It seems more difficult in a good way. The additions and skills certainly at first seem an odd choice for doom, but I genuinely think these work brilliantly for the game, adding to it's fast paced and aggressive nature. There is a surprising amount of tactical play in here as you try to control the various battles. The multiplayer is a nice addition that I hope they build upon, but not what I'd consider the core of this game.
There are also a good amount of additional challenges to keep you busy and new content is apparently on route too.

I certainly recommend the game for those of you keen on single player Doom experience and are ready to test a fresh way of playing. To me this game is better in every way over 2016, but it does seem like this is hit and miss for others.

11,72825354,english,"First impression: There's too much shit going on and this game is asking a lot of the player between all the weapons, weapon mods, two types of grenades, blood punch, flamethrower, chainsaw fuel, and insta-kill sword. It's gilding the lily.

Simultaneously, they made aiming with the mods stupidly easy. There's a magnetic aim assist to most of the game's weapons that it feels like there's this massive disconnect between the large number of things it wants you to do, and the baby-town-frolics of the shooting mechanics.

Then the story. What are you doing game? Why is the doom marine a magic space knight as well? I could not give a fuck about that, and you don't seem to either with how sarcastic you are with the subject matter so I don't know why you're trotting this stuff out you can't be bothered to be sincere about. 

Doom2016 was about waking up from a coffin and killing everything in sight. This is about globetrotting demon invasion stopping nonsense while pumping me up as some kind of chosen one who doesn't give a fuck? Why do the extra work to try to get me to give a fuck then also not give a fuck? It's like it was afraid to do something sincere so it cloaked itself in irony.

Honestly everything about this game is grating on me now and I think it started with the fact that I loved the starting shotgun in Doom2016. I was a fucking sniper-surgeon with that weapon, getting direct hit cluster-bounces with that shotgun that it was my go-to throughout the entire game. They made it anemic  while giving the new 'sticky' mechanic this garbage magnetism that makes me feel like the game isn't letting me win by my own skill. From there it just got more and more AAA nonsense of everything sanded off and over designed, from the tutorials that shove themselves into my face to the autowin weapons that I barely have to aim to use well.

Doom 2016 right? Somehow you always felt how to play it. After a short while, you joined this dance of death with the demons, it was fluid, challenging, but natural. 
At a point you entered this trance like state where defeating impossible odds, dodging lighting swift attacks was just your nature. 
The only bad thing about it is how good it felt, all the time. After a longer play, too much of the good thing left you kind of overstimulated.

[Spoilers about game mechanics and gameplay ahead]

Doom Eternal? You need to learn how to play it, you no longer feel how to do it right. They introduced low ammo simulator mechanics, so you need to think about ammo. All tougher enemies became mini-bosses, with weak points you have to think about. Stay in motion to - stay alive principle doesn't work anymore, the game introduces a new mechanics, that only make sense if you get hurt often, you have to use them to stay alive. You would like to choose how to defeat an enemy? Nope, prepare for rock-paper-scissors gameplay, again you need to think ahead, what kind of ammo you want to keep, in case you end up with scissors against a rock.

You don't even have any means to keep the momentum up, as platforming became the secondary gameplay mechanic.  You would like to just enter the next arena and quickly use what you learned ? Nope. Platforming, parkour, falling.
You are bombarded with new content, new mechanics, new equipment, runes and all other AAA nonsense, to a point that it's distracting and feels like swarm of buzzing flies.
On top of it, it doesn't feel like the game is giving anything new, instead the true gameplay is taken away in the beginning, and you have to chip away the content padding to get it.
I know this is how content is usually delivered, but if it's executed well, you won't ever notice it.

And finally, even Mick Gordon's music feels pretty weak.

Pros:

1) The mechanics of the game are buttery smooth. You can really create your own rhythm within the carnage once you are well versed with the different mechanics.

3) The grappling hook allows for interesting and fun movement within the game.

I was ready to get into this game and believe I knew everything there was to know, but god damn, this game will kick you in the ass hard. The game definitely holds you responsible for success, and won't hold back to punish you for even minor mistakes. It's faster, and tougher than Doom 2016 by a considerable margin, but once you find your way through Doomguy's incredible arsenal, you'll start wiping the floor in demon blood in no time.

This game is very aware of its predecessors legacies, and I love it. The hub area you're given is filled to the brim with easter eggs, callbacks, and numerous collectables scattered around that you gain from finding secrets in the main missions. Collectable toys, player skins, songs from classic iD Software games with their own personalized album art, and I bet plenty more considering I'm not even halfway through the game.

While Doom Eternal has a heavier emphasis on story telling, thankfully it still stays mostly unintrusive. Like its predecessor, most of everything is still told through data logs and other means. What really makes this game's setting and presentation however is the world building. You will visit places and dimensions you've never seen in a Doom game, let alone a first person shooter. Each of these worlds ooze with creativity and care, and both minor and major details open up a universe of history and lore to delve into, all neatly documented in a codex for you to read at any time you wish.

Also, it would be a sin if I didn't talk about the performance of this game. I have to give kudos to the development team for their incredible optimisation. This game runs as smooth as butter, and is highly configurable. It's requirements may seem heavy, but with the numerous graphical settings to the inclusion of a dynamic resolution, most folks should have next to no trouble playing this game. From a technical standpoint, Doom Eternal is a marvel to look at, as well as take part in.

If they'd released the same DOOM 2016 but with more levels, guns, and enemies alone it'd be one thing. But this feels like the natural progression of the game. It runs wonderfully and the combat remains as frenetic as ever, but new approaches to specific enemy types make for a more strategic set of encounters. You're not just ""RATATATATATATAT KILL THE DEMONS"" because they're stronger and more complicated in many ways; instead, you're making split-second decisions in combat to turn the tide on the demons, and it makes a lot more sense. Doomguy is, essentially, still a human. A human built like a gorilla on steroids with limitless stamina and infinite malice, but a human at the core. So it stands to reason using mobility and tactics to overpower these existential alien/demon things rather than pure force of concerted fisticuffs is a neat way of keeping combat challenging without needing to change the rules on the player every other level. Instead, it builds on itself, new enemies alongside old, forcing the player to adapt and not forget old strategies. This game also doesn't hold your hand with puzzles, and most of the secrets are accessed via these same strategies, making them feel more like discoveries rather than secret doors requiring wall-humping.

However, and I know it's a controversial opinion... I miss DOOM 2016's PvP system. I know it went over in the community about as well as a birthday cake with toenail filling, but I liked the gunplay enough and I feel that this game's mechanics would make for interesting Slayer v. Slayer combat.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
A blood soaked action packed adrenaline rushed sequel to Doom (2016) and it delivers and all aspects. Combat feels more intense and punishing if you stop moving. A constant game of chaining together kills, switching weapons to hit specific weak points on demons, and using your chunk machine chainsaw to replenish ammo. The ability for this game to give you a power rush but at the same time make you feel helpless is a outstanding piece of work. Hats off to the team behind this game and all the effort they poured into it. 
My single compliant with the game lies with the story. Yes, why nick pick when the game is such a hit? Because if you have a story, it has to be fluid. Regardless of how polished and excellent everything else is. The game fails to explain how we got from Doom 2016 to Doom Eternal. At first I thought maybe I perhaps missed it in one of the lore books (After collecting them all and reading them), So I went to the internet. Nothing. No explanation as to the time skip, how we managed to snag a badass ship fortress? Some say it will be addressed in  a future DLC but I think that is vile practice for game development.

After 28 hours of the campaign, a little Battlemode, and a Master Level I'm ready to never play DOOM Eternal again. This game pushed me to improve; to move faster, aim more accurately, hesitate less. But after every session my fingers were cramped and I felt tired. There were fights that I finally won after a dozen deaths that made me feel accomplished, and there were those that I breezed through like a killing machine. The power fantasy is strong here... but I realized as I played through that I've changed as a gamer.

I played 2016's DOOM reboot on Mouse and Keyboard, eventually beating it on the highest difficulty. I relished maxing out weapons and pushing my skill. These days my gaming has transitioned to the couch and a controller because I want to spend time with my wife and dog rather than remain cloistered in my office, which has become a literal office due to the pandemic. I'm in it for the story now. I'm in it for the fun. DOOM Eternal traded interesting voice acting and narrative for text logs. I enjoyed that lore, but it was largely detached from the gameplay unlike its predecessor. 

Look. I'm old now. I don't want my hands to hurt after playing a video game. I want to chill on the couch and feel invested in a story that makes me feel whisked away to another world where I'm powerful and skilled. DOOM Eternal isn't that. If you're a gamer like me, pass on this one.

4,73598110,english,"Doom Eternal Review
By Sandewr_Pally
Score: 10/10
Played On: PC
Hours Played: 15
Mode: Normal

Right away the atmosphere of the game hits you. Earth is under attack and you, the Doom Slayer, are its only hope. Demons are on earth and you are their death. With a superb soundtrack to kick off the violence you jump headlong into the carnage, filling out your arsenal and becoming the Slayer that Earth needs.

Taking much of what made Doom 2016 a true reboot of one of the most popular shooters of gaming Doom Eternal goes further in making you the perennial slayer. Familiar weapons are back, with more mods and styles of play for experimenting. The addition of mechanics that help restore health with glory kills, a function taken from the 2016 Doom, to a flame turret that finally gives Doom its answer to reliable armor restore. Each Weapon comes off as unique and needed, for only utilizing each weapon to its fullest extent can the player hope to prevail. Especially in the endgame when many of the toughest demon combinations come into play. 

Speaking of the Demons themselves the AI that makes up your enemies are even more dangerous, a promise that Doom Eternal Developers have delivered on. The horde feels like a proper enemy that works together, yet sometimes to their detriment as much as benefit. Old, new and returning enemies have all gone through new changes to make them even more dangerous. Getting close a gamble that more often than not got me killed, especially against one of the late game enemies.

The classic Doom exploration is upped to eleven, with secrets galore and challenges awaiting those that take the time for them. The challenges themselves (One series that is required for a locked secret) puts players in some of the more intense combat sequences, challenging each of the players skills. Most of the Powerups that you get come from exploration making it well worth it to find a way to that powerup that you see through a grate in the wall.

For lore buffs the history of Doom and its titular character lay bare to all, making an interesting story in a shooter that to most is just tear through demons it is nice to take a moment to read through a piece of lore. Even the bestiary, that gives you tips on how to defeat the minions of hell, is enjoyable to stroll through in the downtime, or when you really need some tips on how to kill them.

Doom Eternal Takes what made the reboot of Doom great and made another masterpiece from it. I would Wholly recommend this game to old and new Doom Players, for it is just that good.

I should say everything is still amazing other than the gameplay itself, but its such a bad experience from my perspective that i have been playing 1 level per day before i get bored and quit. Compared to the previous Doom game in which I finished over the first two days i owned it.

So the combat, firstly you are given bare minimum ammunition to force you to utilize the chainsaw = ammo mechanic.
Next you have a high cooldown grenade which doesn't really do much as you rarely get enemies grouped up.
Then you have the flamethrower, again when you are given so little ammo and then have to spam bullets into enemies on fire to get armor it just doesn't really make sense.

Finally pretty much anything will hit you for 20% minimum of you total heath, and you have literally be jumping or dodging 100% of the time as things you cant see will always be a split second away from hitting you. Even doing that you will always be taking some chip damage and have to glory kill for health every 10-15s in a arena fight.

42,73572843,english,"The story of this game is convoluted and makes no sense for a newcomer to the series. The exposition is also rather heavy-handed, with frequent cutscenes on some levels. A more descriptive name for the game would have perhaps been Doom (2016): Chapter 2, since the scenario of Doom Eternal is illegible without the lore and additional context it provides. The constant teleporting of the player character in the campaign and within the levels further adds to the disorientation and the feeling of detachment from the game world.

The ability to hit the weak spots of enemies to remove their parts and change their behavior is interesting, but it's only really applied to early game enemies. Most of the demons introduced later do not seem make much use of the system. The enemies are surprisingly generic and uninspired. The floating and colorful Cacodemon, with it's funny grenade-swallowing behavior, is perhaps the coolest type of enemy in the game. The Marauder is another distinctive type of enemy. The game has a system of demon skins that could add flavor to the game, but it cannot be applied to singleplayer.

My interest in the game was initially captured by footage where the player made use of switching between weapons in combat to create ""weapon combos"". It seemed like if you could master switching between different weapon types, such as from a shotgun to a sniper rifle to a rocket launcher, you could greatly improve your efficiency and speed up the pace of combat by avoiding reload and cooldown periods of the different weapons. In actuality, these weapon combos have been partially eliminated by the developers. There is now a typical significant delay when switching weapons, making the gameplay seen in most videos of this game impossible.

The system for staggers and finishing blows is also a bit underutilized and disappointing. Since the more elite demons tend to have longer finishing blow animations, provide no additional incentives aside from a couple of one-time challenges on specific levels, and because staggered demons tend to die rather easily of damage from any source, you mostly want to avoid using the finishing blows on high-end enemies in favor of fighting from afar. The game has plenty of epic animations for the chainsaw and the finishing blows, but they are mostly not utilized, since the vast majority of the time they are only used on the same low-level fodder demons. It seems that only in the early game, and only on specific enemies, you really want to make use of the finishing blow opportunities on larger demons.

In a nutshell, many of the more unique and original systems in this game are not used as well as they could have. Some of the core dynamics of the game you might see in gameplay videos, such as weapon switching for combos, are actually not very prominent in-game. The story is surprisingly jarring, complex and heavily present for a game series that some might have the impression of not being strongly story-driven.",1596221368,1596221368,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False,76561198042124139,39,1,2158,0,2001,1596747576,,

It fails spectacularly at higher difficulties.

But since I don't get paid for writing this, I won't go into any technical details.

The most obvious symptom that most player should be able to notice is, instead of coming up with a solution to make the game ""fairly-unbalanced"" on higher difficulties, they went with the old-school Quake style approach. And clearly that didn't work because they have to put in a ""buff yourself up after died for couple of times at the same place"" option as a workaround. 

And once you turn off the music, those seems-to-be-exiting-boss-fights starts to pale off, and you can get bored even before finishing the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For most casual players. I think the most common issue would be, the minimap doesn't work in HDR.
And if you don't turn HDR on, the graphics looks like crap. 
And to be honest some scenes still looks like crap with HDR turned on, it seems like some designers messed up the PBS properties of certain assets.
Graphics aside, whether the gameplay is good or not is debatable.  
It feels like the game is specifically tweaked for playing on lower difficulties with a controller and multiplayer mode. Playing on higher difficulties like ultra-violent and nightmare with mouse and keyboard exposes a lot of problems.  


Case in point, enemies could attack the player across the map with pin-point accuracy; 
sometimes the projectiles would fly through walls and makes you think you get damage by just walking.
enemies would attack the player from positions where player can't reach;
enemies could constantly getting stuck in corners and sometimes in mid air;
there could be ""wrong"" decisions about selecting weapon mods during first play-through, in other words, selecting one mod over another can make the upcoming arena or challenge more difficult to beat;
enemies sometimes could dodge attacks in an ""only possible for bots"" fashion and end up breaking the animation sequences;
certain enemy type, especially mini bosses' behavior and stats are clearly tweaked for playing with a controller, makes maneuvering in circle is always more effective then hit and run;
gameplay rely too heavily on QTE (glory kills);

there're a lot of problems like the ones listed above, but these are results of more serious problems.
The game, other then how the weapons and enemies are animated,  doesn't feel like Doom. Instead it feels like a mix of other popular games in recent years with a Doom coating.

72,73544430,english,"I came into Doom Eternal expecting a solid shooter that would be worth the 30$ I spent for it on the summer sale. I skipped Doom 2016 because it seemed like another bland and brown 7th gen tier shooter and it didnt pull me in. The gameplay for this game seemed faster, more complex, and I liked the aesthetic better. In the end, I decided to give it a shot.


I started the game on ultra violence (Hard) and I got my face kicked in. (You are underpowered at the start) I thought I lowered the difficulty to medium, but I wouldnt find out until 2 levels later that I actually didn't. I thank god I didn't actually lower the difficulty because it forced me to learn the ropes of the game, By forcing me to learn the loop of the game as the devs intended it, I was having so much fun that this may be one of my favorite shooters of all time if not my favorite shooter outright. The Slayer moves very fast and the dashes and double jump help encourage this mobility. There is platforming to help break up the intense action encounters, and I believe this to be a positive aspect of the game. Not only does it allow fun breathers between intense action sections, but it reinforces that this game is really about mobility.

Weapon Switching is another fun aspect of this game too. There are some demons that are hard countered by some weapons, and some weapons just work better on certain demons. This encourages weapon switching which can be satisfying later in the playthrough. This encourages you to use more weapons other than the SSG, and you will find that almost all of these weapons are not only just useful, but really fun as well.

The slayer has the flamethrower (flame belch) to use on enemies if you want armor, glory kills for health, and chainsawing enemies for ammo. Since this game has pretty low ammo, (at least at the start) you will need to become accustomed to using the chainsaw, along with all these other things. This bothered me at first in this game, but as I got better at the loop, (and got more weapons so also more usable ammo), I found myself enjoying an exhilirating gameplay loop. This really surprised me, because needing to use scripted glory kills in 2016 somewhat turned me off from buying that game. But I swear if that is your reservation, this game will convert you. The glory kills and chainsaw not only keeps you in the blood pumping action zone, but gives you a second to check all your cooldowns and plan your next move after scripted kill. This is really useful on higher difficulties. And thats another thing... If you arent looking for a pure casual experience, I encourage you to start your first playthrough on ultra violence and try to fight through it. It will force and teach you into the gameplay loop that is unrivaled in the FPS genre.

The secrets in this game are pretty cool as well. You get records you can listen to in your hub, toys you can look at in your hub, and cheat codes that are fun to use when replaying levels. I find the hub to be a very nice addition, and its fun to screw around the hub. There are also alternate skins you can unlock in the hub like the classic Doom Marine Skin. The weapon mods also allow you to use your weapons in unique ways, and you can choose weapon mods that cater to your playstyle,

Some nitpicks with the game, I found the purple goo segments to run against the gameplay philosophy of this game and were very unfun. I wasnt a fan of the tentacle enemies, and I disliked the final boss of the game.  Although I apparently didnt have the one weapon mod that works well on the boss, so maybe that was my problem. The suit enhancements feel useless except for the exploration ones, because those help you find secrets easier. I also found the grenades tacked on, but maybe thats just due to my own playstyle.

I initially had a problem with the Marauder, but I found out the main issue with him is that the tutorial misleads you. His gimmick is that you can only attack him when he decides to attack you at mid range. It tells you that you need to be in mid range and if he shoots you with his shotgun, he is too close and if he shoots his axe at you you are too far. But what you need to do is stand at the inner range of his axe range. What he will then do is run up to you and attack you. Then you can SSG him and combo that into a ballista shot. Once you figure this out, it becomes much easier, and a fun fight.

Battlemode is also fun for a few rounds, but not something I would keep playing. Playing Slayer in MP feels like a downgrade from SP. 

The story is also fine as helps builds Doom Slayer up as this really cool dude, but that is just a backdrop to the gameplay tbqh. It's good you can skip most of the cutscenes if you want.

Overall, I find the Singleplayer Campaign in Doom Eternal to be one of the greatest shooter campaigns of all time. Its hard to think of another FPS game that compares. As a reasult, I have to give this game a 98/100. I highly recommend people to buy this game and I 100% would have payed full price for it. I can't wait for the DLC.

Now the reason I'm not giving this a thumbs down is because it just, isn't my cup of tea.

I can see how this game appeals to other people. So, this isn't a bad review, nor a good one. Do I recommend DOOM Eternal? Hell yeah... pun intended.

+ Movement greatly improved with not only double jump but also the addition of dash. With that comes new platforming sections, which I quite enjoyed.
+ Ammo capacity for weapons almost halved, leading to more resource management. I enjoyed this change which doesn’t allow you to just kill mindlessly.
+ Combat is the tense and adrenaline pumping experience from Doom turned up to 11, dashing across the level and blasting demons from whatever distance you deem fit. The more open environment complements this very well.
+ Pistol is completely removed, which I think is a good thing since it’s rarely useful.
+ Chainsaw is now an essential part in combat. Glory kills no longer provides ammo, and you will need the chainsaw to get ammo, which now recharges one pit automatically.
-	Fortress of Doom don't really add much to the game, other than providing a safe haven for practicing combat but even that is counter-intuitive because it is so far away from where you usually are in the fortress.
-	The fucking purple goo is the worst thing introduced, disabling your dash and jump, in a fast paced game.
-	The toxic water and tentacles combo are the worst because the toxic water wants you to move fast or you will take damage but the tentacles wants you to stay slow or risk getting jabbed. It’s just ?????
-	Demon customizations don’t apply in the campaign.
-	Mission Replay and Master Level progresses don’t save.

	[td]+ Tons of content within each campaign level.
+ Outside of the main campaign, there are Master Levels, which are harder versions of existing levels.
+ Progression system ranges from suit improvements to weapon modifications and attachments to health, ammo and armor capacity increases, all these while adding new demons to the mix.
-	Another case of developers wasting time to work on multiplayer mode that most people don’t play Doom for.
-	You can only equip 3 runes making the rest of the runes redundant.
- For the amount of work you put in for the Unmaykr, it is next to useless.

	[td][i]FINAL SCORE[/i][/td]
	[td][/td]
	[td]9[/td]
	[td]This is a very good Doom game, and a better one than 2016's Doom. The game retains its fast paced action while introducing new movement abilities like dashing and swinging and new demons, greatly reducing ammo capacity to encourage weapons switching, glory kill no longer providing ammo thus mandating the use of chainsaw. which I really welcome. That being said, there are some mechanics that I very much detest such as the purple goo and the tentacles which luckily only exists in the first half of the game. The game’s unstability also diminished my enjoyability a bit, which is the main reason why this game couldn’t get a 10. While I loved this new concept of tighter combat, you probably won’t like this game if you just want an action game with mindless killing associated with 2016's Doom. In a nutshell, if you like to think while playing and be challenged, then I strongly suggest playing Doom Eternal, on Nightmare, and you will get an experience no other games will provide. Life is limited, but Doom is eternal. [/td]

63,73473991,english,"DOOM Eternal is an action packed first person shooter that has you killing demons left and right! It differs from DOOM 2016 when it comes to difficulty. You need to be more tactical in this game. For example, you can't just spray and pray. If you do this you will die. Instead you should prioritize each enemy and know what their weaknesses are (which all of them have). The only gripe I have is the ammo issue. You simply run out of ammo too fast. You can use the chainsaw to get more ammo but this happens way too often to be a fun game mechanic. The plus side to this is that you are going to be using your abilities all the time compared to DOOM 2016 where you can just beat the game with the shotgun.

Apart from that, the secrets in this game are a blast to discover and the rewards you get for finding them make it worth it to do a second play through of the game.

As of now, I am still stuck on the last level because it is really hard for me but I will finish it at some point.

If your are not used to the weapon and ammo management system from playing Doom (2016) this may seem a little annoying at first.

The game started off fun, but it got old and frustrating pretty early on.

I guess the developers think a good challenge is to spawn mid to high tier enemies all over you so when trying to focus on what's in front of you, you get spawn fucked from behind. The boss battles in this game aren't enjoyable, and the Khan one was the dumbest thing ever. The ground turns into fire while you have enemies shooting at you and the main boss firing crap at you. You die quickly and it makes the whole experience awful. The last level of the game was the most ridiculous ever. It's literally a mess of enemies surrounding you while you run away and glory kill for health. You'll be doing a lot of that in this game.

Not to mention the platforming in this game is beyond despicable. Especially in the last few levels.

A note to the developer: JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 ENEMIES ATTACKING YOU AT ONCE DOESN'T MAKE YOUR SHOOTER ""CHALLENGING"". It makes it frustrating and repetitive. I actually enjoyed the game more when there wasn't any combat. That's not what you want from a FPS..

Also this game is a weapon switching simulator. You'll be mashing buttons to switch through your weapons to fit enemy weaknesses, especially when you have 5-10 different enemy types at any given time..

The game has a momentum issue, in a game where you are encouraged to jump and fly around the map and switch between all your weapons to get tons of awesome kills on the demon populace of earth, it sucks that there is SO MUCH that absolutely HALTS the momentum. The scraps of ammo forcing you to constantly empty whole guns on tougher enemies and scramble to chainsaw a smaller zombie or imp, enemies with tons of attacks that forcibly move you and stop you on top of reducing your look speed, enemies requiring specific weapons to combat reducing the amount you use your whole arsenal, and most notably the marauders. 

here is where I will gripe about the marauders and how they actually ruin the game for the rest of this review
The marauders are a major major issue in the game, each fight halts the gameplay and FORCES you to focus on only them, if you dont you will be killed by them almost immediately even on lower difficulties. Worst of all if you even attempt to play outside of the EXTREMELY specific and incredibly vaguely defined parameters the marauder allows you to fight in, you are heavily punished. Hell the fucker can even juggle you around with his attacks as they all reduce your movement and push you around. On top of all that, he blocks ALL quick kills in the game. The instant kill crucible? he blocks it. The extremely deadly unmakyr players have to work incredibly hard to get? he blocks it. The legendary BFG9000, one of the deadliest weapons in DOOM history? he blocks it. Once again FORCING you to play by HIS rules. The only real effective weapons against him are the railgun and super shotty, weapons that have EXTREMELY limited ammo, so you either make every shot count or try to chainsaw an enemy while he bullies you. On top of all that is the ways he punishes you. If you shoot his shield at all: he sends out a wolf that you cannot dodge that does 40 to 60 damage, if you aren't looking at him, he darts as close as possible to shoot you with the shotgun, reducing your movement and look speed on top of taking a hefty chunk of health. If you're too close he shoots the shotgun, if you're too far he shoots tracking projectiles at you, if you're in range he will dart around in and out of range of his ONLY attack that allows you to retaliate making it incredibly difficult to even keep track of.

This blows, i hate it so much, cause the game has so much good shit in it, the equipment is all fantastic, the actual weapons sound and feel so much chunkier, the new weapons are great additions, the weakpoint system is really satisfying albeit a little too important, and the old enemies brought back to this game are super fun to fight and look fantastic. It sucks that it gets bogged down by a myriad of horrible ideas in the quest of trying to make new enemies and ways to fight.",1596020564,1596020717,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035673426,307,14,1494,0,1202,1596037451,,

10,65438821,english,"What an amazing combination of lore, combat mechanics, and pounding metal, this is such an incredible evolution of Doom 2016, as the Doom Slayer, you feel absolutely unstoppable, the entire experience is geared to let you roam free and murder away. The game also requires tactics and an incredible amount of resource managing and gun switching, I've already seen comments of people who don't like the low ammo counts, it's for that exact reason to nudge you into the aggressive, switching playstyle they want you to be in. The enemies are brutal and unforgiving especially on higher difficulties (and in the slayer gates, which are some of the most challenging gunfights I've had in gaming) and the weapons are a blast to use (That super shotgun <3) there's a great self aware sense of humour carrying through the game and plenty of easter eggs and references to find. The soundtrack is downright incredible, I will rip and tear anyone who says otherwise to pieces.
Downsides? The codex is a bit uninspired and dry, especially compared to 2016 which was genuinely funny sometimes, some collectables feel a bit, placeholdery(?) and half baked. These are pretty much the only two things I can actually hold against the game.
As an experience, this is absolutely worth paying full price for. Kar En Tuk.",1584755352,1595966938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198261533734,89,2,1237,0,431,1586911320,,
11,73431884,english,"Doom Eternal is a great game that takes the mobility of Doom to a new level. The devs have made some major changes, such as limiting ammo, and buffing enemies greatly. However, this is offset by your new tools. 

This time all  enemies are projectile or melee based. This encourages a high-octane style of play with the Slayer dodging enemy projectiles while using weapon combos to devastate them. Think of Doom 2016 on Nightmare. However this time they have given you a double dash, regenerating chainsaw, a freeze grenade, and a more reliable way to get armor (flame belch). It originally seems much harder than Doom 2016, but once you realize what you have to do, Doom Eternal plays a lot like a Doom 2016 with more enemies and a faster Slayer. 

The areas of this game are much more diverse than 2016. There  is the mangled cityscape, the hellified Super Gore Nest, the beautiful vistas of Exultia combined with more hellish elements, an arctic Cultist Base, Ancient Sentinel cities, and more. There are also an abundant amount of secrets as would befit a Doom game. This time they have more clearly marked these areas with enticing question marks where these collectibles are. 

You can view these collectibles in the Fortress of Doom, where you can purchase upgrades with Sentinel Batteries hidden all over the various locations, unlock skins with said batteries, look at your weapons and collectibles, listen to music you've collected, and even play Doom 1 and Doom II. There's also a practice arena where you can test your weapons, practice your movement and combos, and get better if you're struggling. There's even some more secrets inside the Fortress of Doom. 

Some dislikes about the game:
Runes are just given instead of through Rune Trials which was much more fun. If you replay a level for fun and spend BFG or Crucible ammo it doesn't get replenished. Inversely you can also run through levels when you have spent all of these just collecting BFG rounds (such as in BFG division). I would just prefer having everything replenished in the middle of levels instead of everything BUT BFG and Crucible rounds (which you can farm through level replays anyway). I also highly dislike Battlemode. Either the demons are put against someone who is sh*t or they go up against Slayers that completely destroy. Just give us back Deathmatch :(

In DOOM Eternal, there is an increased emphasis on movement while shooting, as well as some challenging platforming elements.  The moving and shooting feels incredibly smooth once mastered, but the platforming continues to be a bit clunky.  The soundtrack is in no way bad, but there has yet to be any stand-out tracks.  There is a return of BFG Division in one of the challenges, and that was quit a nice surprise!  The graphics and visuals are incredible to say the least.  Props to the art team for designing a truly hellish Earth and some VERY beastly demons!

Honestly I much preferred DOOM 2016. 

The story feels forced onto the player as opposed to being something you could pay attention to if you wanted. Several times Hayden just tells you what is happening while all control is taken away from the player and you are set on a rail. Spoon feeding is something that comes to mind.

Pressing a button, draining toxic waste the camera is pulled out of the control of the player to show what you have done even if you are in the water that is draining, looking directly at the mechanism that is moving.

The space station seems odd, why do we not care about where the other game left off, why can the BFG be auto switched to when my other guns run out of ammo.

I had fun on Ultra Violence in 2016, the only way I can think to describe myself in Eternal is annoyed. I will be finishing out of what feels like obligation.

I loved  the 2016 version, and I bought this as soon as I could. Mechanics are way more developed.

Normal (Hurt me plenty) means normal. And Hard(Ultra-Violence) IS HARD! Usually I always crank up the difficulty on every game in the last 10 years, since they make them so easy, but not this time.

Then my save got corrupted, and I had to start all over again, but it was fun nevertheless.

67,73378976,english,"[Note: The multiplayer aspect hasn’t interested me nor do I have anyone to play it with, so that’s why it won’t be covered in this review.]

For as much as I dislike relying on comparisons, it’s hard for 2016’s Doom (I’ll call it Doom 4 for the sake of ease) to not be stacked against Doom Eternal. It’s more of that heavy, crunching combat I enjoyed back in 2016 (which in itself is worth it at price of admission), and while there hasn’t been drastic changes in terms of the gameplay loop of explore, fight, hunt for secrets and repeat, it does just enough to keep it from feeling like a glorified expansion pack. Tight gameplay, plenty of options to fight with based on the situation, exploration that’s a bit more than industrial parkour, new fantastic hellscapes… If only the boss fights weren’t gimmicky and bloated.

Where 4’s story was essentially ‘Oops, All Demons’, Eternal’s story is… It’s still ‘Oops, All Demons’, except this time Earth is under threat of demonic consumption with the Doom Slayer using a floating fortress as his base of operations to plan out and stop the incursion. There’s plenty of collectible lore to discover and read into for greater context and information, but admittedly that was low on my to-do list. What I did read into was well-structured, written and considered, so even though I went through the full game barely looking into the lore, it’s there for anyone interested and I can appreciate the effort from the writers. The plot can still be followed since it’s rather open and shut on who the bad guys are and what needs to be done to stop them - It’s Doom, after all.

Anyone coming from 4 to Eternal should feel right at home, but for those unfamiliar, Eternal’s gameplay is fast, arsenal and equipment based first-person-shooter combat frequently taking place in arenas with multiple terrain and movement options for better positioning and evasion. While there are some options for being precise, a tactical shooter this ain’t; standing still typically means game over, so mobility and target priority is a must. I can’t help but feel like the AI in Eternal got an upgrade in terms of their aggression, as there were far fewer instances I could duck behind a corner and catch my breath; if there’s enemies, they’re either in constant pursuit or bombarding you from range. Add to that encounters having more enemies to begin or spawning as the fight goes on, and you have a campaign that requires good usage of all your tools and ammo management even on normal difficulty. The flamethrower being so reliable does hurt the game somewhat, as having a tool that lets you set enemies ablaze for more armor increases your survivability, but lets the game get away with more, angry enemies. During regular encounters this is fine since it’s less time scrambling for pickups and more time in the fray, but this turns boss battles into a drawn out survival challenge instead of feeling like a major bout. With pickups being limited and enemies being used as ammunition and armor caches, cannon fodder regularly appear to serve that purpose - While still retaining their aggression amidst the boss’ own attacks. The previous game was just the boss versus the player which made the set piece feel all the more grand; in Eternal, bosses feel like a colossal gimmick with resource pinatas running around instead of this nefarious big bad to take down, especially with them having a tell to watch out for before damage can be inflicted - Often having a break in between to wait for the next opening.


This being my only real complaint of Doom Eternal, at least bosses are spread apart which means the majority of your time in the game is spent going from regular encounter to encounter and exploring the level for secrets. There’s standard secrets for upgrades, power ups and weapon modifiers to aid in combat (as was the case in 4), but there are also collectibles that are displayed and usable back at the Doom Fortress (level hub). There’s even items to find at the fortress, making it another place to explore for prizes but also to unwind in and maybe find an easter egg or two. Platforming has more going for it with some segments making use of swing bars, climbing walls and boosters to cover great distances with. Some of these elements also appear in arenas for greater mobility and vantage points, and when combined with an upgrade to allow greater air control, other than jump height there’s not a terrible lot keeping you from repositioning anywhere you want during fights - So long as it’s a valid surface and there’s no ten foot demon ready to clap you out of midair. When fast travel gets awarded, backtracking being a chore to find missed secrets is avoided and lets you pace out how to progress the level, either by heading right for the end then retracing your steps or snooping around after encounters or platforming segments.

My expectations for Doom Eternal were middle of the road mostly because I wasn’t sure where else they could take the game when I went into it. Its campaign expanded upon why the Doom Slayer is power incarnate and certainly ensures you get to wield that power with the games’ combat, but even with only a few peppered in the boss battles slaughter the fun and are the only reason I haven’t started a new playthrough yet. When I say the final boss is exhausting, it’s due to the length and incessant additional enemies spawning, not due to difficulty. That said, whether on higher difficulties to test if your Doom 4 or mobile shooting skills are sharp or lower difficulties to go for that sheer power trip, Doom Eternal is still a great, fun and worthwhile campaign.",1595889354,1595889386,True,37,0,0.761298775672912598,2,True,False,False,76561198009627228,640,35,1155,0,1155,1591668226,,

[h1]Date of Review: 27/07/2020 [/h1]

[b]Story: [/b] [h1] 4/5 [/h1]
Story when playing Doom in never something I would normally pay attention to, but this one caught my attention. Whilst it may not be the most structurally sound story it definitely gives you a sense of direction and accomplishment rather than just “KILL EVERYTHING!”. But...... y’know, still “KILL EVERYTHING!”

[b]Gameplay: [/b] [h1] 4.5/5 [/h1]
Fast paced, action packed, gore and more. Single Player is exactly this with the previously mentioned story as well as collectibles and an array of guns, upgrades and challenges. As for Multiplayer; it is a 2v1 system where 1 person plays the slayer and 2 people play demons that can also spawn lesser demons. Demons have to kill the slayer once to win a round and the doom slayer has to kill both demons within a 20 second window to win a round. Whilst I enjoyed the multiplayer, it quickly reached its lifespan for me, but during the time I did play, the community seemed decent and friendly for the best part.

[b]Graphics: [/b] [h1] 4/5 [/h1]
Visually this game is awesome, blood and guts everywhere, chunks getting blown off of demons and some of the kill animations are just pure art. 

[b]Sound: [/b] [h1] 4.5/5 [/h1]
The soundtrack is fantastic, not quite as good as the first one (2016) but that may be due to how it was mixed. Sound FX are on point and combined the game is made to be very atmospheric.

[b]Value for Money: [/b] [h1] 4.5/5 [/h1]
I got just under 70 hours out of this, around 50 in single player and 20 in multiplayer. Multiple difficulties made for plenty of replays in single player as well as collectibles, challenges and other cool Easter eggs and unlocks.

[b]Conclusion: [/b][h1] Final Score: 86% [/h1]
I really enjoyed this game and definitely recommend it if you are a fan of pretty much anything by Bethesda, faced paced action games or if you are just a fan of Doom in general. 

At full price I still consider this game good value for money, but to get the most out of your money, wait for a sale.

When I say complete access I mean complete access, and as always there are methods to use it as a backdoor to your system potentially if Denuvo is ever compromised (which is not a rare thing nowadays) Like said the game is fun, but this is a complete and utter over step by Bethesda in terms of breaching privacy+Security compromises, and for what? Stopping some asshole from cheating in a multiplayer mode that is already generally deemed to be extremely unbalanced because of the OP Doom Slayer?

For a singleplayer game, the gameplay stands far above any other first person shooter. The movement, sound, controls, and visuals are flawless and perfectly fluid with what comes before bleeding into the next. If you are looking for an unparalleled first person shooter experience then Doom Eternal is your game.

Review when Denuvo Anticheat was added:

Pirate the game, update one added Denuvo Anticheat making it literally unplayable. Windows Defender prevents me from launching the game and when I finally got it to launch it was running at 20fps at minimum settings when I was originally getting ~160fps on nearly max settings.

Fuck Bethesda.

11,71543114,english,"Updating this review since I have finished the game now. I again find it difficult to adhere to Steam's binary review system, but I have to barely end up on the recommend side.  But, I recommend you buy this only on sale, I do not think it was worth the glowing review it has gotten or the full price I paid.  If you liked the last Doom, you will love this one.  If you have not played one of the modern ones, I would definitely pass over the last one for this one.  Here is my summary:

Graphics - 9/10 - They are top notch, but I think the conceptualization is too comic-book like and wish it had been more gritty.

SFx/Music - 10/10 - Man did they hit the nail on the head with this. You just have to listen for yourself.

Plot/Story - 4/10 - They made a bunch of convoluted lore to serve as background and narrative. It is boring and worst of all, serves no purpose since no one ever needed a reason to play Doom. But what is painfully obvious as you progress through the game is that someone spent tons of time writing all of the schlock when it could have better spent ironing out some of the gameplay issues.  This is a game where less is more when it comes to plot.

Control - 9/10 - Your default speed is too slow in my opinion. Other than this, everything is great. It feels very responsive and natural. All keys are can be rebound to your liking.

Gameplay - 7/10 - Oh man, they were so close to perfection.  The fighting mechanics themselves are brilliant.  But they made a few  huge mistakes. First, they kept the game linear as it was in the last version, and even worse, in this game they do not even hide it and most of the time you know you are going into combat before you even get there.  Once you are in an encounter you are locked into that are and cannot move until you have finished the encounter.  Second, the maps are ENORMOUS and working your way through them is incredibly tedious and kills the replay value for me. You can never backtrack through a level. Completely the opposite of Doom's original brilliant gameplay. There are also some very bad decisions that were made about enemy behavior/design that really decrease the level of fun. First, there are two things in the game that can 'boost' the enemies, boost totems and another enemy called the Archevile. While an interesting idea, it is ultimately pointless because the what simply happens is that as soon as you are aware one of these things exists you immediately do nothing else but find that so you can destroy it because there will be no way to win without doing so. Often you simply cannot find them so you just die repeatedly trying to find it.  Another problem is the marauder, but others have written about that, just google it.  There are other things, too.  Trust me, there are issues with the gameplay!

Side note:  I have to remark that this is the most stable games I have played in ages.  Not only does it never crash, there is never even a hiccup or stutters when playing. 

So, 39/40, as I said, buy on sale.",1593319541,1595826565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198037455083,484,18,1486,0,569,1595650733,,
12,73342021,english,"I want to love this game, I really do.  For the things I love, this game is hands down beautiful.  The scenes portrayed feel like something horrifying and crazy is happening, yet are painstakingly beautiful.  You can see that much work went into the graphics system and they knocked it straight out of the park.  The game engine runs smoothly and I did not have any types of stuttering or lag while playing where other games, even including Doom 2016, I had stutter in places that could kill you in game.  The music feels truly appropriate for each location you hear and it can make what would be a small uninteresting place enjoyable just from it alone.  The creativity of the creatures and scenarios you find yourself in also enhances this game in amazing ways.  Hell, even the multiplayer is a fun experience that even with the Demons being the more likely ones to win, playing as the Slayer is still enjoyable.  However, the actual combat mechanics, and to a much lesser extent, the story KILL all these experiences.  

Let’s start with the combat as they’ll probably be some spoilers in the story line of this.  If you enjoy Doom 2016 and are coming straight from it, your experience of the game will almost certainly be harsh at best.  I understand that many people enjoy hard games and even I have enjoyed harder games such as Dark Souls on my consoles.  But I can say this coming from Doom 2016 myself and that is the difficulty spike between the two is absolutely absurd.  

This is a game in which you are the Doom Guy, but within a life-based system around a large damage income and low health and shield recovery.  It ultimately will leave you feeling like some random guy who put on the Doom Guy armor and it’s the only reason you are even surviving rather then being the full-on Doom Guy who the demons of Hell fear so much.  You are expected to use every single alternate ability to it’s fullest and if you are not fast enough or familiar enough with these abilities, you will die quickly even on the lower difficulties.  This incentivizes you to have some of the highest reflexes I have ever seen required for a video game and can be very harsh on someone who is not quick on the draw.  

Weapons of the game feel a bit down trodden.  The punch mechanic of the game is nerfed to be almost completely useless taking 10-20 punches to kill even a basic zombie that a single gunshot could remove unless you have a blood punch charged up.  In addition, there is no pistol so the two fall back weapons of previous Doom games are completely removed by these actions.  Your selections of weapons come back to some well-known Doom weapons, but their ammo reserves are so incredibly low that after a few shots you will find yourself running on empty and being unable to fight.  For best example, if you fully max out the ammo increase in this game your Shotgun ammo still does not even reach the first ammo upgrade in Doom 2016 for the shotgun.  In order to combat this, you are expected to make full use the chainsaw on small enemies which will then drop ammo.  It quickly becomes apparent that this is a painfully bad game technique as you are required to quickly kill the larger enemies while leaving the small ones alone. Any enemy in this game can deal serious damage to you so if you leave too many of the small ones around you will be over run as they keep spawning until the large enemies are dead.  However, if you kill too many you will find yourself out of ammo and most likely dying to larger enemies while hoping a small one spawns for a new ammo cache.  

Enemies are enjoyable for the most part.  Some of the new additions such as Whiplash and Gargoyles are annoying as Hell itself, but they feel like good additions and fit well into the system.  Marauders though DO NOT and they ruin the experience of the enemies.  This here is a creature that does not fit into any rhyme or reason within the gameplay.  If you are too close, it shoots you with a super shotgun.  If you are two far it blasts you with energy.  If you are standing the perfect distance from it, it will attack you with an energy axe.  If this was all the Marauder did, it would be a strong enemy and a unique one to the game.  Nope, they decided to give it a shield that it can bring up and negate all damage at any time.  Think you’ll one hit kill it with a BFG or Crucible attack, nope it’s immune to both of these one hit kills.  So you have a very attack driven and defensible enemy now.  What more to give it?  How about a large amount of health requiring several shots to kill when you are able to hit it?  How about a summoned dog that spawns and attacks if too much damage is dealt to the Marauders shield by you or by other enemies.  This enemy felt like it should have been a boss fight and for one of the stages it is, but then they just throw it in as a casual enemy in locations with several others in a wave spawn.  There was no reason for this other than to artificially create a difficulty that could have been obtained without this enemy and still felt fair and normal in the game.  

At last, the story.  If you do not want any potential spoilers, please end your reading here.  TLDR of this, the story went off the rails like a freight train having a head on collision with another train.  



Starting this game, I loved the story.  It seemed as though it was following up from Doom 2016.  There were a lot of questions such as who really are these priests, who are the Makyrs, what exactly are the sentinels, etc.  This game started explaining and answer these questions, you got to see how the Priests behaved, what had happened to the Sentinels homelands, even explained the downfall of the Sentinels.  The story was going great.  Then you get towards the end of the game and you have to rescue Hayden.  Here, the story shifts from an interesting story to “wtf, you threw out everything you just setup”.  Hayden seems to know everything that happened to Doom Guy.  He knows the machine that was used to give him incredible powers, he stole Father to make Vega, he knows the prophecies of the Makyrs from all I can see and find in game were never wrote down or shared with the Sentinels or Demons.  Everything in this game points to him being the rogue Makyr that created Doom Guy, but yet we know from everything in Doom 2016, Hayden was born a human, made the robot suit which others helped work on, and transferred himself into it so he could be a deadly disease.  How is in Doom Eternal this robot is now something that no one has ever seen the technology for and they cannot access it? There are so many questions here that I can’t even begin listing them all as it makes so many contradictions to the Doom 2016 and most of the Doom Eternal storyline when it gets to the end.  Maybe if there was something more clean to this I wouldn’t have issues as I do with the story and all problems would be solely with the combat.

The game seems to misunderstand what made Doom fun in 2016 and adds a lot of features which mostly make the game worse. The welcome additions are the weak points, new demons (NOT MARADUR) and there destroyable models. The ammo economy, glory kills drops, stage hazards, and cut scenes  all worsen the experience for me. The dash is fun at first but quickly makes your normal running speed seem slow by context. In Doom (2016) you always moved at max speed so you always felt fast. The puzzles and platforming is not complicated enough to be engaging and not simple enough to zone out for. Not sure what they do but pad the run time. 

The marauder is the least fun thing to play against in Doom Eternal. So many times I stopped playing once a marauder showed up. The fact you cannot use any super weapons to instakill them or even just damage them means you must engage with them in the very specific way the game wants you to.

Not only did the game have an incredible soundtrack to which I wanted to listen to just on its own, the gameplay, while incredibly visceral, makes you feel like a force of nature to be reckoned with. You feel unstoppable. As you jump through the levels and almost seem to laugh at the enemies trying to inflict damage on you, you are able to inflict double to triple right back at them. The game is enjoyable, to say the least.

  The red v blue team mutliplayer is a pretty cool take; definitely more on the creative side considering how cut and paste many FPS games are with PVP; but what's far more interesting to me is the campaign:

  The action is fast paced, in your face, punchy-blasty carnal goodness. It feels amazing to flash through swarms of enemies, swapping through truly various weapons while adapting to a shallower pool of health and ammo than traditional; presenting the player with a masterful balance between your abilities and the strength and volume of the enemies. 

  Continual movement is critical, making a few moments in the campaign heart-poundingly tense. I can't remember the last time, when going through a campaign the first time, that I stopped after taking down what felt like a sea of enemies, stopped and paused for a sec, and said out loud ""that was f****ng AWESOME.""

  I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves quick draw horde-slicing action; for those who love the old DOOM games and will appreciate the myriad Easter eggs and fuller story line, and those who will have this as their first time ripping and tearing.

Doom Eternal is a solid 8.5/10 imo. It has an excellent single-player campaign, an incredible soundtrack, and the developers do seem to care about player feedback as after the questionable decision to add kernel-level ""anticheat"" software to the game, it was removed following backlash.

However, while Eternal is at its best when you go *pew pew* against hoards of demons, unfortunately inbetween the action there is more of a focus on narrative and also an ungodly amount of aggravating platforming that takes away from the experience imo.

[h3]The good[/h3]
[list]
[*] Another poggers soundtrack from Mick Gordon. Even the menu theme is a banger.
[*] Combat is really, really fun. Very challenging and fast-paced, the game really peaks when you're just up against hoards of demons and going wild. There's definitely a certain flow you have to get used to, but once you get it it's pretty sick.
[*] Visual direction and graphics. Compared to the last game, Eternal is a lot more vibrant and colourful. Demons have been redesigned, with some going from a very edgy look in 2016 to a more stylised, almost cartoony look in Eternal (cacodemons in particular come to mind). The environments are also a lot more creative and varied, and some like Urdak actually look absolutely gorgeous.
[*] Performance. My PC isn't the most modern, but I could still run it on high at 60 FPS for the majority of the game.
[/list]

[h3]The bad[/h3]
[list]
[*] The platforming, and level design in general. There's a lot of Xen-tier floating platform shite, in addition to wall climbing and swinging from monkey bars. There's also underwater sections?? I don't know why they went this direction, but I did not enjoy it.
[*] The story and writing. While I'm not against story in a Doom game, they just didn't do a good job for how much they emphasised it. Important and relevant information that gives context to what's going on is kept to collectible codex pages (meaning you have to read walls of text), or is simply not provided at all. They certainly tried, but I still had way more questions than answers by the end.
[/list]

[h3]The ???[/h3]
[list]
[*] The abundance of cutscenes. While the last game was pretty sparse with them, they really went ham here. Cutscenes aren't inherently bad, but I feel the excessive use of them really took away from the experience. You've got door opening cutscenes, riding the elevator cutscenes, talking to people cutscenes, you name it. Some of them are cool, but a lot of them just feel pointless. I'd rather press E to kill a demon than watch a cutscene of it being killed from a third-person perspective. 
[*] Linearity. This time around levels are SUPER linear and straightforward -- while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's certainly different. As a result though, it's a lot less time-consuming to hunt for collectibles and progress through levels.

As for the actual game, it's only slightly worse than DOOM 2016. The combat is faster and more complicated, and there's a ton of enemy variation, but it feels significantly less cohesive than DOOM 2016. For every cool new idea there's a regression in either art design or story and it just doesn't mesh together in the same seamless way the previous game did. The more fantastical elements of the story always seemed to take me out of the game, rather than the kind of ""mysterious and unexplained"" approach the last game took to integrating its supernatural elements.

If you're only here for a mechanical challenge, this game has significantly better AI than the previous game, and will take serious consideration to get through fights on nightmare.

54,73317051,english,"It's good, but I don't think it's as good as Doom 2016.
Doom Eternal has great graphics, and the gameplay overall is similar to Doom 2016. I can't deny the glory kills are possibly a bit better, and the demon slaying is more satisfying somehow. Also, there seem to be more of the old original monsters, revamped and beautifully created in today's graphics.

But overall, to my mind, it is spoilt by the platform type areas - wide jumps / climbs that must be passed in order to progress through the game. If you get stuck on one, you have to keep repeat, repeat, repeating till you succeed, and that quickly wears a bit thin.
So the game mainly seems to be either a repeat-till-you-succeed platform, or a frantic kill-fest.
Doom 2016 was a more progressive journey through the levels, with a consistent level of monsters and ripping and tearing. But I suppose it's down to personal preference.

I have played Doom 2016 through twice, and will definitely play it again, but the platform sections might put me off doing the same with Doom Eternal.

75,73298667,english,"I feel I need to thumb this up solely for the quality of the product. It just runs super well, the environments are gorgeous, and the sound is excellent. You will get your moneys worth and this is just quite simply a good game. However, it has a long list of issues, and seemed to do nothing but deviate from the quality of the first game.

1. Bugs. Yes, unlike the first game you will actually encounter quite a lot of bugs in this game, from crashes to getting stuck inside walls, to the camera doing weird things with some of the set pieces and going inside objects. It really took away from the experience, and is sad to see given I encountered none of this in the last game.

2. Level/world design. While everything looks great, many of the platform and puzzle sections are just outright bad and unintuitive. There were several places where I wondered around for sometimes minutes trying to figure out what I supposed to do, only to find some wall climb or jump I was supposed to do, but it was so obscure that it took forever to find. Really just a lot of these sections were poorly crafted.

3. Hard enemy counters. This game encouraged you to use all available tools by giving enemies unique counters, which seems like a good idea on paper. It actually works very well in the later stages of the game when you have a full arsenal of tools, you get into a rhythm and everything flows together well. The problem is that before you have all these tools, the game is incredibly one dimensionsal and boring. The first 40% of the game is just not fun. By the time things are put together and the game starts getting fun, you are already about done with it.

4. Ammo. Related to number 3, this game gives you virtually no ammo to work with, forcing you to swap weapons. The intention is that you use the chainsaw to replenish ammo, but the problem is what happens when there are no good chainsaw targets. There were several times where I simply just didn't have ammo or anyone I could chainsaw, so I just had to stand there and let enemies kill me. Really flawed design there, even something as simple as throwing out some weaker enemies would have solved this, but nonetheless there were several times where this happened and it was just frustrating.

5. Leveling up. Why there were so many resources and leveling systems baffled me. They all felt out of place. It felt less like I had a ""build"" and more that qol things that your character should just have were locked behind these weird systems. I don't get it, and I didn't get it in Doom 2016 either, but apparently modern gaming = skill trees in everything, even in genres where it doesn't belong.

6. The Marauder. This point has been made by everyone already, but the Marauder is just simply an enemy in the wrong game. Every time you encounter one the gameplay becomes degenerate, and you just gotta run, kill everything else, and follow the stupid pattern waiting for him to glow green. You get used to it pretty quick, and it's really not that hard, just really boring. I don't see how this even made it out of testing stages, but here it is and it sucks.

Again, I'd say the environments, the sound/music, and the super shotgun make this a quality game worthy of a thumbs up, but it really was just worse in every way than Doom 2016, a bit disappointing really.",1595749556,1595750792,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069604507,298,42,616,0,616,1595748488,,

74,73239053,english,"A great fast-paced shooter with plenty replayability. Lots of mobility! 

The gameplay loop reminds me of character action games a bit, but without the scoring system. The AI is much more aggressive and brutal than the previous entry, so don't just load it up on Ultraviolence if it's your first time playing (I did that but I just powered through it.) Haven't played the multi-player much since I have bad internet, but I hear it's decent. 

The soundtrack is amazing. Even if you don't own the game yet, look up ""Doom Hunter"", ""BFG10K"", ""Cultist Base"", ""Phobos Base"" and ""Meathook"" on YouTube. It's actually hard to recommend just one or two songs because the soundtrack is that good. Lots of aggressive industrial synths and percussion. Djent guitars, too. Mick Gordon used a chainsaw run through a homemade compressor for one of these tracks.

The story might be seen as a step back to some when compared to the last game, but I personally had fun with the He-Man saturday morning cartoon vibe they went with in this game. There's space vikings, screaming skeleton gods, mad scientists who rant about their finest creations, and a whole level dedicated to crafting a new magic/futuristic sword for the protagonist (after you broke off the last one into a demon the size of a house.) Definitely tons of fun if you like over-the-top storylines that don't take themselves too seriously. Some of the running gags will get annoying after a while, though. The ""mortally challenged"" joke might've been funny the first 20 times, and I've heard that joke since that one pre-release trailer, but the game keeps. making. the same. joke. over and over again. There are even some characters that make the joke despite it not making sense for them to call demons mortally challenged, like the ARC broadcast lady.

The art design is fantastic. It's trivial to tell, in a split second, what enemies are of what type based on their design, even from far away. The environments look great as well. Every set-piece in Hell looks like a death metal album cover. It's great. The argent and mayk'r worlds look cool too. The weapons look and feel amazing, my favorite being the machine gun. It's like firing a 50. Cal, but you're running around with it. 

There was some drama over id putting kernel-level cheat protection into the game, but I think they removed it in an update a while ago.

Overall, I would totally recommend this game! If you're really not sure whether or not this game is for you, try it out at a friend's captain's quarters.

8,71678658,english,"Dont waste $120 and under on this game. Preordering was a big mistake.

Save your time and money. 
Get the 2016 DOOM. 
That's what you want. 
Not this. This is bad. 
I feel so scammed out of time and money. 


Between the crap RNG for online (Pitting a lvl 3 player against 2 level 100-200 demon players, or two lvl 2-5 demons against a lvl 100+ Slayer, I mean what the actual heck devs?) 
And the abundant cheaters (Slayer stood there, shooting us, didn't move, he was swarmed by 2 live demons and our little minions. He didn't die. We died. All rounds. Same MO. Not enjoyable at all) 
It's nearly impossible to play PVP unless you too are sporting all the finest aimbots and wall hacks the internet has to offer. 

Wish I'd known it was this bad before playing 2 hours in SINGLE PLAYER MODE so yanno, I can't refund it or anything.

It doesn't pick up from where you last left off in 2016, the maps are still trash level design wise, look forward to spending 45 minutes trying to solve a puzzle spot, only to lurch yourself forward enough as you die, that the game presumes you did it right and saves you on the other side of a pit you cannot get back across so anything you didn't do back there (secrets etc) you'll never get on this play through. The story is disjointed, and that's if there's story at all I'm nearly 20 hrs in and I STILL have no idea whats happening or why I'm doing what I'm doing... It's clunky, and awkward and feels overly inflated for the sake of inflation.   

I just wanted a DOOM 2016 continuation, Pick up from the crap hitting the fan and headed for earth.  Instead we get a floating mecha cathedral in space which serves as far as I can tell, mostly to house your collection of collectables... Which are oddly easier to find than last game. And a teleporter to zip you down to random spots to fight demons, turn on turrets and fight more demons with cartoony sounds and colours. Long gone are the actual terrifying demons, enjoy your neon glows and farting giggles they call Demonic SFX..

The soundtrack is nice, the first 20 times. I was excited to hear it.  It's great. Do yourself a favor, listen to it on youtube. 
But theres no variation to the music, I feel it's the same song with the same rift and I hear that damn guitar in my most unenjoyable of nightmares now. At least 2016 switched it up every few maps. 

The skins and events and items and stands gestures etc... There's little to no information on HOW to get them. 
Do you HAVE to play online mode?
Are they timed events?
Can you still get them after events?
If you're halfway through a level of items, are you SOL once the next set comes out?

And when you DO get them, they show up... eventually. This problem has been ongoing since launch. the Pre-order items came in at random. if at all for some players.

Overall highly dissatisfied with this game :(

*Update*
+6hrs
I keep trying to like the game.. But I can't, and I don't. Ughhhh so sad I really wanted to love this game ;__; Sadly I still play DOOM 2016 SINGLE PLAYER more than I play this. Trudging through the levels is an effort to say the least. 
Platforming tools get in the way, so many times I've been looking to get away from a demon only to find out I've accidentally backed into a swing bar and WHOOP off I go, nowhere I wanted to be, and usually into a swarm of demons BOOM dead.  This game is work. I don't like to mix work with what is supposed to be an enjoyable exciting thrilling game. 
But no. It's work. And whats worse is its work I paid to do. Jokes on me. 

*Update*

I finished it.
All I can say is Meh.

The game is an absolute adrenaline overload. So many things happen at any engagement that may seem overwhelming at the start, but once you get the rhythm of the game, Doom eternal will look like an elegant dance of violence. 

Personally I like the aesthetics of Doom 2016 more. But Doom eternal's gameplay leaves 2016 in the dust. In 2016, weapon switching was merely suggested and the chainsaw was just another weapon. In DE, weapon switching is a must and chainsaw  (along with your flamebelcher and grenade launcher)  is required to be mastered to fully play the game. To that end, you must rebind your keys,  so that you can instantly react  to an ever chaotic situation. The weapon wheel can help for some players but it's a lot better to rebind your weapons directly to keys.


Every heavy / super heavy demons have weaknesses you exploit with the proper tools/weapons.The following is what I usually do against certain demons
Cacodemons (buffed as compared to Doom 2016) are agile and spam ranged attacks) - grenade in mouth for glory kill status
Arachnotrons (very deadly at the initial levels) - heavy cannon snipe off the cannon on top, aim rocket while its stunned, ballista / ssg thenafter
Mancubus (deadly at close range with their flamers) - one heavy cannon snipe for one cannon, one ballista at the other cannon, a rocket at center mass, meathook for up close SSG shot
Cybermancubus - same as mancubus but cannons can't be shot off, best tactic is to  freeze grenade, meathook, blood punch, SSG / balista
Revenant (rockets deal respectable damage) - heavy cannon snipe one of its launcher, ballista the other, meathook for either SSG or bloodpunch 
Whiplash (massive pain in the ass with their ranged / stunlock)- Lock on triple rockets for insta kill, no discernible weakness other than high burst damage
Stalkers - meathook pointblank ssg (kills) or ballista (glory kill state)
Pinkies - bloodpunch instakills them
Hellknight / Dreadnight - theoretically can be staggered endlessly by chaingun, but a properly placed grenade can help you stunlock them with typical switches (rocket, ballista, meathook > ssg)
Pain elemental - rocket lock-on > ballista > meathook SSG
Doom hunter - microwave mod for plasma rifle can remove their shielding after 3 sesconds, before the last second, shoot a grenade near its  ""feet"" to stagger again, then do your usual cycle. Once removed from its ride, pretty standard high burst cycle can insta kill it
Marauder - always kill the wolf when it spawns, stay away from close range, when eyes flash green shoot your SSG, immediately shoot a grenade at its feet, ballista, SSG, ballista. Marauder hp is down to around 40 percent. Wait for another opening then do again. Marauder dead in less than 6 seconds.
Baron of hell - Eh. Just a big hellknight/dreadknight
Tyrant - quite easy to kill tbh. just a large lifepool. Ballista seems to stagger it pretty consistently. So basically cycle rocket > ballista  > meathook SSG > grenade at feet, fly away, repeat.

Battlemode while an interesting idea is poorly executed. Latency issues will have you getting shot at (either as a demon or as the slayer) when you're already in cover. When I play as a demon, I fall into the ground at the start of the match around 20% of the time. There is no rank match making, so sometimes new players get paired with high level players making the match seem severely unbalanced for either side. Then you hear from dev's that they are  focused more on battlemode rather than beefing up single player more. Snap maps (from 2016) is a lot more interesting. Master levels are interesting. A horde mode / co-op mode is interesting. Battlemode is  meh.",1595605088,1595605363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198126619739,35,8,10393,1356,6294,1602046347,,

20,73208729,english,"TLDR; It's like DOOM 2016 but faster, with more demons, more challenging, with a deeper lore and a good variety on the environment. Definitely a good game.

The combat system has greatly improved, you finally have to use more than two weapons, and resources management has a huge impact on the outcome of a fight (well, given that you are playing on at least UV, below that anything works really), and countrary to what a lot of people say, you will hardly run out of ammo, since your chainsaw automatically refill one charge overtime.
Battlemode is...there I guess. It's not great, after a while it gets really repetitive, but it's still fun to do some matches between an UN run and the other. At least they got rid of the ugly loadout system of 2016 and got back to a more ""FPS Arena"" style, which is definitely good (bring back Doom 3 multiplayer pl0x).
The OST is superb as usual (really sad to know that Mick and id will not work together anymore), it mixes really well with what's happening on screen and you'll never get a ""quiet"" moment.

Eternal goes even further by bringing back a lot of the original Doom visuals, which put a huge grin on my face. Yes, I still think that the infamous Marauder should have been a boss fight only and not a regular addition to the rooster. Platforming is confusing or even annoying at times, but with accommodating  level design like on Mars or Earth it give a lot more mobility and interesting level traversing options. Overall, this is both thumbs up and a recommendation to everyone looking for fast paced, arcade combat where you'll get to rip and tear the Hell a new one.

26,73199850,english,"Played it on nightmare difficulty. I was a bit skeptical of this game at first because it comes off as a little more 'game-y' than Doom 2016: tutorial rooms to teach you guns, specific ways to force HP/Armor drops in addition to chainsaw ammo, etc. To my surprise the game is incredibly well balanced compared to its predecessor due to these decisions. You need to use all of your guns because ammo/chainsaw is limited, no longer can you just stick with the Super Shotgun of 2016. The game feels incredible when you master the dash, the fast weapon swaps, the meat hook, and the other mechanics needed to succeed on Nightmare and Ultra-Nightmare difficulties. The mobility in this game blows all previous entries out of the water with how fast it plays and I really get a Quake CPMA feeling between movement and fast weapon swaps.

My biggest fault is some of the assistance features that are turned on by default. Tips that pop-up telling you how to defeat a new enemy before they even appear on your screen, special armor if you die on a boss a few too many times, etc. These can be toggled off in the menu but I'm not a fan and don't understand why they aren't disabled on Nightmare difficulty. I did appreciate how loading screen tips changed bind keys based on my configured keybind, nice touch.

The only other downside is that exploration isn't as exciting as older 90's Doom games. You never really find anything exciting in secret rooms but sometimes the puzzles are satisfying.

The music is still amazing in this game with both new and old songs.

However, it makes up for that in droves with outstanding gameplay mechanics, diverse environments across every level, interesting engagements with enemies, and fun puzzle bits. I seriously loved this game so much more than I thought I would. I am impressed in every way.

36,73192333,english,"        Alright, so there is a lot to say about this game, so I will summarize now. I think this game is worth $30 - $50 I would pay $40 and be happy with the purchase. This game is like DOOM 2016 and Wolfenstein: The New Order, two good games.

         Now that that is done, I paid $60 for this game and I will be mostly discussing the bad of this game, so before I start saying all of the bad things I noticed, I do like this game, and I believe any fan of Bethesda's FPS games should give it a try. I'll name a few objectively good things first: it is DOOM, this needs no explanation if you are familiar with the series. It has great graphics. The game is optimized very well. There are less glitches than other Bethesda games (no obvious ones to me after playing 18 hours of the campaign.

          Alright, so now time for my problems with the game; the campaign in this game is pretty short considering the $60 price tag, this is something that I need to talk about, because in recent Bethesda games there has been an increase in online content, and DOOM Eternal is in an awkward stage in between a Quake and a DOOM. What I mean by that is, every DOOM game up until now has been solely focused on the single player experience, yes DOOM 2016 did have multiplayer, but DOOM 2016's multiplayer was an afterthought, the whole thing was kind of thrown in there and completely unbalanced which is bad. But DOOM 2016's multiplayer was not PVP focused like DOOM Eternal, it was coop based, and PVP is much harder to account for. I believe that DOOM Eternal's development was closer to a 50/50 split for multiplayer and singleplayer making them both suffer. Unlike other reviews I will not take offence to their map design, I have seen much worse from Bethesda (I come from playing Oblivion). A big thing that I take issue with this game is how the developers added so much new stuff, I think every installment of a series should be very distinct and they did that, but I think if they took all of the enemies and weapons from DOOM 2016, set it on earth, and updated the graphics; it would be distinct enough. The amount of things they did to DOOM in this installment I believe is too much, they added a flame thrower, multiple grenade slots, dashing, button things, climbable walls, etc. and in DOOM 2016 I don't think anyone even used the grenades, I sure didn't. The point is for me to bring light to how hard they tried to make this not just another DOOM game, but, is it crazy to say that that is what all of us wanted? Even if it was basically the same DOOM 2016 we all loved with new levels it would still be good. DOOM 2016 felt like a splash and a real revival to the DOOM games, it felt like the same Doomguy we liked in the original games, updated for a modern audience. And all it needed to say on the box was DOOM and nothing else, it was awesome, then DOOM Eternal comes out and it is good, but it isn't another splash, it felt like Wolfenstein: The New Order, a good game, but not DOOM. That is another thing, Wolfenstein 1 (as I will call it) was a usually slow paced shooter that felt great to sneak around people, but DOOM has none of that, DOOM is supposed to be in your face and loud shooting. But because of the game having all of these mechanics that you are forced to use if you don't go around to find every collectible known to man you are, one or two times a stage, in a courthouse battle scenario without all of the tight controls, speed, and lean mechanics in Wolfenstein, it is not as hard as the courthouse battle but it might take you a few tries. The bottom line of this is that DOOM has always been loose and limber, you run around and shoot hoards of demons, but DOOM Eternal feels tighter and more technical, like Wolfenstein, this is a change no one should like, because this has always been the difference between Wolfenstein and DOOM and this difference seems to blur the further we go on. 

Over all, this is a DOOM game, and a good one at that, but I fear for the future of the franchise. Bethesda has done this in 2 different ways with, now, 4 of their series. Oblivion came out dumbing the intelegence of the story and puzzles for better gameplay, Wolfenstein's reboot sacrifices it's more DOOM-esque features to form it's own identity as a more technical game, Fallout 4 came out as dumber and more technically focused than any other Fallout game, and now DOOM? I don't think so yet, but if I could ask Bethesda one question about the future of the DOOM series it would be: If you take away dumb fun from DOOM to add more technical features, then I ask you.

Remember when Doom was about a random Marine fighting demons on Mars? Well now he has a floating castle in space; and he apparently had been sent to Mars to fight demons by some bullshit fantasy kingdom in some other dimension bla bla bla; granted in Doom 2016 they made it clear he wasn't just a marine, but they didn't really make a big deal out of it, and it was great that way.

47,69347981,english,"EDIT: Anti-Cheat was later removed. My point about the gameplay still stands.

Heads-up, this game no longer works with Linux thanks to the anti-cheat. Furthermore, the anti-cheat implemented by Bethesda and Id is far too invasive to your home PC. It also can cause game instability. You have to use this system even if you never plan to play online. 

Bethesda's stance on this anti-cheat is confusing. They don't seem to understand why the players are upset. To be fair, in the last nine years the company has become too detached from their fan base. Most of what comes down from Pete Hines is either contrived BS or conceded half-truths. 

On the gameplay note, I feel Doom 2016 is a bit more fun. Eternal has a great score and some fun instances of combat, but the game pushes you to swap weapons constantly. This becomes a little too much in some fights where you're less focused on the enemy and more focused on how many shots you have left. You're no longer swapping weapons because specific guns are more powerful against specific enemies, you're swapping out guns because they're all constantly empty. There are perks to increase the amount of ammunition you can carry, but they do not add nearly enough. This system feels like it was designed for a higher difficulty setting.

55,73182516,english,"Doom eternal is a glorious game that builds a multilayered pie of skill-based gameplay loops into an addictive whole while running better than most other large releases this year (with a fraction of the HDD space too).

Every part of this thing was designed with clear purpose and a role in the elaborate, free-form combat system that is as much about tactics as it is strategy. Even the much maligned marauder has a valuable role in meaningfully changing how you have to approach combat (I think the hate comes from the fact that people assume he is a pressure unit to be taken out quickly rather than a kind of 'chaser' that should be taken out last, this is the sort of thing that people will get used to in time).

-marauder - an enemy almost everyone unanimously hates at first, possibly forever, and without the proper strategy feels like the game is throwing a boss at you from a souls game
-difficulty - sometimes the game is just brutally hard and a lot of people will be quickly overwhelmed in certain arenas by the large variety of demons

What I Think About Those Issues:
platforming - every once in a while i won't latch to something i should have latched to, but other than that, i have personally loved the platforming throughout the entire game, and i think it's really well-designed in that it doesn't slow down the pace of the game (unless you mess up). also, the mantling, double-jump, dash ability and meathook really make navigating basically every space in the game easier. 
marauder - hated him until i learned how to weapon swap. now i don't find him to be a huge issue (occasionally wackiness where he doesn't get staggered by a point-blank ballista shot aside). 
difficulty - most people i find who complain about this are often getting caught by demons on the ground. you should always be airborne in this game. it gives you a lot of tools to do this, some of which are the most fun mobility mechanics i've ever used in an FPS.

okay, now the biased opinion. this is my favorite shooter to be released in a decade or so. it may be my favorite of all time.

Graphics/art design: 10/10 - if you liked original DOOM color schemes and level designs you may feel the same. demons will lose chunks of body as you shoot them to display how much damage they've sustained. i love little details like that.

Sound design: 10/10 - pretty easy to tell where everything is by sound alone, guns sound really good

Music: 10/10 - the dynamic music in DOOM (2016) and Eternal are one of the reasons they are so popular from what i've been able to tell. never played a game that does such a good job with this. i'm pretty uneducated musically, so take this opinion with a grain of salt, but i think this soundtrack is better than 2016's. BFG division will always hold a place in my heart, but this one's really good. hoping that they find someone equally as talented as mick for future games.

Gameplay: 10/10 - it's just so fast, and so aggressive, and there are a lot of buttons to press. the same amount from 2016, plus some extras. they are not necessary to press - my first nightmare playthrough, i barely used flame belch, for instance. however, you will feel much more unstoppable when you've mastered all of the various abilities. this is good, because demons are accurate, fast, and numerous. every demon has a weak spot that can be exploited for more damage or to reduce their battle effectiveness, and even in their handicapped state, a lot of them are still pretty strong (fucking arachnotron bombs).
movement tech in this game is just so rewarding and fun. the meathook feels so unrealistic but who cares, because soaring across an arena at 200mph after swinging yourself around a zombie feels so good. once you've mastered the game's mechanics, you will feel EXTREMELY powerful. 

Story: 9/10 - i liked it even when it was cheesy. big difference from 2016. i won't say much more.

oh yeah, Multiplayer: 7/10 - needs better netcode (like really bad), would be nice if it was slayers v slayers as opposed to the asymmetrical experience they went for, BUT i really enjoy the multiplayer. my experience with it has been: laggy as shit, almost completely nontoxic (either no communication or nice, friendly chats with other players), with a surprisingly high skill ceiling for demons. however, the pace of the game is set entirely by the doomslayer. certain people are able to weapon swap and hit with weapons so accurately and quickly that you, as the demon, can die in about 2-3 seconds, sometimes unable to properly react because the slayer is behind a wall on your screen due to the aforementioned shit netcode. i have had some games where it is literally just impossible to beat the slayer unless you are coordinating with your teammate on voice chat, and have some experience playing together. even in this situation, certain players will almost never lose, which can be discouraging to new players

if you are interested in this game and you like arena-style shooters with a really high skill ceiling, some of the best mobility options in an FPS, and it's also DOOM, you should probably just buy it, on sale or whenever you can afford it.

I am very cautious when it comes to preordering games, more so when it comes to publishers with a known history of fucking things up like Bethesda. But thought it would be very difficult to fuck this one up. The game is great after all. You just have to publish the game, nothing more, nothing less.

I regret my decision to preorder this game now. Admittedly, the single player campaign is absolutely great. But I would not have bought this game if it would have been advertised to contain Kernel-mode-anticheat software from Denuvo in the future. I refuse to install this software again because of Denuvo anti cheat and thus I can no longer play the game at all, even in single player mode. Refunds are not possible at this point. Thanks a lot, Bethesda! 

Don´t give these people your money, they don´t deserve it.

EDIT: So, as Bethesda has noted in their comment to this review, the Denuvo Anti Cheat Integration has been removed in the last update. That´s great. Really good move, Bethesda.
I tried to give the game another chance because of that, but the game is completely broken now and does no longer start at all.

The feeling of frustration is compounded on levels that often take over an hour to complete. 

The nail in the coffin is the total lack of irreverent humour that made DOOM 2016 such a joy to play. Instead, you're overloaded with self-serious and verbose lore so ham fisted that was a complete chore to slog through reading.

Despite fleeting moments of sweaty, heart-pounding, action, I find myself completely unwilling to play it again. I'd love to try the multiplayer but my friends have the Bethesda Launcher version which, for some absolutely stupid and infuriatingly unknown reason, doesn't allow us to play together on PC.

However, outside of that, it's sub-par or outright disappointing. The game feels like a total parody of itself.

Everything that made Doom 2016 great was turned into nostalgia-bait gimmicks and parodic fan service.

SPOILERS:

The video-gamey approach, such as floating weapons/items, extra lives, floating question marks for secrets, are extremely cheesy and make it hard to take anything other than the gameplay seriously. It feels like it's one step away from being a meme game. It feels like a bunch of nostalgia bait was crammed into it, and it feels really arcadey.

The portrayals of doom guy where he talks is cringe-worthy at best. I like that they tied the slayer to the classic doom guy, but the approach was just all wrong.

And last but not least, fighting the Khan Maykr and the Icon of Sin were the most disappointing fights I've ever encountered. They don't feel like a test of skill, but more of an endurance test. Fighting them was more of a chore than anything else.

Not to mention the Icon of Sin's design is fucking awful. Let's just put this ancient eldritch goat head onto the body of a raging bodybuilder, and put really hideous armor on it. Then you get to relive Doom 2's icon of sin fight by shooting at a wall, only this one requires less skill and frustration because the weak spots are out in the open.

Doom Eternal had so much potential and failed in many areas. While I do enjoy playing this game, I can't recommend it because it's such a letdown in all the ways I've listed. It's a gimmicky, borderline meme game with fun combat.

In the light of Bethesda staff leaving a comment on my review, I've decided to update it.

Doom Eternal is a fine game... However, I didn't like it nearly as much as Doom 2016.
I understand the idea behind ""combat puzzle"", but I don't like being forced in a particular play style, instead of improvising on the go as I want to. The further into the game, the more combat feels like a chore instead of a fun activity it supposed to be.
And don't even get me started on Marauders! I have no idea why they exist. The only purpose they serve is being fun police. As soon as Marauder shows up, combat slows down to a crawl, and any semblance of game flow is getting thrown out of the window.

There is some strategy involved in when to use which weapon, but with only 4 ammo types (5 if you count bfg), once you run out on one weapon, you'll also run out on the other. Final edit: ok, the chainsaw refills itself. Ammo is never an issue anymore, because you can just keep chainsawing forever. This gets very tedious, however.
* Platforming. A little bit is okay, but you're supposed to jump from ledge to ledge and if you miss, you're dead. Also, jumping from wall to wall is almost a puzzle as it's barely visible which walls you can jump and which you can't. edit: I'm a bit further in the game now and it has progressed to double jump to double dash to recharge dash in mid air to dash some more to jump to horizontal bar to jump to dropping platform through fire and electric barricades. I wish I was kidding.

I'll continue to play to finish the campaign, but I wanted to throw this out there for people thinking about buying it in the summer sale: this is not the greatness of the previous doom. Wait till it's at least 75% off.

Final edit: Ok I have now finished the game. My points all remain the same. I'll give the game one thing: it is very pretty. The environments are amazing to look at.
But it's just not as fun to play as the previous doom. The music never goes to 11, I never got the ""this is awesome!"" feeling, the entire game feels like a chore. The story is.. whatever.

97,69331570,english,"since denuvo has been removed i will edit this review.  
Doom Eternal is honestly one of the best games made in recent years and is an amazing continuation of a beloved series.  the combat is fluid and fast paced while the weapons have incredible precision which amps up every aspect of combat to new levels.  replay value is amazing as is the incredibly innovative way the camera shifts from 1st to 3rd person in many cutscenes.  as for me personally, i absolutely adore the insane level of mobility they have given to the Doom Slayer allowing for true free movement during and after combat in all areas.   the art work on this game is beyond masterpiece levels, a real treat for the eyes and imagination, building an amazingly living world out of dead corpses and destruction.

i will be leaving my old review in place under this as history must be acknowledged as should their (the developers) work to right historical wrongs should be acknowledged as well.

OLD REVIEW - PRE DENUVO REMOVAL




Doom Eternal was an amazing game until denuvo kernel level drivers were crammed in with the first update.  no userlevel program needs kernal level access especially anti-cheat systems that are known to and are currently screwing up save files, degrading performance, and making the product you paid for utterly unable to be used.

will not recommend this game to anyone until denuvo kernel level is removed.   
i am a QA Engineer with 20+ years experience as well as a Network Engineer with 20 years experience, kernel level drivers for something like anti-cheat are 100% a security risk and should NEVER be used and absolutely should NEVER be forced on players AFTER they have already paid for a game.  telling us beforehand at least lets us make an informed decision however bethesda took away that consumer right when they forced their crap through to people who already bough DE.",1589751677,1595496282,True,0,0,0.538622856140136719,0,True,False,False,76561198040097525,484,2,6640,0,4156,1599426819,1595463002.0,"Greetings,

6,73148606,english,"Over past few years, I thought I had lost the taste for games, as I had difficulty getting immersed by the games I played. The only game that had managed to immerse me was Dark Souls and that was thanks to its atmosphere, lore and narrative.

Then, I played DOOM 2016, which I had an absolute blast but was not really immersive for me. (that's not to say the game is bad in any way).

Then I got DOOM Eternal from steam summer sale and boy oh boy. During intense fights, I could FEEL my brain getting 100% stimulated by dashing, double jumping, shooting and switching weapons at the same time. Some say that the decreased ammo capacity is a downside, I say that it is indeed an upside, as it introduces strategic thinking into the game. 

Once I got a hang of the game mechanics and managed to incorporate ammo-, armor- and health management into my play style, it felt amazing. I was chewing through demons with speed and FUN.

11,73146780,english,"Fun and challenging for the most part, some horrible enemy/battlefield designs though. Once you are introduced to Marauders you will learn to hate this game. Every time you encounter one of these fucks, the arena is tiny and quite tedious to maneuver to avoid the Marauder. With that, they spam spawn an enemy that constantly punts you around, throwing off your aim. If that wasn't bad enough, the Marauder itself constantly spams ranged/melee attacks and is only damageable for a fraction of a second as it is attacking you. After that, it gains the ability to deflect any damage you throw at it. There are several other enemies in the game that follow this same poor arena design/enemy difficulty scheme that ultimately leads to more frustration than fun. It seems like many of the maps/arenas were designed more with a focus on looking cool rather than pairing well with the enemies they contain, limiting the fun aspect of gameplay and only giving challenge.

With all of that being said, it has some fun gunplay with all of the different weapons/mods you can find in the world, not that they'll ever really help. Every gun still feels like a pea shooter against most enemies besides the fodder. The collectibles/lore are just about the only enjoyment I get from the game, many of them are hidden behind fun/challenging puzzles that promote a desire to explore the different maps. The story and lore are very engaging, and I find them to be vastly improved when compared to Doom 2016.",1595483252,1595483252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198102279357,73,3,1875,102,893,1601513524,,

Your exploration felt like it had impact with good story telling to back it up. Doom Eternal is an arcade game. It lacks all the charm of the original, but with 3x the action. The action itself is wild and fun, but it's *massively* overloaded. It's less an 'adrenaline rush' and more a 'meth-addict rampage' that makes NO sense story-wise. Good for getting your FPS rocks off, not so great for a relaxing gaming experience.

The game is fast paced and brutal.

==========================

It's a great game but the game portion is not the problem.  Bethesda has seen fit to add an anti-cheat service that operates at the kernal level on your computer.  This will cause performance hits but the real problem is it creates a gaping security risk. 
 That's completely unacceptable.  While the patch notes (linked here: https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en/article/2zHgbzsIV8gTzFUZ75ADGx/update-1) claim that it will not be used for any spying or nefarious purpose we've been lied to before.  

More importantly if Denuvo is ever cracked it would be possible for this to become a gaping back door for any black hat who wants access to your system.  Bethesda: You do NOT get to do this.  You do NOT get to alter a product into unsability by anyone sane and informed.  The fact that you did this in the first update tells me you had this shady BS planned from the start.

An Edit: 

Thank you Lazida, I shall note in my review, the reason for my negative review is no longer that Doom Eternal contains Denuvo Malware, my negative review is now for the reason that Id Software and their parent company Bethesda both somehow deemed it acceptable to introduce Denuvo Malware post-launch, and only decided to remove it after outcry.

How did the staff at these companies become so out of touch with their consumers. How did the staff in charge of this decision not have the advisers they needed to forecast that such a stupid choice would receive push back from the people who loved their otherwise perfect game.

49,69348806,english,"Alright, now that Denuvo has been partially removed in the 1.1 update, I'm tweaking my review a bit. As a fan of the original Doom as well as the recent remake, I can say it is a solid continuation of the first. The campaign is good, and there's a few neat new mechanics that are quite fun. I can't speak for the multiplayer since I don't use it, but the single player is very enjoyable.

Now, onto the disclaimer. If you're getting the game for the singleplayer experience, I 100% recommend it. Very fun. If you're planning on doing multiplayer, however, you'll need Denuvo installed.

For those who don't know, Denuvo is an incredibly invasive anti-cheat and DRM. It literally installs itself into your PC at a kernel level, meaning that it literally builds itself in as a system process for Windows. It is known to ACTIVELY weaken your PC's security, do plenty of data harvesting and selling, and to top it all off, degrades your PC's performance while the game is running AND while it isn't. So yeah. having Denuvo on your system won't only make DOOM run like crap, but all your other games too! Not to mention that Denuvo frequently causes FPS loss of 30 frames or more on MOST systems.

In conclusion, don't pick this game if you want to play with other humans. If you want a good, immersive, fun campaign, definitely recommend. If you're looking for multiplayer though, find another game like Destiny 2 or Remnant: From the Ashes. Denuvo is too high a cost to play with other humans.",1589781466,1595464304,True,0,0,0.500586152076721191,0,True,False,False,76561198158977891,799,16,670,0,670,1589328638,1595456167.0,"Greetings,

50,68957430,english,"There is no real reason to buy this game

1) This is more a first-person platformer with occasional battles in the latter half of the game. There are even the fire sticks from the original Super Mario Bros. as aerial obstacles with no explanation, they just float in mid-air unconnected to anything.
2) Ammo caps are so low you can't take different approaches to fighting, there's only 1 way to play. Figuring out the ""right way"" cuts the difficulty by 75%
3) The game's story elements are completely disconnected from 2016. We don't get an answer as to why the Slayer saved Vega, why Hayden teleported the Slayer away at the end of 2016, anything about Hayden.
4) The game's control scheme is overloaded. There are 7 different weapon controls outside of the actual primary and secondary-fire weapons and they're poorly designed. There's a button to switch between 2 grenades instead of just two buttons to fire two grenades. There're still two buttons, but firing the second grenade requires an extra keystroke.
5) It doesn't feel like a DOOM game. The end of the game plays like Xen from Half-Life.
6) A lot of the enemies in the later half of the game have CC. There aren't any stuns, but there are several enemies (like the Whiplash) which have nothing *but* knockback. This is really frustrating, since the game requires a close-in brawling combat style.
7) The weapons aren't satisfying. There is no pistol, and the shotgun doesn't feel like it has any weight behind it. The machine gun (""Heavy Cannon"") shoots a large, slow-moving that's slower than the Plasma Gun, and I think this Plasma Gun has the lowest DPS of any Doom game.
8) The weak points on monsters are gimmicks, only a few monsters have them, and the game largely switches away from those monsters to the newly-introduced, weak-point-free damage sponges the new dev has created.
9) There is no casual fighting, i.e.: no fighting as you move from one point to another. Every fight is marked, in advance, on the map, AND only happens in obvious arenas. 
10) If this game wasn't the sequel to DOOM it would a 6/10 and a 2/5. It's coasting on the success of 2016 while rejecting all of it's design principles. 2016 had a simple, clean design, and even in the menus, Eternal is a noisy mess.",1589205673,1595463817,False,7,0,0.357274353504180908,1,True,False,False,76561197996385934,82,2,2057,0,1806,1595739038,,

Either way the game is a absolute must have for any FPS genre player who just wants to dive in and have fun. RIP AND TEAR!",1589781373,1595463176,True,0,0,0.502833187580108643,0,True,False,False,76561198028546501,250,34,3036,0,3036,1586741120,1595456176.0,"Hello,

It pulls 13% more cpu in the backend on my test system , and crashes linux systems. Again I love Doom, I love what ID has built in the last 4 years, but I feel unless there is a fix made quickly to this issue, I will unfortunately not play this game  anymore.

60,69343129,english,"UPDATE (7/22/2020: Forgot to do this when the news was originally announced, but, with update 1.1, Denuvo was removed as a requirement from the game. So, the game won't hold you at ransom (at least not with Denuvo, but still with bethesda.net) anymore. They did say that it would return one day, but in a less intrusive way, and only in multiplayer. That still sucks, but hopefully it won't be kernel level then. I can now safely recommend this game as it is still a very good game (though I do prefer Doom 4 a bit more). 

Original for historical purposes: 

Fuck Denuvo. Stop ruining games after release with shitty updates that add anti-consumer things. Didn't you guys see the shit that happened with Riot, and that shitty CS:GO + Overwatch Offspring thing that nobody asked for? When you install a fucking rootkit into the game, PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO JUST BEND OVER, AND TAKE IT! 

Do not pay for this game. What I have played of it so far is fun (single player only, haven't touched the multiplayer), but it is not worth having a shitty piece of software on my computer that adds a potential backdoor all for the sake of a multiplayer mode almost nobody knows even exists. 

On top of that, why the HELL do I not only have to have a Bethesda account, but also have to sign in to even get to the main menu? It's fucking unnecessary, especially in a single player game!

I don't fucking understand what it is with you guys, and ruining games. This game is great, but in its current state, I cannot recommend paying for it. Play it the way you should play any game that goes Epic exclusive.

it installs a sector 0 rootkit, this means that the rootkit itself (Denuvo Anticheat), can access any information on your PC, everything from unmoddable system files to the the keys you press at any time.

Paid for the deluxe edition, refunding asap.

EDIT: Apparently Denuvo was removed, but at this point I don't see a reason to even consider it, if you're going to decide, as a group of technically minded developers who all know what a rootkit is, that a SECTOR ZERO ROOTKIT is acceptable for anticheat in a DOOM game, a game in which such a low percentage of the playerbase even wants cheats that devs barely even care to make them, than I don't trust your intentions in the least.

I was really happy when DOOM 2016 was announced, i was waiting and getting money for a new PC.
I played it. I was glad that i did. I was satisfied with what i had to play. But when i wanted to replay it... It felt boring. Dunno. The game felt really boring. The repeative levels. Gritty level's. Same thing everytime.
Then comes DOOM Eternal. And oh lord, Jesus Christ, how HAPPY i was just replaying the same level over and over, hundred times, thousands, and never getting bored whatsoever, i didn't thought that i'll replay it this much honestly. And master levels on Nightmare? Just... A cherry on the cake.

Battlemode? Meh... Haven't played it. Not really interested in it honestly.

But overall, if you feel Christian enough, DOOM Eternal is for you. (DOOM 2016, is just a bottom of the cake, while current one is everything on top of it.)

The Doom universe has been expanded drastically in Doom Eternal introducing new characters, environment and answering to some of the questions that have been concerned the players throughout the franchise. It is well executed in a sense that it does not get on the way of the gameplay itself, which is the core of this game. The number of cutscenes are kept minimal and most of the story can be read from the codex. In other words, the players can dig into the story whenever they want and don't need get frustrated by cutscenes, although, the cutscenes can be skipped. The downside of the story are the plot holes.   

[b] Gameplay [/b]

Simply amazing. Controlled chaos as its best. I have beaten the game on ""Ultra-violence"" and ""Nightmare"" difficulties and have to say it is challenging. Doom Eternal is more difficult compared to Doom 2016. 
The constant movement and jumps remind a bit of arena shooters i.e. Quake or Unreal. Special thanks to dashing and all the tricks that can be done with super Shotguns meathook. 

The game gives you a lot of room for creativity on how to kill your enemies. Using only one weapon won't work and you have to think for different strategies on how to defeat the enemies in different situations, which is heavily relied on resource management.  
In addition to that, you have to constantly use your utilities and those are grenade/ice bomb and flame belch. The game is difficult in the beginning, but you'll eventually master it. 
The point is to learn and learning brings enjoyment. PS. I played Doom 2016 and it wasn't easy to go back to it after playing Doom Eternal. 

A minor downside is that there is no ammo for super weapons or the Crucible in early levels, if you want to play those levels after beating the game. It would be good for example to get energy for the Crucible by killing a certain amount of demons in the manner as regenerating the Blood punch, instead of picking ""Crucible ammo"". 

[b] Level design and platforming [/b]

The levels are much larger and have a lot to explore, which motivates even more to search for secrets most of which give you rewards for upgrades.
New places, while stunning, are a great refreshment to the UAC facilities, thanks to the great graphics and art design.  
 
Platforming for most parts felt unnecessary. For example, in levels ""Hell on Earth"", ""Super Gore Nest"" or ""ARC Complex"" it made sense since the level was destroyed urban environment, where you have to jump over or climb rubles. 
However, in others such as ""Urdak"", ""Cultis Base"", ""Doomhunter base"" or end of ""Excultia"" it felt annoying and dull. Teleportation or different kind of route would have made much more sense. Swimming was kinda weird.  

[b] Soundtrack[/b]

Mick Gordon's soundtrack fits Doom like Ennio Morricone's soundtrack to Sergio Leone's Dollar trilogy.

What I think makes this game so great is the fact that it sets you up as this unstoppable demon killer with an arsenal of amazing weapons and abilities. It then introduces you to waves upon waves of demons, with each level typically introducing multiple new types. The challenge is to balance ammo, shields, and health while flying around absolutely obliterating everything. On top of that there is some basic exploration elements and some optional challenges.

The game play is pure fun, the graphics are gorgeous, the music is heart-poundingly epic. Every second of this campaign was worth playing; not once did I feel a lull or a slowdown in terms of pacing. ID Software has mastered the art of the FPS, and this game so far is their magnum opus.

6,73121353,english,"Doom Eternal is the best game I hate. Despite the fact that this is the least fun I've had with the franchise, I can't dispute the fact that an incredible amount of attention and craftsmanship went into the game. It's just too bad that it feels more like Bop It than a classic FPS, in my opinion.

The game relies on a weakness system. Enemies have a weak point, or are susceptible to certain attacks. And it isn't a straight up buff to damage either: entire move sets can change. In theory, this is cool. In practice, the game limits your options down to one or two weapons per enemy. You simply [i]have to[/i] use the sticky grenade on the arachnotrons in the later levels. If you don't, you'll be hit scanned to death by the three that spawn, rushed down by the hellknights and plinked by the 100 imps.

The sticky grenade is a prime example of why I hate this system. The super shotgun is a straight upgrade in every way, but you have to constantly switch to the pump just so you can avoid the insanely high health pool of even a lowly cacodemon on normal. You can't just save up shotgun or plasma gun ammo and go ham -- the game knows you want to do this, and caps the ammo to a downright anemic limit. You have to have the appropriate amount of fun in the heavily regulated methods. I bet you that the higher difficulties make it virtually impossible to ignore this system.

One thing all the big demons have in common is a stupid huge health pool. Another is that they can't be chainsawed for more ammo. This means you have to constantly keep around the little dingleberry demons to restock mid-fight. Don't accidentally shoot them one extra time, or let them get stuck in the crossfire, or else it's all for nothing. It feels oddly like a survival horror system. Again: good in theory. In practice, why am I not killing all the demons in Doom?

There's a bunch of new enemies, bosses, as well as important redesigns, but most of them are just plain annoying. Most of the bosses are the kind where you have to wait until they do the one move that leaves them open and then you shoot them. Many of the new enemies are just stupidly fast like the whiplash. Some enemies are both fast and force you to wait around to hurt them like the marauders. Archviles are even worse in this game than usual: they teleport around, summoning [i]new[/i] demons, with a simply monolithic health pool. Save the BFG or crucible for them and pretend they're not in the game.

Meanwhile, the doomguy is the slowest he's ever been. Sure, he's got some dashes and a rune that makes you speed up for a bit, but it feels like anything --[i]anything[/i]-- can outrun you. Even mancubi, even [i]imps[/i]. Every arena starts the same: jog around looking for power ups, take out the weak points you can, target the high priority or rush down enemies, and then pick the little circle you're going to run laps around while you clean up the trash. You just don't move fast enough, you [i]must[/i] abuse things like monkey bars and jump pads.

There's also a puzzling focus on cinematic cut scenes and story. Remember that time in Doom 2016 where the bad guy is trying to tell you what's going on, and doomguy doesn't care so he shoves the computer out of the way? I wish [i]that[/i] doomguy was back. Prepare to be lead by the nose and talked at by VEGA, the AI from 2016 that I forgot existed, and Samuel Hayden, the AI from 2016 that is now mysteriously not an antagonist anymore despite the post credits teaser from the last game. Maybe it talks about it in the million codex entries you can read through instead of playing the fucking game. You can also find out about the Sentinels and Makyrs and all this other shit no one asked for or cared about. Wise man once said ""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" This isn't Gone Home, it's Doom for Christ's sake.

The graphics are stunning and colorful, and there's loads of set pieces chock full of collectibles. There's too many invisible walls, even for what is essentially a corridor shooter, but I can't complain about it too much. The music is less Trent Reznor circa Quake if all he had to work with was Cryptopsy samples, and more generic djent and butt metal. In a word, it's overproduced. Nothing comes close to the raw energy and experimentation of BFG Division. I'd call the tracks in the Makyr world downright bad and annoying to listen to.

But again, most of this is by design. It's done exactly what it set out to do, and done so expertly, but I disagree with all of it. It's well made by talented people. But from the start, I think the direction they were heading was the wrong one. This is most likely the beginning of the end for the new Doom. The next one will most likely tout itself as a return to classic form, while basically being a stripped down version of the Bop It Doom in this game. It was fun while it lasted, Doom.

It's far better than Doom 2016 IMO, It's bigger, faster, and much more brutal, you'll hate the previous game once you start playing this.

The levels are bigger and the missions are longer than before. The encounters are INSANE. Fast ,brutal and hugely satisfying.

Some of boss fights are really good, the timing plays an important role in most them, some of the bosses are really interesting.

The platforming is a good idea.. but it's easy a bit, there is no challenging in it! that's what makes it less interesting.. at least for me. but overall it's good.

The mobility is fu♥king fantastic! The Dash and the Meat Hook are among the best features they've added to the game! It makes the player movement smooth and fast and very useful to evade demons' attacks.

id Software managed to force you smartly to play the way that you supposed to play as Doom Slayer, no longer possible to stick with one or two weapons throughout the game as some do in the previous game, every weapon and every mod is great and functional, some of them are effective against specific types of demons but they're almost useless against the others, so you have to switch madly between weapons and mods to choose the most effective things against demons and their weak points.

The story is good and the lore is great, even If you not interested in Doom's Lore, in this game, you'll love to read some interesting paragraphs in the codex about Doomguy and Doom universe.

52,73084151,english,"I fucking adore Doom 2016. Everything in that game clicked so well for me, the combat was satisfying, the music was amazing, the world design felt tailor made for the slayer's momentum, it's so good. So, naturally, I was hyped for Doom Eternal. There's a couple things that I felt could be refined and tweaked from the original, mainly the combat could be expanded a little so it doesn't become stale, but other than that I just wanted more.

Doom Eternal is a very different game to its predecessor. It feels like a soft reboot in a lot of ways, a reboot of a reboot. A 'hell' of a lot of stuff has been changed, arguably too much. The combat has been deepened, with enemy weak points and new abilities, which is really cool, but way too much has been introduced. There's a wider array of settings, but they feel way less deliberate than the original. There's now a far more complex parkour system, which is fun and breaks up the battles, but arguably too much. There's now like 5 different skill trees. There are way more collectables. There's now a hub world for no reason whatsoever seriously why is this here. The story (which was admitedly kind of boring in Doom but at least it was something) has done a complete 180, swapping from the kinda serious, kinda sarcastic style to the most boring plot in a video game ever made. There's no drive to do anything because I don't even know what I'm doing half the time.

It's nice to see a AAA studio give the developers a lot of creative freedom with how they approach a sequel, but I think there was a missed opportunity here. Doom left so much room to expand and develop what had been created, and while this sequel does do that in some aspects, it feels like an entirely different game in others. I'm not saying it's not good, because there's a lot here that a lot of people I'm sure will love. For me though, it just doesn't work.

The soundtrack's fucking great though holy shit",1595372850,1595372850,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198255727257,272,15,417,0,417,1595371186,,

another annoying one is the random blocking of movement. enemies far to the side of your aim block you but also the spikes etc in the map that become basicly invisible when moving with the speed of this game.

AI of enemy was sometimes also strange. ranged enemy that go melee happened a lot. all just angry zombies trying to kill you head on. and why the heck do you get the precise instruction of how to kill and enemy when you see him for the first time. talk ab out holding hands.
And the marauder is just made to be... unfair. all the times i died by him was just...unfair. skill or not (i played ultra nightmare). The fact that there is basicly only ONE way to beat him is just dumb. run run run, attempt to avoid his light speed attacks and wait for the green flash. at some point i found a exploit to keep a certain distance after interrupting him and he will attack again. to 5 times in a row. he was just lame for being the answer to our guy.

It's a resource management game where if you don't have health, ammo or armor, you are f*cked and need to go after those immediately. You have all the tools to do so, at any time (chainsaw's first charge recharges after a while, zombies piñatas spawn regularly...).
[b]Diversity[/b]. More enemies and weapons means that the game is much more diverse but also more complicated, it could have been impossible to remember all those. But the game made it easy thanks to clear and logical strategies. When you see a new enemy, a tutorial pops up with its weakness. They give us a solution, but in an arena there is tons of different enemies with their own weakness, ideal weapon to kill them with. So it is in the execution of those strategies that the challenge reside. Also, with stronger weapons unlocked, you find better, quicker strategies.
[b]Hard to master[/b]. This is the one that divides players. To put it simply: it's really hard. I beat it in hard mode the first playthrough and even though I sometime struggled, I learned, got better. The maurauder is a pain, but by getting your *ss kicked you start to understand how to manage him. The same for doom hunters, archviles... The game made me really master it compared to Doom 2016, I feel like I know almost every gameplay details and techniques now.
[b]Pacing[/b]. The game is very fast paced. Still, you can slow down with plateforming, puzzles, secret hunting, lore reading. It's all there to rest a little between fights if you desire. (secrets are much more fun than in 2016, you can fast travel at the end to pick them up, it's smarter that those levers you hated).
[b]Huge campaign[/b]. 30 hours for 100% in hard. More than twice the length of the last Doom and it doesn't become boring at any point. Every environment is a new, beautiful surprise. The story never stalls, it's rich but optional. So if you don't care about the lore and all, don't worry the game doesn't force it. And if you care... there is an entire huge Bible covering each world, characters, enemies. And it's a well written sci-fi take on biblical themes with bits inspired from Berserk. They even contain some legit tension and plot twist, which is the first time a codex gave me that.

The only negative critics I have: [spoiler]That one hidden toy in the well at level 9... seriously?[/spoiler], the music's dynamic range (the original composer didn't deliver in time so the devs improvised with the unmastered bits) a shame but it's still beautiful.

64,73077735,english,"Doom eternal does a lot of things right but gets a lot of things wrong overall an enjoyable experience. What it does right is builds off the original game with new game mechanics and demons in a consistent and pleasurable manner. What does right it's easily overshadowed by the errors in game design and story. A simple example is the new ""Buff totem"" mechanic which as an objective to find a small totem in a Sea of Monsters and demons are overpowered at the moment that can be simply neutered by destroying the totem, which makes the totem the high priority and now you are on an egg hunt to find this one totem which usually results in dying, respawning looking dying again and repeat until you find the totem and then you can start the engagement with the demons. The new game mechanics like the flame breath, grenade launcher, suit upgrades, ice grenades are at first overbearing and cumbersome but as the game goes on and you adapt to the new equipment the game will become more enjoyable in spite of the additional complexity. 

I would recommend Doom eternal but the first half of the game is more of a 6 out of 10 and the following half more like an 8 out of 10.

71,73073453,english,"If you enjoyed DOOM (2016) and were hoping to see a game that would keep the same tone, or something built around that formula, this game might not be for you. If it wasn't a sequel, and was judged entirely outside of the perspective that the prior game inescapably brings into the conversation, it would be easier to justify all the questionable decisions that were made in DOOM Eternal. It would've been an okay game, maybe not the best one to represent the franchise, let alone the genre it once shaped, but it would've been somewhat appealing to a certain type of gamer, as is. That said, IT IS a sequel, and for a game, that one would think builds upon something that wasn't entirely broken, it sure tries to fix right about everything, except the things, that actually needed fixing.
DOOM Eternal doesn't really address the biggest criticisms of the previous game. It isn't any less repetitive, and, in fact, puts even more effort and production into the sequences that are focused only on delivering plot (yes, there is a story going on somewhere there, apparently). Why they couldn't have been written into the gameplay more naturally without breaking its natural flow, is beyond me.
This is not the biggest thing, that breaks the flow, however. Between constantly searching for ammo or armor, by trying to pull off one of way too many special attacks, and platforming back and forth from one hazardous area to another, only to realize you're not using the optimal weapon for a certain enemy type, there is sometimes a momentary window of good ol' monster slaying, while jumping around them oldschool style. And frankly, when there is so little flow going on, it may seem that it's the fun parts, that occasionally break the grind.
Another incredibly frustrating thing is that I always kept relying on ALL of the special weapons - and there are way too many of those - while barely using (or needing) three of the eight main weapons. Also, there are only two types of grenades in the game, and two buttons to use them - but instead of binding each button to each grenade, one is used to switch between them. This is just sheer stupidity. Your arsenal is outright unbalanced in this game, even outside of the comparison with the previous title. Certain types of particularly bullet-spongy enemies don't exactly rectify that.
Platforming on its own, as far as game mechanics go, is not half as bad as some of the hysteria on the internet would let you believe. But it is inexplicable, that the player movement was redesigned specifically for this game, and yet the levels look like they were designed for something completely different. Is there a single aspect of this game, that wasn't corrupted by its identity crisis?
Unless you're very inexperienced with the genre, I suggest to turn off the tutorials, because the number of game pausing textual hints is INFURIATING. They show up all the time, sometimes one right after another, and don't stop until the very final boss battle. Do they not know what the point or definition of a tutorial is? Multiplayer tutorials are also utterly annoying, and are on by default.
Speaking of the final boss battle, I am truly amazed that in the year 2020, in one of the biggest Bethesda titles we are still getting the most generic, dull and unoriginal, worst possible kind of a mainstream final boss in a game with ""DOOM"" in its title. And that is really the ultimate problem with this game - remove the name, swap the characters and the monsters, and you got yourself a salvable title. But this whole thing with ""DOOM"" in the name? Nope. There are just too many things you have to keep in mind in order to do well, and there are games that benefit from having somewhat convoluted mechanics, but when you're given a bunch of giant kickass weapons with a bunch of demons to kill, all you should wanna do is to have some fun killing them. Yet all these things end up getting in the way of having fun.",1595355760,1595357170,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198074763496,222,7,1901,0,1901,1594858197,,

I regret buying this and I have shitloads of games that I don't play but only DOOM Eternal I regret buying.
This isn't an FPS, its a hyperactive platformer with a DOOM skin.

Pros:
-graphics: looks great;
-performance: never crashed, no stuttering etc...;
-Dev team: cares about having updated content, patches;

Cons:
-New mechanics: new doesn't always mean better. 
In past DOOM games there was an advised way to play the game but you could do your own thing and still get through it. 
In this game you're forced to follow a certain cycle; 
""non stop double jump-chainsaw-shoot-switch weapon-double jump-flamethrower-double jump-shoot-switch weapon-grenade-double jump-chainsaw.......""
It isn't fun or exciting, it's frustrating.
When you don't know the cycle and expect a DOOM/FPS experience you're gonna have a significantly hard time.
When you get the cycle you're gonna get a terribly boring time of constantly jumping/chainsawing/switching weapons.
And I mean constantly, if you're not flying/jumping, you're dead.

Enemies/combat:
When you're getting bored with the cycle grind, they throw the marauder at you...
I fought him once, died and quit, never starting up the game again.
The marauder can only be fought with a certain cycle, stay close but not too close or he'll shotgun you... don't go too far or he'll throw his axe at you... he has a indestructible shield and blocks any attack you'll throw at him... he even is immune to all superweapons... so you can only kill him if you stay within the non instant death range and attack him within a fraction of a second when he's about to attack you and if you don't attack him on that fraction of a second, you're dead.
And the cherry on top of the cake is that he has a minion that constantly bugs you, together with the standard cannonfodder so you're constantly getting fucked by either the marauder or the cannonfodder.

Tldr:
Overrated platformer with crippled gameplay.
DOOM 2016 is the best and last FPS DOOM game, so if you're looking for a good fps, go for that or wolfenstein(NO, OB or NC).

[h1] Picked this up in the Steam Summer Sale of 2020 and was very excited to play, being a huge fan of the Doom franchise and with how DOOM (2016) turned out. It only took an hour for DOOM Eternal to rip and tear through any excitement I had and I am honestly left unsure how to feel. I don't think I have ever played a title that was so different in how it actually plays from the information given in so many reviews out there - I feel like I played a completely different DOOM Eternal from what I have read out in the wild.

Everything about it feels off from DOOM 2016; the mechanics, weapon handling, the bugs, animations, damage distribution, level design, the overall tone, the new cartoonish aesthetic....everything feels slippery and slowed down. I don't feel like I'm really in control of how I play anymore and that I'm more a slave to the mechanics than having a fun time. DOOM Eternal is wanting to be a 'pedal to the metal' FPS but keeps hitting the brakes every few seconds with its mechanics to constantly interrupt the carnage for some resource management.[/h1]

There is a lot to discuss when it comes to DOOM Eternal and I will be breaking it down into sections for easier consumption as well as making comparisons to DOOM (2016). 

[b][u]Movement and Control[/u]

In Doom Eternal a new 'dash' mechanic has been added in as your primary mode of movement. This 'dash' is on a timed charge and comes in a pack of two, with options for upgrades with Praetor Suit tokens. Combined with your ponderous walk pace this is an element in introducing a 'stop and go' effect into DOOM Eternal - movement is no longer smooth and fluid. This becomes more of a problem as movement feels slippery in general; with ledges and corners being the worst offenders, the former attempting to pull you off if you get anywhere near.

Glory / Chainsaw / Crucible kills are now wildly inconsistent in terms of locking on to a target when compared to DOOM (2016). This can be frustrating since enemies are now in higher numbers, respawn and performing these animation based kills are now tied to a new resource management mechanic the whole game is built around. 

Controls really feel like they were designed for console players - or at the very least a controller - with how weapon selection is laid out, juggling resource mechanics and the nature of how dash feels and functions.

[b][u]Weapon Handling, Enemies & Level Design [/u]

DOOM Eternal introduces new body damage to enemy models which ends up making weapon damage noticeably inconsistent - especially when combined with the new resource management mechanics. This ends up making weapon damage variable when it comes to both staggering a foe for a glory kill or simply attempting to finish off an opponent. Enemies with mechanical system placements (Arachnotron/Mancubus/Maykr Drone/Revenant/Doom Hunter) can have them sniped off with the Heavy Cannon or Ballista, forcing them into melee, to drop ammo/HP or disable that system entirely. As you might have guessed, weapon specific weaknesses have been introduced even more so into DOOM Eternal limiting your options for carnage even further. 

Something to note is the stolen designs for enemies, specifically from the Games Workshop IP 'Warhammer 40,000'. The three biggest offenders are the Khan Maykr (Eldari), Marauder (Chaos Marauder) and the Doom Hunter (Necron Destroyer Lord) - with the latter being the most direct and obvious design that was stolen of the three. How the Doom Hunter breaks apart into its second phase shows just how much they were paying attention to Warhammer 40,000 when designing these enemies - it is almost a copy with a slight aesthetic change to cover the deed.

A word of warning is that enemies are now incredibly fast compared to your much slower self and will often spawn in the same space as yourself - leading to instant death. You can also be pinned into corners much easier due to the higher number of enemies and more box'd design of the levels.

Resource management is the system to which you will now be slaved throughout your time with DOOM Eternal. Levels are no longer well designed but feel even more like boxed arenas than previously experienced in DOOM (2016). This is due to the game revolving around resource management mechanics that are requiring juggling and your constant attention in a fast-paced situation. Glory kills are still your bread and butter for health, chainsawing your opponents your source of ammo and now requiring to burn your enemies with the 'Flame Belch' for much needed armour. This gives combat a frantic 'stop and go' feeling that sacrifices the fluidity of previous Doom titles - all the while making the game feel less like it was about skill and more about random luck. 

A final note, many glory kill animations are very similar and lacking in variety, with player death animation variety being gone entirely from DOOM Eternal. 

[b][u] Bugs, Secrets and Crashes [/u]

Throughout my time with DOOM Eternal I was subjected to a number of odd experiences, crashes and bugs. 

[list]
[*] Controllers must be disabled in options or you will be trapped forever in a loading screen
[*] Crashes at cutscene loading - both to desktop and full PC reboot
[*] Crashes taking screenshots during cutscenes and gameplay
[*] Player will randomly fall through floor
[*] Enemies can become stuck under floor and in walls - still able to attack player
[*] Super shotgun has fired plasma
[*] Crashes at beginning and end of cutscenes
[*] Crashes upon Slayer Gate completion
[*] Black screen bug from Sentinel Prime onward - game must be played in admin mode from then on via .exe
[*] Combat Encounters not counting as cleared - requires complete replay of section and still may not count
[/list]

Just to name a few, with some of these requiring areas to be replayed due to crashes or bugs which is frustrating. 

Secrets are now much easier to find in comparison to previous titles, making the platforming and exploration portions of DOOM Eternal lackluster and almost unnecessary in regards to the former.

[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u]

DOOM Eternal has easily been one of my greatest gaming disappointments of 2020, possibly even my entire gaming career. I wish I had refunded it while I still had the chance and not listened to reviewers and other gamers assuring me it improved past the two hour mark, when all it does is double and then triple down on the problems present. DOOM Eternal feels like it should have been released as a $30 expansion instead of a full blown release at $79.99. 

I no longer feel like a badass Doom Slayer in DOOM Eternal - which is probably the biggest disappointment of it all.",1593696998,1595329046,False,11,3,0.554590582847595215,0,True,False,False,76561197993266228,792,84,2709,0,2709,1593691972,,

I am a Doom fan - I have liked Doom since the 90's and thought the version in 2016 (?) was nothing short of great.  However, this game just doesn't measure up to it and in my opinion, here is why:

1. Nothing new here to see.  Same everything with lack of originality.
2. Levels have annoying ""jump"" puzzles that don't really add to any type of ""story"" - jump on this wall to go to another wall and eventually punch a skull to level through.
3. Levels are the same to me.  The only reason I know I am about to finish a ""chapter"" is when there is enough baddies on the screen to indicate this isn't a normal firefight.  I slaughter them and next chapter loads.

In closing, fun game so far but I wouldn't spend more then $30 on it and don't expect anything different than a run-and-gun, monster slaughter-fest.  Not that there is anything wrong with that but there are other games out there that accomplish the same and cheaper.

66,73001636,english,"Let me be very clear, Doom Eternal in concept is a very good game. The ability of running and gunning continuously is such a good thing to have. The action is non stop and you really get sucked into it. However, there are some real flaws that prevent you from enjoying the game: 

1) Frequent Crashes - no one knows why but the latest patch seems to crash...a lot. Normally, I would just restart and go along my merry way. But if you happen to be in middle of ultra nigthmare run, you are hosed. I have seen numerous streams in which the game crashes in middle of such runs and the host has no choice but to restart. There were no crashes before the patch, so more to do with game than PC specs. 

2) Bugs - In addition to crashes, latest patch doesn't register key strokes. You could have something flashing for a glory kill and on pressing the glory kill button...nothing happens. Same thing for chain saw as well. Very frustrating when you are close to finishing something and because of these bugs, you die. 

3) Master levels - The ARC complex master level is actually good. The cultist one...not so much. The idea of ramping up difficulty is shoving tyrants in small spaces. If they were in different waves, that would be fun. Having too many demons together makes it pretty annoying and not fun. IF you know spawn locations of the demons, you will get through. Otherwise not....seems more like a ""do you know where they spawn"" rather than a test of your skill. 

4) Broken promises - this one is the most heart breaking. The devs promised plenty of master levels and other content. Yet to live up to their promise. 

I cannot recommend this game in the current state. Maybe when things improve in future, sure.

the combat itself is fine... the graphics look decent enough for this day and age and its really not too terribly hard to run on alot of different hardware. the controls are responsive and fast enough to do what you want to do.

..that being said, i have a few issues with the game itself. first off, ""pay-to-win"" in the ""multiplayer"" mode(s) is a huge deal breaker for me. i should have known better, considering its a bethesda game, but i was hoping that maybe theyd let this one slide, but of course not.... it doesnt feel like a Doom game. it just doesnt. it plays more like a shooter-platformer more than anything, with a few cutscenes in the game. that isnt what Doom is supposed to be, but whatever, times change, i guess....  the music. look, im a HUGE metalhead and i LOVE metal, but this soundtrack is trash. everyone talks about how good it is, but its just not. i had to turn the music volume all the way down because it sucks. good thing i have second monitor so i can just play my own choice in music instead. ugh. there are so many options they could have gone with that would have made it SO much better, but i guess they didnt want to pay royalties to a band that actually knows what theyre doing....

i have been playing Doom games since December 25th, 1993. this one isnt the worst in the series, as i think that one goes to Doom 3, but this one is a close second worst and as much as i want to like it, i just cant. i cannot justify giving this Doom game anything higher than 5/10 and even thats being a bit generous in my book. either way, if this game comes down to $20 or less, near the time of this review, it MIGHT be worth your while, if you like shooting-platformers, the ability to pay-to-win in the ""multiplayer"" mode(s) be able to run on not that great of a system and look decent doing it.",1586733401,1595240100,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198386253958,60,11,2247,85,365,1601936756,,

[h1]The Good[/h1]

•	Fast paced FPS combat.
•	Weapon variety including all the old Doom favourites, shotgun, super shotgun, assault rifle, chaingun, plasma rifle, rocket launcher, BFG.
•	Enemy variety including familiar foes such as imp, pinky, cacodemon, revenant, mancubus, and also several new enemy types.
•	No framerate issues or crashes.
•	Controls are fully rebindable and feel great on mouse and keyboard.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

•	Level design is the worst I’ve ever seen in a modern FPS, where the pacing and rhythm of combat is broken up several times on every level with annoying jumping puzzles. Jump, double jump, dash, double dash, and wall climb over bottomless pits and falling platforms that will cause instant death if you make a slight mistake. Jump, double jump, dash, double dash, and wall climb to find switches hidden on high ledges to open doors. These sections just don’t feel like “Doom” and sadly there are *so many* of them.
•	Sometimes if you die on the jumping puzzles you have to replay the previous combat encounter because the placement of checkpoints is dumb.
•	£50 for a 17 hour campaign (played on the third difficulty, Ultra-Violence) is overpriced.
•	If your internet connection drops for a second, the game will pause and throw up an error message, which is extremely annoying. I must have seen the below message a dozen times, usually when in the middle of combat. And yeah, okay, obviously my internet sucks. But it shouldn’t matter when I’m playing the singleplayer campaign. (Note: I disabled the option to have special demons who killed other players invading my game before I even started playing because I don’t care about that kind of thing, so that’s not an excuse for needing to be permanently online while playing singleplayer).

Multiplayer:
- I get match made with players from Canada (I live in South Africa).
- My ping is so high I keep getting shot through walls.
- There are no multiplayer servers in Africa, but hey the game is sold here in my currency and the Devs sure do like my money... being an African they just refuse to render me the same service as others.
- The net code is terrible.
- There is no anti cheat.
- Multiplayer is extremely boring, the complete opposite of the Doom (2016) multiplayer experience.
- There is only 1 multiplayer mode (slayer vs 2 demons).

Campaign:
- The campaign experience is completely unlike the Doom (2016) campaign experience: What made it fun in Doom 2016 was the fact that it was an arcade shooter with large open areas where you have the ability to maneuver your character and kill demons. In Doom Eternal however you are locked into small areas with high amounts of demon spawns (you can't go anywhere outside until the demons are cleared) and you get put into literal tunnels in some areas where you can only move forward or backwards with extremely dense demon spawns in front of you. The combat is extremely repetitive and you keep running out of ammunition, health and armour. You are forced to glory kill demons for health, chain saw them for ammo and scorch/ burn them for armour... over and over and over again.

1,72975373,english,"This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  There are numerous other reviews explaining why the singleplayer campaign is amazing, and all of them are valid.  What I want to review here is the game's unique multiplayer experience, ""Battlemode"" (or BM for short).

BM is an asymmetric 2v1 game mode that pits one player who takes on the role of the Doomslayer against two players (and their NPC minions) who take on the role of playable demon characters (as of the time of writing this, 5 demon characters were playable).  There have been many players who most likely tried this mode a few times and didn't enjoy it.  I'm not here to say anyone is wrong for having an opinion, and certainly everyone who plays this mode competitively knows that there are some problems that need to be fixed.  But I'm here to tell you that BM is absolutely amazing and is by far the most fun I've had with any multiplayer game released in the past 10 years.  

One of the core design principles that the developers used to guide their development of this game was the concept of a ""fun zone,"" which is to say that they have a vision of what ""good gameplay"" looks like, and they design the game to reward habits and behaviors in line with that vision and punish those outside of that vision.  It is my opinion that a majority of the players who view BM in an overall negative light are those who have most likely not yet experienced the ""fun zone"" of this game mode.  It needs to be stated that playing BM requires all of the singleplayer campaign skills as just a fundamental baseline - to really play successfully and against truly skilled opponents, you need to elevate your skills beyond just the level needed to play the game in singleplayer.  In fact, playing BM at a high level is the most challenging thing this game has to offer.  As such, players who want to push the limits of skill and creativity and who have a competitive mindset will naturally be able to find an extreme amount of satisfaction from playing and mastering this game mode, but ONLY if they give it enough time to realize that they need to learn more advanced skills than what works in singleplayer.  And that's only talking about playing the game as the Slayer; when you play a demon character, you have a whole new skillset to learn and master that is different from anything you've ever seen in a Doom game.

Now a word on some of the current flaws in BM.  The biggest one is lag/latency issues.  It's impossible to know how much is due to the game's netcode itself versus the natural latency that occurs based on the geographic regions of the players connecting (i.e., if you live farther away from a server, your ping is higher which means lag affects you more).  There is simply nothing that can be done to fix geographic latency and it is not the game's fault that this exists.  But due to the fact that this game allows for some very fast actions, when a player's screen doesn't accurately reflect every action, it can be frustrating.  Luckily, the developers have been quite open and engaging with the BM community and have stated that they are working to fix these issues.  We also know that they are working to add a ranked mode (presumably after the lag issues are fixed) and additional demon characters.  Given the current situation with COVID-19, I see these as positive steps and am willing to accept that implementing these things may take more time than what we impatient gamers might normally expect (or demand) from the developer who took our money and promised us greatness.  You are entitled to your own judgments about this.  There are also still some balancing issues, though the devs also release hotfixes every so often to try to address community concerns (the bigger problem is that the community in general is the same as all other gaming communities and tends to overreact to everything, but that's just gamer logic).  Overall, I am pleased with the effort the devs have shown in addressing the flaws of BM and am willing to be patient as they work to implement changes over time.

But even with the flaws considered, my experience with BM has been exceptionally fun.  I play this game almost entirely for it's multiplayer content now, as I enjoy it even more than I enjoy the singleplayer campaign (though do still replay the singleplayer, because it is indeed very awesome and well worth the price).  I encourage everyone to give BM a try with an open mind, realizing that it requires different skills than what you may have acquired from just singleplayer or from prior FPS titles.  All of the top tier BM players are very welcoming to new players and many of them stream BM content, making them good resources if you want to ask questions and get a better understanding of the ""fun zone"" of this game.  You don't have to become a godlike player to find the fun in this game's multiplayer, and once you do, you'll realize that there is nothing else like it on the market today.  In that respect, I personally am grateful that id Software made the decision to create this game mode rather than rehash the classic deathmatch that has been done over and over again over the past 30 years.  Battlemode is unique and it stands out, but because of that you will have to put in more effort to master it because not all of your prior skills will translate over to it.  To me, this is a strength and makes it worth wanting to play and master.  If you share my opinion, give it a try (especially if you have a friend to play with), and you might also come to realize just how much fun the Doom Eternal multiplayer really is.",1595203983,1595203983,True,2,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False,76561198048186338,32,1,25460,1309,18020,1602042553,,

What everyone else has said: DOOM 2016 was one of the best FPS games in years. This  is a huge step backwards.

Endless platforming and monkey bars - die more from falls because you missed swinging high enough than from enemies. 

Forced ammo scarcity to  make you use the weapons the devs want you to use on certain maps - you don't get a chance to use your full arsenal, only what they allow you to use. 

New enemy types where you have to shoot them in specific ways to do any damage.

New weapon combos, like the flamethrower, that you're forced to use, even when they don't work well.

Too many attack combos requiring too many different buttons to play smoothly with a keyboard - clearly designed only for game controllers, not mouse and keyboard players.

Tiny maps swarming with respawning enemies from every direction, so there are no tactics you can use anymore. There's no way to use terrain to your advantage because you can't stand still for a second - just jump and shoot and spin like crazy and mash every button and hope you kill them before they kill you. So, none of the differences in the maps actually matter. They look different, but every one plays the same: a tiny area that you sprint around without stopping for a split second, just mashing buttons, until the entire board is clear.

In total - more grind, less choice, less flow, less fun.  A real step backwards from Doom 2016. What a shame.

------------------------------------------------------------------
""Ammo not included"" 

Run out of ammo. Get trolled about not using the chainsaw. The chainsaw is either out of fuel, or there are not weak demons available. And speaking of fooder demons, you reach a point where they are practically being guarded by heavies, so going to them in a hurry is suicide.

This game takes all the fun out of Doom 2016 and turns it into pure frustation at points. For all the cool graphics, the godly vulkan performance, the collectibles, the ""poorly mixed soundtrack"", you are stuck with an absurd unfair difficulty at points where any  public complain will get you trolled by ""git gud"" shitbags. You git gud? The game cranks up the fudgery to the point you wish you bought this in physical to shove it up the exhaust pipe of the designers.

The jumping is ok. The marauder is ok. Or it would if it was a true one on one honor battle instead of thousands of mobs. Because by this game they don't even know how to make a boss. A different slightly bigger enemy and more mobs to generate artificial challenge and difficulty.
-----------------------------------------------------

7 hours of gameplay later...
Nothing like getting up and reading your own words 24 hours later. I really was pissed off at that point. I decided to go back to the previous levels and do the collect-a-ton. And damn, I'm actually hooked for real now. The joy of obtaining everything on each level was insane. And this time, things played a bit differently. There's something like ""git gud"" here. Las week I was complaining about it being too hard. Now I am feeling weird about not dying enough and thinking I should increase the difficulty.

You need to keep playing until certain things become second nature or an habit. Customize the keyboard bindings to have the most important wepons close to your left hand fingers (number keys are good in original Doom, but here there's no break for reaching the ones on the right side of the alphanumeric keyboard), remember to alternate the two types of grenades, set ablaze your enemies from time to time, and have a defined rotation of weapons inside your rip and tearing routine. Oh, and try every weapon mod. By the end of my second week I have been surviving slayer gates without even needing extra lives. I end dying and needing them when trying to get the challenges.

Still, even if you get good enough so that you can automate inside your head all the small tasks, there's still a chance of ending in a guaranteed failure situation. Namely, having zero amunnition, and no chainsaw ammo at all. this is the worse that can happen,  and you will running an arena like a dumbass praying it refills and you can find a fooder demon that is not next to that superheavy while low health, no armor, no ammo, no fuel. This is happening less, though. Most of the time I run in this situation is when trying to do a challenge that requires using a specific weapon, or conserving the gas.

The solution would be some decent melee. For so much doomslayer god of men, his melee is more like cuddling demons if they are not staller. For Richard Stallman sake's, you have two fists. You should be able to pummel an enemy , or kick their demonic ball sack. What, that's what Dork Nokem would do? bleh.

Anyways, the game has a lot of great stuff, and also bad stuff, but less. It's missing balance. I don't need cheat codes, lowering the difficulty or the sentinel armor. I just want an opportunity to come back, instead of being stuck like in a Sierra adventure game.

Oh, you cant run through levels, you gotta use dash, and monkey bars, and time your jumps perfectly. Is this unreal tournament? Oh, you gotta jump on the floaty things, and they will fall after few seconds. Plain dumb, like they just ran out of ideas and used the brainstorm vomit to add MORE - disregard to quality.

Storyline: I tried. But I couldnt help but give myself a facepalm to the back of my scull. WHY would you add so much detail to the lore, thus taking away from the mystery? Flying fortress as a base of operations, made of stone? Teleport? Im speechless.

game play is super engaging, awesome graphics, story is far better than I expected, soundtrack is epic,  decent replay-ability due hidden areas, and upping the difficulty settings allows you to keep it challenging.

43,72956543,english,"Notes: No comment on Battlemode will be made because I have not played it. All of my comments will be based solely on the single-player on Nightmare difficulty, since it is the main difficulty I have played.

What I like: 
1. The gameplay. Fast-paced and hectic, forces you to think on your feet. Limited ammo forces you to be a better player. Contrary to popular belief among the loudest detractors of this game, this game is actually not particularly limiting on playstyle, certainly not more than 2016.
2. Weapons are well-balanced, I managed to find legitimate uses for most of the weapons and their mods.
3. Suit upgrades also allow for more flexibility compared to Doom 2016.
4. Roster of enemies has been expanded and they have more ways of hindering you besides just shooting fireballs at you. I especially love the Marauder because the Marauder forces you to rely on your competence regarding game fundamentals rather than using cheese strats.
5. The goddamn Slayer Gates!
6. The game runs pretty decently even on my GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU.
7. The master levels!

What I don't like so much:
1. I can honestly do with less narration, Dr Hayden really could shut up at times. In terms of narration, 2016 is better in this regard, it is less in the way.
2. Sentinel Battery insertion cutscenes can't be skipped. Just why? It gets grating having to see the same animation over and over again with no option to skip it.
3. Crashes and bugs happen at a noticeably higher rate compared to 2016. Also there are more weird invisible barriers that I can do without. Doesn't really take away from the experience very much though.
4. The purple goo needs to die in a fire with the heat of a thousand suns. Thankfully purple goo is not a common sight.
5. We could do with more master levels, although I understand id Software is planning to release more along the way.
6. Writing is honestly nothing to write home about.

Things I'm ambivalent towards:
1. The flashier UI and overall more ""video game"" feel. I understand why id Software made the changes they did. I wouldn't say I like it so much that its basically the best thing in the world for me, but I will say its something I don't really mind.
2. For the most part I didn't feel anything much about the platforming, I don't think its the absolute best thing in the world, however I'm also perplexed by some of the complaints regarding the platforming. It's honestly not that hard and frustrating and the game doesn't even kill you if you screw up the platforming sections. Have the people who claimed the platforming is hard played the advanced test chambers in Portal 1? That shit can have you tearing out your hair in frustration at times.

Overall, the negatives should be noted, but not enough for me to outweigh the positives. For that, I give the game 9/10, I would highly recommend that people buy this game, especially people who like more gameplay-driven games. However, if you're looking for a more immersive game, more relaxing game and more story driven game... you may want to look somewhere else.",1595174795,1595175496,True,2,0,0.523562073707580566,0,True,False,False,76561198111312647,37,8,26563,27,8574,1601021877,,

Visceral combat. 
Great soundtrack.

But If I was to nit-pick (and I always do) I think the previous game's campaign level design was better.  

Nitpicking follows:

In DOOM (2016), There were subtle choices to most open areas, allowing you to approach a fight from different angles from the outset. There were also scattered enemies between each set piece. 

In Doom Eternal, your path doesn't branch as much.  It loops and crosses over itself, but there's actually less choice; you're herded into a ambush zone, you fight, then you navigate a jump puzzle (or a series of them) before you reach the next fight. Enemies are scarce between these encounters. 

The scenery is visually much more impressive this time around, but there's more platforming in the main campaign path than the previous DOOM.  

People who love platformers will cheer for that, but I find jump puzzles annoying when they're this frequent, challenging and so visibly contrived; for example I felt that the spinning fire chains (in the early hell level) were not particularly organic in the scene, they looked comical.   

Having said that, there is a more irreverent tone in this latest installment; crushing zombie heads down into their torsos, the cork-pop sound effect when you score a headshot, and the cheesy audio broadcasts from Earth.  It's taking itself a little less seriously these days.

I'm enjoying the playthrough so far.  Savouring it.  I'm just hoping that level exploration opens up in the midgame.",1595128268,1595158972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197973296192,595,163,383,0,215,1596283509,,

music: amazing the mix of dubstep and heavy metal is just WOW

enemies: a few piss me off but fun as HELL to kill them with a glory kill

story: similar to doom II but bethesda thickened the plot for more gameplay which i like so story wise very good great representation of doom II (which is basically what it is),its very good but just confusing that daisy is still alive and the doom (2016) is alot more different than doom I but still great lore for the game

weapons: first one super shotgun 

the super shotgun was very fun to use but was alittle slower than the combat shotgun, the meathooker was very fun to use as well like REALLY REALLY fun to use, combat shotgun.

the combat shotgun was the first gun you get in the game and is basically what it is a shotgun but can turn itself into an assault rifle and a sticky bomb shooter really the most gun i use amazing in killing but damage is so and so not like the bfg 9000 which is a godly gun just normal doom weapon.

bfg 9000,perfect just perfect the sheer damage when you shoot just one enemy and then a whole group of enemies in one shot is satisfying its just amazing bethesda made it correctly as it should so 10/10 weapon ,the rest are really fun but i think you should play the game to experience it for yourself.

96,72918872,english,"DOOM Eternal improves upon the DOOM (2016) in almost every way. The combat is even more kinetic due to environmental additions such as swing bars, powers that makes  you fast right after a glory kill and a grappling hook. There are new weapons and mods which complement the combat really well. The game is noticeably harder than the previous entry. One key change they did was to make ammo much more lower than before. The idea is so people don't stick to one gun all the time and instead switch up. This might make some people to get adjust to it, but personally I loved this change as I always switched guns constantly until the fight is over. The addition of grenades and fire adds even more tactical depth to the player's consideration as damaging or killing enemies on fire yields armor. When you combine everything, it blends perfectly with the combat style setup by DOOM - 2016 and improves upon it.

The game environments are bigger and more complex than ever before. You will be travelling across  different worlds this time and every world has a very unique aesthetic when compared to Mars and Hell from the first game. You even have a hub world from where the DOOM Slayer can launch missions from, I love hub worlds and this is implemented wonderfully in the game. The game looks even more gorgeous yet it runs just as fast. Their id tech engine is amazing.

Mick Gordan's amazing music is back and is better than ever before and when combined with the gun sounds and screaming of demons, it almost feels like a badass metal concert, like it should. Terrific audio design.

The only issue I had was the game's platforming sections. Most of them were fine, however, some of them were annoying as you really couldn't see where to go until it was too late. Luckily it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

The game is an asymmetrical mp mode got battlemode which I haven't tried yet to give any opinion of. But I am really glad it is a unique mode instead of a standard death match from the past game.

First, the combat - while some may enjoy the new pace of combat, I think the need to constantly micro manage your ammo breaks the immersion of just being a badass demon killer. The weapons are obviously cool, but at times using them feels too much like rock-paper-scissors. ""Oh, there's a Cacodemon, better take out my shotgun with explosive charges for the 1000th time"". And don't get me started about the Marauder. Second, the platforming. Doom is not a platforming game, why add out of place platforming sections that border on either trivial or frustrating? They feel tacked on. Third, the atmosphere/story - Doom Eternal sprinkles attempts at world-building and story-telling throughout the missions, but just like the platforming they feel like an afterthought. Of course you don't expect a strong story from a Doom game - that's not what it's about.

11,72914962,english,"The only problem with doom eternal is that story and atmosphere wise, it's less consistent and more poorly written than 2016.

Gameplay wise it cranks itself to 11 and demands mastery from the player so they can climb a perfectly angled difficulty curve, which is not so steep as to be domineering, but not so flat that it's boring to climb. Doom 2016 makes you feel like a badass, Doom Eternal forces you to be one. It truly is built for nightmare difficulty, so if you're decent at shooters, start from there.

The parkour/platforming (which everyone seems to think is a massive deal for doom for some reasson) is easy as hell. The puzzles are incredibly simple, and honestly quite difficult to fail. I only started to have a little trouble with them towards very late-game.

Overall the improvements in gameplay are so significant that in my opinon they crush the downside of a poorly written story with bad continuity to the last game. I mean how often is it that a sequel improves gameplay so much that you feel like it's impressive antecedent just won't cut it anymore? 

There is one more downside though. Bethesda.net integration is more cancerous than helpful, and sometimes messes with your saves/ has online issues. One of my saves even got deleted at some point, but luckily it was one of my abandoned half-finished playthroughs. 

Side note: I doubt you're buying this game for the multiplayer battle mode, but if you are, some advice: Don't. It's really not that great a gamemode, and feels slow and lethargic (terrible for a doom title).

27,72906212,english,"I am finding it hard to recommend this game. I've been playing for about half a dozen hours now, and up until very recently the game kept introducing new concepts and techniques to me as if I was still playing the tutorial. 

Bethesda, why? Why did you ruin a perfectly good game? Doom 2016 was perfect: it was tight, it was fast, it had an amazing sound-track, and honestly if you'd given me the exact same game but with a different story I would have loved it. Instead you gave us this bloated mess. More is not always better. In this case, it is so, so much worse.

Let's start with the abilities: at any given moment in the fight you have approximately 6 different cool-downs to worry about: there's your flame belch, grenade, chainsaw, weapon-mod, blood fist and dash, good luck keeping track of them all in the middle of a hectic fight. Then you need to keep an eye on your health, your ammo and armor, all of which you must constantly replenish throughout the fight through one of the aforementioned cool-downs. Then you need to remember what equipment works against what enemy: does your chainsaw work on any enemy? Like hell it does! But if you run out of ammo and there are no small fry to kill, well, you done buggered up son, go straight to hell and you do not collect your mini-figurines. 

Take even just the chainsaw: it used to be a get-out-of-jail free card, to be used sparingly. It worked, it was good, and it made sense that you needed more fuel for bigger enemies. Now it's essentially a ""can-only-kill-imps"" weapon, which you MUST use all the time to keep your ammo up, and the NEW get-out-of-jail-free card is the blood punch. Except the only way to know whether blood punch is available is through a tiny little icon next to six other tiny little icons. And it's the same button as your glory-kill button, so if you accidentally mis-targeted a demon for a glory kill, well, there goes your blood-punch. 

It's a mess. No, Bethesda, this does not give us more ""options"". It rigidly locks us into a single play-style because there is only one possible way to play now. And it's just.. not fun? 

Frankly, you've ruined it for me. I consider Doom 2016 one of, if not the best games of the past decade. It's right up there with the original Half Life for me. But Doom Eternal just plays like a crappy shooter that tries to make everything way more complex, shoe-horning in stuff just to bloat itself. Take the wall-jumping: we had perfectly good platforming in Doom 2016 without it. It does not make combat faster, it does not make the platforming more challenging. It serves no purpose. Blood punch? Again, no purpose. 

And don't even get me started on the gazillion ways of upgrading weapons, the suit, the ship, the weapon mods, all with practically no purpose other than to make it more RPG-like. Yes, Doom 2016 had this to some extent, and it was mostly pointless there too. 

I almost could not stop playing Doom 2016. It was just so much fun! Every time I hit a new arena, I said to myself: ""heck yeah let's go!"". With this bore? I'm dreading every encounter, barely a few hours in and they already feel like pre-ordained boring grindfests. 

Literally the only thing that Doom Eternal does better are the environments. I am seeing some of the most amazing landscapes and diverse arenas ever, they are absolutely stunning.

The campaign is awesome, with unique level design and great challenges to overcome. I loved how the guys at id wanted to frustrate you as long as they had something to teach you, like how Hugo Martin (the creative director for the game) has said. In the beginning, you will have problems with some of the heavy enemy types, and towards the end of the campaign, you will be ripping and tearing through them without breaking a sweat. The campaign is around 20 hours, but there is still so much more to do, with the existence of the Fortress of Doom as a hub filled with easter eggs. There are collectibles to find and secrets to uncover (which are actually quite worth finding and enjoyable unlike other games where they are throwaway quests essentially). 

There is also the multiplayer experience, where currently the only mode is Battlemode (Invasion has not come out as of this review). I will be honest, I have yet to play more of it but it is really enjoyable so far. It is quite unique mode with 2 demons vs one Slayer, and strategy versus skill really matters. If the demons do not plan out their acts, the Slayer will easily kill you and win. Meanwhile, the reward system from multiplayer is through a Battle Pass kind of system, but as far as I am aware there are minimum or no micro-transitions. Yes, people have complained of the absence of traditional multiplayer modes like Team Deathmatch, but I am okay with id's decision to try new things instead of the same old regular multiplayer that every other game has.

47,72887290,english,"Doom Eternal takes what Doom (2016) did, and makes it so much better (even though I loved 2016 already). The mobility this game adds with the dashes, monkey bars, the meathook and double jump from the start really gives you a whole other feel when running around the encounters, ripping and tearing everything in your path.

The game makes a point showing how much the player is respected, feared and worshipped. That's you. You, on your own, are so much of a threat to all hell, that humanity looks to you as if you were a god, and the demons are warned of your presence when you enter a new area. Id Software really creates that feel you look for in a Doom game, that YOU are the most powerful being in the universe. 

And of course, it's all accompanied by Mick Gordons incredible soundtrack. There were people who complained about the metal in Doom (2016)? Well, Id Software basically told those people to go fuck themselves, and shoves even more down your throat. It's absolutely fucking amazing. Now, to be fair, I preferred the soundtrack in 2016. It matched the flow and progession of the game better. That's not to say the music is bad in Eternal, it definetly slaps just as hard, if not harder, it's just doesn't match the game quite as well as 2016 did.

Now let's get to the lore. While Doom (2016) was more or less testing the waters with their new(-ish) concept for a modern Doom, and focused a lot less on story than on the gameplay, Doom Eternal has a solid story which is easy to follow, and if you're actually interested in the lore, there's a lot to read in the game. This is done perfectly in my opinion. Doom was never created to be a story-driven game. The focus was always on the gameplay. It was all about running around at high speeds, slaughtering demons. For the people that only want that, it's relatively easy to gloss over any story elements, as you aren't really forced to learn that much about it throughout the game. Most of it is written on pages you pick up during the game, allowing the people who are interested to read, and those who don't give a fuck to not give a fuck.

I personally enjoy learning about the lore, especially in this case. Without spoiling anything, Id Software managed to connect the old Doom games to the new ones in a very interesting way. It actively makes me want to know more about the lore, which isn't something I ever thought I would say about a Doom game.

All in all, Doom Eternal is fucking incredible. From a gameplay perspective it's probably one of my favorite games of all time.

53,71592857,english,"This game is pure, unadulterated and raw fun. The levels are longer and packed with more collectibles of more types, yet the game somehow only takes up about half the disk space of DOOM 2016. The inclusion of an arena mode in the game's hub room (called the prison) is a very welcome addition for when you just want to experience the detailed, gruesome combat without worrying about other surrounding aspects. The soundtrack certainly delivers in this game, even allowing you to pick up some music from other id software games as collectibles.

You no longer die when you fall off a level, but instead respawn at a nearby location approximately where you fell. The movement is also greatly expanded and improved, allowing you to swim, climb walls, dash (upgrade this quickly), fling off of monkey bars and break certain cracked walls.

The chainsaw plays a much larger role in DOOM Eternal compared to it's predecessor, acting as a way to quickly gather the in this game much scarcer ammo from lower tier enemies, rather than quickly eliminating the tougher guys (which you rarely have fuel for). For this purpose, one bip of fuel recharges quickly over time, and the game features a plethora of ways of executing the bigger demons in your way. Take for example the BFG or it's rapid fire counterpart which you can unlock, or an immensly powerful sword for one hit KO:s on basically any enemy.  

DOOM Eternal is much harder than DOOM 2016, and will feature encounters where you almost laugh at how ridiculously many enemies the game throws at you. However, on normal difficulty I had no problems getting through it without getting frustrated, especially because this game gives you multiple lives and only resets you to a checkpoint when they run out (which never happened for me) as well as multiple ways of regenerating ammo, health and armor.

Some levels have cheat codes as collectibles, which can be activated when replaying any level. The ability to progress, collect items and such still function mostly as it would during a normal playthrough, allowing you to master a level while having infinite ammo, all runes, infinite beserker mode and much, much more.

It's a bullet hell knockoff where the designers thought spamming damage sponge enemies that take 25 bazooka rounds to the face to kill (I'm not even joking) was a good idea. Game play basically consists of areas of Super Mario platforming (which gets old after the second stage) followed by a giant fight where you will essentially run in circles over and over. The mobs spam heat seeking projectiles at such a high rate you can barely tell what's going on. 

Doom Eternal is hard, very hard. So hard the Devs really really want this to be some FPS Dark Souls or something. You will die, not because of clever and challenging game design but because you'll get stuck on one of the many walls placed by someone that apparently went to the Salvidor Dali school of architecture.  Standing in one place for more than a second is is a death sentence due to the constant cheese spamming of literally every mob in the game. Apparently, the designers think that running in a circle for an hour makes compelling game play. Their foil for this profoundly innovative combat design is to have Prowler mobs that can teleport clear across a map at will right behind you so you get blocked for that split second needed for the 293284023802384023840923890 perfectly aimed projectiles the other mobs are throwing at you to hit you for a zillion damage.

67,72878209,english,"TL;DR: If you like lots of platforming between each fight and constant ammo mgt, this game is for you.  As for me, I'll replay Doom 2016,

Where Doom 2016 was a FPS that had occasional jumping puzzles, Doom Eternal is a platformer with occasional combat.  The jumps usually require 2 jumps, 2 dashes, a few yellow poles you have to hit during these jumps, and then wall climbing and each level is full of them.  Sometimes, to mix it up, the platforms or walls disappear a few seconds after you land on them or there are targets you have to shoot while jumping.  There's probably 10 minutes of trying to figure out where to jump and then doing it for each 2 minutes of combat.  Even when your fingers start becoming trained to do this and it becomes easier, even fluid, it breaks up the flow of the game; you feel more like Super Mario with a shotgun than a rough tough demon slayer.  And unlike Doom 2016, you can't just turn off your brain, pick up a shotgun, and kill some demons.  This game requires thinking.. where to jump, how to jump to the next area, etc.  There are a lot of other design choices that I dislike immensely (low ammo count so you basically have to use the chainsaw every minute and can't save it for bosses, and you still have to change weapons constantly, for instance),

To be fair, there is a way to change the difficulty, but it doesn't actually change the required jumping so it doesn't actually make a big difference.  Enemies die faster, and the ratio of platforming to combat just gets worse because of it while it doesn't actually help with any of the jump puzzles or double jumps.",1595050955,1595050955,False,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198014805168,244,3,690,0,603,1595153609,,

74,72873869,english,"To an extent Doom 2016 was an arena shooter where you are forced into small areas to fight and can't backtrack or retreat. Doom Eternal turns this up to 11. The fights still lock you in so you can't backtrack. But now you get so many resources from glory kills/chainsaw that nothing has consequence. 

The original Doom was tense because even if you cleared a room you might have used up so much ammo and health that you were screwed. The new one might as well not have levels, if you beat a fight you can just chainsaw and glory kill to be at full health/ammo. Each fight is disconnected. 

It would still be a good but not great game even with that. But because the devs decided you need to rely on fodder to keep your health and ammo up all of the bosses and hard fights are infested with infinitely respawning trash mobs. You don't get to decide to clear trash first or focus the boss like in the original series. You're constantly shot in the side by imps that have to be there because without them you wouldn't have enough ammo or health.

The original games were amazing, there was a tight limit on health and ammo per level and it was up to you to overcome. Yes that meant backtracking to pick up health or ammo, but thats okay it added to the feel of the level being a real place. Doom Eternal has a very modern hyper polished feel. The devs wanted to remove backtracking. They wanted to make sure you couldn't screw a level up by getting to the last fight without enough resources to finish. 

The design choices to create that polished modern feel have made the game fun in each micro segment and vastly worse overall. It has chopped the game into lots of little disconnected pieces that added together is less than the sum of its parts.

Then Doom Eternal came along and made Doom16 look like babby's first schuter.

Everything about Doom Eternal is a step up from its predecessor. It isn't content to let you stand back and kill every enemy with your favorite weapon, as it challenges you to come up with weapon and item combinations to kill faster and harder with the least damage taken. I played through the game on HMP for my first go and even then i found the game to be decently challenging. Going from that to Ultra-Violence feels like removing the training wheels, as the game is more content to punish you for small mistakes.

Don't get the wrong idea, the game isn't unfair. It's not punishing you for the sake of it. It's not trial & error. It respects the player and expects the same in return. If you go into every encounter relying entirely on your SSG, you're going to die. If you rely on one weapon you will die.

1,72825805,english,"This is DOOM 2016, but more. More demon types, more patterns to learn, more things to keep track of in a fight, etc... Ammunition can feel scarce, but despite what some players believe, this is less to make you to use your chainsaw, and more to force you to rapidly swap between weapons with different ammo types to get through a fight. Combat centers around rapid movement, combining jumps, bar swings, mid air dashes, and grapples to enemies. Whereas you can mostly dodge everything coming at you in 2016, here, the volume of incoming attacks almost forces you to take hits. This leads into the game play loop of constantly topping off armor, health, and ammo with fire kills, glory kills, and chainsaw kills.  You are required to learn how to use all your gear, mobility, and weapons in a way you don't have to in 2016, which I think is the source of many players' frustrations. Additionally the mobility centered puzzle elements and arena additions (bars, jump pads) bother some people, but they're hardly out of place for an arena shooter by ID. Its like complaining about no waist-high-walls to take cover behind in a Quake game.  I notice that people's complaints about the game fall into these categories:

The fighting is too difficult / too much of it
The platforming and exploration sections are too difficult
Their is too much lore compared to 2016
Their is too little lore compared to 2016

8/10 in my book as it was exciting playing at first but then the momentum doesn't keep up as you progress through the game, especially with some extremely hard fights that will see you die a lot and get frustrated as it can be nearly impossible unless you play slow, kill enemies one by one, and fly all over the place to avoid dying.

System level anti-cheat in a game nobody bought for the multiplayer? Bethesda, son, you done messed up.

The core game is incredible, by the way. The combat's even better than Doom 2016's. However, nobody in their right mind should accept anti-cheat systems with system level privileges being slipped into their game months after launch. Fortunately, I bought it on a recent sale and was able to refund. 

I'll buy it again - on sale - if and when they remove this atrocious addition. Never accept this kind of shady practice, or they'll pull it on you every chance they get going forward.

63,72809784,english,"Doom 2016 was a fantastic experience that felt great to play, and gave you the tools to achieve your maximum potential. The difficulty felt appropriate for each level and the campaign was a lot of fun. And then there was Doom Eternal. Holy shit, what an upgrade. If you played Doom 2016, I feel like you'd be hard-pressed to dislike this addition into the franchise. The mechanics are pretty different in this game, but I feel like all the changes were to its benefit. To be perfectly honest, I never really bothered with the chainsaw in Doom 2016, but in Doom Eternal, the limited ammo capacity requires that you use it throughout, and it's more forgiving when it comes to fuel as a result. Weak points on demons makes you really plan out your attack, and it means that almost every weapon will serve a purpose. In Doom 2016, once you got the super shotgun, there was very little need to use anything else, unless you ran out of ammo. The story in this game definitely got turned up to 11 and feels more narrative, whereas the story in Doom 2016 was rather lacking. There's much more dialogue, lore, and cutscenes in this entry in the series. Also, if you thought Doom 2016 was difficult, this game makes it look like a joke. Nightmare on Doom Eternal is infinitely more difficult than Nightmare on Doom 2016. If you're a fan of Doom, I think you'd be insane not to pick this one up. It's made even better by the fact that it goes for as low as $29.99 on sale.

It can be fun and really feel like an improved Doom experience, but the game tends to quickly take away the fun by drowning the player in tutorials and new mechanics all the way until the end of the game. It can be frustrating at times because I've always seen Doom to be a simple fps. 

I know it sounds like a broken record, but the marauder really sucks. Like he reallllly sucks to fight. I was always curing under my breath every time he would show up and it totally took the wind out of my sails. Eventually you get used to fighting him and it becomes easier, but with how may new demons we have in this new game, on top of all the new mechanics, it feels like the game is too much over time. 

But on the positive side, I would still recommend this game to anyone who has been a fan of the series. The fact that they are able to pack so many demons into the arenas feels so chaotic and I've never been happier to see all chaos on my screen. I also love that they tried to give more lore to the universe and I also love the detailed environments we traverse. The series has come a long way and it's really amazing to see how much has changed over the years.

Daym good game

So here's a summary of my review

Spoilers aplenty

Story beginning/premise
The game skips 8 months between the stories of 16' and Eternal. ||Sam got split down the middle whilst fighting the demons on earth after warping you to parts still unknown and got stuffed on life support back in his ARC resistance HQ (probably in Los Angeles or Austin Texas)|| You start in the fortress of DOOM, Slayer's/player's hub area, get a request for help on the radio from civilians calling for any aid. Slayer cocks his shotgun then drops right into the hell barge with ||One of the three priests leading the demonic invasion|| and from there is roughly 15-20 hours of mayhem.

Gameplay basics: The demons have been balanced on a tightrope of three factors
Size, Damage output, and numbers. Everyone comes back for more when you first meet them. You have fodder such as imps, zombies, and soldiers. They do enough damage to be a constant threat but exist to be farmed for resources (the chainsaw regenerates one pip of fuel so chop em like beef on a grill) You have the heavies like DOOT, Mancubus, Pain elementals, whiplash and cacos. There be four super heavies that'll drive you to blood lust, as the devs intended (Archviles, the Marauder, the DOOM Hunters, and our old pal the Tyrant. Be sure to humiliate him by not using the BFG or ||Unmakyr|| when you do.

Chainsaw for ammo, glory kill for HP, and Flame Belch + attacking burning enemy = armor. Runes make a return, but there's no Rich get Richer rune. They made that one into a cheat you can find.

To upgrade guns you have to complete combat encounters, secret encounters (timed combat skirmishes) and the Slayer Gates. 1 point per encounter and secret encounter, and three for a Slayer Gate (you can't access the Gates when using cheats tho) up to 10 points per mission max. Also bosses give various amounts, but i'll leave those out completely... also ||GIANT SWORD||

Every not-key-8 weapon has an alt fire mode and upgrades for them. Take full advantage of the arsenal, because they all have good uses (except for maybe the Microwave beam for me personally). You collect praetor tokens to upgrade your suit, and Sentinel batteries to access useful stuff at HQ, and some cool skins. Lastly there are crystals that upgrade health/armor/ammo stats. Fill in a dual set of upgrades for a perk like Loot Magnet. Max those out and become a death god.

As you progress you'll eventually unlock skins for Doomguy, battlemode demons and your guns (Yes, even the BFG-9K).

The cutscenes are relatively short and all skippable. They are simultaneously 5/10 and an 8/10 for me. Whilst they do pad out the game a bit (and are easily ignored) you still get great animations and stellar character development for our boy. They fit well and don't interrupt the flow of the game, because they all lead to you slaying the armies of darkness.

You can collect cheats, album covers, toy figures, have a display for weapons, go to the ripatorium for some casual BFG Division slaying. There is plenty of things to do while you DOOM. They even added a new multiplayer mode I've yet to try for myself.

In short, DOOM Eternal is a genuine labor of love from the folks at iD. Worth my $60. 9/10 GOTY 2020",1584836252,1594872503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198351214658,121,43,4353,0,1379,1595560247,,

31,72758611,english,"Combat is visceral, engaging, and rewarding. Enemies approach from all directions. Broadly speaking, they come in 3 priority tiers, but across 2 of those tiers you'll still have to weigh your options depending on available ammo, positioning, and heat zones in the combat arena. All the while, you have to keep yourself moving. Standing still is like backing yourself into a corner -- you will die. Fast.

You're left so overwhelmed with the barrage of stimuli that you'll even welcome the brief story cutscenes. You probably won't care about what's happening, but that 20 - 30 second reprieve clears the fog of your bloodlust. Over time, the cutscenes become longer, though (thankfully) less frequent. I wish they'd stuck with this ""take a breather"" format, though...

Every 4 - 5 missions, gameplay design takes a back seat and you're left with long stretches of exploration between combat encounters. While this may be reminiscent of missions in the original Doom games, it doesn't mean it's fun. The illusion of 3D geometry was still a novelty in 1992, and players were happy to bask in the atmosphere while jamming to MIDI guitar riffs.

Eternal's designers seem to know that simply moving around won't cut it any longer, so they try to break it up with alternate traversal mechanics, such as dashing, double-jumping, air-dashing, and vaulting onto nearby ledges. These mechanics do keep things fresh for a while (especially during combat), but they're extremely forgiving -- to the point of presenting no challenge in puzzle sections. The designers didn't take the player's learning curve into account, so traversal became boring again.

I'd be willing to forgive the complaints above, but the worst part is the introduction of the Marauder enemy. He's such a threat that he immediately takes highest priority, but he also has such a demanding combat loop that you really need to wipe out the other high-priority targets to prevent yourself from dying because some demon sucker-punched you. After you manage to whittle down the playing field, you're left with a tedious fight.

The Marauder deals high damage if you're too close. He also deals high damage if you're too far. You have to stay in his Goldilocks zone, but he can dash and quickly closes the gap. He has a shield that deflects all damage, and he only lowers it long enough to dash in for the kill. You're left dashing away on the defensive and it's disorienting. You'll probably miss with the right weapon. Hold the wrong weapon and it may have too much spin-up time to even land a shot before his shield is back up -- or worse, damage yourself with splash damage. Try to use a super weapon and you've just wasted your ammo. Oh, did I mention he has a flame elemental guard dog that will attack you if you move too far away? Since it's incorporeal, you can't chainsaw it for ammo, which is inevitably the reason you moved too far away from him in the first place. If you need more ammo, you're going to trade health for it.

The Marauder has appeared 3 times in the game. I'm about 2/3 of the way through. Maybe I'll revisit Eternal some day, but I think I'm just done for now. If you're looking for 10 - 15 hours of solid gameplay, I'd recommend Doom Eternal.

39,72757034,english,"First off, I want to say that this game is an absolute masterpiece and is definitely on the list of best games of all time.

That said, there are a few things I want to nitpick:

1. The upgrade system in general is not as great as it was in Doom 2016. The whole thing with the sentinel crystals was kind of lame and a lot of the upgrades seemed to go toward systems I never actually used. I didn't use the grenade launcher once through my entire playthrough. Additionally, there were extra suit upgrade tokens and sentinel batteries that I didn't know what to do with at the end of the game.

2. This game is also quite lore heavy and delves more into the world of Doom that has been in construction since Doom 2016. I did enjoy learning about the lore itself--I know there are those that have their own reservations about it, but I really liked the lore in the game. My problem with it is that I wasn't able to actually read the codex entries until finishing up the game. I couldn't read them as I picked them up in the game just because it was hard to transition from battle to reading. It's a small nitpick, but something I felt others should be aware of.

3. I also felt that the developers went a little overboard trying to amp up the graphics in this one. You really can't get much better than Doom 2016, but in trying to I feel like they tried a little too hard and ended up making it just a bit too colorful. It's not bad by any means, just not as good as its predecessor. Doesn't distract too much from gameplay.

I will also say that the game itself is definitely harder than Doom 2016 was, to the point that I had to set it to the lowest difficulty level to actually have fun--however, I should also note that I'm not a big first-person shooter player in general (I'm just not very good at them) and I only just got into the Doom series. If you need to play on the lowest difficulty setting, don't be afraid to. Not every game is Dark Souls and you should be able to play however you want without judgement from others. Games are meant to be fun, and goddamn this one was fantastic.

65,72515729,english,"So ive been excited to make a review for this game. Since I played Doom 2016 last year, ive been really excited to play Doom Eternal. After reading some of the reviews, I wasn’t so sure how the game was actually going to be. I, along with a majority of others, were comparing it to its predecessor, Doom 2016, which had many accolades and was highly praised. This one had a lot to live up to, and in my eyes, it did a pretty good job. Im going to go through and review certain aspects of the game and address some of the other points I saw in other reviews. For the sake of myself and time, imma just refer to Doom 2016 as Doom. 

[h1] To begin with, lets discuss the basic gameplay. [/h1]
      Its very similiar to Doom 2016. The maps are very linear, you go from point A to point B, stopping every now and then with a demonic encounter, and you clear the room, and move on. Simple and straight to the point. Nothing too bad or complicated here. The minimap is so much easier to read and be able to make out locations than it was in Doom. This game falls short in the same way as Doom did. Well, it only falls short based on your playstyle in this regard. The collectibles. There are so many dam collectibles. That’s not a bad thing, but if you were like me and wanted to find them all in one playthrough, you would spend 80% of a level just looking around at the minimap trying to find how to get it. As mentioned earlier, the collectibles are much easier to find, most of the hidden ones are hidden by a giant breakable crack that’s easy to spot. In Doom, a lot of the hidden ones were hidden by a lever that blended in like it was Susan Storm from Fantastic 4. But honestly, the collectibles are found throughout Doom Guys lair, Fortress of Doom, so that’s a pretty cool little difference. Doom Guys “Rec room” consists of many Easter eggs and collectibles that act as a gateway for character models like in Doom, but instead in a room that you can admire them in. But getting back on topic, looking back, Doom eternal added a nice little feature where you can fast travel to certain points on the map after you complete, but NOT EXIT OUT of, the level. Meaning, you can actually go through the entire level without stopping the combat to hunt for items, and then go back after killing all of the hell spawn to look for items. I didn’t do that and ending up having many slow times in the game, where I was just looking for collectibles. And there are about 10- 15 items per map.  So kudos to them for improving that. 

[h2] Lets move on to basic Gameplay mechanics. [/h2]
 Most of the weapons are similar, nothing new. Don’t fix what aint broke. The Ballista and Gatling gun got a few new upgrades, but that’s about it. One new thing that’s introduced near the end of the game are a few weapon token used to bypass the mastery. In my opinion, that kinda defeats the entire purpose of mastering the weapons by yourself. But you don’t have to use them, so its up to you. If you like grinding, you still can, and if you don’t, you don’t have to. Theres about 7 or so I think, idk. By the time they were introduced, I already had a couple of the guns I liked mastered. Oh, and the super shotgun is amazing. The little hook that comes out of it is amazing and later becomes essential for armor and just for looking and feeling like a badass. The biggest game play mechanic that I saw in the comments but wasn’t sure what it was was the “Parkour” element to the game. Basically monkey bars and climbable walls. At first it seems kinda cool, then it just feels like they are in there just to prolong the game and just to have them in. Its Doom Guy, killer of demons and gods, yet he cant bust down a wooden door to get to Point B, and instead has to swing from conveniently placed monkey bars, sometimes spread apart so far that you have to time the jumps just right or else its game over for poor Doom Guy. This isn’t a huge problem, it just kinds becomes pointless after having swung from a few hundred bars already. Wall climbing seems like a more appropriate choice. This game also has a lot more “Puzzles” in it, meaning you have to hit buttons and levers in the correct order, not hard btw, its just a couple. These just seem kinda pointless, as why the hell would these demons build their fortress, decked out with traps and gates and such, just to have a button that can be shot to unlock a door that will let Doom Guy just waltz on in and kill them. Seems kinda like the Deathstar, but you know, whatever, story line. 
Another issue that players had was how the ammo looked, that it looked too colorful and cartoony. The UI in the game is great, and totally customizable. You can change the brightness of the drops, and even change the color of the UI, which is neat. There are more options, I just didn’t mess with them. So yeah, if you don’t like how the drops look, you can change them.
 
[h3] Then there's the ammo problem. [/h3]
 After a while, ammo isn’t as bad when its fully upgraded, but you still need to use the chainsaw. The other reviews made it seem kinda difficult, but its not. There are literally a class of demons called Fodder. Your chainsaw always refuels one fuel, making those fodder demons your main source of ammo. Kinda annoying, but its manageable. So in my opinion, not that big of an issue. 
Now, the game feels a lot harder than Doom. Which is a good thing, as Doom began to feel a little too easy near the end of the game. In this game, you die a lot more often. They do have extra lives scattered throughout the level, but its useless. They saved my ass maybe a total of 4 times, the rest of the time id die to an imp or something, wasting my life. You cant just restart a checkpoint to get that life back, those lives are gone for good. The extra life rune is more important than any of those anyway, imo. So they are good and all, but honestly, except for the Extra life mode, a perma death mode, where you have to rack up those extra lives, its useless. You can survive almost any encounter by yourself after a few attempts. 

Im not one that’s big for story line, but this one was good I guess. I really forget whats happening after I spend almost an hour on a level hunting for little toys and other hidden items, but you get the gist. Demons bad, Doom guy good. You get a little backstory of Doom Guy and his race, which is cool. (Hopefully the DLCs will expand on some things) 

[h4] Multiplayer. [/h4]
So I wanted to 100% this game, but that’s really hard due to one thing. The multiplayer. And most of the reviews are pretty accurate when they say its dead. It’s a cool concept, Doom Guy vs 2 demons, but holy hell is it dead. It takes maybe a minute or so to find a match, another half minute to get ready, and depending on the enemy, may be over in 2o seconds. The first match I played, I hadn’t quiet finished the game and was like a lv 12 or so, I got matched with a both opponents at lv 150+. Next match was a dude 200+. But the point is, rarely will you find a match with people your skill level. Its sad that an achievement, play 25 battlemode matches is such a rare achievement. I mean only 2.6 % of people on steam have played 25 matches?? Unlike in Doom 2016, it had sooooo many customization options, and as this one does have some, it so much different than Doom. Its fun seeing your character in the campaign though. 

Overall, really fun game. Demons are harder, cooler looking, and that Super shotgun is looking sexier than ever with its ability. Worth the money. Its just a shame that a cool concept like battlemode was executed so poorly. The devs tried, but it just doesn’t work out in its current state. Theres a lot of fun to be had in the campaign though. I was also hoping for a little somthin somthin for players that sat through the entire credits, and it did not disappoint. Its pure perfection. 
So overall, 9/10.

This is one of the few, and I mean FEW single-player shooters I have played that has such a great re-playability factor.

 I am currently on my second playthrough, this time on a harder difficulty, and I can say I am nowhere NEAR done with DOOM Eternal. There is a high skill ceiling, and in order to complete the game on the harder modes, you MUST master the movement and weapons. It's a tough game. Especially compared to 2016's DOOM, but unlike 2016, the utilization of all your equipment and weapons is vital to success in Eternal. This means that the gameplay is incredibly rewarding, and that ""cheesing"" your way through the game is a less viable option.

75,72734862,english,"It was not a bad game but I would not recommend it at full price, or perhaps even 50% off.

Unlike many other negative reviews I didn't struggle with ammo or the gameplay. I played it on Ultra Violence (second hardest) and finished the game with ~23 extra lives left and 100% collectibles. So the problem was not that I struggled, the problem was that I didn't have that fun playing it. This is mainly because how the game was designed to be played:

CONS:
The levels, while visually nice, are far too linear for my taste. In very crude terms it basically boils down to corridors that lead to big arenas where you fight a lot of demons that spawn in. The arenas definitely feels like shooter arenas with jump-pads e.t.c. all over the place. Personally not a fan of singleplayer arena-styled shooters.

Exploration is mostly looking at the map instead of actually exploring the environment.

Fighting demons feels more Unreal Tournament as opposed to Doom. Lot of double jumping, jump-pads and dashing around while constantly switching weapons.

The levels are disjointed to each other. Where am I now? Mars? Earth? Hell? Somewhere else? It feels random.

Timed challenges sucks. You can find them on levels and after activating them you have to beat X amount of demons in Y amount of time. If you fail you can retry but your lives, health and ammo is NOT replenished. Not fun at all.

Press 'C' to ammo. Also known as the quick-key for the chainsaw which replenishes almost all your ammo. While it works, it makes it completely pointless to manage and search for ammo between demon waves. For example, you don't need to search for secrets and store up a supply of rockets which you can use on a hard level like in the old Doom. All you need to do is press 'C'. The only exception is the BFG which the Chainsaw does not replenish.

The multiplayer sucks. It's only 2vs1 and expect to only be matched with players with 100+ levels. Levels don't make you stronger but it does mean you have played the game a LOT. No deathmatch or team deathmatch.

PROS:
I liked the platforming.

Anyways, I hesitantly picked up the Doom series starting with the 2016 Doom. I can be really squeemish and sensitive about gore and violence, it's just not my cup of tea. Fortunately, one thing I can appreciate about Doom is they avoid violence towards humans or a certain party, and focus on destroying demons, and they're easily evil and demonic enough to be distinguished from humans, so it was good. 

The graphics are done well enough that it holds a comical and creative design to it, while giving it realism and artistic values. The Graphics are great, and the game runs really dang well at 90+FPS, the gameplay and movement flows much better than the previous game, and I enjoyed playing through it. The story wasn't a huge aspect of it, but the game itself was enjoyable and I enjoyed unlocking new weapons and using new tools to rip and tear until it's done.

89,72719269,english,"I loved Doom 2016 and got Doom Eternal hoping for more of the same.  In some ways Doom Eternal delivered, but in others it fell short.

The levels in Doom Eternal look every bit as pretty as those in Doom 2016, but they are not as well designed mechanically.  Even in just the first few levels there have been multiple occasions where I have been standing there thinking 'where do I go now?'  Puzzling out how to get to a secret is fine, but if it is completely unclear where I am supposed to go to progress the main game that is just bad level design.

Doom 2016 had a mechanic that if you used the chainsaw on a daemon it would spit out a bunch of ammunition, which was a neat little extra.  Doom Eternal has changed that to a core mechanic as ammunition is much more scarce, and not only that but the chainsaw attack doesn't seems to produce as much ammunition.  Combined with glory kills to replenish health and the flamer to replenish armour this gives you three different things to juggle, forcing you into using specific attacks and making what was a neat little extra into a chore, and I at least find that I keep running out of ammunition.  In addition, whereas in Doom 2016 all of the ammunition icons produced by the chainsaw attack were a fairly dull orange, now they are fluorescent green, purple, red.  In the words of the Girlfriend Reviews youtube channel, 'diarrhea christmas lights'.  It just looks obnoxious and distracting.

The final thing that is a negative for me, but might be more of a positive thing for some people, is that there is a lot more platforming than in Doom 2016.  I really dislike platforming.  If you are also a person who dislikes platforming and found the minor platforming sections in Doom 2016 a chore rather than enjoyable then this is also likely to be a negative for you.",1594799580,1594799580,False,1,0,0.441585183143615723,0,True,False,False,76561198007432245,358,4,217,0,217,1594794448,,

70,72676974,english,"It's ironic that this one is called Doom Eternal, because its design decisions make it look like its heading to Final Doom territory. People like to bitch about Doom 3, because it was memorably different, but forget how forgettably shit Final Doom was. 

This game has been horribly, and unnecessarily overcomplicated for such a throwback shooter. There are so many systems in the game, its near impossible to pick up a play session after a week or two of playing other games. I had my controller break, and switched to keyboard and mouse, which wasn't a problem for me in 2016 Doom, but this one was just too many control combinations, and since non of them are standard shooter fare, muscle memory couldn't guide me through new controls, I had to just stop playing until a new controller could be bought. This is the first shooter I COULDN'T play with a keyboard and mouse. 

The game is so complicated, it feels the need to stop the game with a popup box every time a new enemy appears to explain why just shooting it... in... a... shooter... doesn't kill it. That's a design decision that raises a red flag. 

The most worrying aspect of this game, though is the Maurader. For a game this large and complicated, dozens of design meetings are required. The Maurader made it through all of them without anyone saying, ""Maybe this is shit and shouldn't go in the game, maybe."" Instead they said things like ""Let's make you fight it at an arbitrarily defined 'Medium' range"", and ""Lets give him that 'everything proof shield' that every kid you hated in school had. Lets make it immune to the BFG too, because this is apparently a Doom game, lol"". This is a massive second red flag. This enemy is entirely antithetical to literally every other enemy in the game. If it was simply on boss fight it wouldn't be a problem. But their lead designer, Kaitlyn Bennett (or I assume because of their affinity of shitting themselves) decided to put at least one in every conflict for the last HALF of the game. They recognized Denuvo was a bad idea and patched that out, but somehow the least Doom idea every put in a Doom game stays in. 

The third red flag was the handling of the soundtrack, suffice it to say that Mick Gordon did pull a fireable offense, but Id and Bethesda should probably mop the floor where they were standing, because they totally shit themselves in that debacle, no one came out well. Third red flag. 

This game has more red flags than a flag pole at Beijing Olympics. In the end I would recommend this game, but this could very well be the last good, but not great, Doom game. I don't see enough involvement in design decisions from anyone who made 2016 Doom fun. This one seems focused on design decisions executives want, like Always Online functionalities and season pass sales. *Bethesda executives looking at next Doom 3* They were sloppy, but you, you will be worse.

If you want a Doom sequel, where, as that guy from the old ID documentary said (something to the effect of) being a guy taking on the forces of hell, look elsewhere... 

If you want an introduction to the world of Warhammer 40k then this is the best thing ever!!! It has it all!!! All us can rejoice we finally got a sequel, in the form of a prequel, to Spacemarine 40k. Here you can play as a Neophyte (Spacemarine candidate) as he takes on the Chaos forces in the hopes you impress some primarch or the other and get the all mighty gene-seed (called all cheats in game).  

Do you want:
Heretics..............................................check
The corrupted force of Chaos.....check
Space marines / Space wolves....check
Battle Titans......................................check
And...
Dead Royal Guy on a throne.......check

Sure, its easy to point out the similarities, but that is very problem. Doom never needed to be fleshed out story-wise. At it's heart was the story of a lone HUMAN survivor who decided to take on the forces of hell, that's it. It was relatable, to a small degree, who hasn't wanted to fight evil with such abandoned... but this doom guy is now a member in some cosmic brotherhood of space knights, blah blah blah... leaving you with this feeling of watching a dull rehashed space opera. I haven't once so far said that's interesting, rather it has me thinking back to Call of Duty where I can at least get behind the men and women of the story. 

If you want to know about the game play, it's okay. You get into fighting the hordes only to have it end seconds after... It blows its load (of bullets) and then rolls over leaving you dissatisfied and wandering around looking for secrets.... but at least it's fun to look at. 

Bottom line, Bethesda has made their money... my review is beyond late...but at least I didn't pay full price.

14,65391601,english,"EDIT: After adding back Denuvo, they backtracked on it incredibly fast. Can't understand why they did that in the first place, but at least they listened to the community. 

Imagine everything you loved about Doom (2016), and then brace yourself for something better. Something more engaging. Something [i]new.[/i] This game embraces wholeheartedly the incredibly fast paced shooter that it is, but also the fun loving spirit that most gamers have in droves. The combat has been revamped to force you to think on your feet, use your entire arsenal, and rip and tear like never before. In Doom (2016), you could get away with using only two weapons, That was fun enough, but the devs really worked to make sure you don't do that this time around. They've made enemies more aggressive and strategic while also lowering your available ammo per weapon. To counter this though, and make sure you're more engaged than ever, you've been given far, FAR more tools to use. You can now dash, have a flamethrower that drops shields when you burn enemies, have a freezing grenade, and your chainsaw regens to make sure you can always get more ammo if you play your hand right! I was a little unsure when I heard about these changes from the devs, but after playing, I'm absolutely astounded. 

Doom Eternal feels like the type of game that just isn't real. It feels like it shouldn't and can't exist. It juggles intense combat with a fun sense of love and care through both the quality of the game itself, and the fun easter eggs you can find in droves. I feel as though, when I wake, this incredible experience will have just been a dream. I can barely fathom the idea of owning something so deeply fun. 

Now, all this praise being said, it's currently a bit buggy. I'm very pleased that they pushed back the date, because it seems to have really needed it. Currently, you'll find yourself getting stuck on a lot of the objects around the map, sometimes you'll be stuck on an enemy (Not grappled, just stuck), and sometimes the Monkey Bar grab is...iffy. All in all though, these are so negligible with just how fantastic this game is. There hasn't been a single moment in my first 5 hours of playing where I thought to myself ""This part sucks."" Not once has that thought crossed my mind. 

The location of secrets seems far, far smarter this time around too. In the first game, one gripe I had was how frequently out of the way they would tend to be. My first time playing, I didn't mind too much, but with the nature of the game, I really didn't like having to stay out of combat for so long with how fun it was. This time around, however, most of the secrets are streamlined into the routes you'll be taking anyways, so if you keep an eye out, you'll find 'most' of them. Some are pretty sneaky though, which isn't a complaint. The locations for them just feel better this time around! 

I'm yearning to play more of this game right now, but I also don't want to finish it all right away because of just how grand of an experience it is. All in all, I highly recommend this game, and also recommend supporting the developers.

I'll caveat at first that this game is not flawless technically, it looks great, but there is a not insignificant amount of bugs. It's not something that majorly disrupted my experience, but there are a number of bugs that range from mildly amusing to requiring a reboot of the game (rebooted or crashed about~5 times in 150+ hours of play time). Like I said though, relatively small issues. 

Despite these issues, almost everything is improved on from Doom 2016 in terms of pacing and options the player has. Most importantly for a game about being a one man army, you feel powerful, like ""I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me"" levels of powerful. It's not just that feeling of power either, Eternal walks a thin line of you being a godlike killer of demons while the demons themselves are a horde ready to wash over you. The game constantly introduces new enemies, weapons, mods, and abilities to keep you and your enemies interesting. The weapons feel impactful, unique, and useful, and those weapons fit perfectly with the enemies. The demons are fast, brutal, and numerous, each fight is a constantly shifting balance of weighing the combat options available with the enemies presented to you. The game shines in huge, hectic arena fights where you can force the battle to be on your terms, but is a bit less entertaining during boss fights. There are 4 real ""boss battles"" in the campaign, and while decently entertaining on the first playthrough, after completing the campaign once or twice they can be more like a chore in between you and the next arena. The soundtrack is still great of course, it speaks for itself. 

The only thing that was not better than Doom 2016 in my opinion was the story, which is to say, there's a story in this one. I get what Id was trying to do to set up more games after this one, and I didn't hate it like some people do, but a lot of the overall self aware tone is gone from this game. You still find bits of funny voice lines or codex entries poking fun at the game itself, but the overall story is more serious, it wasn't too bad, it just felt a bit odd after Doom 2016's complete lack of regard for any narrative resembling more than a 6 year old's crayon drawing.

36,66460642,english,"With it's visual spectacle, visceral soundtrack, a wide-variety of over 25 demons, and an explosively adrenaline pumping gameplay experience DOOM Eternal can impress even the most avid game enthusiasts.  DOOM Eternal takes the existing groundwork of DOOM (2016) and offers a multitude of additions that improves the formula and stays true to the focus of constant action/violence and fast movement that calls back to but stays unique from the original 1990s games.  For brevity's sake I'll refer to DOOM (2016) as '2016 and DOOM Eternal as Eternal, please refer to the invader zim DOOM song if you feel any DOOM withdrawal.

I played the campaign on Ultra-violence difficulty and found that it required my complete concentration on each enemy and my resources while staying balanced throughout the experience.  During each fight (save for the ""parry"" demons) there is little to no downtime as you swap between ammo / weapon types to take out each demon.  While you're well-equipped to handle another demon infestation with dashing and many weapons to deal massive damage, enemies are much faster and heavier demons are tankier.  Like in '2016, there's great fun in swapping weapons quickly with the numerical keys where each one applies to each demon type.  You also have two swappable modifications to each weapon (excluding the super shotgun) to fit your playstyle, in my experience I only swapped in the beginning where you lack weapons.  Performance, controls, and pacing all worked flawlessly and I hadn't noticed any areas of dropped framerate / inputs, or too few encounters / too many encounters. 

Ammo is more scarce and limited unlike in '2016 where you have a chance to gain ammo on kills.  I noticed in my playthrough that I burnt through and ran out of ammo several times on each level which heavily incentivizes the use of the chainsaw. In the previous game where I'd use the chainsaw to both clear heavy demons and get ammo back only once, rarely twice each fight I'd use the chainsaw more often in Eternal and only on smaller demons for the ammo.  You can hold a max of 6 fuel pips in '2016, in Eternal you can only hold a max of 3 but can slowly recover a single fuel pip automatically if you have none.  It's up to your discretion on which game did it better but in my opinion I preferred how '2016 incentivized you to use it both for the ammo and cleaving through large demons whereas Eternal punishes you for using it.  If used against a large demon the player is obligated to wait until they get their free fuel pip before picking up any other fuel canisters, in this regard you lose a significant amount of potential ammo to only kill a single enemy and it oftentimes takes you a significant amount of time before you find another canister as there are far fewer fuel/ammo pickups in Eternal (I spent most of my time on one fuel pip).  In addition Eternal lacks the dramatic death animations from '2016, I'd speculate this was removed in order to retain the focus on the power of the DOOM slayer and constant flow of gameplay provided by the extra lives pickups.  

As-of launch the game's multiplayer ""Battlemode"" feels lacking in both balance and gameplay depth.  It's a 1v2 with a slayer versus two player-controlled demons with 5 to choose from.  I quickly learned that using lock-on burst in conjunction with the super shotgun quickly kills demons with little to no counterplay on the receiving end. I hope to see better balance of the rocket launcher in the game's future.  With the current lack of gamemodes '2016s base multiplayer experience was much more appealing and balanced in my opinion.

[b]5/27/2020 EDIT:[/b]  ID software has done a good job with some of the recent patches which nerfs the slayers effectiveness but still retains a balance for both sides.  However there are several fundamental strategies that the slayer can use with no counterplay options from the demons. 

Slayers can spend most of the match in the air with jump pads that have no cooldown and offer no counterplay.  The majority of demons are at a disadvantage when a slayer uses a jump pad as the slayer is too high to receive damage from most high-damaging attacks which can be abused indefinitely since jump-pads do not de-activate.  (some maps have jump pads that lead directly onto another jump pad) 

The Chaingun shield can solo a mancubus at point blank range and the only counter is using hazard zone whose cooldown is far greater than the shield (7/13/2020 EDIT: The chaingun shield now properly doesn't shield the player from behind in battlemode and while it no longer de-activates the shield when the slayer is in a hazard zone it still deals damage as it did before leaving some room for counter-play)

The speed of quick-swapping weapons could use some tweaking, slayers can kill player-controlled demons in only 5 seconds.

Overall, the fun I had GREATLY outweighed some of the missteps in this incredible game, can't wait to see what new content ID software has in-mind for the game.  RIP AND TEAR!",1585872353,1594677844,True,2,0,0.525047183036804199,0,True,False,False,76561198120331550,94,68,13973,0,1887,1599337299,,

Doom 2016 is an amazing game, i've completed it 3 and a half times, which is amazing for me because I very rarely play games more than once.

WHAT I LIKED

The levels look beautiful.
The chain hook on the super shotgun is amazing.
Having a dash makes so much sense.
The freeze grenade is super useful in most combat encounters.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE

The levels are boring. Seriously they look amazing but all you do is go from battle arena to battle arena. Remember Doom 2016 when you had mini encounters in the lava factory level, or being on top of that massive crane, jumping and shooting imps, moments like that are gone. You go into a battle arena, fight, go to next battle arena, fight, rinse repeat. It's so uninspired.

Why are weapon, keys, health, armour etc so cartoony? I get they were going for a retro feel, but it just doesn't mesh with the level design being semi-realistic. In Doom 2016 it was so exciting physically picking up the weapons and keys you get.

The combat system. On paper a chess battle sounds good but in practice its so boring. Oh look, the floaty eye monster, swap to shotgun, fire grenade in mouth, execute. Oh look, spider enemy, snipe turret off, freeze, mini gun, execute. Why have they strong armed people to play this way? It's like they're bothered that people like to use a certain amount of weapons that they like.

Going on from the last point, the ammo system is terrible. Every gun has so little ammo you spend 90% of the game looking for squishy enemies to chainsaw, otherwise the combat becomes almost impossible. 

The mini bosses, they fucking suck. The doom slayer, you stand there with a super shotgun, wait for him to flash green, shoot, run out of ammo, search for spawned squishy enemy, chainsaw, rinse repeat. Doom robot thingy, shoot with plasma rifle until shield goes down, then shoot with everything else until you run out of ammo and have to search for squishy enemy to chainsaw.

Why when a game is about constantly moving did they introduce a purple slime that slows you down and makes you unable to jump. It doesn't add anything to the gameplay, it just makes it frustrating.

Why is there a battlepass? It's a game that the majority of people are coming for the single player, it seems like such a bizzare addition. Why do I want a custom skin when the game is played in first person?

LAST THOUGHTS

The game feels like what happened with Shadow Warrior to Shadow Warrior 2, or Wolfenstein The New Order to Wolfenstein The New Colossus. It's like the devs don't realise what made the first games loved.

If you want a game that Doom Eternal should have been like look at Ultrakill demo on steam. It's everything this piece of shit should have been.

I don't normally do reviews like this, but it's such a let down I had to let people know, don't waste your money.

Doom Eternal is amazing, graphically and gameplay-wise. Glad they bumped up the AI, they actually pose a threat now, not just target practice, even the fodder if they managed to gang up on you (freaking totems xD). 

The only thing that disappoints me is that you don't really have much to do after you finish the story, found all the secrets and collectibles (and if you're like me, you probably did all of this by the time you finished the game); besides waiting for the expansions. Sure you can try higher difficulties if you're a masochist, that's fun too.

Sadly they took out what was fun in the multiplayer, like the different modes you could play, now there's just 1 v 2 mode, 1 Slayer vs 2 Demons, which is.. meh, not that I managed to get in a lobby, for me at least, it was empty, barely managed to find one guy who was like 100 levels over me (don't know if levels count in multiplayer - besides what cosmetics you unlocked). They tried doing something different, but don't think they succeeded in pulling people in. At least it's not a battle royal mode.

I was really skeptical of Doom Eternal when it first came out, especially as I watched Byte, the world record holder of Doom 2016 100% speedrun spending hours struggling to adjust to Eternal's new combat system. At that time, it seemed to me that this game overwhelms players with mechanics: dash, flame belch, bloodpunch, two kinds of grenades, and crucible. Players not only have to keep track of these cooldowns and resources, but also manage demon weakpoints at the same time. On top of the seemingly over-complicated combat system, Eternal's cartoonish color, UI design, bugs (such as swimming in air, weird Marauder behavior and BFG crash), retcons, and cutscenes tailored for weak systems make me dislike the game more and more. Before buying and playing the game, I thought Eternal is simply made up of unnecessary additions that force a playstyle upon players and take the depth, freedom and creativity of its 2016 predecessor away.

I couldn't be more wrong.

A few hours in after purchase, I was thoroughly hooked and invested in this sequel. While some of the criticisms above do hold up, and it is kind of a shame that you cannot beat the game in your own way(for example, with only super shotgun), the incredible experience Eternal creates outweighs the downsides by a mile. First, the graphics and animations are fantastic. Demons are extremely lively and expressive, not to mention their decaying flesh as you pump damage into them. Weapon mods are also very well balanced; they all have their distinctive purposes that serve different situations. And just like 2016, the little details and secrets really show the effort, passion and care the devs put into their work. Lastly, it turns out that the new combat system isn't all that overwhelming. Once you get the hang of the timing and usage, everything starts to fall into place, like a perfect, metallic symphony of chaos, rage, and blood. Doom 2016 might be a more polished and contained experience, but Doom Eternal is in no doubt a cathartic mayhem that challenges you to embody the Slayer.

99,67322717,english,"DOOM Eternal is a very difficult game to review. First and foremost I want to say that it is worth your money, no doubt about that. I sincerely recommend the game to anyone who likes fast pace action and never-ending sheer brutality (against demons that is :] ). The game takes the concept of weapon modifications from DOOM 2016 and expands it to a point where you can build intricate combos to desimate enemies quickly and effectively. The game also gives you the same opportunities to upgrade health, armour, and ammo. I will talk about ammo later...
The level designs I think is where the game excels. Many players critisized Eternal for having too much platforming, when I see this as a way to show the amazingly designed atmospheric levels. As an artist, every moment in eternal is like a hyper-realistic painting. The art direction and 3D modeling team has my eternal respect for achieving this monumental task. (pun intended >:] ). This being said, I have to mention mobility. The games controls are fantastic for combat... and that's it. Platforming does have an element of rage to it in the later stages in the game where I wasted many minutes trying to nail a few jumps, totally breaking the constant adrenaline the game has you on during fights. This extra difficulty is due to the fact that the controls work poorly outside of combat scenarios. This being said, the fights are very well structured, with enemies appearing in waves from easiest to hardest, and sometimes a mixture of both which results in the danger on the demons being similar to that of an opponent in chess. You can't just prioritze the big strong demons over all the lesser ones because those will slowly chip away at your health. This is a virtue rather than a curse because it keeps combat engaging throughout the whole game. This being said, it is time to discuss the games biggest flaw... the Marauder. I hate the marauder, I also love it. To elaborate; the marauder is the best mini-boss enemy in the whole doom saga, but it is the worst enemy in Eternal. He gets introduced to you in a magnificent 1v1 duel at the midpoint of the game, and in a few small encounters afterwards. BUT... then he gets thrown into big fights. This is awful. The marauder is an enemy that spins the DOOM concept on its head, having you actually care for timing your shots and keep a strategic distance from him at all times. You can NOT use your trump cards like the BFG or the Crucible, you are forced to fight him properly and if you do not wait for him to lower his guard it is impossible to make ANY damage at all. Like I said, this works well on individual encounters, but as you can imagine works absolutely horribly in big fights. You have to wilfully shift your focus on him and try your best to ignore all the other enemies at the same time. It totally breaks the DOOM ""dance"" as some call it, and makes fights tediously challenging rather than entretainingly challenging. I think the lategame would be a million times better if they removed the marauder from big fights completely. This problem also combines with the games second biggest flaw: ammo scarcity. Now I know that the game has less ammo to force you to use the chainsaw in the way that it is intended, but they went so overkill with this concept that you eventually run out of fuel too. You can imagine how bad it is to fight the marauder with almost no ammo. You either land every shot perfectly, or you die again. Then you will spawn a few moments earlier with the same amount of ammo as last time and the cycle repeats until you manage to beat him under these poor conditions. This happened to me multiple times during my playthroughs and it was enfuriating. Of course, you could just say ""you are bad at the game"", and if it were a fair fight i'd agree. But this scenario make fights significantly skewed against the player.
Now that I've gotten the problems out of the way, i'd like to end this review by stating that DOOM eternal is nothing short of a masterpiece of modern shooters. The combat design and freedom given to the player is unmatched by any other game I've ever played. Despite its numerous flaws, I know that nothing in this world is perfect... and thus I still urge you to try Eternal out.

DOOM Eternal gets a 9/10 from me.

TL:DR - Not as fun a game anymore, a lot of annoyances and downgrades from Doom 2016. Only buy at -50% off or more.

- Glory kills are terrible and so much worse than 2016
- Ammo is shared between some guns and is sparse
- Enemies can CC and stunlock you
- Game is harder than it needs to be on the earlier levels
- So. much. parkour. It doesn't belong here and is just an annoyance
- Too many upgrade currencies and menus get overwhelming
- Bad UI makes knowing when things are off cooldown harder than it needs to be
- Forced to use weapons you don't want to on a lot of enemies, like a rock paper scissors
- No more normal multiplayer or snapmap from 2016, replaced by a mediocre battlemode
- Has a battlepass system

Although I do have a lot of complaints for the game, I do enjoy parts of it and they got some things right:

- Good soundtrack as always
- Really well optimised, can run on almost ultra at 144 fps which a lot of games can't really do. No fps stutters or crashes
- Graphics look pretty good
- They added a more prevalent story into this one, although no one plays this for the story
- When in combat and I actually have ammo, it's really fun most of the time
- The game has some customization with skins and such, if you are into that (although they're not serious at all)",1594632817,1594633230,False,12,4,0.540290534496307373,0,True,False,False,76561198109175044,1128,66,303,0,259,1595859138,,

Pros:
Perfected game play loop
New mechanics are fun and challenging
Level design is cool for the most part
nice mix of old and new doom 
chunks of demons flying in the air
MUSIC IS STILL SICK (not as good as Doom 2016 imo but still good) 
Lots of customization for enemies, weapons, and doomguy

Cons:
Boss fights are not fun
Corny cut scenes and lore.
DOOMGUY TALKS IN A CUT SCENE (completely unwarranted awful execution)
Platforming isn't as bad as people say but it's tedious and unnecessary at parts
Stupid sound effects with certain weapons and glory kills. Gets old fast
MARAUDERS
Menu music sucks
Game is buggy at parts (textures not loading)

18,72565577,english,"Doom Eternal makes Doom 2016 look like a student project.  Everything is far more polished - controls are tighter, soundtrack is surprisingly good, graphics and environments are breathtaking, and the story is nicely fleshed out.  You will die a lot.  Keep slaying - with 60% strategy and 40% luck you'll make it.

Ammo and other resources are far less plentiful than the previous game, requiring a dependency on the chainsaw and the new flamethrower in order to survive.  You ditched your infinite ammo pistol too, for some unknown reason (seriously, if something had infinite ammo, why wouldn't you keep it?).

One mind-blowing aspect of this game is: you can destroy some furniture just by touching it, but you can't break any glass with the exception of one glass door.  That's right, the Doom Slayer can punch through a wall but can't break glass. (MEME time?)  I would have thought, with Red Faction setting the bar for destructible environments, that other games would have gotten the hint - especially games like this where it would make complete sense. Sadly that just isn't the case.  Seriously if the demons had walled themselves up in a glass fortress, there wouldn't even be a game - the slayer would never be able to get in.

Imps.  Get used to clearing out a room and concentrating on anything (or the last remaining demon) and having an imp attacking from behind.  They seemingly just pop right behind you just to irritate you.

The game is also a bit more hokey than Doom 2016.  Adding 1-Ups and a comically animated wall climbing mechanism that makes you feel like the devs played a lot of Darksiders when they were creating this.  Some of this stuff sadly takes away from the immersion aspect of things.

There are also some balancing issues, namely with the Marauder.  This demon is final-boss-of-any-video-game-ever level.  Pure god-tier.  It's never alone, it constantly spawns these golden wolf-dog spirit things that munch on you, and it blocks everything that you do.  There's a little video showing you how to take it out - problem is that the marauder never moves slow enough for that video to mean anything at all.  Oh, and it's resistant to things like the BFG.  The only chance that you have to kill it is to throw everything explosive that you have at it repeatedly and hope the splash-damage ends up killing it.  Strategy simply does not work, speed simply does not work, skill simply does not work.

Minus these shortcomings - this is an amazing game and one that you absolutely need to play if you're a fan of the run-and-gun genre.

26,72596714,english,"Doom: Eternal is an improvement over it's already solid, predecessor, in every way. Even though Doom (2016) had some of the best gunplay of any FPS game, my biggest critique of the game was its bland level design. Doom: Eternal took this issue, and created something amazing. The level designs in Doom: Eternal are a breath of fresh air. No longer are you confined to the generic space stations of Mars, or the two-tone colored hell levels. Doom: Eternal brings you to colorful locations of a hell-raised earth, Gothic castles, arctic fortresses, and the list goes on. 

Along with some incredible new locations you'll get to visit, the gunplay in this game has improved upon the already perfect gunplay from Doom (2016). You have more weapons and abilities at your disposal, your chainsaw has a refresh rate, so you'll always have the opportunity to rush in and rip some enemies apart for ammo when you find yourself running short, and the combat feels more fluid than ever.

The final cherry on top is the lore you'll find in this game if you take the time to read all the data logs. There's some very interesting story and details that you won't want to miss out on if you care about the story of Doom: Eternal. The developers have put a lot of heart into creating this game into a living, breathing world. A world that you, as the Doom Slayer, will liberate from this damned hell invasion. 

Doom: Eternal is one of the best FPS games I've ever played, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-tier shooter with unique locations, an interesting story, and solid gunplay.

I just can't get enough of this game, I'm literally out here replaying missions just so I can find all the secrets and easter eggs that I missed, and that says a lot because ive always been the kind of guy that never understood the point of going out of your way just to find collectibles.
I'm not gonna explain everything that I love about this game, because there are tons of reviews that thoroughly cover all that already, but this was my experience from someone that's never been a Completionist or someone that sticks to a single player game until the very end.

They're just another type of stealthy marketing in a now fully capitalistic world that includes ""reporters"" and ""influencers"" as paid and willing actors. Anyways, here's why I don't like this game.

This game has so many puzzles that it ruins all of the action. Doom's history indicates that the original creator didn't want to slow down the game by making the players read lore. This latest version slows the players down with puzzles instead of lore. 

Imagine this: You're tearing through demons, building up skill, listening to rocking music. You're on a roll and you're loving the fast pace. Suddenly, after you've defeated all the enemies in the area, you don't know where to go. You look at the map and it looks like you need to execute a complicated series of air jump maneuvers in a perfect sequence. If you fail any part of the jump sequence, you die and have to start all over again. You're now stuck in a Groundhog Day type loop until you successfully complete the entire sequence. All the health benefits, extra lives you accumulated are lost. Ok, it happens. Some players hold on to health and extra lives until the end of the game anyways and don't enjoy the game as the developers intended. I get it. But, look at the other side: all of that rush you got from tearing through the demons while listening to metal is now gone. Your eyes are tired, your fingers and wrist are overworked. The only reward for all of that ""enforced grinding"" is that you crossed the artificial hurdle put in place by developers who want to make you play the game in a certain enforced way. 

Ok, anyways, you start playing again and it gets good again. You're defeating enemies and rocking out to music, again. And, suddenly, one more platforming puzzle for you to do. The platforming puzzle is a part of the main game. It's not for an extra mission or for some hidden trophy for the completionists. This whole FPS, puzzle, FPS, puzzle, ... business is repeated for as long as I played the game.

I have encountered enough of these to give up on this game. I have spent many hours spread out over weeks trying to finish one puzzle. I spent more hours solving the puzzle that actually playing the FPS part. These puzzles don't become easy with practice or with more command of the keys. While puzzles do improve your jumping skills a tiny bit, the puzzles become harder too. 

Don't get me wrong. Puzzle games have their place and people love them. But Doom doesn't market itself as a puzzle game, it markets itself as an FPS game. But, this Doom game is 50% puzzle and 50% FPS. All the glowing reviews conveniently skip this key detail, which is why I feel the reviews are all fake/paid. Any solid FPS reviewer who has actually played the game for a decent amount of time would at least mention this very important aspect of gameplay. 

If you want to play an FPS game that's frequently punctuated by puzzle-grinding, this is the game for you. If you don't like the puzzles in an FPS game, I think you'll end up abandoning this game midway.",1594599997,1594599997,False,3,1,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198289098174,68,2,421,0,421,1588991623,,

35,65524614,english,"A fantastic continuation of DOOM 2016, DOOM Eternal is a fast paced first person shooter that is all about mobility, ammo management, and killing demons in a gory and brutal fashion. The story and campaign is linear although there is a good amount of exploration in terms of finding secrets and collectibles, which admittedly is very easy especially if you upgrade your suit to mark them on your map. There is plenty of combat to be had, and the game relies a lot on the arena style combat of DOOM 2016, but has also added a sprinkling of enemies through out the level so you have some things to shoot on the way to the next arena battle. The gun play and weapons of DOOM Eternal are much the same as DOOM 2016, although many of the weapons that were useless in 2016 have been buffed, as well as mods that weren't used that much in 2016. However you'll quickly fall into preferring certain mods and certain weapons over others, especially since weapons in this game still share ammo with other guns. For instance once I got the chaingun I quickly stopped using the heavy cannon unless it was for situational things.

As for the story itself its fairly enjoyable, they did a fair bit more world building in this game than they have in the other DOOM games and has confirmed some fan theories related to the Doom Slayer, and a lot of the environmental design lays into this, the design that is quite phenomenal, as I often stopped just to observe the world that id has crafted, with areas such as hell being more hellish than the prior games. The graphics are also fairly good, although I wasn't running them at the highest settings, with effects and sound design being on point. The game is also fairly lengthy, taking me 15 hours to complete with me going after all of the secrets and most of the challenges.

The game also definitely tries to be the DOOM 2 to DOOM 1 of the newest iterations of DOOM, in that it ups the ante, especially in terms of number of enemies and difficulty. I've played both this game and DOOM 2016 on ultra violence and felt that I was dying more often and struggling more in Eternal than 2016. This is both because of there being more enemies, being more enemy variety, and most importantly, because the AI of the demons in this game is much more aggressive than 2016. They actively will try to swarm you, jump up and down ledges to come after you, and many will try to get into melee range with you while others stay in the back shooting you with projectiles. This is overall good and gives a great challenge but it does often feel a bit overwhelming.

My only concerns with the game is how they implemented ammo management, particularly in the fact that weapons in this game have very small ammo capacity, and the only ways to get ammo is to either pick it up off the ground, blow up barrels with the right armor upgrade, and, the most common way, using the chainsaw. In DOOM Eternal you'll always regenerate at least one fuel for the chainsaw meaning you can use it fairly regularly on weak enemies to get a steady stream of ammo, and because weak enemies such as zombies will keep spawning in arenas while the stronger demons are still alive, you'll usually have a steady stream of ammunition. While this isn't too much of an issue, this does get rather tedious, and I feel as though they want you to use the chainsaw too much and a high ammo capacity would've been more appreciated to keep the flow of combat going. Another issue I personally have is that the default punch does 0 damage unless you charge it up to be a blood punch, and my final issue with the game is the Marauder enemy, who I always groaned at when I saw him appear, as they are very time consuming to kill.

Overall though, if you love DOOM games, Eternal is an excellent addition to the franchise and a wonderful challenge to get through if you love fast paced FPS games.",1584851072,1594598971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004225502,781,23,1557,0,1101,1588890823,,

81,72577066,english,"[h1]Doom: Eternal is easily the best game in the entire series.[/h1] 

Especially if you're already a big fan. I myself, have been playing these games since the release of Doom 3. Which got me heavily into the series, and simultaneously into survival horror. However, if it wasn't already obvious, these modern games go back to their roots. Non-stop demon slaying action, hidden collectibles, power ups, and secrets. Intense battles and a somewhat interesting plot.

If I truly had to nitpick on some things it would be the following:
- [b]Marauders, one of the new enemies introduced in the game, are easily the most out of place and annoying baddies to have to battle.[/b] As they block all of your attacks and won't let you hit them until they open themselves up for attack. In a game where you're constantly moving around managing other monsters with different behaviors, its a real huge annoyance to have a virtually invincible enemiy harass you at the same time. The only defense is to keep moving away from him, while you manage the other enemies. Whats worse is that one of the timed challenges in the later maps features a Marauder that was insanely frustrating to beat. Since the monsters attack pattern is inconsistent, and the games only advice is to keep him at ""medium range"". Eventually after some luck and determination, I beat the challenge. Some people might not have the patience for this. However, IMO the game was too fun to not push through and beat every challenge I faced.
- [b]The game seems pretty buggy, and has crashed on me several times after beating crucial story points.[/b] That said upon restarting the game again, I started exactly where I left off. Or at least the closest possible checkpoint. So no progress was lost any time this happened. The games cheat codes that you unlock as you progress through the story, also seem to cause weird bugs. If you turn them on, you won't be able to get the Empyrean key from the Slayer Rooms after you beat them. I had to do the same challenge at least twice, restart the game, and then turn the cheats on then back off again. After another reload of the game, I was able to get the key just fine.
-[b]I found the ending to be kinda underwhelming[/b] [spoiler]After you defeat the Icon of Sin, it just kinda ends on a corny line and thats it. No real resolution, especially when everything implies that Dr. Hayden might be up to something. And that VEGA might actually be assosciated with the Makyrs somehow. Who's to say Hayden isn't the Makyr that gave Doomguy his speed and strength. All kinds of questions unanswered, but maybe that's the point?[/spoiler]

Overall the gameplay is fun, intuitive, and downright addicting. The replayability is pretty high, especially on higher difficulties if you like that sort of challenge. I might even consider giving it a try after writing this review.

And lets not forget Mick Gordon and the heavy metal symphony that is the soundtrack. I can't stop listening to it I'm obsessed with tracks like 'Meathook', 'The Only Thing They Fear Is You', and 'Super Gore Nest'. Check them all out, plenty of good quality releases out on YouTube. At least until they officially release the soundtrack.

My love for Doom, is eternal! XD

84,72574332,english,"During the summer sale, I bought Doom 2016 at an extremely good rate, played through it, and loved it.  Before the sale was up, I decided that I would check out Doom Eternal while it was also on sale.  So, I started it up to play it, but having played Doom 2016 and Eternal back to back really highlighted some of the annoying changes.  

With Doom 2016 as my baseline, there was a noticeable decrease in quality nigh across the board:
- The animations seemed lazier
- The glory kills had less variation
- The user interface was overly simplified and unhelpful
- The texture quality was greatly reduced
- Rune trials just turned into touchable runes
- Default keymapping is annoying and unintuitive
- Monster AI appears to be diminished, but more aggressive
- Gauss cannon removed from the game in lieu of Ballista
- Equipment animations dropped in lieu of shoulder fired grenade launcher/flame squirt gun.
- Emphasis on rechargeable chainsaw kills due to ammo scarcity.
- Ammo drops themselves are 2D color coded squares on the ground.
- Story driven single player was revised to mindless robot speaking in my ear.

These are the things I noticed in the first hour and a half of the game that I didn't like about it and I wasn't about to spend another 15 hours growing this list.  It's possible that the game improves given my extremely limited time playing it.  But, from what I saw, it wasn't fun and I've no desire to continue.  Maybe it isn't fair to compare it with such a good game released in the past.  But it exacerbated the annoyance I had with it when playing them back to back.

94,69034959,english,"DOOM Eternal Review

Four years after the release of the awesome Doom 2016 comes the next chapter in the saga called Doom Eternal. How does it compare to the previous game? Let’s find out.

The story, which is kind of a remake of Doom 2’s plot, is simple: Doomguy/Doom Slayer has returned to lay waste to Hell’s armies who have invaded Earth. In other words, this is id Software’s version of the Book of Revelations.

Gameplay remains as great as ever with some new abilities to help you rip and tear through your enemies such as ice grenades that freezes enemies, flamethrowers that’ll get you more armor from burning enemies, and a badass laser sword (which sadly you won’t get until the end of the game) that takes out even powerful enemies in one slice. You also get the ability to climb walls and even dash, both on the ground and in the air.

As with the past Doom games, there are numerous collectibles to find such as floppy disks that enable cheat codes, toys, and albums each containing one song from id Software’s past titles like Doom II, Quake and surprisingly even Commander Keen. There are also upgrades to find such as Sentinel Crystals which expands your health, armor and ammo, Sentinel Batteries that unlock items in your Doom Fortress, Mods for your weapons and Praetor Tokens to upgrade your gear, abilities and maps. Finding these collectibles and upgrades feels a lot easier in Doom Eternal than its predecessor as I always had difficulty locating all the secrets.

The game’s difficulty is more challenging than ever, even on normal difficulty. As you progress, you will be up against super tough demons that will make it difficult for you to focus while you dodge attacks from nearby enemies. So you'd better know what you're doing or you'll be so filled with rage, that you’ll wind up playing Rage. (Little id Software humour for y’all)

Mick Gordon who composed the music for Doom 2016 (as well as one my favourite fighting games Killer Instinct 2013) returns with another badass soundtrack. The music gives off vibes of hopelessness, dread and makes you feel like you’re in a hellish nightmare. Good job, Mr. Gordon!

Of course the game isn’t without its faults. Weak points. Why? Where’s the honour of that? When I played Doom 2016, slaying demons was fun. In Doom Eternal? Well, to get rid of the Mancubus quickly, you should take out their arm cannons. Cacodemons? A sticky bomb into their mouth for a quick glory kill. Revenants? Take out its rocket launchers. I can go on, but I find it difficult to focus on enemy weak spots while a horde of demons are trying to gang up on me.

And there’s the inclusion of extra lives. I don’t know how I feel about extra lives since I always liked the challenge of trying to fend off again a huge wave of demons with one life no matter how frustrating the experience can be. On one hand, they seems like an attempt to cater to casuals IMO. On the other, they do come in handy if you’re trying to get past each level, especially, with those pesky Marauders and the final two bosses. Less said about my experience with them, the better.

And finally, there’s one big gripe I have with this game and I’m sure this isn’t the only Bethesda game that’s having this issue. You can’t play access the game unless you sign up for a Bethesda dot net account or bypass the login screen by briefly unplugging your internet. Ugh... Why? No seriously, Bethesda. You're blocking me from playing this awesome game just because I have absolutely no interest in signing up for what should be an optional account? What’s even worse is you can’t even play online multiplayer unless you sign up for one. Which is nonsense, especially with games like Fallout 76 and even Wolfenstein Youngblood. Also, I bought the deluxe edition of this game and so far, I haven’t be able to access the exclusive demon slayer skin or the classic weapon sounds. Do I have to sign up for said account to access these items and the upcoming Year One Pass DLC? That said, this is Bethesda’s online & offline pass. Fix this, Bethesda.

**UPDATE 7/12/2020** I finally caved in and got a Bethesda dot net account and I can confirm that you need one in order to access the Deluxe Edition goodies. I have Wolfenstein Youngblood and it's the same deal. A bad business practice if you ask me because we should be able to get them without creating an account.

That said, as of this writing, I have not played the Battlemode. So I cannot give my thoughts on the online multiplayer modes. But if playing as a Revenant in single player is any indication, it sounds fun.

Oh, and spoiler alert for everyone, Doomguy actually speaks in this game. Not much, but still. Out of character for him if you ask me.

Final thoughts:

Once again, the folks at id Software have hit it out of the park with yet another awesome Doom game that improves from its predecessor. Sure, the game can be tough and you need a Bethesda account to play online & offline (again, unless you briefly unplug your internet). But if you can get pass these issues, Doom Eternal is a great game and a worthy successor to Doom 2016. Buy it.

Now please make a new Doom 2016-style Quake game already, id Software! Or a new Commander Keen game perhaps?

Amazing game with tons of glory violent kills, rage, gore, and heavy metal music, which accompanies it perfectly. :) About 40% of players finished the game, which is a very good indicator by comparison with other games. Took me 25 hours to finish the game. Game is polished and graphics is amazing. Developers created unique scenery from the start to finish. Game tries to tell an interesting story, but not in a way for you to focus attention on it.

Cons:

Difficulty is badly balanced. This is one of those game where you have no time to perfect your skills and attacks with your favourite weapon. You just get bigger guns and bigger monsters. I’ve started game on “Ultra-Violence” (Experienced) difficulty and completed about 75% of game on it. Then game just started to pile more big demons and added Marauder – out of place demon, which I could not kill even with BFG or Crucible and had to counter its attacks in 100-350 millisecond range, which is beyond physical capabilities of some older players (my future in 20 years :), therefore failure of QA team. Usually I would deal with Marauder after wiping other monsters, but developers decided that it is a good idea to spawn other range damage monster when you have to focus on Marauder (mixing requirement to run and stay in place and focus). I lowered difficulty to “Hurt Me Plenty” (Normal). Last boss fight was visually impressive, but poorly done i.e. no strategy just mindless slaughter and more demons. Lowered to “I’AM TOO YOUNG TO DIE” (Easy) difficulty for it, because I could not be bothered. Game would drop you into challenges without refilling the ammo, which could be “resolved” by you choosing to die on purpose.  I think there must be an easier difficulty option, which would allow bigger reaction times and further jump distances, which would allow me to play such games when I will get very old.

This is DOOM, so it is full of random instant-deaths from the pointless jumping and falling into the void, which brakes immersion.

[i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is an incredible game that improves on every aspect from its predecessor [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/]DOOM (2016)[/url]. Take control of the Doom Slayer once again and save mankind from the powers of hell as they try to take over Earth. [i]DOOM: Eternal[/i] goes further in depth about the origin of the slayer, the history of the conflict with hell, and more to sink your lore loving teeth into.

The same basic formula from [i]DOOM (2016)[/i] returns: execute glory kills for health, use your chainsaw for ammo, and burn enemies with your flamethrower for armor; but the ability to climb, swing, and dash are all new mobility options to help you survive...and you're going to need it! [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is HARD. I felt that the entire game was challenging but doable up until the final boss. After failing a boss fight several times in a row, the game does offer you the option to use ""Sentinel Armor"" which reduces the amount of damage you take, and I had to use it for the finale.

The visuals and audio for [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] are incredible. The graphics and art style are fantastic. The death metal soundtrack alongside the very distinct audio cues in game that help you know when your abilities have refreshed, or which enemies are near you, are a huge help when trying to survive. Plus there are many classic DOOM references, easter eggs, and re-mixed soundtracks to enjoy!

I played the game on Nightmare difficulty and was able to collect all the toys, gun mods, weapon upgrades, etc in a single playthrough. After completing the game, there are additional activities to do such as ""Master Levels"", which are re-mixed and harder versions of the game's missions, and various multiplayer modes. Personally I felt no desire to try these Master Levels or the multiplayer modes.

[h1]Summary and Target Price Point[/h1]

All of the above, paired with butter smooth and fully optimized performance come together as one of the best games released in 2020. I highly recommend [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] to any fans of first person shooters and single player experiences! Pick this one up at $30 or less and rip and tear through this 25 hour masterpiece.

9,71498249,english,"There is a very good FPS here somewhere. Unfortunately, it is buried under layer upon layer of useless upgrades and skill trees, forced platforming, and worst of all, the ever-present resource management: ammo, health, and armor are intentionally scarce, and you are forced to use special attacks to refill. To some that may be fun, to me it just makes the whole experience feel incredibly clunky and unnatural, interrupting the flow of the game rather than adding to it. While we are on the subject, the number of special attacks is excessive: chainsaw, flamethrower, glory kills, blood punch... keep it simple will you? It's a Doom game, I came here to blast demons away with a double barreled shotgun, I don't want to have to memorize half a dozen key bindings. Then there's the platforming: I like the idea of double jumps, climbing, dashing, somersaulting. Those are all things which, in moderation, would have been a great addition to the game, but sadly they got carried away, and often you find yourself spending more time jumping than shooting - again, this is a Doom game, I came here to fry hordes of demons with a BFG, not to re-enact Nadia Comaneci's perfect 10 at the Montreal Olympics. Probably as a consequence of this forced platforming, the levels also feel very linear.

The story is also a significant let down: they turned the tech-occult theme of previous Doom games into a sort of dark fantasy mishmash with kings, priests, gothic churches, and similar elements which might have been great in another game, but which simply do not blend at all with the Doom lore. The main character himself is disappointing: in Doom 2016, through some excellent use of environmental storytelling and brief cutscenes of the Slayer punching and smashing his surroundings, you felt like fury incarnate. Here... meh. The storytelling is also subpar: in 2016 you knew who the main villain was within minutes of starting the game, here, I've played the game for seven hours and I'm still not sure who or what I'm trying to find - something to do with some priests?

Overall, Doom Eternal feels bloated and clunky. That said, it is not a terrible game. It is a major step back in the series, and it is also a major disappointment, given how much potential was wasted due to poor game mechanics, but it is definitely not all bad. There are some enjoyable moments here and there: when the fighting picks up and you don't immediately run out of ammo, it can be entertaining. Just don't buy it at full price.

---

Addendum: I forced myself to finish the game. I only did the campaign because I don't care for multiplayer. I stand by what I wrote: when you are in the thick of the fight it can be entertaining, and once you get the hang of it you even stop running out of ammo (protip: dash, dash, chainsaw), but the glaring issues I saw in my first hours of play only got worse.

The platforming and puzzles became so annoying I almost quit several times. I do not know how much time overall I spent jumping around like a frog, or frustratedly looking in every direction, searching for a climbing wall or a horizontal bar that might get me to the next cluster of demons, but it definitely felt like hours, and it probably was. All that time spent not shooting anything and engaged in activities which would have been better suited to a Mario game, was time in which Doom Eternal was failing utterly at its main purpose: being a first person [b] shooter [/b].

Then there's the whole ""you must only play the way we want"" attitude. This was already evident in the forced chainsaw-flamethrower-ice bomb mechanics, but it became even more annoying with the marauders: they're really not that difficult to kill, they're just... boring: there is a certain distance you have to keep, and there is only a specific time window during which they are vulnerable to your attacks. There is absolutely no room for doing things any way other than what the developers decided. And don't even get me started on the Khan Maykr. Once again, the experience feels incredibly mechanical and artificial.

The story and the atmosphere... eh. More priests, more fantasy environments, some clichés about [spoiler] angels being just as bad as demons [/spoiler]. It's all a convoluted mess. Where Doom 2016 was almost lovecraftian in hinting at the unseen and the unspeakable (""They promised me so much""), this was in-your-face and comic book-ish, and I cringed every time the UAC hologram talked. Even the ""evil priests"" sound petulant rather than scary, definitely not something you would expect from literal Hell. All this nonsense is canon in the same way that midichlorians are canon: it simply does not fit with the rest of the story, it severely hinders suspension of disbelief, and I hope it will be quietly ignored in future games. Speaking of disbelief: what's with ""empowered demons"" who ""killed another player""? This is a single player game, I don't want to know about other players, this has to be the most immersion-killing thing I've seen in a game! What were they thinking?

To conclude: several times while playing Doom Eternal I had the distinct feeling that, in some posh executive's office at id/Bethesda, some of the suits decided that rather than improving upon the previous game, the surest way to sell more copies would be to expand the target market by including gameplay elements which may attract people new to the franchise or even to the genre. Unfortunately, the end result is a Frankenstein monster of a game which tries to be too many things at once, and fails to deliver the kind of experience a lot of older fans have come to expect. There are still moments of absolute brilliance, namely when you are given lots of guns and lots of very angry, very mobile targets, but that just adds to my disappointment, because if this game had just tried to be Doom, instead of Doom Raider or Assassin's Doom, it could have been really good.",1593272189,1594555743,False,88,8,0.683339118957519531,0,True,False,False,76561198053107313,212,12,2044,0,441,1594550649,,

36,72542886,english,"I don't understand the allure of this game as an shooter, and I'm genuinely sad that this did not live up to the amount of hype it's received since the pandemic began. I tried for over a dozen hours to like this game, but honestly I hate it.

The shooting reminds me of playing with a bow and arrow back in the Elder Scrolls Oblivion. There's no weight to the shots and no sense of feedback to the bullets registering on enemies. The graphics are pretty, if you like that sort of thing I guess. It's gratifying to see chunks of the enemy's flesh being blown off, but that doesn't really amount to jack shit if they aren't being affected by what I am doing to them. When I empty a mag into a generic human enemy that's literally reduced to a skeleton from my attack but he still somehow manages to close the gap and soul-punch me into a wall before mugging me, that doesn't encourage me to try harder next time. 

I read a lot about how this game implements 'strategy' and that 'you have to think your way through each fight' or some rubbish like that.

No, it appears that the 'strategy' touted in all of the reviews and blurbs seem to boil down to ""When you see X enemy use Y weapon. If you don't have Y weapon ammo then strafe like a kit in a hurricane until you pick up or earn ammo resources and then cheese the enemy"".  When I first read this I was excited because I thought from the sound of that, that this game would encourage you to experiment and explore different approaches. But alas, it's more like The Arkham Series' melee combat but with extra steps and you routinely just run out of the tools you need to deal with something in front of you that otherwise would be a cakewalk if you somehow knew that the enemy was going to show up at that part of the mission- oh wait, when you replay the mission that's exactly the case...

Which leads me to the worst part of the game that made me realize I don't want to play it anymore. It's repetitive to the point of boredom in a way I haven't experienced since the previous console generation.

And I get it. I doubt anyone will read this. The developers are millionaires. They have my money and I am in the minority on this take, but I am just very disappointed with how much of a letdown this game was. When the 'strategy' of each gunfight boils down to very predictable 'rock paper scissors' equations that punish you when you don't play by their rules, it takes away a lot of the experimentation from a game like this. Combine that with the fact that the missions are soooo long and it just feels like I'm doing chores to get to the end of a mission for the chance to replay said mission over again in such a way that I know exactly what to expect. So I can do exactly the same sequence of weapon rationing. So I can fight the same order of enemies.... Etc, Etc.

I don't know what else I could say without repeating myself. As a shooter this game blows, you either kill things instantly by exploiting their weakness or you get biffed by their damage sponge haymakers. The replayability is there maybe once or twice but after you know what to expect the formula is impossible not to see. Also, maybe I'm the only one who thinks this, but can we have one ""dash mechanic"" shooter where instead of just hitting shift and then WASD you can just double-tap one of the WASD inputs to juke in the direction you double tap. I don't know if I'm getting too old for this or what but I felt like I playing piano while trying to juke in mid air, switch to the insta-gib weapon, and also freeze another enemy in place with my shoulder mounted grenade launcher. On paper that sounds like a fun sequence, in practice though I had at least two other different enemy types that were also trying to brute force me at once and it just felt more frustrating than intense.

Changing this review after the Denuvo Anti Cheat debacle. ID/Bethesda actually listened to peoples' feedback and removed the DAC requirement. Good on them!

Doom Eternal is a great follow-up to Doom 2016. It's faster and has more action. The gunplay is satisfying and cannon fodder is plenty. It's got the grandiose, over-the-top weapons, battles and monsters and it's all amazing.

It has a bit of a lighter atmosphere compared to 2016, with some moments being comical (cacodemon grenade animation, zombie glory kill head bash, etc.). While I myself prefer the more grim and dark appearance of 2016, Doom Eternal's look is far from being a deal breaker. It's a beautifully crafted game.

There's three things I'd rather not have in the Doom Eternal: Parkour sections, very limited ammo (you have to use the chainsaw to replenish it constantly) and marauders. All three slow down the game's pace. Other than that, it's a solid entry to the franchise.",1589603752,1594527972,True,0,0,0.506960570812225342,0,True,False,False,76561198032209634,668,10,1114,0,1080,1590993678,,

THE GOOD:
-The gameplay is nuts once you get the hang of it (you are basically done with the tutorial and get to the fun stuff once you reach the super gore nest level)
-Music is great but not 2016 great (just my """"taste"""")
-Ultra Nightmare is fun if you enjoy CBT for a gold armor
-The level are fun as long as you don't *itch about the plataforming parts
-There is a track from Andrew Hulshult (""Goroth"" -Quake Champions) hidden as a secret
-Blood Punch is gonna make you nut
-Demons are great
-Hell looks ***king amazing
-A bunch of Dopefish
-More Uncle Sam and Vega
-The levels Super Gore Nest, Mars Core, Nekravol, Urdak and Final Sin are my personal favorites.
-The Slayer Gates are a lot of fun, hopefully they make more of those in the future for the lack of Arcade mode or infinite and bigger Ripatorioum once you are done with the main game.

The *kinda* BAD:
-Novik's speech at the start of the game. It's unskippable, and once you start playing through UN and dying over and over you may get tired of hearing it (come on, use his 2016 speech)
-No Arcade mode
-The ending (It was like ""wait, that's all?"", not in like hey I want more, but just that it ends so abruptly and it felt like I didn't win sh*t)
-Not enough Archviles and the Tyrants are a joke imo
-No doom 64 or doom 3 skin
-No Kar En Tuk song with just the vocals :(

48,72537939,english,"As someone who has never been a DOOM fan, only played DOOM 2016 through once and never felt the need to touch it again... This game is amazing. DOOM Eternal is ten times faster paced and has combat so satisfying it just keeps drawing me back for more. The real edge this game has is the fact that the better you get and the more you master the systems (of which there are a lot more than in 2016) the more fun it gets. Playing it through once wasn't enough, I then had to test my mastery by beating it on Nightmare difficulty, which then wasn't enough as even though I was slightly bored of some of the levels (mostly early game), I loved the combat so much I still kept getting the itch to play more and this has led me to attempting Ultra-Nightmare which I have yet to complete.

Simply put, the game runs smoothly, has an awesome combat system, extremely tight and responsive controls, and will make you keep coming back for more DOOM.

The main negative reviews I remember from around release were by game 'journalists' who had the main complaints of 'the marauder is too hard' (of course they didn't say that but by looking at their gameplay you can tell that's what the problem for them was) and 'why does it have platforming?'
My response to these is as follows, the marauder is punishing sure, especially on Nightmare, but he is definitely balanced, he can be countered effectively using skill and the right tactics (I mean speedrunners beat him in less than 5 seconds legitimately so he's clearly not too hard) and personally I never died to him even on my first playthrough, you just have to use the right strategies.
In terms of the platforming, is it amazing? No, is it terrible? Also no, as it is responsive and works well. Given this, it's more about what it adds to the game, which is the opportunity for the developers to add large, open and amazing level design which they otherwise wouldn't have been able to put in the game, so I think it overall ends up being a positive, and to really seal the deal, would anyone really rather ride a 30 second elevator or train where you can't control your character to get to a new area than just do a section of platforming which can be mastered and done in far less time? This is not the only example of how it betters the game either, areas can have little wasted space, as in the third level for example after an arena fight you do a 5 second part of platforming and you head back over the top of the arena to drop into the next arena fight quickly, instead of having two far away and totally separate areas that need to be accessed by some kind of walkway if there weren't any platforming elements. The main point is this: it's not the best thing about the game, but it allows the game itself to be so much better than it would have been otherwise, so don't believe the hate, and honestly some sections can be quite fun, especially doing your own parkour by using the meat-hook in combat!

All in all, this game is just great, I haven't bought a 'full price' game in a long time, and even this I got on half price sale, but it was worth every penny and after having played it, I would have paid the real full price for it, and I absolutely intend to get the DLC.

The gameplay is a cheap recreation of the first entry. 
Graphically there is little to no improvement. The addition of HDR actually breaks the game. All Maps and menus become illegible.
The story is all over the place. You feel like you missed an entire game from the first to this one. There are huge story gaps.  The story is also extremely short. If you are not a completionist like me you can probably complete the campaign in less than 5 hours.
Most all boss battles are repetitive and unrewarding. 
Ammo is not plentiful whatsoever. There are many areas where you will become stuck and unable to continue without restarting.
The soundtrack is atrocious compared to the first game. Its basically the same guitar riff the whole game. Plus it doesn't go along with the action.
This whole game is pretty much just $60+ DLC.

At the moment i'm writing this review i'm 21 hours in the game, not even finished it. Since endings to great games tend to sadden me alot and i'd hate not to give an honest review.

I started my first playthrough about a week ago, i have a fulltime job in an office and this is a great way to release that pent up anger built up by lazy colleagues and annoying customers that ask too many questions. Normally i play games just for the story and it's respective setting, Doom Eternal however, is a different case. Once you start getting used to all the many weapons given to you and the new and improved movement mechanics, you'll understand why this game is worth every penny you pay for it, regardless the price you paid. Unlike every other game with secret rooms, collectibles and extra challenges, i thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of exploration, extra challenge and all of the other side activities presented to you in this game.
Now i'm just speaking from my own point of view of course, but i'm 100% certain in saying that people who will not enjoy this game fall into three categories: 1, highly religious people. 2, parents who are afraid their kids might shoot up a school. 3, pussies.

BUY THIS GAME. RIP AND TEAR, UNTIL IT IS DONE.

99,72518993,english," I don't think I've ever done a complete 180 on a game like I have with Doom Eternal. I was so disappointed with my initial experience with Doom Eternal that I returned the game after two hours. I had just replayed Doom 2016, and Eternal was such a poor sequel to that game both in tone and gameplay that I perhaps overreacted. The game seemed needlessly complex and over-designed. The perfect combat loop of Doom 2016 was replaced by extraneous button-pushes and old-school platforming. Fortunately, Doom Eternal went on sale for thirty bucks a couple weeks later, and for that price I decided to give it a try. Once I got over the fact that Doom Eternal was not just more Doom 2016, I started to embrace the game on its own terms and appreciate what it was trying to do.

This is a difficult shooter that expects the player to keep track of many things at once. You have your flame belch, a flame thrower that immolates enemies who then drop armor as you damage them. The chainsaw is your main method of ammo replenishment, rather than the optional tool it was in Doom, and if you don't want to constantly run out of ammo, you have to chainsaw fodder enemies regularly. Glory kills function just like in Doom, but perform two of them and you'll have the option of performing a Blood Punch, a devastating melee attack that can severely weaken powerful monsters. You also have a recharging grenade launcher that can shoot ice grenades, which really comes in handy for crowd control when you're juggling twenty-plus enemies at once. Finally, you have enhanced movement options--in addition to your double jump from Doom, you can now perform two quick dashes as well as grab on to horizontal poles in order to swing from them like Tarzan. Add in the fact that most powerful monsters have damageable parts--you can shoot the rocket launchers off the revenant and the gun hands off the mancubus, for example--you have a game that expects quite a bit from you during a firefight. Initially, it's a little much to handle--the beginning levels throw several tutorials at you, introducing most of your new abilities in a few seconds, and then send you on your merry way to deal with arachnotrons and hell knights--but around the midgame point, you finally start to get into the combat rhythm that Doom Eternal requires of you. This is due to level design improving, as well as your arsenal, while your fingers have finally figured out which buttons to hit during what moment. The supergore nest level was when I finally mastered Doom Eternal, and it's also a wild ride through a hell and guts infested earth city.

Tonally, Eternal is a departure from Doom 2016. Whereas that game seemed to be a mishmash of Doom 3's realistic spaces and horror aesthetic with the more frantic gameplay of Doom 1 and 2, Eternal goes full nostalgia. The enemies possess none of Doom 2016's grindhouse design--they look like updated renders of the original game's cartoons. The whole art style screams Heavy Metal (by which I mean the influential magazine as well as the music genre), and one of Eternal's best gags is that the Doom Slayer can find and collect records from the soundtracks of id's classic games. I don't know if I prefer the tonal changes to the style of Doom 2016, but I like what Eternal does.

So what does Eternal flub? The platforming, mainly. There are many platforming sections which serve as breathers between the combat and little else. Some require decent timing, but I can't think of a decent reason for their inclusion other than old school shooters used to have lots of platforming. Also, the new combat loop works when you are given a big enough arena in which to do battle. Several of the early levels have you in little spaces. When you get stuck in a corner, the Doom Slayer is sort of screwed, since he doesn't have the durability of previous games till later. As far as difficulty is concerned, there is a huge jump from Doom 2016 to Eternal. I played Doom on Ultra-Violence (hard), and that's what I started Eternal on, and I was getting my ass handed to me until I figured out how to play. That difficulty stems from the aforementioned weaker Doom Slayer, as well as the sheer volume of heavy hitting enemies the game thrusts on you. I got used to it, but I don't know if I prefer Eternal's combat to that of Doom's.

If you're a fan of hardcore older shooters, then you'll probably love Eternal, with the caveat that it's not Doom 2016, which was a classic. I don't know if it is a better game that Doom 2016 (I greatly preferred Doom's wink and nod approach to story as opposed to Eternal's obsession with its boring lore), but it's already occupied 18 hours of my time, and I have several levels to go.

Doom 2016 is definitely better than this game.

Added a lot of unnecessary game-ruining features, such as parkour, swimming, puzzle solving. They are not necessary and adding those in the game ruin the whole experience.
Crashed a few times for no reason. But worse graphics than Doom 2016.
Messy combat gameplay where you had no idea which button to press to kill an enemy. c'mon, just do the same thing with Doom 2016! Why the 'sword', the 'fire', stupid grenades? We use to just press T for the BFG and now I have press Q and find BFG meanwhile having no idea which button to press to attack the rapidly attacking demon in front of me and behind me.
Also, the boss design are terrible. They are the WORST. The designers clearly don't have any experience or idea in making the game levels. They should probably play Doom 2016 to know what is the difference between ""intense"" and ""troublesome"".
And OH DEAR, the whole game only took me 13 hours to complete. What a ripoff. I was expecting a 50-hour gameplay!

Doom 2016 was the best. This is not.

28,72506797,english,"You want good Doom game? Get Doom 2016.

You want to be forced to use chainsaw to get ammo, and do retarded jumping puzzles? Get this game

Don't get me wrong, game is fun when you get to fight demons but rest? Bosses that you can damage only when their eyes turn green during an attack, stupid boss skills that put you in corridor made out of ""demon magic"" and make you dash around and jump while they throw silly moving stringy things at you.

Bethesda wanted to try something new with Doom: Eternal. They failed. In doom 2016 i was invested in my character progression cause it made me stronger than before and you could notice difference. In D:E you get buffed over time yeah but you don't feel being buffed. You are no longer Slayer. You are a weakling that gets killed by fucking imp cause you forgot to spam killmoves to regain HP every 5 seconds.

You never have enough ammo for anything. You MUST use chainsaw as often as you can in fights and delvelopers know about it cause every fucking second you get a useless and harmless minion spawn that can only walk slowly and all they do is slap you in the face. They should rename them to mobile ammo boxes.

Weapons
Shotgun - you start with cap of 10 shots. Very cool spinny skill (more powerful than default minigun in my opinion)

assault rifle - 100 ish (and it burns trough them fast), mini-rockets skill is cool as it was in D:2016

Plasma rifle - ok. this one is actually fine not much changed here. Microwave attack is useless

Minigun - well it uses same ammo as assault rifle. If you dind't upgrade your ammo cap twice you are going to run out of ammo in 4 seconds. Shield skill is nice, but mobile turret is better (as it was in D:2016)

Rocket launcher - seems to deal very low dmg for a rocket. sure trash gets one shot but honestly compared to other guns this one feels weak AF

Railgun thingy gun - fun to play with. actually i like this gun more than in doom 2016. uses decent amount of ammo

BFG - everything would be ok if not for some boss-like mobs than can literally just block it with a indestructible energy-shield and deny all dmg. Like WTF. 

And ofc as every Bethesda game it has BUGS.
How many times I died because of a floor that wasn't really there. I could shoot it fine! It did stop bullets but me feet? nope just fall to your own death. Enemies passing trough shields that block your pathway until you kill every mob on the battlefield. Well mobs can go trough it. Gl shooting them while you are blinded by some ugly ass orange force field spamming your eyes with effects while trying to find anything behind it.

Guess what happens when you fail a jumping puzzle. You don't die. You just respawn with 15% less armor and hp at the very beginning of the jumping puzzle. Yes in this game when you fail jumping puzzles game is not saying to you GAME OVER. No. It just spawns you back up like it was saying ""you fucking sucked so much Ima give you as many attempts as your HP is above 1 *head pats*.

Horrible experience. I will still play it trough it just to finish it but i know it wont be fun.

ps. ""You mad bro?"" yes I am as I just finished one of the hardest purple keys just to see my game crash at the end of it. Reloaded - checkpoint is before i started purple key. Fu Bethesda

ps2. I do not care for mp gameplay as sp already gives you retarded possibilities to stunlock strong enemies when you 1v1 them.

58,72491300,english,"So, I gave in and started playing Doom Eternal yesterday. I bought it on the summer sale even though I waited and wanted to buy it for Switch.

I'm a big fan of Doom 2016, which in my opinion is close to a perfect shooter with its tight game design, shooting, action, movement, level design, visual style and world building. 

So starting Doom Eternal, I am immediately thrown off by how the game does not take it self serious. Characters and enemies act like an Adult Swim comedy cartoon and the sound design only add to that with overly used wet gurgling noises and comedic plops. Visual design is just the hell and demons theme on steroids, and all pickups and the UI are super colorful and arcady. None of the more realistic horror sci-fi stylished mix from previous game.

ALL that being said. I already LOVE the game. I can tell their focus was to make a fun and tight game.
Enemies are more aggressive and you have to move around even more than the previous installment. You have so much movement options with dashes, swinging from handles and the hook.. The weapons feels AMAZING. A great sense of 
power, in not just how much damage they do, but visually with how you see bits of flesh fall of your enemy and the audio feedback from the weapon and the hits. Just wow...

The original Doom reboot wasn't necessarily a deep game but the dark story itself was told REALLY well in a wonderfully engaging way that's brilliantly interwoven throughout. Doom Eternal throws all that completely out the window and you're thrown into a... space castle? WHAT? How in the heck did I get in a space castle? WHY am I killing these priests? What are these GIANT FREAKING ROBOTS I AM PUTTING BATTERIES IN. Who is this ""Betrayer"" and why am I suddenly giving him things I just risked my life to obtain? 

WHO KNOWS, they never really tell you.

There is a MASSIVE gap between the two games that isn't ever really filled and none of it makes any sense or gives you any motivation for what you're doing and that's honestly really disappointing considering how wonderful the first game was. There are clearly components and other narrative pieces within the game that seem part of a larger story but they are not connected in any way almost like it's all been gutted for no apparent reason like a 24-episode season of a tv show where they only show you episodes 13, 18, and 23.

What's even worse is that the game-play itself has some really fun new mechanics and the new parkour and dash functions add some fun variability and paths to get away during encounters. However, these new mechanics are thin candy coating in a hollow shell of very brightly lit linear puzzles.

92,70687902,english,"Virtually every negative problem and critique about DOOM 2016 has been addressed, or is going to be addressed in the future, in this game.

[b]Snapmap has been removed from the game[/b], leaving Eternal to focus on the single-player and the multiplayer components. This was a negative from DOOM 2016 as that game never planned to have mod support, and this was a ""replacement"" of sorts, containing level blocks that the player could arrange into a makeshift level. It was generally underused and there were only a few bright gems towards the end of the game's life-cycle.

[b]Story DLC has been confirmed and is in the works right now[/b]. The original game had three planned multiplayer DLC packs, the component and the expansion packs were à la Call of Duty. To mitigate fracturing the player-base for multiplayer, they eventually overhauled the progression system and gave you the choice of unlocking the maps and equipment purchased, or making you earn them all over again. Overall, it was not well received in comparison to its single-player component, where fans wanted more from.

[b]Multiplayer has been completely reworked[/b] into an asymmetrical 1v2 multiplayer component where one player controls a fully kitted-out Slayer from the campaign and their objective is to kill the other two demons in the arena before they kill you. The mode requires you to be strategic regardless of the role that you're playing. The Slayer needs to be incredibly skillful, understand the weapons' various strengths and weaknesses, and the map structure and entities in order to succeed. The demons need to cooperate and work together in order to successfully trap the Slayer and overwhelm them The demons have access to various buffs and powerups throughout the match such as spawning heavy demons like the Tyrant (i.e. a cyberdemon), a Doom Hunter, a Baron of Hell etc. At the end of each round, the Slayer and the demons get to choose a powerful buff to use in the next round.

[b]More demons, more Djent, more of everything[/b]. This game has a much bigger scope and allows for more replayability of campaign missions with seasonal content for completing challenges. You can also unlock these emblems, skins, stands, and animations by participating in Eternal's multiplayer component, Battle Mode (1 Slayer vs. 2 demons), as well. Generally, the levels are much longer in length, the campaign itself is longer, there's more in-your-face music, there's a LOT more demons, and a bunch of new weapons and mechanics for the Slayer to traverse the environment with. There are more boss fights in the game which last much longer than DOOM 2016 and later in the game, those bosses show up as regular enemies (although slightly nerfed with regards to health). Also as someone whose purchasing decisions can either be made or swayed by the game's soundtrack, this game includes a best slice of every id Software game's soundtrack such as Quad Machine from Quake 2, Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, and the classic Doom games (even DOOM 64!) 

[b]This is a much more difficult game than DOOM 2016[/b], and honestly it benefits a lot from it. In 2016, you could literally go through the entire game with a super shotgun or a Gauss cannon from start to finish and not encounter many problems while doing so; this was even possible on a relatively difficult setting such as ultraviolence. In Eternal, there are demons with bigger weaknesses to certain weapons in your arsenal. For example, it would probably take you 10 seconds to kill a Cacodemon with a Super Shotgun (generally more powerful), but it would take you less than 3 seconds to kill a Cacodemon with an ordinary shotgun's grenade launcher attachment while its mouth is open. It's little weaknesses like that which require you to think strategically about which demons are more susceptible to being killed first in combat. 

I'll admit that I'm not entirely a big fan of the extra lives system. I understand it's an accessibility setting, and by no means am I a 'git gud' sort of player, but I would prefer if we had the option to disable that mechanic entirely alongside all of the extra life power-ups in the game. I'm also slightly worried about the future of the game's DLC given that Mick Gordon has been taken off the project due to internal conflicts and project scheduling.

The only part I didn't like was all the platforming.  I feel that, while it does engage the player (obviously), it just feels a tad too much at times.  I play Doom to murder demons, not jump around on platforms.  However, for every frustrating platforming area, there are 4-5 fight areas, and you never know what the ""arena"" is going to look like till you get there.  Visuals are simply stunning as well.

I also really appreciate the comment from Bethesda, quite surprised to have this level of attention to customer feedback. And following the clarification from Andy Stratton himself, sorry for the whining about Bethesda publishing schemes, if Denuvo was indeed IDs decision.

14,72059303,english,"After playing Doom Eternal, this game shows us what the future of the franchise will be.
* huge levels
* arena-corridor-arena game play, which isn't that bad
* more platforming, which is fine but I hate blind corners and blind leaps
* beefier weapons
* beefier enemies (even the ""feeder"" enemies are tough)

This is all all right but I don't like way they've implemented fast travel in the game. I feel once you've completed a level you should be able to go back to it and have fast travel immediately and forever unlocked for that level. The levels are huge and it's a PITA if you're looking for something in particular. Also I encountered a bug that marred my progression (completed a slayer gate but did not get an empyrean key--making it unlikely I will be able to unlock the unmakyr).

PROS:
+ I like the more movement options, I didn't think I would, but I do, double jumps, dashing, monkey bars, all of it
+ I like the beefy weapons
+ I do not mind the feeder enemies/chainsaw ammo resource management, it's ok, but meh
+ chainsawing enemies is fun but the timed recharge can really interrupt the flow of the game (at least for me)
+ the platforming is fun after you've done it a bit, it can take some getting used to
+ I like being able to upgrade your weapons and stuff
+ it's nice having all the old Doom II enemies back
+ the belcher/armor mechanic is fun--it encouraged me to use the belcher often
+ there's a story to doom now, it's not just mindless ""kill everything""
+ I like exploring the levels
+ I like that the levels have fast travel now

CONS:
- I do not like getting swarmed by the enemy AI especially when I'm trying to reach an enemy to chainsaw or glory kill
- the AI in dewm eternal seems dumber in some ways, in dewm you could always get to your enemies, now there's traffic jams all the time
- I'd like fewer, more obvious weapon upgrades
- I do not like most of the newer enemies, the viper/whiplash, the gargoyle but the doom hunter and marauder seem OK
- I do not care one iota about the ""progression"" system to add customizations to your game/UI/whatever, it just seems like a distraction
- the frag grenade seems pointless if you can shoot a bomb with your shotgun, just give us more shotgun ammo and drop the frag grenade
- I thought I would like the meathook more than I did, with the dashing, it seems redundant; you get the double dash way before the meathook--although the burning meathook is a nice option (since it drops armor for you)
- DRM: denuvo anti-cheat (which was later removed) and dunuvo DRM haunt this title
- the story, as it stands, it's just bafflingly stupid (IMO)--it's worse than Dewm's story; it's nice it has a story, but they could do better
- fast travel should be always available once you complete a level

After thinking about it some there are 3 ""eras"" of Doom so far... canonically, they're all a single timeline but to me, that timeline doesn't make a lick of sense, and they are all very different game play wise. So I tend to think of them as separate, but similar, realities.

15,72468320,english,"""Not your little brothers shooter""
And so this game has been out for a couple of months now and I finally came round to reviewing it. I mean you have seen the reviews and scores, THIS GAME IS BLOODY BRILLIANT. As a long time DOOM fan since i was a wee child it makes me so happy to see the series doing so well in this day and age, But lets get into the actual game. I came into this one with high expectations for many reasons. One this was the sequel to DOOM 2016 of which I adore. Two the DOOM series rarely disappoints. Lastly this is a game I have been itching to get my hands on since the reveal at quakecon all the way back in 2018. I tend not to get excited over games mainly because I have been let down by many games I got hyped for in the past, *cough cough* Star wars battlefront, But even I admit this game had me hyped to play and this is the one game I have been looking forward to since DUSK. Lets get presentation out of the way. ID Tech 7 looks awesome and the high detail in weapons, character models and environments shine in some breath taking levels, But what I love is the fact that even though this looks as good as it does its disk size is at least 15gb smaller than DOOM 2016, I dont know what Black magic they are playing with at ID but I love it. Also the game is really well optimised I only had one crash and its when I took a screenshot during a cutscene. Story has had a huge involvement in this game, I wont be that guy to ruin the best moments as some parts of this game left my jaw hanging, but my only issue is there seems to be a huge gap in time between DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal which kind of annoys me as I wouldve loved to see Doomslayers Journey between games, but with confirmation of two story DLC'S maybe we might get to see this story told. To the thing that matters. Gameplay. Core gameplay is a lot like DOOM 2016 I mean if its not broke dont fix it but a lot of new factors have been implemented into the combat that makes this combat a lot more challenging than the previous game. I think the biggest one that had all the game journalists butthurt was the lower ammo count which yes could get annoying as power weapons like the Rocket launcher and Ballista have bugger all ammo, but you can upgrade your total capacity and the game has made the chainsaw automatically refill its fuel to allow you to constantly be chainsawing the fodder demons for ammo. To further this point even more the game gets to the point where it will infinitely spawn fodders like zombies, zombiemen and imps in an arena until you defeat the bigger demons so if you are actually half decent at shooters this shouldnt be a problem. I believe this game to be an evolution of the FPS genre it quite literally has changed the game and other big budget shooters are going to be hard-pressed to even come close to this beauty of a game. Also I did not try the battlemode as I am not really a big online guy, but my friend says its fun if you can get on it with friends so I will take his word for it,

Graphically very nice and much improved from '16 in terms of visual clarity (uses all colors instead of just red). Every stage looks unique and extremely pretty although it's all very concept arty and motionless. 

Similar sort of gameplay to '16. It doesn't feel like you can really ""avoid"" attacks, like there's no weaving in and out of fireballs and rockets as in classic Doom. It's more about moving constantly while managing your ammo counts and ""super ammo"" counts and four cooldowns and one meter. Levels flow much better than '16. Progression feels worse than I remember. Suit, weapon, rune, crystal.. too many types of leveling up, nothing feels substantial or interesting beyond like 2.5 of the runes.

Not much to do after the campaign; I do not enjoy Battlemode even 1%. ""Master Levels"" and Lives Mode poorly conceived, half-baked. Takes itself stone cold seriously in terms of lore and tone, in contrast to '16.

6/10
Pick up for $20 if you really want to
The main campaign is alright, super repetitive gameplay involving focusing the 'heavy demons' first and fodder for health and ammo. I won't lie, this was my first DOOM game and I am just not impressed beyond the glory kills and carnage. Multiplayer is alright, but won't keep you playing.

[i]Let me preface by saying I have never played any other DOOM game, or read any novels. However at the time of writing I have sunk 82 hours into the game to give you an accurate representation instead of something cheesy and surface level like most one liner reviews. I hope this guide helps your final decision on whether or not to get this game.[/i]

[h1] Doomblade into the Campaign [/h1]
[b]NO Spoilers![/b]

Visually speaking, the game has moments of feeling really fucking ferocious. It's a weird thing to admit but the carnage is just something of an addicting stimulant to keep you going. You can glory kill anything at any angle and fall in love with wiping out hordes of fodder with a mega-mc-double-pummel of your gauntlet. The problem is... well, beyond that..? Not much else is very engaging or enjoyable. I really loved the beginning of the game, I played through this on ultra-violence and had a blast for the first maybe 6-10 hours; but got so fucking bored afterwards. To begin with, I really couldn't get into the story very much, it just felt like a pretty average revenge tale.  You will learn in the first 10 minutes that your objective is to kill 3 Hell Priests that made Earth go a bit wild. Let me just say, that is essentially the whole story.

In terms of the game play, from what I hear this variant of DOOM is quite different from the 2016 release; which I have yet to play. For this reason I don't feel comfortable making comments on the comparisons which can be made (unless someone thought it right to gift it to me lmao) but I will tell you this much... You will learn rapidly the ideal strategies to eradicate each small arena-like room of demons. As I said earlier, this process is pretty fun at first because of the carnage but later on it's literally

""Do I have enough ammo to kill this big bastard?""
if yes, use either everything you've got or something it is weak to
if no, chainsaw an enemy. Then ask yourself question one again

This same analogy would work with your health and armor, simply switch out ammo for health lmfao

Anyways, unless additional information is needed. This is about as brief as it will get when talking about the campaign. The reason I didn't like it is because you repeat these targeting systems for hours and hours and eventually the game comes to a close. Boring as the hell our demons came from my guy.

[h1]Ballista Beams, another word for Multiplayer[/h1]
[i]Can you guess what's coming?[/i]

The multiplayer, or 'battle mode' as it is called in DOOM Eternal. When the game first came out it actually was pretty damn good because of all the lads playing and everyone being relatively bad.Even if it was a 1v1 you had a chance of winning. Now adays it's more akin to prestige 3 playing your level 50 and below lookin' ass. Not only has matchmaking become so irrelevant, but damn... It's just a never changing meta.

If you're playing a slayer, use the super shotty and ballista.

If you're the demon, spawn your garbage mobs and run lmao

Despite being a two demon one slayer system it feels like in any match a slayer that knows what they're doing will win. If you focus the demons and don't miss your shots (which is easy with the eccentric 'freeze frame' lag). You will kill them and the slayer gets a massive health and ammo drop which [b]can't[/b] be blocked. So, then they just need to focus you with a relentless chase and the round will end pretty quickly from there.

If you [b]EVER[/b] get stuck in a 1v1, and the slayer knows what they're doing just throw the fucking match it is so easy to stomp the demons balls into their throat and turn their dick into a banana smoothie like FUCK my guy it's too easy and I can't stress this enough!

Also, I will admit something I do agree with off the bat is that having an option between battlemode and slayers vs slayers would have been so much better. I can just tell a majority of players finished the campaign. Played an hour of battlemode and left the game to rot on their hard drive.

[h1]Cheat Codes[/h1]

So, with all that being said. I would have to say that there are just a couple of other things I would want to speak on. First, I am running a beefy krabby patty of a computer and the graphics maxed out simply did not impress me at all. There is some weird effect in place that makes looking at objects or rooms kind of... bad. I can't quite place it, but if you need examples I will gladly take screenshots and post them in the comments. Along with my notes as to why it looks weird. However, this can't be said for the demons or gore. All of that looks absolutely fantastic! It's simply the environment that looks strange throughout the whole game.

The events are average at best. Like I said, you have a pretty boring/repetitive campaign and a fairly dead/sweaty multiplayer. So, these events will reward you cosmetics for completing challenges and ranking up in the 'battle pass' if you will. However, the problem I had with this is that the challenges just aren't very fun. This is [b]not[/b] the devs fault. It's just that this system really couldn't be utilized well when you place it with everything you have to work with. It's like the challenges are just ""Kill 40 frozen fodder demons"", ""Kill a pinky with a doom punch"", ""Jump off a cliff but pull of a 360 no scope"". Like uhh... I will tell you a secret right now... You can re-run the level Mars Core and [i]always[/i] complete 70% in a run or two, if not the whole thing.

The multiplayer seems to get challenges as well each season, these challenges are really simple; but like I said they can't really be different because the core game is just the way it is. You play 3 matches as a demon or 3 as a slayer and boom. Challenges done.

[h1]The End[/h1]

With all this in mind, I can only recommend you this game if you pick it up on sale for $20 or less. Truly it fucking blows to say this because I was ready to get into DOOM. This is my first exposure to the series, and I even went so far as to preorder the game. I didn't come in with high expectations, because truthfully I couldn't. It was my first game, no impressions or anything. Yet still, I was let down. I am sad to say all this about the game because it's got an appeal which I can understand. However, I'm also not blinded by what this game is. Just barely above average.

So, I would like to thank you for reading. If you have thoughts, questions, or anything of the sort please leave a comment or rating on this review to help others see it and understand. I'm glad to have been a part of this games review process, and keep in mind... Rip and tear lads!

[b]This only goes over the campaign, as I, and probably many others, didn't buy a DOOM title for online PVP.[/b]

Starting off with performance/optimization, max settings ran surprisingly well with no frame drops, at a solid 144fps, despite this I did have a few crashes but none made me lose progress.

For gameplay, overall it was good, but could sometimes be clunky, particularly with the wallclimbs and pipes. Another thing I disliked was having my dash get blocked by an enemy when it looks like I should've made it past, getting me stuck and losing a lot of health. Meathook felt great once I got familiar with it, and is a really nice tool for hit & runs and getting in the face of something over a gap. There's lots of on-the-fly ammo management, which can be quite annoying sometimes.

The first few levels have this odd immersion break where it teleports you out of the level into a small tutorial room, which is completely blank and looks like it was made in 30 seconds. Needless to say this is highly unnecessary, the tools at your disposal are relatively simple and can be learnt faster in combat than in a small gray space. Other tutorials such as weak spots showcases for new enemies, are also done in a similar room, but without you actually being there. It's just a video.

Regarding the story/lore, it's about what you'd expect for a DOOM game. Earth is infested with demons, angry man goes to Earth and kills the demons and their sources.
It's obviously not that linear, but I want to keep the review spoiler free.

In summary, is it as good as DOOM 2016? It's hard to say as I love both games, Eternal is much faster paced, with more movement mechanics, while 2016 is slower, simpler, and has a better story.

TL;DR: Fuck Marauder.

It's not too hard, it's just not fun at all. I ended up switching to easy out of frustration on bosses, but it didn't really change much, so I'm blaming piss game design.
Also it runs like dogshit, I have to specificly change my mouse sensitivity when playing this game because the mouse options are a piss and noodle soup. There's a 50/50 chance it will freeze at loading, and I had it freeze numerous times at said bollocking tit nipples bossfights. The graphics are fine, I had no problem with them, haven't even cliped through the map like in DOOM 2016, but maybe that's just because the game would crash before it.
Dont get me worng, I enjoy the gameplay loop, the resource management, the level design, just bosses and game crashes can suck my miniscule micro-penis.

First off, the game throws you in the middle of a story that makes zero sence. I had no idea what was going on, but every other character. No one felt the need to catch me up on this, just act like I knew what was happening. 2016 was petty straight forward and simple. Your on mars, there are demons, kill them. It was simple and worked. 

You now have to either kill each demon in a certain way or they will just absorb bullets. Melee deals basicly no damage. it takes like 20 hits to kill a grunt when it was 2 in 2016. It made me more hesatint to push then I did in the old game. It felt more like Halo where I hid and shot. 

This isn't a bad game, I just wouldn't recommend it. This is a Just Cause 4 situation, I just wouldn't recommend it. If you really liked 2016 than get this, but if you just thought 2016 was OK and wanted more of the same than don't get this.

65,72439581,english,"Meh.  The Doom franchise IMO ""jumped the shark"" with Doom Eternal.  Just after finishing all current content in Borderlands 3,  I saw DE om sale for half price, and a further coupon discount.  Given I am a fan of all the previous versions of Doom, and the strongly positive reviews, I was majorly disappointed.  Compared to Borderlands 3, or any Borderlands game DE is a incredibly boring. Worse yet, it's nauseatingly cheesy.  I still feel like I paid more for the game than it is worth.

Sure, it has great graphics.  But I can't play the higher quality settings on my QHD monitor, because I have a 6GB GTX 2060 card?  The required memory for the higher levels is just 0.2 GB more than 6GB?  Seriously?  I would think 6GB graphics cards make up the largest portion of cards in use today.  It seems incredibly sloppy and lazy that Bethesda basically decided ""oh well what can we do"" when a tiny 3% further optimization would have made the highest quality settings playable on 6GB cards.  My card runs  the game at 130 FPS+ at native 2560x1440 resolution at the highest usable graphics settings allowed.  Clearly the card could easily handle great frame rates at higher quality settings. What  waste.

That said the graphics are pretty.  Not ground breaking, but good.  Previous Doom games were more of a shut up and shoot affair, with only infrequent comments from your ""commander"". The demonic characters that talk in DE are just nauseating,.  It's like they are trying too hard to make the story engaging.  Its not.  The result is so cheesy and annoying its like a B movie, or the worst movie sequel you can imagine.  The talking demonic characters are so bad, that they are almost funny.... almost... they're just irritatingly bad.

It's not that this is a bad game, its just not a great game.  Especially having just played a game like Borderlands, where the story telling is just as incredible as the graphics.  I spent about 130 hours on BD3, finished everything.  I have spent less than 2 hours with DE and am already thinking of just deleting it.  Life is too short to play cheesy mediocre games, even if they have nice graphics.

DE is an excellent example of why any game that you have played for less than 1 or 2 hours should be fully refundable.  Buyer beware.  You may like this game, or like me, despite the many positive reviews may find the game tarnishes the overall doom franchise. Doom 3 was a good game, not an amazing game, but at least wasn't so cheesy.

Beware that just because you have liked all previous versions of Doom does not mean you will like DE.

It's not a terrible game but it doesn't feel it took the improvements from 2016, the management is just downright stupid, I've done raids in an MMO that doesn't feel as suffocating as this, Ammo management is just completely absurd and it just makes me want to stop playing seeing that all my weapons are low ammo constantly, yes I can use the chainsaw to remedy this but it doesn't feel as flowing as 2016, in fact it feels like the brakes are slammed here constantly to deal with some annoyance that threatens to slow the rampage down.

The other big downgrade is the music, I won't deny that mick gordon slacked by not having the soundtrack ready for release but when the music isn't mixed by Mick, Well you can tell it isn't because it doesn't feel like something playing along to your rampage but rather just quietly in the background so I'm disappointed in that regard.

[i]Joking, nothing can come as close to that[/i]




So, i've been playing Doom since the first one, somewhere in 2000-2001 when i had my first PC, i've been a die-hard fan of the franchise ever since.
When Doom 2016 was released it blew my mind, everything was perfect in that game, i was hoping to be as pleased with Doom Eternal as i was with the 2016 reboot.

Eternal fell a bit short to my expectations personally, but it's still a great game nonetheless.

It feels like the developers wanted to do something a bit different this time. Some of these things were cool, some not so much.

What i am totally unhappy about this game is that it steered a bit from the classical type of ""corridor shooter"" as some might call them, meaning that it has too many characteristics of an adventure game, for my tastes at least.

Some puzzles were overdid, you can't afford to be very trigger happy and just blast everything because you usually have somewhat a small ammo available.
Typically Doom was the kind of game that always had tons of ammo everywhere, and you could just don't care, shoot, blast, explode, so i wasn't happy about this change.
Most of the times i died were because i was totally out of ammo for any gun, and the melee punch wasn't strong enough to kill even a fly, so i had to adapt a bit, and be more cautious with the firepower.

The puzzles weren't hard (and i say that as someone that is very dumb when it comes to puzzles, the last few years at least), it's just it feels like there could've been a better balance between Action and Adventure.

What i loved most about this game on the other hand, it gives you a more humanly perspective of the hell, it gives it some more rationalization i suppose,

[h1]Music[/h1]
Oh well, i am not a fan of this soundtrack, I don't know exactly how to describe it. it's just very vanilla, too soft. 
DOOM 2016 had one of the greatest soundtracks i ever heard in games, with music that would give you that adrenaline rush and pump you so hard you were feeling like you were actually, indeed, inside the game.

It does contain the song ""BFG Division"" which is a pure masterpiece, but you don't get to hear it often.

Personally, i am a simple guy, if i could have a song switcher, i would've listen to it the entire game.
I don't like this genre of Alt-Nu, or however ti can be called, and i get the feeling i am not alone in it.

Menu theme was pretty cool, it was chill, but it also had some dark and unnerving vibes, totally loved it.

[h1]Maps, Levels, Demons, W/E[/h1]
I liked the level design, of course, as usual you get to have secret locations where you can find cool collectibles such as Vinyls and dolls.
Towards the end, however, it's where the level design actually shines at its brightest, they were so beautiful i wished i could take a trip to hell for some hours.

Some enemies are annoying as hell (no pun intended), for example the Marauder but luckily they don't appear often.
A cool thing i encountered was that, some times a demon would appear that had previously killed another player, and he was a bit stronger, but also dropped more loot.

Weapons, you have plenty of them, the ammo isn't great as mentioned earlier. I wish [spoiler]you'd get the BFG a bit earlier though[/spoiler]

I think Doom is the only game that made a classic, non-fancy double barrel shotgun look and feel so bad ass.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

The game is very well optimized, i played it on a PC that hasn't seen a fresh OS install since 2018, with a GTX 1060 that needs new thermal paste, and an i5-4440. 
While my GPU is far from being old or outdated, i was still a bit surprised to see the game set things to almost maximum at the launch of the game. 

I did encounter some bugs, some i could reproduce, some i couldn't, this area is mostly for the devs if they are reading reviews and want to fix them:

- Sometimes when launching the game, i was having two cursors, the game window was somehow not in focus, as i couldn't do anything, keyboard didn't work, neither did my mouse. I couldn't alt-tab. My workaround was using an android app on my phone that i use to control my PC, to bring focus back to the game window. 
Not sure what causes it but i had it most of the times i launched the game

- Screenshots while the Doom guy was picking up collectibles was causing memory leaks, might have something to do with Steam itself.

That's about it, i mean, the game did crash few times on me out of sudden, and i had 2-3 more random memory leaks but those i blame on my PC itself.

[h1]In the end[/h1]
If i had the chance, i wouldn't pay again 20$ for it, that sum of money is not that small where i am from.
With good and bad, i loved the game, it's a good and new addition to one of my favorite franchises.
I think a big factor on why Eternal didn't tick for me as amazing as DOOM 2016 was in fact, the music, it's a really big important factor.

If you are not a fan of the franchise, i think it would be better if you got DOOM 2016 instead (assuming you don't have either, and want to choose between them)

I give it a 7/10.

The game is way too long to have kept me invested in it's gameplay and upgrade systems. Battling through wave and wave (and wave) of the same enemies, with the same death animations was superb for an hour of 4/5, But not much more. 

Oh and it's incredibly frustrating to loose a fight because you're out of ammo and there's no cannon fodder for you to cut up with your chainsaw so you generate some much needed ammo. Sometimes it works though when looking for health, but more often it gets in the way of a good fight.

9,68884105,english,"I think DOOM Eternal is pretty good. It may not start especially strong, but after the first third of the game you've got a bunch of new abilities, weapons and movement options that makes the 2016 reboot seem threadbare in comparison. The levels start fairly linear, but open up as you progress through the game. The combat this time around is definitely harder, and there's one enemy in particular that's probably the toughest in the [i]entire[/i] series, but oh man is it ever satisfying. Plenty of ripping and tearing to do!

You're forced to use almost every tool in your arsenal in a sort of rhythmic dance of death, especially since your primary source of ammo is from demons, not pickups. It's not like in other Doom games where there's enough ammo lying around for you to use just a couple of guns - you don't hold that much ammo, but your chainsaw that you use to kill demons for ammo automatically fills with gas now. Thankfully the rhythm is fun; cutting fodder demons open like a demented pinata is always great, and the weapons are very punchy feeling. Movement is if anything even more important this time around, given how deadlier your enemies are. I don't even mind the arcadey floating pickup icons, because most of them are secrets and there's more than collectible dolls this time. The hub area is neat, with places for your collectible items, bonus upgrades you can unlock, and other things besides.

The only thing I didn't like so much was the occasional patch of purple goo that slows you down and prevents you from jumping. Since movement is a very important aspect to the game, being stuck in the goo is not only less fun than free movement, but dangerous in combat. Tutorial pop-ups tell you how to defeat most non-fodder enemies just before you face them for the first time, and apart from a couple of bosses where the advice is welcome (including the aforementioned toughest enemy in the series) I found it a bit egregious. Fortunately you can turn those pop-ups off. There's noticeably more platforming than in the 2016 game, and while I didn't mind it too much, there were bits that I ended up falling off like 2 or 3 times before getting through them.

For those of you who care about Doom's story, there's a lot more lore this time around. The backstory that was alluded to in Doom 2016 is essentially revealed, as is the Doom Slayer's background. Between that and where the campaign takes you, it's an interesting ride...with an okay end. I honestly expected more of a denouement after the final boss. Multiplayer's different now: it's a 2v1 arena where two demons gang up on the Doom Slayer. It can be fun, but the biggest problem is a lack of matchmaking skill balance.

Ultimately Doom Eternal changes up the formula enough to be more than just ""the last game with different scenery"", and while that might displease some people, I thought it was done well. Throw in another patented Mick Gordon soundtrack (unfortunately he's stopped working with ID Software and won't be scoring the DLCs) and plenty of callbacks to the classic games for older fans and you've got yourself a great time.",1589086430,1594351202,True,12,5,0.526819169521331787,0,True,False,False,76561197999151078,510,271,2639,0,1097,1598404740,,
10,72407017,english,"IMPORTANT: Do NOT try to run this on a laptop. DOOM 2016 worked on mine (slow but functional), but this refused to run. I ended up buying a gaming desktop from a friend for a very good price just to play this (though that was long overdue).

For those of you picking this up after playing DOOM 2016, this is a very different experience. The enemies are more powerful, but so are you. Many times, I would find myself wondering why I was having trouble, then I would remember that I had way more tricks up my sleeve than my guns. It has an Overwatch-like plethora of abilities with cooldowns and other ways to replenish them, and some of the enemies have Dark-Souls-like attack-timing and weak spots. There are several sections of platforming, and they're usually kinda puzzle-y. Imagine DOOM 2016 but with all that thrown in there. If that doesn't sound like fun, then this might not be for you.

As for me, I enjoyed this a bit more than 2016. I say that because while it was more frustrating at times, it was also more satisfying to succeed in. Before, when I got through a hard section, I would think, ""Well, I shot my gun, and they died. Cool,"" but after getting through Eternal's hard sections, it felt more like, ""Wow, I actually managed to pull that off by using all my abilities and the enemies' mechanics as best as I could. Awesome."" It makes you feel a lot more apart of the fray and less like a mobile tank just clicking on everything. It also makes you feel more mortal in that if you screw up or fail to use your the mechanics properly, you're toast. Some people like that, some people don't. That's mostly what you'll see in the reviews here, but there's the truth. Both games are very fun and have their own things going for them, mechanically. 

I didn't bother to get too deep into the lore myself (I got both games almost 2 weeks ago and beat them; I'm new to the DOOM franchise), but this game is far more rich and explicit with it than the previous games. And, like the other aspects of the game, your enjoyment of it is based on your preference. For those who disliked how deep it got into the Doom Slayer's backstory, I mean, come on. They probably weren't thinking too deeply about lore in the earlier games, and in order to tie it all together here, they really had to stretch. Some of it felt kind of odd and vague, but I thought it was overall pretty cool (with some suspended disbelief). Some of it felt a bit lacking, but hey, it's DOOM, you play it to saw demons in half, not read books (though I spent a good amount of time admiring the fortress's bookshelves), so it's kind of a petty thing to get hung-up over.

And the platforming is fun. It sometimes gets challenging, but that just gives you a chance to prove your skills. There was only one section (I think it's in the Cultist Base) that I was REALLY frustrated with and ended up having to use some very unconventional methods to solve (Make sure you get the air-control perk early!). But besides that, I had fun with it. 

While I don't necessarily think this is a game I will be coming back to frequently, the 16 hours I spent on the campaign in normal mode were a blast. I wouldn't say it's worth $60 (I got it half off), but if it's on sale, and my above description sounds appealing to you, then absolutely pick this up. If you like big guns, powerful abilities, daunting enemies, and Christian values, this is the game for you.

18,65903989,english,"Doom 2016 was a pretty damn killer game. It was also an extremely simple game. The combat required a lot of skill, but 95% of that skill was just moving around the level and dodging attacks. It didn't really matter what weapon you used, all of them would work against almost any demon. You still had some strategy, but for the most part you could make it through the mid-to-late game picking completely random weapons for each encounter and you would still make it out on top. Thinking back, that was one of my only real gripes with the game: When in a firefight, I would swap weapons on a complete whim with no real rhyme or reason as the player is given an overwhelming amount of firepower, so many different types of attacks that a few of them would always go completely unused or would be useless compared to other attacks. This ""no-brainer"" simplicity of combat was reflected in my middle-school era three word review of the game: ""PUNCH FUCKING EVERYTHING"".

Doom Eternal is like being pulled by the neck out of the mindless, comfy W+M1 combat of the previous game, shoved into a cold steel chair, and having a gallon of frigid water dumped onto you. This game's combat is like 2016's in appearance only, and whilst that turned a [i]hell of a lot of people[/i] off of the game I can't get enough of it.

Whereas Doom 2016 gave you the feeling of being a legendary warrior, Doom Eternal makes you fight for it. Eternal is the [i]Hypermagic Mountain[/i] of Doom games. Combat is an absolute knife's edge - right off the bat, you're given less than half the ammo pool you had in Doom 2016, and even basic enemy attacks damage for an immense amount. Any enemy past the basic fodder demons are tough to kill unless you use weapons that they specifically are weak to. You could chip away at that Revenant with your pulse rifle, sure, but that wastes precious time and ammo. Instead you could focus fire on disabling its rocket launchers with the combat shotgun's sticky grenades or the heavy cannon's charged bolt, then get in close with the super shotty and have it dispatched in just ten seconds. In this way combat becomes a puzzle in and of itself. You have weapons dedicated to replenishing your three resources: Shred demons with the chainsaw and they will drop ammo, Glory kill them with your Doomblade and they will drop health, Light them on fire with the flamethrower and they will drop armor. You will constantly be running out of these resources, so it becomes a challenge upon figuring out the very best time to use these. (Maybe not the chainsaw though)

Every weapon and ability has a specific usage as well: The dash ability that seems like it's just for platforming at first is mandatory to dodge attacks that in previous games you could simply strafe around. The rocket launcher's detonate mod which was completely useless in the previous game now has a very distinct purpose - getting behind the front-armored Pinky demon. It was used for this in Doom 2016, but now it's required; this game's Pinky has a MUCH TIGHTER turning radius and deals a LOT MORE DAMAGE. Use the heavy cannon's charged bolt (think sniper rifle shot) to snipe mounted weapons off of demons, forcing them to become melee only combatants. The plasma rifle's microwave beam may force you to slow down, but it stunlocks an enemy and guarantees a kill, making it perfect for cleaning up larger enemies after you've dealt with the smaller ones. But if you don't have the time to switch to a specific weapon or mod, don't fret- the frag grenade (a rarely-used weapon from the previous game) and the new ice bomb are always available no matter what weapon you have selected and are an [b]absolute godsend[/b] when you need some space to think up your next move. 

Doom 2016 may have had simple combat, but its levels were unforgiving. Secrets were so hard to find that I needed to look up the locations for half of them. The game had an obsession with locking you out of all previous parts of a level as soon as you entered a new room, so if you noticed an item you missed on the game's map you'd have to restart the entire 35+ minute mission to get it. With Doom Eternal this is rarely an issue. The levels are boxier and more clearly laid out. The secret items are more numerous and easier to find: you'll know when a secret is nearby and for almost every secret you just need to find the breakable wall that leads you to it (only needed a video tutorial for one item in the whole game, lol). The game has a more cartoonish and bright art style making enemies and pickups pop out, and inbetween fights there are platforming segments that give the levels a bit more variety, as well as allowing more interesting placement of secrets. Apparently many people hate the platforming segments. I couldn't disagree more, they're one of my favorite parts of the game - it's very clearly (with a... few exceptions) marked where and when you need to jump.

It's obvious this game will not click at all with specific types of people. You may have seen negative reviews complaining that the game forces you into a very specific playstyle with almost no room for deviation- use these specific weapon for this specific demon type, all other weapons won't be as effective. Let me tell you with complete certainty that this is [i]absolutely, undeniably, positively [b]TRUE.[/b][/i] And personally, I love it. I enjoy the game's super run-n'-gun puzzle combat gameplay, and the game is completely structured around stuff like ""jump and dash and lock-on burst that mancubus then quickly switch to your super shotgun and meathook that gargoyle to get across the arena so you can barely dodge the hell knight about to pounce on you then flame-belch the zombies around him, glory kill one of them for health and blow up the others with a frag for the armor they'll drop, then duck behind cover, charge up a destroyer blade shot, and shoot it down that hallway with those two carcasses and the half-health pinky I stuck a couple sticky bombs to thirty seconds ago, and all of this while running away from the marauder because the marauder kicks my ass every time and i want to save him for last because he SUCKS"". That was an overly detailed description of about twenty seconds of gameplay. Every single weapon I used in that wall of text I used for a very specific purpose. If I hadn't used each weapon for its given specific purpose it would not have been as effective. If this sounds like something you would enjoy or you loved Doom 2016 but thought its combat was too simplistic buy this game right now.

But all and all what I like the most about this game is that (as previously said) where Doom 2016 simply gave you the feeling of being a legendary warrior, Doom Eternal makes you fight for it. You will likely stagger at the start from the unforgiving nature of the combat (I was playing on Ultra-Violence first playthrough if you were wondering), but when you figure out what the hell you're doing and you get REALLY good at the combat loop, you really [i]feel[/i] like the god damn Doom Slayer. Seriously- the final boss fight is one of biblical proportions and by the end I sure as hell felt like a legendary warrior for the shit I just trudged through. Basically, it's a good game.

22,72404072,english,"A worthy successor to DOOM 2016 that made the reboot possible.
Doom slayer is back with a never ending thirst for vengeance against those unlucky enough to deserve it. 

Hell wasn't just on Mars it was also waging a full scale takeover of Earth, luckily you won't let them have it. Between games the Slayer has been busy building up his own resources for when he will have to stop the demons once again. You now own the fortress of doom, a relic of a long lost era when the Knight Sentinels once ruled. Strike out from your base against those who would want to see humanity fall. However your actions aren't going unnoticed... 

For those that smugly said DOOM 2016 was too easy well id listened and you're going to regret it. Combat against the forces of hell is more brutal and bloodier than before and you will need every advantage you have to make it out on top. Retaining your movement options from the last game, you unlock even more ways to traverse the arenas. The dash ability at first seeming to be an optional move is quickly learned to be necessary. Quickly engaging and just as quickly moving back to relative safety is a skill you will need to hone. Doom Slayer now makes use of monkey bars as well to launch himself to higher areas of arenas and to get a drop on his foes. However none seem to compare to the ""meathook"" the grappling hook launched from the underside of your trusty super shotgun allows you to do both, move quickly like your dash and gain elevation like the monkey bars. All the while you can still dispense brutality to the unfortunate demon at the end of your hook. 

The demons of hell are back and more fearsome than ever. They're faster, stronger and much smarter this time around. Instead of seemingly running around doing their own thing they will work in tandem to try and bring you down. Hell knights are much more aggressive than last time, able to run you down if you simply try to back pedal. Even mancubi have new tricks up their guns with more movement options at their disposal with faster firing cannons that deal out hefty damage. New enemies like the prowler will phase in and out of reality to do hit and run attacks on unwary Slayers. 

This comes with an all new damage mesh system. As you face them down with equal brutality, demons will begin falling apart. Large open wounds and exposed flesh, bones, and blood will appear on them as they sustain more and more damage. 
We also can't forget about the new glory kills. Along with those we've seen, there are also a lot of knew ones involving the Slayers new arm mounted blade that let you pull off quick yet brutally efficient glory kills.

Now let's talk about music. Mick Gordon has outdone himself and has been allowed to fully embrace the heavy metal riffs and guitar that those were so wary of in the first game. The combat music soundscape for each level inspires a feeling of visceral need to keep going against all odds like ""rip and tear"" did when we first heard it.

In short the game is harder, stronger, faster and better than ever. To see what id could possibly create to top this seems impossible.",1594345790,1594345790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045778100,173,45,1855,0,1796,1594368931,,

Now to answer to people, who complain about new stuff/content, (majority of them are trolls, who play like noobs and casuals. Dumb guys, who hate the game without any arguments) and people, who planning to buy/play it. (Again these answers are made based on comments that i read online and in steam) :

For people, who think flame belch, dash ability and other devices/tools were bad idea....Guys, really, stop being noobies/suckers, open your eyes already). 

1) Dash has been added specifically to evade some fast and heavy attacks (which a lot of demons use against you). Instead they removed crouching, as Marty Stratton said, cause no one used it and had no advantage whatsoever....They only evolve the game and give you more choices like dash in this case, to evade some attacks, or maybe use it during the fight to attack quicker.

2) Why the hell would you complain to id company and write this shit in review on steam about it? Flame belch and Freezing grenade is also, just additional tools, to make life easier in Doom eternal, cause once again....ENEMIES ARE WAY FASTER AND STRONGER than in other Doom games. And yes....the grenade was already present since Doom 3 and was present in Doom 2016. All they did is installed it to the canon on your shoulder. So i don't get the idiots, who say ""grenades are new tools and make fight more complicated and less fun"" And no one forces you to use grenades or tools, but i doubt that these guys will survive long on Ultra Nightmare difficulty...Another point in shit story, where haters hate the game and tools in it, without logical argument

3) Doom Guy/Doom Slayer runs with same speed as in 2016, so quite bullshiting about him being slow. Even more, you have perk to boost your speed significantly after a glory kill, another point to the bullshit story of him being slow....

4) People complain about many tools, buttons to press during fight? Well what do you expect from a shooter in 2020?
If you still wanna play casual shooting game...Where you keep on just running and shooting/hiding and shooting behind the wall like in old days, with no additional buttons to learn....this game won't satisfy you. Go back to the old Doom games and stop stinking around. Casuals aren't welcome here!

5) People say items/ammo look more like in 1993 Doom games and drawn-like, or graphics are too bright like in arcade game. Well that is exactly what designers wanted to give us. So old fans of Doom would enjoy game in nowadays, more familiar to them....AND STILL, if you don't like it, there is always an option to change it how you like it more. Nowadays with new patches you can change graphics around as you wish: arcade like, gritty and more similar to Doom 2016 game, scenario mode, dark like in Doom 3 atmosphere (many haters kept complaining that Doom needs ""this ATMOSPHERE OF DARKNESS""...in a fkn shooter....), even graphics like in Doom 2 for old fans. Choose anything what is optimal for you!

6) Doom haters keep talking about Doom 2016 and Doom 3 with their dark ""atmosphere"" and Doom Eternal ain't have it. Both of this games (Doom 3, Doom 2016) had only 3 or 4 colours max, which where used in any room and every surrounding if you look closely. If THIS is what you call ""DARK ATMOSPHERE"", well then I won't comment on how boring this shit is. Hence why 60% of all players after clearing Doom 3/Doom 2016, leave it and won't return. Or if they do, once a year... DARK Atmosphere in a fkn shooter, which had none of this bullshit for 25 years. When person sits to play Doom, he sits to RIP and TEAR until it is done! Not to have delusional dark atmosphere.... 

7) So if you are new player in the series of Doom, before listening to the bullshit of dumbass noobs and haters, (who are complaining about game without any sort of logic), play the game yourself and then make a decision. They call themselves 25 year-fans of Doom series and keep criticising best Doom yet so far...But they ain't got brain to see basic things and logic why new things are added/Doom have changed to good side. Don't listen to them and play the game :)


ID really worked well on it, many things from Doom 2016 (which was also an excellent game in its time) was taken too, some new were added.
Doom eternal is 1 of the best games I played so far. If you are a fan of all Doom series, like me, this game is worthy of your time. Doom 2016 was a game of the year 2016, sure this one will be game of the year 2020 :)

As a disclaimer, I've been playing on Ultra-Violence; I understand some of the problems with the game aren't quite as bad on lower difficulties. The combat lacks all the satisfaction of its predecessor; the game seems to be taking itself too seriously, even the music (which as a standalone is as awesome as in 2016) just doesn't fit the ambiance properly. The sceneries are gorgeous, but they feel like they don't make any sense. The glory kills feel like exactly the kind of annoyance we expected 2016's to be; somehow, 2016 avoided that, but something about Eternal's breaks that. You no longer have a fallback weapon; instead of an interesting tactical option, the chainsaw becomes your last resort of getting any damage at all. The melee attack is completely worthless against anything but staggered opponents - even the most basic zombies can shrug of dozens of hits (I gave up after twenty hits or so).

Level design seems to be a bit schizophrenic. Wide open spaces with lots of pickups and no monsters (maybe a few zombies); tight spaces with no/few pickups and lots of monsters, making you backtrack once in a while to get ammo (except when a magical barrier appears to stop you from backtracking). A lot of jump and dash action, but it kind of fell flat; and is further hindered by many invisible walls to boot.

The worst thing is, when you add it all together... in my two and a half hours of gameplay, I never once felt the rush or joy of playing Doom 2016. It all felt like a tedious slog. For bonus points, often interrupted with annoying popups trying to tell you how to play the game. It's obvious a lot of hard work went into the game.

 - Since when is Doom a 3D platformer? The swing bars, wall climbing, and jumps you can easily fail- why? Doom 2016 had its platforming moments, but not in the first hour of game play, and not as what appears to be a continuing theme.

 - Run out of ammo? Well that's ok cause demons have an unlimited supply! Whip out the chainsaw, cut up a demon, and you're good to go. Just something about this really breaks the immersion for me. I think making it a primary mechanic was a mistake. The veritable confetti of ammo spewing out of your latest victim used to have a sort of satisfaction to it. Now it just kind of empty. Seems to me like the easy way out to actually plotting out where ammo dumps should be. Also, I just miss the pistol.

 - *** spoilers *** Story Progression: 2016 was really great at telling its story, and if things were left unsaid it was done in such a way that it made sense. Now we're just dropped in a part of the moon orbiting earth, and we're just supposed to accept that he made it out of hell without any explanation? Also, Vega is alive, online, or whatever? It's a very jarring transition from the end of 2016 in my opinion, and it makes the other elements introduced at the end of the first mission even more confusing, which, again, breaks the immersion.

 - Enemy Progression: I took the note about low health being common in the early stages of ""Hurt me plenty"" with a grain of salt, but was not prepared to be facing enemies akin to what you'd see probably halfway through 2016 in the first hour of the game. I also don't like the fact that you end up having to get an upgrade to punch your way through the waves of the weakest enemies.

I'll keep at it, and maybe I'll change my tune farther down the line, but those are my thoughts.

TL;DR Not what I expected, and a very abrupt change from Doom 2016. It feels like something that would have been brilliant as its own standalone game.",1594329661,1594329661,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042872461,137,1,161,0,161,1594326153,,

some of the puzzle challenges weren't really fun, and were quite aggrevating. (I don't mind dying in combat here and there, but spending a hour dying the same way on a jumping platform puzzle makes me put a game down for a couple days at least).

the combat is a lot of fun, took me a while to get a hang of it (couple hours of solid play). but the puzzles took away from a lot of that for me personally. I play exclusively with a keyboard and mouse, haven't had a chance to try with an xbox controller or anything.

in 4K the game looks better than great. can easily get solid 60+fps ultra settings on a RTX 2070 Super

What is DOOM Eternal?:

DOOM Eternal is an arena FPS Game which was originally created in 1993. DOOM Eternal is the recreation of the original series and it holds itself extremely good. In this game you have to kill Demons throughou the way to get into the finish line. It sounds like it's a basic combat game but no. It's more then that.

The Combat:

In DOOM Eternal there are multiple Demons which you can encounter with. At first the game introduces you to the simple and basic Demons like the Possessed. The Combat gets harder when you meet the Arachnotron. The tutorial tells you everything about the Demons and it's weaknesses and it's useful. the Arachnotron has it's turret and it deals some major damage. At first you can ignore the tips from the Tutorial but after a while you realise that the Arachnotron's turret is annoying as hell and it has to be gone! So you use the sticky bomb launcher or the scope on the Heavy cannon and destroy it. I've never seen such a game teaching you even after the tutorial and it feels awesome. this game and it's Demons are frustrating but in a good way because it's frustarting you but after you die you keep want to try again and again until you ripped them apart. This feeling is awesome and not much game has this feeling. The Combat mechanics change everytime you meet a new Demon and after you receive a new gun. With every new gun you create new strategies to kill the enemy easier and easier but everything changes after you meet the Heavier and stronger Demons like the DOOM Hunter, Marauder and the Baron of Hell. You realise that you have to CATEGORIES the enemy. Which one should you kill at first. Which one should you leave for the last and more.  This well built up combat gives an extremely hyped push into the Combat. Analysing the Battle is one of the most important things to do because you have to understand what you're about to encounter with. The small Demons are good for ammo supplies and the bigger ones are the threat to you. This means that you have to aim for the bigger Demons first and if you're running out of ammo then you simply have to use your chainsaw to kill one of the smaller Demon. You can also save your chainsaw fuel to kill a bigger Demon but there for you have to be more experienced in the game. If you really want to kill a bigger Demon then you have to create strategies to save your ammo. The different Demons with different strategies require the categorisation in order to finish them all. Simply running into the horde will only kill you and it won't do much however, if you analyse the horde first then hunt it down then it means that you understand what the game wants you to do. Personally my favourite Demon is the Marauder because of it's combat style. It may look simple but it's complicated and hard. You have to understand the thinking of the Marauder in order to beat him. You have to analyse when he's about to come at you and attack and when he's about to put out his shield. I've seen and heared that a lot of people are complaining about him because he's imune the BGF, he's blocking every shot and that he's slowing down the combat. I don't hate these people. Everyone has it's opinion but I think that they're wrong. For example they're complaining about the dog he's sending out. Well the problem is that he only sends it out when you hit his shield or when you miss him. The dog is a punishment for your failure and I think it's a great punishment for the player. It makes the player constantly learn to be more careful about his/her combat style. It can be brutal but at the same time you should be more careful. This gives DOOM Eternal a meaning that you can't just shoot everything until it dies. You have to think about a strategy to encounter your enemy with and it makes the game so much greater. All of the combat encounters have it's hype to give you the feeling that you're the real DOOM Slayer and you want to RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT'S DONE. No matter how much time you die, after the Combat you'll still going to feel like a god.

The Story:

DOOM Eternal has a rich story. The Game tells us a continued version of the original ark when the Slayer sacrificed himself by going to hell to save earth. DOOM Eternal tells us what happened to the Slayer after that, How did he meet the Sentinals, How did he become a Sentinal and how did he become a Demi God. The Slayer fought against Hell's forces  to save earth but after a while he was worn off and he was found by the Sentinals. He was sent into an arena where the Sentinals realized that he has an extremely big potential in him as a fighter so he became on of their soldiers. He was trained by the Sentinals for a while but in the mean time the Sentinals (Khan Maykr side) made a deal with Hell to create a new energy. They combined Hell and Sentinal energy and creater Argent Energy. This kind of energy opened new opportunites in front of the Khan Maykr to save her world. In exchange for she destroyed and killed other planets and civilizations. This time a Sentinal didn't like this this idea and granted the Slayer a gift. He gave him power to fight the Hell's and the Sentinals forces in order to save the worlds and that's where our story begins in DOOM (2016) and continues with DOOM Eternal. Overall I love the story of DOOM and the new DLC will answer new questions and probably will create new questions aswell.

The Scenery, Graphics and coloring:

DOOM Eternal has some BEAUTIFUL Graphics. The details and the maps are extremely detailed and great that sometimes you have to stop for a second and look around how it looks. The Scenery is one of the best part of this game because they're so beautiful and awesome that you have to experience it for yourself to really agree with this. Nekravol and Taras Nabad it's Scenery are just so great. I can't describe this category with more words, it speaks fot itself.

The Multiplayer:

The Battlemode is a gamemode which I don't know a lot about. I mostly played DOOM Eternal in singleplayer mode and I didn't really play in mutliplayer. All I have to say that it's completely different than the Campaign mode. New Rules, new Strategies, new Maps. Everything changes drastically. I recommend to watch tutorial videos about the multiplayer because it's so different from the Campaign that you may even think that it's not the same game. It's hard. It's hard if you don't know anything about it. The tutorial teaches you the controls and the powers of the Demon but not much about the Strategies. In the multiplayer you can choose from two sides. The Slayer or the Demons. The Slayer has to encounter two heavy Demons in an arena. As the Slayer, you have to use ALL of your experiences of the game in order to have a little chance. For the people who are relying on they're Super Shotgun. You'll loose. You will definitly loose if you'll only rely on close combat. In the Battlemode you have to work from the range. You have to use your advances in Range combat to have a bigger chance. A lot of Demons underestimate the Slayer because they're not thinking about the Slayers Range possibilities. This may give you a bigger chance of winning. On the Demon side I recommend to play with a friend. You should use the Voice chat in order to stay informed with your teammate and to understand each other better.

Last words:

Overall I love this game. It's a MASTERPIECE and it deserves more attention. If you don't like it it's okay. It's simply not your style. It's not wrong or bad to not liking something. It's completely okay but you can't change my mind. DOOM Eternal is the greatest game of 2020 and I won't stop playing it for a while.

85,72384757,english,"Doom 2016 was truly a return to formula, and for me Eternal went away from that formula a bit

I don't really like any of the combat mechanics they added. I feel like the protagonist was weakened in order to push them. I'm certain that they especially increased enemy damage in order to support the new ""extra life"" mechanic. I mean I'm supposed to be a badass slayer yet death can become a regular part of combat, I only actually died a couple times on the normal difficulty and finished the game with over 20 of them, but still they should have just omitted it entirely and had the player focus on health and armor Instead of nerfing the protagonist to add it. I think the contributing factors to this is all of the other combat options they give you. The flame belch, the ice bomb the crucible, everything probably contributed to a overall feeling of being weaker, and they didin't all gel together in combat for me at all - especially considering that 2016 Doom stood out on simplicity. Ammo also just felt horribly nerfed. I get that I needed to upgrade it but I felt like did this to really push the chainsaw. In 2016 Doom, I was using it so I could get back to the weapons I liked the most, rather than desperately going around looking for an enemy that requires one fuel bar so I could continue fighting - even in a ton of boss fights which was super immersion breaking. I felt like I[i] needed [/i]to upgrade whereas before I felt like it just made me even stronger - mind you, playing on the same difficult across both games.

Boss fights took a huge hit as well for me. I've never seen a game give you nothing but a boss, a giant health bar, yourself and say ""good luck"", which is what 2016 Doom did. In this game, every boss and even new enemy came with a tutorial which took me away from the gameplay big time. Some of the bosses had a huge ""wait to attack"" base, which is something I never thought they would add, and it's not what I looked forward to.

All of my complaints stem from comparison with the 2016 Doom though. This is a fantastic game and the soundtrack is 10/10, it is easily worth the $30 I paid for it.",1594321688,1594321688,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,76561198086463690,378,47,718,0,718,1594260226,,

In addition to more movement options, the customization introduced in DOOM (2016) has been further expanded upon to reward combat prowess and exploration to earn character advancements. The new platforming added in DOOM Eternal feels a bit clunky, but it is a step in the right direction in expanding the complexity of level design.

combat: beautiful, gorgeous, smecksy, you have a large assortment of guns including but not limited to 
1. the combat shotgun. 
2. the SUPER SHOTGUN, a glorious beast that is capable of converting most if not all demons to liquid. it also has the meathook a hook that connects to a demon and reduces the DOOM SLAYERS distance to the target to 0 which as you can assume causes (as far as i know) any basic demon to become a liquid version of what it was. 
3. the heavy cannon, is the assault rifle from the previous game but slightly cooler.
4. the rocket launcher, boom, that is all.
the enemies are challenging but fair. the demons often have weaknesses such as a weakness to a type of gun or a weak spot.
environment: fabulous, the environments include cold surface dungeon, hot earth ruins.

Not a FPS fan? - This game will make you one

I have played and finished all the DOOM games and somehow this became my top DOOM game. This game has the fast adrenaline filled action from 1, 2 or 2016 mixed with the slower more thought out approach in DOOM 64. The fast faced action does not get tiring because of the platforming sections in the middle. I was at first very skeptical about this, but damn did they pull it off! The graphics is one of the best in gaming till date. The environment  and the some of the set pieces are purely mind blowing. This game is on my top list along with the likes of Dark Souls, Zelda and CS:GO. So whatever your preferred genre is give this one a try.

Well that's completely out the window with this game. You are basically forced to use certain weapons and attachments for certain situations, which completely takes the fun out of it. Also add the fact the you are constantly running out of ammo and the only way to replenish it is to use the chainsaw. The player shouldn't be forced to play the game in the hyper-specific way the way the developers want them to. For example, tossing a grenade down a Cacodemon's throat is by far the most efficient way of killing it, and there isn't any reason to not do it that way. It's pretty cool the first few times, but it gets old really fast when it's the only way to do it. There's layer upon layer of annoying gameplay mechanics, which is completely opposite it's predecessor's relatively pure FPS experience.  

There are a lot of goofy and totally out of place platforming segments that look straight out of Super Mario Bros., spinning fireball traps and all. I actually laughed out loud when I first came across one. The artstyle has been changed as well, to a more bright and cartoony style instead of the more gritty style of the previous game. Enemies look silly and unimposing.

Doom 2016 is one of my favorite FPS campaigns of all time alongside TItanfall 2, but this one just ain't it, chief. I totally get what they were trying to do, and I can understand why some people may like it, but it's just not what I come to Doom for.

Christ on a cream cracker is this game incredible.

This is a perfect sequel because it builds on what was good about the last game. The blood-soaked no-nonsense Doomguy is back again with a simple goal: stop demons doing demon-related things to Earth. In a world filled with games trying to have the most complex story ever, it's nice to return to simpler times.

Like I said, Doom Eternal builds on the best parts of the last game; the weapons have more grunt, the glory kills are even more gloriously violent and there are now twice as many enemy types to blow the brains out of. The rune system has also been streamlined, shooting is as tight as ever, even bigger levels means there are hundreds of collectables and the suit upgrade system has also had a bit of a revamp.

One thing this game does better than its predecessor is being utterly bonkers and bananas. Not in a wacky LOL RANDOM sort of way, more because sometimes there will be so many things going on at once you will have no clue what you're shooting at. In many games this would be extremely frustrating, but because of the perfect balance between getting a bit beaten up and health-drops from enemies you never feel like you're going to die; it's more like you've entered a red mist in which you don't know what you're shooting at, only that it needs to be shot at until it stops existing. It's exceptionally fun.

Of course, no DOOM game would be complete without a killer soundtrack, and the bassy metal perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere. Every so often you'll perform a glory kill perfectly in time with a power chord and those are the moments you'll truly understand what bliss feels like.

NOTE: This review was originally negative due to the implementation of Denuvo software which has since been removed, I have kept my original review at the bottom of this for anyone who sees this review in later months and wonders why my opinion changed on it.

DOOM Eternal is a fantastic game. The core gameplay mechanic is simple: Kill demons. But this simplicity is not a bad thing. The mechanic is not only cathartic, but extremely well polished. With abilities such as the double jump and dash, the player is able to navigate the arenas with ease, gliding around and decimating hordes of enemies. I have seen comparisons (both positive and negative) with this feature to DOOM 2016 - I haven't played that game but am looking to do so, and I'll update this section once I have played it enough to be able to make a comparison.

This gunplay alone is not what makes playing this game the experience that it is though. Full credit has to go to Mick Gordon and the sound team on Eternal, as the pulsating soundtrack drives the player forward through each encounter, so that - even if you are as terrible at the game as I am, wildly misfiring every gun at any enemy in sight, not noticing the summoner demons - you feel like you are good at the game.

The only major drawback to this game is, in my opinion, the tutorials. The issue for me was that they broke the pace of the gameplay up a little too much, such as at the start of boss fights, when the bosses weakness is given to you. Looking back at this having just plugged 80 or so hours into Dark Souls III, this feels like the wrong way of approaching boss fights for me. Even though the DOOM Slayer is a powerful being, having the bosses weaknesses laid bare before a shot was fired made the game seem a little too simple for me. That said, it is possible to turn this off in the options, a setting which I personally found has made the boss fights a little more challenging (which I prefer), and has retained the pace of the game far better than with the tutorials on.

In conclusion? DOOM Eternal is a very good game. In a year where everything seems to be spiralling out of control globally, it's nice to play a good quality game with a great sense of catharsis. As weird as it sounds, DOOM Eternal is one of the most calming games I have played.

Please don't put Denuvo back into the game though, writing this positive review took a while.


My original review:
It genuinely saddens me that I have to leave a negative review for this game, because it is very well put together. It's incredibly satisfying, the combat is fun, it looks beautiful, and the music is still top notch.

So why am I leaving a negative review?

As many of the other recent reviews explain, in the past week a new anti-cheat software has been shoehorned into the game post-launch, after many players (including myself) have played past the 2 hour limit Steam sets for a refund. This anti-cheat software has access to a very secure level of a computer, and is touted by its own company for its invisibility when running. This software is [b] required [/b] to play DOOM. This means that at the moment, the game remains uninstalled in my library, until I can either get a refund, Bethesda/id Software changes their policy, or I remove the game from my account at my own cost to hide the shame of being mugged off to the value of £37.

It’s a joy to play and I’m really grateful for the development team's hard work! They really made something to be proud of, my hat is off to all of them! I’m still playing the game after 60 hours and that’s very special. I love it to bits basically. 🥰

+ absolutely gorgeous all the way through, great animations for enemies, runs very well on a 1070 in 1080p
+ great, pounding (sometimes a bit too pounding) soundtrack that provides momentum to the action
+ a fun take on the very dorky doom story with few (often humorous), skippable cutscenes with LOTS of lore if you’re into that
+ the fights are an absolute thrill, I came out literally sweating and cursing from some of them and shouting when I finally achieved victory
+ lots of fun weapons and movement skills to play around with
+ it’s actually difficult at times! Reminded me of Sekiro (but you have more possibilities to cheese in this game, but game can be played without the crutches BFG/Crucible, and to me that was more fun)
+ lots of item/suit/weapon upgrades and secrets give a fun sense of progression and add a break from the action
+ lots of fun enemy types that really become a challenge when bundled together
+ the slayer gates – really thrilling curated battle encounters locked behind secret keys
+ generally great, simple platforming that provides a fun break from the head-stomping
+ master levels
+ the promise of more master levels and story DLC, looking forward to all of it!

these are mostly small niggles, but some could be annoying:

- sometimes the music doesn’t let up even when you don’t have a battle encounter going, which made me stressed out and annoyed. I think this has been affecting other people as well who say they ‘feel exhausted’ after playing. I sometimes changed to other music because the came is really more chill than it wants to show 😊
- there are some bugs regarding achievements (some not popping, some popping without reason), I played this during launch so I hope they will be ironed out in time
- the controls for the few swimming portions are odd and Doomguy can’t keep his head above water. He needs swimming lessons asap, and he is very bad at exiting the water as well 😅
- some platforming moments are maybe not the most intuitive?
- some geometry issues with cragged ledges being unclimbable (except some are climbable or from some angles?), so sometimes you try climbing one and a demon gets your back 😆
- I do not enjoy the final boss. Your mileage may vary.

The game more challenging, haven't a problem with that. The graphics are more like a cartoon show, the Demons are not looking the same as at DooM 2016.

And that annoying jumping sequences almost at every mission, make a vastly negative impact on the game. Take strength from the hanging yellow stick to reach another area, I mean seriously, what are developers thinking really? It very sucks. Plus climbing the walls also tedious, the story is meh either. Demons invade the world and we follow their traces to kill three hell priests. It's not a deep, immersive narrative. Doom 2016 wasn't good too but at least it had presents much better gameplay.

DOOM Eternal knows when to tell, when to show, when to let you act, feel and that's what makes it so interesting. There's a tremendous amount of effort put into the story and I like how the game encourages the player to collect all the extra info and read into it. Shooters were essentially the first games I got into when I was younger and I've played a lot of them. I still remember all the boring shooter games I've played in which everyone knows that the story is bad but the game still forces you to sit through it until you get to the action... DOOM is nothing like that. It is constant adrenaline that never feels the same.

The gameplay got upgraded. There's now actual platforming in the game and it's fairly challenging at times. In addition to that, there's upgrades for everything, collectibles, little easter eggs hidden across the map, secret encounters, upgrades in the base... a lot. I honestly can't think of anything that could have been added to this game - all you can think of is here and it creates fantastic balance between the action, exploration and extra things. The action itself is great, very fast-paced.

89,72339272,english,"As a guy with little money and a crummy rig, it seemed irresponsible of me to buy Doom Eternal the second it arrived on Steam. Since purchasing the sequel to the excellent 2016 Doom reboot of the franchise, I have had nothing but a big, sinister, blood-drenched smile on my face. I can safely say that this purchase, as quick as it was, was not a waste of my money. Doom Eternal has earned a spot in my heart as one of the best games I've played this year. For all those stuck inside during these uncertain and trying times, consider this an adrenaline coated release for all your woes and strife.

Doom Eternal takes place some time after the events of Doom 2016. The Doom Guy has reappeared after the demons that plagued Mars last time have now invaded the Earth, nearly destroying the planet. With the human race on the brink of extinction and no one seemingly capable of stopping them, it's up to you to take the fight to the horde. You have only one strategy: Rip and Tear!

Game play, like in the previous instalment, is the core of the experience. One of the main complaints about Doom 2016 was that, once you had the Super Shotgun, you could almost ignore the other weapons. In Doom Eternal, it's made clear that to survive this slaughter house, you need to use EVERYTHING. All guns have unique effects on demons and their weak points. New tools allow new benefits during game play. The chain saw gives you ammo, the glory kills give you health, and the flame belch is the latest addition that gives you armour, rounding out the survival trifecta. All of the weapons are satisfying and useful, no longer relegating the responsibility of damage to just one weapon of carnage. I was gleefully swapping from the Rocket Launcher to the Machine gun to the Shotgun the whole way through. And believe me when I say the carnage was oh so satisfactory. It was fast paced but also strategic, allowing me to feel like a crafty gun man, and not just a tanky one. Like a metal version of John Wick.

The story is another matter. By no means bad, not by video game standards at least, it is a lurch for the franchise from 2016. Before, 2016 kept its story simple with hints of greater ambitions. Here, the story absolutely drowns you in a cinematic universe's worth of lore and history. The Makers of Urdak, the Khan Maykr, the Night Sentinels; I was lost on a lot of these places and people and had to check the glossary a lot. It's not a bad thing to have a story with lots of lore, but Doom Eternal still tries to hug the tight rope between a story buffet, with elaborate cut scenes and narrative-based levels, while still trying to keep it vague and ""unobtrusive to the game play."" In the end, it just comes off as bloated fluff that doesn't add to the game's experience. It does have moments of pure cheesy, metal, He Man-esque joviality and carefree humour which makes it a joy to sit through. Surprisingly, the best character is often the man who never says a word.

Consumer-level complaints: Some things that members outside of gaming news and the Doom community should know. 1: The Marauder and the Tentacle enemies are considered pretty controversial. The Marauder is often called  one of the worst enemies in the game because he interrupts the flow of combat by constantly blocking the player. The tentacle is a jump scare enemy that surprises you and is often too quick. The slimy critter will take some health from you before you kill it by poking you. 2: Bethesda recently added the Denuvo anti-cheat system to the game. This particular system interfered with the performance of the game and is also highly intrusive to player systems due to its kernel-level driver. It has since been removed, due to player backlash. However, I advise people be aware of Bethesda's actions because the company might try to do something like this again.

But don't waste time. Get this game if you can. Raise hell in the best way possible! And afterwards, get Animal Crossing next.",1594265449,1594265449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198090894680,107,6,4287,78,3192,1601007612,,

Audio: ✅ Mick Gordon did it again it's sad that this was his last work apparently cause of some issues with Bethesda but hopefully we will get someone as good as him or better.

Bugs: ✅ I haven't experienced a single bug so far but i've seen videos out there with a few minor bugs.

28,72329324,english,"Takes the original game and refines it to near perfection. I found the game hard for the first couple of levels as I was playing it with the original game mindset and getting killed A LOT. You need to keep moving, keep topping up ammo, health and armour constantly, and I mean constantly. If you get carried away and let one of the 3 drop too low you're in a world of hurt.

The atmospherics of the game are different to the original too; I found the last game dark and brooding (and violent) whereas Eternal is more varied (and violent).

The weapons are well balanced and the mods are interesting and varied. The lower order weapons like the shotgun get relegated pretty quickly though and you find yourself using them primarily for the secondary mode which is OK I guess.

There is an overwhelming number of mods, suit upgrades, runes etc in this game which can be a bit too much to start with but eventually I loved it as you can really fine tune the Doom Slayer the way you want - obviously you want to max that out of course.

The storyline is about as compelling as the original - ie not much to get excited about - it doesn't get in the way of the game.

Graphically it's super slick, there are probably better looking games but everything is moving at 200mph so who cares. Maxed out graphics on a 3440x1440 ultra widescreen @ rock solid 60FPS. On a Nvidia GTX 1080 / Core i7-8700 laptop (last gen hardware). Cannot complain!

45,72321934,english,"I enjoyed my time with Doom Eternal a lot. I experienced countless moments when I win a battle by the skin of my teeth and, with just a few health points left, breathe a sigh of relief, let the adrenaline settle a bit and get ready for the next arena. Killing demons is a great fun and surprisingly never gets old or stale, due to huge variety of enemies and your arsenal. 
However, Doom Eternal is quite a different experience than Doom 2016. The new mechanics change the feel of the game rather drastically and not everybody might like it. I personally really enjoyed the fact that you get all your resources by killing enemies, even if some portions of your arsenal are a bit fiddly to use. Being able to recover from the brink of death during a fight really helps to keep the pace up, and you will never face a situation when after a fight you're low on health and ammo and have to backtrack to regain some before the next encounter.
I do however have several nitpicks. The way you get ammo and health now means that boss fight are no longer duels of equals. Instead, now bosses have their own entourage, which is fine if they are some lower demons but becomes problematic later on, when bosses fill half a screen and their minions include barons of hell and cybermancubuses. It really turns fights into a clusterfuck that is less of a desperate fight for survival and more a chore. If authors wanted to have a story, they should have told all the important parts in the cut scenes and not in the codex entries. The pick ups need rebalancing, as by the end I was able to unlock everything and still have weapon points and suit points available. The design of pick ups in general is not great, as bright, colorful icons don't fit with overall aesthetics of the game.

This is something that uses Doom 2016 as a reference only. There is less feel of sci-fi horror. The art style is too bright, too comic bookish/cartoony. The fights are not about raw brutality. Extra lives are a thing to collect and fight difficulty even at Hurt Me Plenty is tuned to make you use them, Glory Kills are now something you must do if you want to keep your health up, chainsaw kills are required to gain ammo due to extreme ammo scarcity for even the basic weapons, switching weapon types to match monster 'weaknesses' is required to not run out of ammo trying to just gun them down, and worst of all (imo) is the introduction of a monster type that requires fighting at a specific range and timing your attacks as counter attacks. I'm sure some people will enjoy the new feel of the fights and the new art style, but it isn't for me. As I approach the end of the single player game I find the fights more frustrating than fun.

The in your face grind to a halt tutorials all the time are annoying, mostly unnecessary and just bad in the way they are done.

The game shines in the gameplay.  It's fast and it's incredibly intense.  

The levels are broken into transition areas full of somewhat mediocre platforming though great looking areas and demon full arenas that are balls to the wall crazy fun.

The most vicious enemy in the game is the limited amount of ammo you can carry.  It forces you to swap guns and use the wide, maybe to wide a variety of skills for the pace, to gain back health, armor, and ammo.  

Overall the game performs incredibly well and is a blast to play even if it seems a bit silly Metalocalypse at times instead of the more serious Doom 2016.

Final boss: Actually difficult this time same with the other bosses.

More difficult: adding to the fact that the Slayer gets stronger and stronger the more demons he kills, you fight way more demons at once and most are heavies or medium demons. By the end game you're decimating several powerful demons at once. (beautiful game design here)

While the graphics, animations, and gameplay are amazing, technical problems and some game design issues hold [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] back from achieving its full potential.


[h1]Pros[/h1] 
[list]
[*]Incredible action that is a test of your reflexes and simultaneous knowledge of the game's weapons, enemies, and environments. These elements are balanced nearly perfectly, creating a mix that is dynamic, challenging, and rewarding.
[*]Great production values. It's made with love and seemingly infinite appreciation for its source material. At the same time, it never takes itself too seriously.
[*]Graphically superior and very well optimized in terms of graphical performance for the PC.
[*]Actually a pretty decent multiplayer mode that gets the jitters and adrenaline pumping, partly on account of the high skill gap. You're going to get pwned *a lot* in this mode, but don't give up!
[/list]
[h1]Cons[/h1] 
[list]
[*]Several bugs, design oversights, and crashes remain. I had crashes while taking screenshots in some areas: ""Application has been blocked from accessing graphics hardware"" error. I've even had a bug where the final enemy in a room was indestructible. The worst of them all is a common bug on both PC and console versions that causes the game to crash after completing Slayer Gates in Mission Select mode, causing you to lose all level progress and preventing you from obtaining the Empyrean Keys needed for the game's secret weapon. In this vein, if you crash at any point while in Mission Select mode, you will have to restart from the beginning of the level. Also, the Battlemode tutorials are unskippable. If you initiate one by accident, you'll be forced to play through it, or force quit the game!
[/list]
[h1]Summary[/h1] 

This cheesy arena shooter is keenly self-aware and builds on practically all aspects of the series while introducing a gamut of its own ideas. The single-player campaign is especially strong, but the well balanced and nuanced gameplay overall kept me wanting to improve my skills and take on other aspects of the game beyond the campaign. Some poor design and technical problems make the game feel slightly unfinished, as though it needed just a bit more time in the cooker to bring everything together. This is unfortunate because in many ways [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is something special. It's just not quite as a good as it could have been.

        [td][b]Story[/b][/td]
	[td]4/10[/td]
	[td]One of the silliest stories I've experienced in recent memory, but at least they make an effort to own up to the source material and do what they can. It must be hard making a narative out of something with such an absurd plot to begin with! The lore does a decent enough job for players interested in learning more about the game world, although I felt that the setting of earth was way underutilized.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]
	[td]9/10[/td]
	[td]Top notch and masterfully balanced action with a high skill gap. It's easy to learn, difficult to master, and rewarding the whole way, but it can be frustrating. The platforming is only good when it is woven into the fighting sequences. The pure platforming sequences are tedious and hurt the game's pace overall. The scripted cinematic sequences that take place duiring the campaign while manning turrets and vehicles, using certain objects, etc., are entertaining to watch, but I would have preferred to have control of the input in these cases.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Graphics[/b][/td]
	[td]9/10[/td]
	[td]Amazing enemy models, animations, gore, glory kills, weapons, loot effects, etc. Great customization options. It's really state of the art in this regard. The environments are beautiful, but I wish they were more interactive in some cases. The wonderfully macabre environments would come to life even more if they were destructible![/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Sound production[/b][/td]
	[td]9/10[/td]
	[td]Incredible sound quality, effects, and OST in so many ways. Great customizability too.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Difficulty[/b][/td]
	[td]8/10[/td]
	[td]The fights can be extremely challenging, especially while you're getting used to all the different tools at your disposal and the intricacies of the various enemies you'll encounter. The game has a hardcore permadeath mode if you're up for it. In other areas, the game is quite forgiving though. Having all collectibles and most secrets detailed in the dossier/map seems to defeat the purpose of a treasure hunt, making this aspect of the game feel more like a compulsive chore than an actual accomplishment.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Multiplayer[/b][/td]
	[td]6/10[/td]
	[td]The multiplayer takes some getting used to, but I came to enjoy it quite a bit. Matches can be super intense, and there is a high skill gap. It's brought down by a clunky UI, both during matches and in menus. It also takes far too long to get into matches by modern standards, and the map rotation is almost always interrupted because someone leaves the lobby, and if someone leaves during a match, it's game over essentially--couldn't they have figured something out to avoid these issues?[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Replay value[/b][/td]
	[td]8/10[/td]
	[td]There are so many ways you can add variety to this game, whether it's playing through the campaign on harder difficulty levels, finding collectibles, applying one of the many cheat codes that create fun modifiers, or delving into the multiplayer. The home base is a nice addition but it feels a bit bland, not to mention slightly out of place for the single-player campaign. It would be nice if there were some NPCs and/or more things to do there. Why isn't this a place I'm able to hang out and explore while looking for a multiplayer match?[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][b]Overall value for asking price ($60)[/b][/td]
	[td]8/10[/td]
	[td]This a state of the art game in many ways and is probably the best one in the arena shooter genre right now. There is a lot of high quality content.[/td]

I'm exhausted -- seriously. This feels like less like mindless carnage and more like dance-dance-revolution with guns. Disappointed that Id is taking this game in a different direction, but I think this was more of a passing the torch kinda game for me -- kinda like the new Star Wars series for the younger generation.

I don't recommend this game for die-hard doom fans that are all about the freedom to wreak carnage the way you want. This game literally tells you the EXACT way to kill a demon, which seems like a step backwards in this game brand's philosophy.

That being said, this game is for a lot of people! A lot of people with a lot more, focus, mental-wit, and patience than me! I guess I just have a bit of buyer's remorse because in the 30 years that I've played DOOM games on a vary degree of difficulties, this has never been what it's about.

57,72269307,english,"Doom Eternal is a true evolution that builds upon everything from Doom 2016. This game is all killer no filler: levels are more interesting both aesthetically and layout-wise; lame weapons like the pistol and frag grenades are dropped in favor of more inspired weaponry like a Ballista and a shoulder-mounted grenade launcher/flame thrower; the battle chess is more strategic with various resources to manage and enemy prioritization to think about; the generic multiplayer is dropped in favor of a demons vs slayer 2v1 mode that actually plays to the game's strengths; even the story is better, providing a deeper, more interesting lore-rich narrative while still making it almost completely optional/avoidable if that's your thing.

I'm about halfway through at this point and my biggest gripe so far is the Marauder. Criticism around this enemy is all over the internet and while I see id's philosophy of wanting to make an enemy that would act as the Doom Slayer's equal - someone to really stress you out and give it your all - the inability to inflict damage on the enemy until he provides you with a window to counter, I believe, goes against all design pillars of this game, forcing you to essentially corner him and dance around him just *waiting* on HIM to make a move so you can hit him a couple times. I think the Marauder worked best in his first encounter as a sort of mini boss, perhaps one that should have returned throughout the campaign and acted as a rival for the Doom Slayer getting stronger with each encounter, instead of being a almost regular occurrence in the arenas.

Aside from my gripe with the Marauder, I definitely recommend this game as it stands. If you liked Doom 2016, you're going to like Doom Eternal; if you like the new Wolfenstein games, you're going to like Doom Eternal; and if you like meaty single-player first person shooters, then you're going to like Doom Eternal.

I didnt play DOOM 2016, but apparently people are upset that this is ever so slightly different. I think this game may only fit a few certain playstyles, as it is generally speaking, hellishly fast.

I bought this during the steam summer sale, for %50 off, at £24.99. I'd say it was worth it.

I haven't tried out battlemode, (the only multiplayer gamemode, 2 player demons vs 1 player slayer), but i think the devs/bethesda/id should add some sort of co-op or team deathmatch sort of thing. Again, i have not played 2016, but apparently there was a team deathmatch in that.

Even after all the main missions are completed, i've been going back to try and do everything %100. i may be alone here, but that doesnt get too boring. The cheat codes can be quite fun, too! Combinations of them can provide some... fascinating battle scenarios.

80,65850872,english,"Man where do I even start, imo this game is just bloody amazing.

Once again, Mick Gordon hands out eargasms with his headbangin' compositions. 11/10 OST.

Eternal's very different from Doom 2016 in many ways, with some negative but mostly positive. 
You can easily tell that this game was meant to be friendly to people new to the Doom franchise, from the sometimes jarring tutorial popups to the bright visuals. Doom Eternal is visually much more colorful, vs. the dark horror vibes of 2016. I personally preferred 2016's vibe much more though. This is also reflected in the UI, which was glaringly off-putting if you were to compare it to 2016.

The designs of the weapons, enemies, and levels were excellent. I found myself stopping and admiring certain areas of levels, the side of the ballista blade mod, and even tiny sections of a floor, sometimes for minutes at a time (Maybe due to my artistic disposition. I'll definitely be using some elements of this game as future references and inspiration).
The weapons are beautifully complex in terms of design, revamped from the previous Doom game. 
The already humanoid demons have been made to look much more ""human"", particularly their faces, which also added to the more colorful look of Eternal. The Baron does look much more badass though, now being infused with fire, revealed by the new gory gibbing system. You can remove massive chunks of your enemies flesh as you damage them. 
Now onto the levels themselves. Here you fight from the depths of Hell, the ravaged surface of Earth, the sci-fi facilities of Phobos, and to even the beautiful ruins of forgotten cities. The level designs are extremely diverse and just so impressive.
The world of Urdak was so awesome. Urdak's architecture reminds me of the orokin from Warframe, which is super cool. In some cases, it literally looked like I [i]was[/i] playing warframe, and inside of a Clan Dojo. 

The gameplay is what seems to have garnered the most complaints from other players. For a variety of reasons, I don't share the same opinions. 
Ammo is more scarce in Eternal. Your chainsaw, the main ammo source, needs to be used more often. Some people consider this a chore, but another change is that your chainsaw fuel regenerates, in addition to having many small fry to saw up. So I didn't mind this new ammo system at all. 
Another common complaint is about the marauder. Combat-wise he's a bit clunky but I don't understand the hate for him, he's not deathly hard nor is he extremely disruptive. Lore-wise he's super cool. Demonized sentinels man, super badass. 
Eternal also introduces a new climbing and dashing system, giving rise to more vertical level designs with many ""puzzles"", platforming, and parkour which I LOVE to death. Some people hated this but I say to hell with them. 
The relative difficulty of Eternal has increased considerably compared to 2016's due to the presence of more ranged enemies. This is where the dashing comes in, which also increases the already fast-pace of Doom. 
Not much to say about the glory kills. As visceral and violent as ever. Rip and Tear.

Finally, the story. I L O V E T H E L O R E. I couldn't wait to find each new codex page and finding out more about the Doom world. I'm just a casual so I can't really judge how well written the story is, but I can say that I enjoyed it way too much. The cut-scenes are now occasionally third-person to help push the narrative, which some people disliked because it took them away from the feeling of being the Slayer himself. Previously the Doom guy didn't really have a real established identity so it helped people immersive themselves as the Slayer. I was never one for self-insert so I didn't mind in the least. In fact, I prefer it this way because now I can admire the epic design of the praetor suit(s) during the cut-scenes lol.

To sum it up, I [i]love love love[/i] this game. I exclusively buy games at 50% off or more, but this was an exception. I bought at full price, no regrets.

84,69436696,english,"I played Doom Eternal on day 1 and loved it to death. However in the coming weeks Bethesda made the questionable decision to patch in Denuvo. This choice has thankfully been reversed, removing the terrible cloud floating above an otherwise excellent game. No offense to the dev team, the community would not respond so strongly about these things if we didn't care about your game. It's a real work of art and we want it to be the best it can be as well.

Okay so Doom Eternal is another fast paced game in the Doom series that has made a lot of changes to the Doom 2016 for better or worse. This game now has many new mechanics that increase Doom Guy's mobility including a dash and ability to stick to and jump off of climbable walls. These mechanics are fairly fun to execute in combat, and are also used in platforming sections that break up the action (These are fairly short and simple). 

Also introduced is a flame thrower to make enemies drop armor, a new melee attack that does high damage to enemies in front of the doom guy, 2 grenade types to aid in crowd control, and the chainsaw is now less of a weapon and more of an ability. The Gameplay loop is simple but the execution is fast paced and complex. Certain weapons hard counter certain enemies forcing weapon swapping. Ammo pools are at an all time low meaning that players much remember to take time to chainsaw enemies for ammo. Typically how things work: You shoot demons, chainsaw when available (unless you are saving 3 charges for a big boy) for ammo, flamethrower on cooldown for armor refills, and weave in grenades and blood punches when needed. If that sounds like a lot... It is... This game is fast paced and almost overwhelming with the amount of options you can and must take advantage of to succeed. Doom Eternal features many many upgrades for the Doom Guy, his suit, and most substantially his weapons that can greatly change how you tackle the demon hordes.

 You might be thinking... ""This sounds like a lot of fast paced thinking compared to Doom 2016"", you'd be correct. This is Doom Eternal's strength but also it's weakness. Making a fun fast and vicious game that also kind of loses some of the brutal simplicity of 2016. Make no mistake that Doom Eternal is a great game, but it has a lot of differences compared to 2016 and it is not everybody's cup of tea.

Okay now that the important gameplay stuff is out of the way... The visuals are top notch, everything looks and feels great, the world designers are masters of their craft, the audio folks are equally impressive, and the soundtrack is bangin. The story is somewhat crap, but it seems to accept and run with that fact, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, I appreciate the effort, but it's not why we are here.

tl:dr: One of the Best Action FPS in long time, it does have a different approach to combat than Doom 2016 though and this might turn a few people off.",1589915172,1594165521,True,0,0,0.501998662948608398,0,True,False,False,76561197966632480,450,65,1075,0,969,1593761339,1594160360.0,"Hello,

Original review:
I'll probably return this game as it uses a very dodgy rootkit for ""anti-cheat"" known as Denuvo anti-cheat. 
Denuvo anti-tamper, which the game launched with is general okay, though still DRM-bullshit. 
Denuvo anti-cheat on the other hand is unacceptable. It requires the highest level access on your system and can pretty much do ANYTHING if they want it to. It also stays in your system even if you uninstall the game. This is a MASSIVE security problem especially coming from a unethical company such as Denuvo. 
The fact that Bethesda or ID soft put this in months after release is incredibly sketchy and downright insidious.

99,72258912,english,"A lot of people seem to really like this game. I liked Doom 2016 despite having a lot of issues with it. It was a really worthy entry in the franchise once I got past the admittedly big issues I had with the game. Did Doom Eternal work on these issues and turn out to be better than 2016?

Uhhhh I don't know?

This is like the most mixed bag fucking sequel I've played in awhile. I don't think I've ever had to think this hard about whether a game was worth experiencing or not. I'm going to start with the issues I have since you can probably find a whole bunch of the positives below.

The early game is hot GARBAGE. In 2016 it was slow and boring. In Eternal its aggressively bad to the point where this is actually one of my biggest issues with the game. Jesus fuck is it not only slow, but the early game features some of the most questionable game design I've seen in awhile where they took everything that made early 2016 slow and...made it worse? The maximum starting ammo feels and probably is lower. I played on Nightmare and I don't pretend to be an expert player, of course I wasted shots here and there so I was near constantly running out of ammo. Which lead to looking for pickups or waiting for my chainsaw to recharge. And when I was mostly relying on the chainsaw this means seeing the same chainsaw animations. Over. And. Over. And. Over. again while fighting Imps, Possessed, and Cacodemons. Ah yes, Doom, the series I want to play for its deep ammo conservation mechanics.
Ah well, no big deal though running out of ammo for the shotgun! My infinite ammo, charged shot, backup pistol exists to headshot those pesky fodder! Uh, what do you mean they removed the pistol for the early game? Okay, not a problem, not a big deal. I'll just conserve ammo on those mindless zombies by punching them into a glory ki- oh it takes upwards of 5 melee hits to get a zombie into glory kill mode? Well uh, chainsaw and ammo pickups it is then. Well the enhanced mobility I've heard so much about should come in han- oh the dash is unlocked beyond this mission. How the FUCK did the first few missions get playtested and get approved?
I mean luckily this is a game that you can tell is going to get better. Chainsawing will become less frequent as you gain weapons, ammo upgrades exist, the dash is going to eventually come, grenades will eventually come too, mods will become available, enemies become more varied. Still though, ANY game's early game being this infuriatingly bad is inexcusable and could have been improved SIGNIFICANTLY with a pistol or actual fucking melee damage or the dash being present or the heavy machine gun/grenades being available earlier or removing the pointless praetor suit and sentinel crystal upgrade shit and letting me have NORMAL (please note, not a broken amount, a fucking NORMAL) amount of health/armor/ammo? That leads into another of my gripes.

Yeah the upgrade system. Why does it exist? Just to make me engage in unfun exploration and platforming just to find ""upgrades"" to things that...shouldn't actually need upgrading? Ah great a normal amount of armor and ammo, just the kinds of upgrades I really like. Oh I have respectable weapon swap speeds now and my frag grenades are no longer shit? Great. It's like the design team literally went ""Okay here's what the norm should be. Let's just remove some armor, ammo, and general features from the player and mix them with actual upgrades to flesh out our upgrade system so we can justify having an upgrade system."" I had this same fucking problem with 2016. The only reasonable upgrade systems are for the weapons and runes.

And here's a whole bunch of minor gripes that add up. The platforming is boring as shit and takes up too much game time. Exploration isn't that great. Buff Totems are pointless additions that literally pause combat to encourage exploration in combat zones(the fuck?). Goo that slows you down, removes your ability to effectively dash, and removes your ability to jump (in a sequel that added enhanced mobility?). Tentacles are pointless trap monsters that just exist to fuck with you during exploration for some reason. Marauder, despite being easy to fight once you got his gimmick down, isn't FUN to fight at all. Art changes from 2016 to Eternal are mixed bag. I think the Praetor Suit and some demons look worse (Wtf did they do to the Revenant and why?), but some enemies look dope as hell (The old school Cyberdemon design is much better than 2016's design). The change from first person only during cinematic moments to mix between first and third SUCKS and the game lacks a lot of those charming expressive moments in the first person that 2016 had. Doom Slayer death animations literally lack all of the charm they had in 2016. Most of the boss encounters are just not that fun. Those cutscenes where Doomguy talks weren't nearly as cool as the writers probably thought they were. Glory kill challenges are still not enjoyable at all. I don't think the Crucible is that enjoyable of an addition.

Okay...now the good. General combat arena shit has been greatly improved with the enhanced mobility for the most part. Mid to late game fights in both games are basically the highlights of the game. Its fast, frantic, and has a very good pace to it. Enemy weakpoints implementation is pretty good. Weapons feel good, mods are generally fun and useful. The combat arena design is overall about the same in terms of quality as it was in 2016. Slayer Gates are the best parts of the campaign. The Unmaker is in this game. Fuck yes. The music is pretty great and atmospheric. Environmental design can be pretty cool at times (dead giant mechs posed over dead giant demons). The Fortress of Doom has some neat easter eggs in it.

That's it for the positives to be honest. It may not seem like a lot, but those positives were enough to drag me to the end of the game. I'm at the final level of the game right now and while I don't regret my purchase, I would say overall I don't feel the experience has been entirely worth the negatives. Obviously different people will feel differently, but there are so many issues in this game that I actually consider to be straight up bad game design, I'm really wondering why people praise it so highly.",1594160223,1594160223,False,3,0,0.520385086536407471,0,True,False,False,76561198004147795,318,41,1039,0,1039,1594008362,,

4,72257677,english,"TL:DR: A ton of fun.  Single player campaign is great, but short.  Multiplayer and story are lacking.  
Get it on sale, and enjoy the ride while it lasts.  3/5
-----------------------------------------
I bought this as my first real FPS game as a way to generally get better at gaming.  (They never have been my forte). It's definitely a thrill ride.  I appreciated intuitive controls and appropriately scaled difficulties.  The enemies each have their own weakness, which seemed balanced.  My main gripe is that I got ~50 hrs total out of it before I'd maxed out every stat, upgraded every weapon, found every secret, and beaten ever boss 2 times over. Then I was left with a ""now what"" moment where I'd felt I'd completed everything the game had to offer.  

Pros: graphics, intuitive controls, soundtrack is sweet and matches the game well, varying difficulties scale well

Cons: Story is lacking and has a lot of backstory holes (but it's DOOM, so what did you expect?), and the multiplayer is just not enjoyable in my opinion.

There are certain things I preferred about the tone of Doom 2016, but this is an overall improvement with the gameplay cranked up to 11. As a fan of classic Doom, I really appreciated all of the monster designs and callbacks that were included.

At first, it feels like there are a lot of superfluous systems in-play here, but once you get acclimated to the ""Doom dance,"" this is probably some of the most-fun I've had with a video game in years. Mick Gordon's incredible soundtrack is the icing on this fiery cake of damnation - just AMAZING.

23,72251249,english,"[h1] TLDR: This really ain't it chief. [/h1]

Starting with the opening mission you are dumped into the new hub zone (I will return to this shortly) and a bunch of plot threads are thrust in your face without proper introduction. I genuinely wondered if I had missed a game between 2016 and this one to explain why the fuck you suddenly have a space station and what the makyrs were cause the opening story beats were incredibly jarring. The story would be fine, just like the first games, if they properly set the new story beats up rather than smacking you around the face with them.

After each mission you return back to a hub which is one of the worst implementations of a hub in any game. It slows the story pacing to a crawl and serves no purpose besides being a place to get a few unlockables and see some of the stuff you collect during missions. That is it.

I think the most weird change they made to this game is the changes to level exploration. For the love of god stop making this a platformer. The swing bars and bounce pads are actually nice additions to combat letting you get some good verticality in combat but going full spiderman on a wall in first person just looks dumb. As I said, Doom isn't a platforming game so it's just confusing why they fill the breaks in combat with tedious platforming sections.

Finally the combat....they had basically perfected the formula in 2016 all id had to do was not change to much and add in a few new enemies and guns. That was it. But they decided to change things, the guns feel and sound as good as ever but the ammo economy is a total mess and the glory kill system from 2016 got broken up for no reason other than forcing you to engage with new systems. This is a pure case of justifying feature creep. The flamethrower is simply there to turn enemies into armour vending machines instead of acting like a flamethrower should. And I've legitimately never had to use the ice grenade. The game also pauses just before you go to face a new type of demon so it can tell you all about it's weak spot which in my opinion totally devalues being able to exploit weaknesses as you never get that moment of discovery.  

For the most part the new enemies the game introduces are pretty good, Archvile is kinda annoying but nothing the bfg can't handle, however the Marauder is a problem. A serious problem. People meme on marauder shields in mass effect but in doom they take the piss. The game teaches you early on that you can use the plasma rifle to destroy energy shields but not the case here. The dudes energy shield is impervious to everything and the marauder pops it up the instant you start firing not letting you take advantage of the windows where he has it down so he can snipe at you. The marauder continually summons a wolf that harasses you and causes staggers, you can't just kill it and move on cause it'll just be back a few seconds later unless you sit in the nebulous ""mid-range"" the helpful tool tip mentioned. Then you just have to wait for the marauder to attack you for a bit while invulnerable and then open itself up for a stagger by it flashing green where you get a very short window to shoot it so god forbid you be trying to shoot the dog or anything else. Then it sits there for a second to let you damage it then it's back to being immune to all damage until it feels like making itself staggerable. This enemy feels so out of place in a doom game and forces the combat pace to slow to a crawl until its dispatched. id needs to rework this enemy to stop it being such an annoyance. Letting you kill the shield with the plasma rifle would be a nice start and allowing you to damage it when it puts its shield down to snipe would be great starts.

Finally, a more personal problem, this game crashes a lot and the frame rate is really unstable. Legitimately after every slayer gate my game will ctd, half the time it won't even save my completion so I have to do it again and hope it saves this time. Eventually I just gave up on doing them because it got so irritating that this recurring issue continued to happen. The same ctd would occur during level traversal, particularly the arc facility mission.

Overall this is a highly disappointing sequel to an extremely beloved game. The game's director seems to have lost the magic behind the first game and seems to be adding new features and enemies not caring whether they help or hinder the game. The game is hard carried by the visuals, music and weapon feel. I hope id revert the changes to the glory kill system, curb the platforming, remove the hub and rework problematic enemy types like the marauder. Because if they don't I very much doubt I will be buying the next doom game should they choose to make it.

- Interesting weaponry upgrades

- Full Ultrawide support

CONS:
- The story could have been better
- You never have enough ammo, no matter how much you jump, run, kill and use the chainsaw
- Some cinematics feel like bits of a cheap CGI content
- On higher difficulties the game is way too hard (don't try Nightmare, you will get frustrated)

Possibly the best shooter I've played, as it focuses on making the game fun without forcing all that ""cover mechanics"" and ""reloading"" crap on you. Which makes for a much better game than pretty much any other shooter I have played. You are the god damn Doomslayer, and it makes it clear how you are the badass who kills demons from the start, instead of most games have you be a generic soldier or something who just kills endless enemies cos protagonist.
Soundtrack is really good, and I don't even like metal. Played once with the soundtrack on, but gone back through levels for collectables with the mamma mia soundtrack and some river dancing tunes, that works too.
Story isn't the crown jewel here, but it provides the lore that you can read into while back at your space castle, and the story presented serves it's purpose for getting the Doomslayer from spine-tearing at location A to ass-tearing at location B. It's fun tho. Never bored me, as custscenes were short and normally contained some sweet sweet murder.
Multiplayer is pretty fun for a while, but nothing to get too excited about, but the campaign makes up for it.
Basically, if you are looking for a great single-player shooter with the most fluid and fun-focused attitude to game design, this is your game. It is simple, but not boring.
If you prefer a more realistic approach to shooters, but want to play a game with monsters and stuff, there are plenty of games out there for you, but this ain't it, kiddo. Hunt: Showdown is pretty good and heard good things about GTFO.

You know how hollywood takes a great doom game and turns it into a big budget pile of crap movie?  Well imagine for a moment that the same guys who make those horrible doom films decided instead to make a Doom game, and voilà you get Doom Eternal.

First, IGNORE the positive reviews.  10/10, 9.5, 5/5, 94/100  I don't know what game those people were playing but they weren't playing Doom Eternal, and if they were they obviously never played Doom 2016 or they are paid fakenews media. 

Describe the game in one word:  Lazy.

Describe the story in one word: Nonexistent.

Describe the combat in one word: predictable and repedative. Gore kills are fun when they are rare, having to do it every 30 seconds to refill ammo or armor makes it tedious and unenjoyable. 

Describe the level design in one word: incoherent/disjointed with Platforming EVERYWHERE!. 

Describe the challenge in one word: minimal:  
All but maybe 2 demons offer little challenge. I beat them game just below nightmare using the basic shotgun and grenade launcher mod the whole way through save for the very last boss which was a tedious bullet sponge and not challenge or difficult compared to similar bosses in doom 2016.  
 
Rate the game - 1/5 
(and that’s a generous 1 as what was good here was all taken from doom 2016) and the bar should  always be higher for sequels. 

Should you Buy this game? No. 
I'd suggest waiting for a steam sale and then only purchase if its under $15.00 anything more and you’re rewarding them for this garbage.

Developer Cash grab: ID was so desperate to turn this into COD with a season pass.  There is nothing here worth paying for any kind season pass. skins and backgrounds for loading screens, icons for your avatar? these are not things gamers should be expected to pay money for in a game like this.

Multiplayer: is almost non existent.  They tried to do something new here and its failed enormously. There are few players and if you do find a match, enjoy the 20 mins of loading screens so they can showcase the swag backgrounds or avatar poses they want you to pay for in the season pass.   How are Devs doing this in 2020 on a premium AAA Title?

TLDR:

This is not a good game.  

This is not doom 2016, if you loved that game you'll be disappointed here.  Its basically a bunch of random user created maps one after another with no link between them and no Story Whatsoever.

It is perfectly balanced, and each type of gameplay compliments the other. 

In the beginning I had trouble learning all of the gameplay mechanics, I feel like it was throwing new shit at me left and right and I still often forget to utilize all my abilities in a fight, for example I often forget about the flamethrower and grenades. Lots of different ability upgrade currencies and different attachments for different weapons, some weapons are kind of similar to others, and you have a combat system that is kinda difficult to get the hang of, but definitely makes battles very open for whatever you want to do, and doesn't get stale.

The last thing I want to mention is the music, possibly some of my favorite game music of all time, it all flows together really well, the high intensity battle music makes me grit my teeth, lean forward in my chair and feel like a god while executing my enemies, and the downtime music can be so eerie and builds tension for the next battle so well.

76,72218651,english,"DOOM Eternal expands on everything that made DOOM (2016) an incredibly well done reboot of a classic series. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

+ Movement and aiming feels better than ever - blending speed and movement fidelity perfectly
+ By extension of movement improvements, the platforming elements of the game, which are numerous, do not feel tacked on, and blend nicely into regular gameplay (whether during arena fights with the swinging pipes, or during map exploration with the climbing walls)
+ Gunplay is fantastic, with each weapon having their clear pros and cons, and a roster of diverse enemies that encourage you to experiment/switch through the arsenal to defeat them 
+ Most weapons have two modification options, some of which are expanded on from DOOM (2016) which compliment their default firing modes (the short range Combat Shotgun can take the sticky-bombs option for long range, precision firing)
+ Weapons and their modifications can be further improved through Weapon Points earned through killing demons and completing optional challenges
+ The Slayer's armour can also be improved through Praetor Suit Tokens, much like in DOOM 2016, with some new equipment options
+ Similar to Suit Tokens, you can find crystals throughout the game that improve your health, armour or ammo capacities, which can have further bonuses when paired together strategically 
+ There is ample opportunity for players to unlock these improvement points; through mission-based challenges (Glory-Kill an enemy in a particular fashion, or find a particular collectable), timed Secret Encounters (kill a series of enemies in a short period of time), or through the Slayer Gate challenges (Six increasing difficult arena encounters that can be found throughout the game, leading to an unlockable super-weapon
+ The new equipment options (shoulder-mounted grenade launcher/flamethrower and wrist blade/Blood Punch) do not detract from other combat options, but complement them
+ Map and environmental design is phenomenal - you can almost hear the artists/writers giggling as they make the world as crazy as possible
+ The same as above can also be applied to the expanded lore, which has been used to make an interesting narrative for the game that carries you from Hell-torn Earth, to Hell and beyond
+ The lineup of Demons return from 2016, along with some familiar faces from Doom 2 (such as the Arch-Vile, Pain Elemental and Arachnotrons), and some brand-new Demons for you to slay
+ Each Demon has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses, much like your weapons, and in time you'll learn how to exploit and prioritise their presence to maximise your slaying effectiveness ('Fodder' demons like Zombies can be farmed for ammunition and so on)
+ Some Demons have strategic 'weak-points' that can be disabled, like the Mancubuses' Flame-Throwers, providing you with an edge during an arena-fight 
+ From a technical standpoint, the game runs smooth as silk, and has a huge range of optimisation options and unique video rendering settings (such as film grain, colour filters, the 'classic' centered-weapon pose from Doom)
+ The game looks and sounds fantastic, and Mick Gordon once again hit it out of the park with the soundtrack
+ Battlemode, a co-operative PVP Slayer vs. Demons mode is an interesting addition, that can be avoided completely
+ Extra lives are a handy bonus for those having trouble against particularly difficult arenas
+ Good range of difficulty options, and 'cheat codes' - unlockable modifiers that can be enabled to customise your experience during the campaign (very similar to the Skulls in Halo)
+ Huge range of collectables and easter eggs that encourage you to explore the stages of the game in detail, and also help encourage multiple playthroughs of individual missions, or the campaign in large

[b]Mixed:[/b]

+ Most of the reviews I read prior to actually playing the game frequently mentioned that you are incredibly hard-pressed for ammunition and health throughout the game. This was, at least in my experience, most recognisable during the first act of the game, and the necessary resource management becomes second-nature once you are well experienced in the campaign, and the mechanics required (frequent glory, chainsaw and flamethrower kills) to keep stocked. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

[i]I really, really enjoyed this title, and most of the cons are going to be nit-picks[/i]

- The movement-slowing slime sections can slow down the pace of the game, and can be more of a nuisance than a complementary experience
- Similar to the slime, the demonic tentacles in some stages don't really add too much to the game, besides making you slow down and be cautious 
[spoiler]- There is one particular level of the game that feels completely out of place, even though it is crucial to the narrative of the game, and almost cheapens what the Hell/Earth levels are trying to establish - in short, it's almost [i]too[/i] whacky[/spoiler]

[b]Summary:[/b]

If you enjoyed DOOM 2016, or any other entry in series (besides Doom 3), then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Even if you're unfamiliar with Doom, and just enjoy arena-based shooters, like Quake or Unreal Tournament, you'll enjoy this.

Pros
- Super Polished Triple A Feel
- Graphics and Art Design that will blow you away.   I kept stopping to take screenshots
- Perfect Ultra-wide 21:9 support at 3840x1600
- Vulcan powered engine that ran 120 FPS 100% stable
- Great new variety added to the Doom Slayer's attacks - Grenades, Fire, & Sword
- Great level design, sound / music, and a servicable story
- Played about 25 hours and eagerly awaiting the expansions.  I played in small chunks of time

Cons
- Multiplayer is meh - I played once and never came back
- The gameplay isnt revolutionary.   Walk around map look for the secret locations enter a room full of monsters and move on....
- Not much interaction or phsyics interaction with the environments

Doom Eternal is what you get when you release the perfect shooter and try to improve it.
TL:DR - if you like platformers, retro gaming and want a challenge, it'll probably be up your alley. If you loved doom 2016, consider skipping.

Generally if a game is well made but not to my liking I'll still give it a thumbs up however I can't help but view this one in the context of its predecessor and Eternal just made me really unhappy while playing it.

For every interesting new idea there's something new that I hated, for every returning positive feature there's a returning feature that's all messed up. 

[h1] Doom is a shooter, this is 50% platformer [/h1]
This is probably the biggest single reason I had a bad time and I shouldn't bring it up as a complaint if it weren't for the lack of presentation clarity. Admittedly I didn't research this game a ton before buying but everything I saw gave me the impression that it's a shooter like Doom 2016 but instead you'll be swinging around monkeybars and climbing walls like lara croft as much as you'll be shooting. And well I really don't enjoy platforming. the platforming even invades the shooting sections as your traversal of the combat arenas are more jumpy and climbey than ever.

[h1] Objectively good, relatively worse [/h1]
The core of the game should be how the shooting feels, right? Well it feels good. But Doom 2016 felt somehow more fluid and smoother. There are a lot of new tools and systems but for me personally all it does is make the experience more convoluted. Until you've unlocked all the upgrades, guns manage to feel weaker and in a power fantasy game that's bad, even on the easiest difficulty some of them are disappointing. Eternal is generally harder, which would be fine if there was one even easier difficulty setting that would just let me have fun shooting demons without all the other nonsense going on (Yeah there are ""cheat code"" unlocks but that's not the same). I actually went and re-downloaded Doom 2016 to make sure I wasn't just misinterpreting things and the only thing it did was to highlight how much better, more pure the previous game was in almost every way. I didn't feel any particular desire to return to Eternal after playing a few levels in Doom.
Bosses are hit or miss, the big ones towards the end are luckily very good but the game flirts with invulnerability (again making you feel weaker and more gamey). The Marauder is easily the worst enemy in the game and I can't remember an equally bad-feeling enemy in any game in recent time because you're allowed only to hit him at certain openings and that'd be fine but even outside those opening, visually he's open to getting shot, just when you shoot him he immediately pulls up a shield and it's an unrealistic feeling animation, it's ridiculously fast, it feels like the game saying ""NO"" every time it happens making things incredibly annoying. Every demon (except maybe one with a giant shield up ALL THE TIME) should take some damage even on badly timed hits and against poor weapon choices.
Oh and another minor frustration to add to the list is how melee punches seem to do nothing. Even as I punch a ""trash"" demon, I can't kill it with just punches. So why even let me punch out of glory kills and blood punching? Another bit that makes me feel weaker and not stronger as the doom slayer.

[h1] Cool, but covered in ugly [/h1]
I love shiny visuals in my games and whilst not every game has to be up to the same visual standards, sequels should look better than their predecessors. What's frustrating about this aspect of Doom Eternal is that the assets and style of the world are fantastic but most of the time the lighting, colours and textures make it feel more flat or cartoonish than Doom 2016. Additionally I hate games that are... well, gamey and the areas of Doom Eternal are filled with gamey objects like blockers (barriers and gates), monkey bars (god I hate monkey bars) and climbable walls that all have green ""notification"" lights next to them so you can find them easily. Demons, again, look better in terms of models and animation but the colours tend to go in the retro rather than immersive direction which I dislike. The UI, despite customization options, is one of the worst looking I've seen in recent times.
Cutscenes are weird, inconsistent and intrusive. Doom 2016 did an amazing job at making you feel in control and above everything else going on but 3rd person pop-out cutscenes add nothing to the experience and make you feel less like the doom slayer and more like in an rpg. Some of the cutscenes are like the good, old ones but why the other half are more traditional, lame ones I can't fathom.
In a vacuum it'd be an amazing looking game but how can I not complain if the game ID made 4 years before this one looks better.
I should note here though that the render modes are pretty cool to mess around with.

[h1] Narratively confusing with memes on top [/h1]
Doom 2016 had a very clear, simple mission statement throughout the game. It made you feel like a matter-of-factual force of nature but in Eternal you start aboard a spaceship in the middle of a story for which you lack the introduction to. I really wanted some more explanation to connect the two games better. With all the character interaction and 3rd person perspective cutscenes it feels like you're trying to make doom guy an rpg hero. That said the story is great as long as you read the codex to understand it.
A particularly annoying little detail I noticed is the humorous announcer jokes referring to you as ""doom guy"" (yeah he's called that but very counter-immersive when used inside of the game) and all this ""mortally challenged"" nonsense, giving orders to demons as if they were coorporate workers. Doom has always thrown some jabs at the ridiculous, evil and greedy attitudes that have lead to the disasters you find yourself playing in but this kind of humour just breaks immersion and the wall between doom fandom and the game world.
Codex entries seem to be more down-to-earth and boring. Somewhat behind Doom 2016's progression of codex tiers with each consecutive one being more outlandish and cool.

[h1] There are good things but just too many frustrations [/h1]
Eternal certainly brings some new improvements to the table that feel good like the soundtrack is fantastic. Some levels manage to look amazing despite the earlier complaints, like the late hell levels are the best doom has ever had. The dash and meathook feel good (though I never felt the desire to use the latter). The collectable system is great, as you don't have to look stuff up or wander the same circle for an hour to find all the items though even here some things have been made worse, for example (and this is minor but frustrating) you can't move once you activate the collectable toy animation and you gotta wait there for it to finish. Plenty of systems are fine and similar to the old ones (like runes, armor and weapons mods) but clearly the game has gone in a direction I don't want to follow. I enjoy the shooting enough to play the game but around every corner is something that drives me up the wall (pun intended, I hate wall climbing), makes me bored or disappointed.

It has difficult and sometimes frustrating enemies, but that's a reason why the game is so good. The hate you have for the enemies makes it so much better when you rip them apart. A lot of people say the Marauder breaks the pace of the game, and that's a good thing. DOOM Eternal is a game where you have to adapt to your situation and play around what's happening. Knowing the arena, enemies, weapons you have, equipment, etc. So the Marauder is more to really test your skills in those areas. He isn't there to break the pace, he's here to test if you can keep it. Besides the point, the game has great levels and fights, broken up quite well with a few enemies here and there between arenas, and just looks great even on low settings. Older computers can have issues running it, though. So check your specs and see if you can run at least 60 fps, if you can't, in game performance can be affected pretty poorly, e.g, missing a shot, etc. Other than that, it's an incredible game. 9/10.",1585545989,1594107845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198108165531,95,8,4908,568,1151,1601910593,,

94,72211395,english,"DOOM Eternal is a truly amazing experience, living up to the hype in my opinion. It's just as good as it's predecessor. The gameplay is even faster, and almost ruins 2016's gameplay. You haven't lived until you feel the rush of dashing around, blasting demons apart, before chainsawing one and slicing the head off another at 90mph. The game has tons of unique and fun weapons, ranging from your typical double barrel shotgun, to the awesome Crucible. 

There are tons of collectibles, like toy versions of the demons you fight, and cheat codes. My personal favorites are the record vinyls, that let you play music in the Fortress of Doom. The lore pages are also interesting reads too, expanding on the interesting lore and backstory of the Makyrs and Sentinels.

The boss fights in this game are amazing, and each one is unique. My personal favorite is a demon taking inspiration from the Classic Doom Hell Knight design. Tons have spoken their disdain for the Marauder, but I personally love fighting him. It's a fun change up of pace, and you have to play smart and be patient. He's your equal in every way.

I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I have heard both good and bad. But it's there for those interested. 

My only negative for the game as of right now, is the lack of Master Levels, with there only being ONE with the base game, and TWO if you own the Digital Deluxe Edition. I can't really blame ID though, due to the current events transpiring, being forced to work at home. My fingers are crossed for more Master Levels soon.

2,71986657,english,"Doom is probably the best shooter of all time.  It was the first and is still the first in class.  A lot happens very quickly.  Even the normal difficulty is very challenging.  You're always balanced at the cusp of death.  You have to make a lot of decisions very quickly.  To compensate for the difficulty the game controls very well.  I get a lot of pleasure from simply flicking the screen.  It's so fast and so tight.  

If you've played Doom 2016 there are some difference.  The BFG is scaled down but it's made up for with a new addition.  Chainsaw recharges but ammo depletes faster.   Armor is a renewable resource.  There are a lot more keys to press.  All of this makes subtle but large changes to how the game plays.  Subtle because it's still feels very much like 2016, but large because instead of glory kills being the main focus you're now focused on many different tactics to balance health, armor, and munitions. 

There are a couple of negatives which come close to ruining the game.  In 2016 a lot of focus was placed on preventing you from being caught in geometry.  This game lacked that focus.  You will get caught in shit.  There are invisible walls in this game.  In the chaos of conflict you will leap for a clearing you should be able to reach and an invisible wall will block you then you will die.   You will get caught in some geometry on the floor for just a second and then you'll be dog piled.  You'll try to escape but you can't shove pass.

The next complaint is even greater.  There is one enemy in the game that is in complete contrast to the entire game.  The Marauder that you cannot attack.  You have to wait to counter it.  It will always be on top of you.  It summons a ghost dog that respawns as soon as you kill it.  You have to sit and watch this fucker while staying in the perfect range while everything else the normally happens in Doom is still happening.  

Overall It's beautiful, it's challenging, it's metal, it's one of kind.  Doom eternal is a ledge above all other fps's.  Most of the changes made from 2016 make the game feel new and improved.   A couple of those changes jeopardize everything.",1593825123,1594097182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198058420171,237,106,2072,0,1646,1596170488,,

As I mastered the doomslayer's abilities and got more accustomed to the maps and enemies though I found that the complexity is exactly what allows the action to get as chaotic and exhilarating as it does. I have now played this game through 3 times, first on ""hurt me plenty"", then ""ultra-violence"", and now finally nightmare, and I found each play through to be a real challenge. The constant challenge forces you to learn the gameplay, and that is really when the game gets fun. When everything clicks, when you remember all your weapons and abilities and are switching between them seamlessly as you fly around the arenas dodging demons and projectiles while at the same time managing your resources and rapidly slaying demons, well it really puts you in a trance. I've never played a shooter that requires so much of you or is as rewarding.

There's no flow between them aside from get the mcguffin, which you could trade out for any of the levels. Doom 2016 had a nice continuous flow, this feels more like an arcade game of random assorted levels put together.

There's a lot of frankly LAZY choices in the environment, time and time again, random endless black hallways that could've just been solved by capping it off with a wall, invisible walls where they doesn't need to be any, but what there is beautiful, puzzles where you can clearly see there's a breakable wall but it's only designed to be broken from the OTHER side.

Fun mechanics with a great core gameplay loop. Great looking game that captures the feel of hell on earth. The demons all look amazing. Soundtrack phenomenal. Performance astonishing. Played with ultra nightmare settings at 1440p constant 144 fps.

57,72188584,english,"Let me start by summing up this review: buy it, you're not gonna regret it.
Now, for my opinions on the game. If you've played DOOM 2016, the basics will feel pretty familiar to you, but not just the movement but your mobility in general has been amped up from the first game. The devs really tried to make the gameplay a lot more frenetic than the prequel, and it shows. You're gonna be zooming through any area killing demons without much time to stop. But this also comes at the trade-off that, since you're so much more mobile, fights are also more packed and harder in my opinion (though I only have completed it in the Hurt me Plenty difficulty as of writing this), so expect a bigger challenge than before. The guns also received some overhauls in the upgrade section, making them more distinct than in the previous game and each one having a different feel to them. All of this, with the lower ammo max and new tools (Flame Belch and Blood Punch especially) create the most action packed DOOM until now.
As for the looks of the game, in the graphics section, it's not gonna win any awards, but it doesnt defer from the experience either, and it allows the game to run smootly at all times. But the art direction, oh man, it's amazing. Compared to the previous entry, it took a lot more inspiration from the classic DOOM's, both in the levels, and especially in the enemy and gun design, and I gotta say, I really dig it, it feels pretty unique to me.
As for the music, you just can't find a bad track in this game, Mick Gordon did an amazing job again, not only is the soundtrack awesome on it's own, but it really improves the experience of this game. Definitely one of my favorite soundtracks in games.
Now, for the multiplayer. Let me start by saying that, although the 2016 multiplayer was a bit generic, I actually really liked it, for me it had a very good blend of mobility and quick action, it still was friendly enough that you could still play it perfectly casually and improve over time without getting stomped all the time. For Eternal's multiplayer, although I can certainly say it's more unique than it's predecessor, I don't think it's as much fun. I haven't played much, but for my first impressions on the Slayer's side it was chaotic as hell (hehe) and for the demon's side it was very do or die. In all of my games, most were favored to one side, be it the Slayer's or the demon's, haven't found much in between, but there's also a lot of factors that may have contributed to this, such as skill gap and lack of cooperation.",1594070399,1594070399,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198066913681,317,6,2980,115,1334,1602068298,,

65,72186162,english,"Builds on everything DOOM:2016 had, including the difficulty. 

Customization menus are a bit of a pain but they don't take up too much of your time at least. You really have to narrow down and focus what you're doing to even stand a chance - which is draining over time, so it's a game that really requires breaks between play-sessions. The Save + Exit option after each level + Exit to Desktop are welcome to that effect.

You'll use the chainsaw a lot, which is why knowing what you can or can't chainsaw counts and there's no indicator this time. Unlike the predecessor, ""No target"" sign appears when u just swing. There's a DOOM Level Up which pops up occasionally with no direct info on what it means. A lot of info pops up fast and this time u must press TAB immediately or you have to browse to the codex entry by hand. The font is cumbersome to read and the buttons for the codex and the UI in general could've been streamlined. A nice plus is that you have hotkeys to browse through every menu at least.

Similar to 2016 you have arenas you fight in to open a door but you have double or triple the usual enemy count.

Biggest problem? ""Bethesda.net connection."" You are taken out of the game and into a menu and during the worst fights it's really annoying. Why would you ask the player to manually refresh your connection instead of automatically doing it silently? For a game that is built around ""high tension during fights"" and ""release nerves after fight"", it really severs the game flow.

Graphics are gorgeous, especially when you're not in the wrecked cities.
Customization options are very generous. 

Sound design is great, really captures the gamey but still brutal feel of the experience: enemies sometimes ""pop"" like a corked bottle, ammo gets sucked up like candy while your chainsaw hacks flesh and enemies rage like wild beasts.

Music is a little bit too metallic for the game-play and could've used more musicality against the noise. Turning it off and putting your favorite R&B tracks actually improves skill and lowers cortisol levels dramatically after a couple of hours of play.

79,69227668,english,"TLDR: DOOM Eternal is first-person shooter perfection.

I'm a fan of DOOM and Quake. I'm a fan of arena shooters in general (Quake Live, Overwatch etc).
I've thoroughly enjoyed DOOM 2016 and found it to be the best revival of an IP that I've seen.
I expected DOOM Eternal to be more of the same, maybe with a few tweaks here and there.

[b]But, holy cow, nothing could have prepared me for this.[/b]

DOOM Eternal upgraded on every single aspect of its predecessor. It's everything I wanted in a DOOM game, and then some.

The combat is unrelenting and fast-paced, yet cerebral at the same time. If you are not constantly thinking and making decisions, you are dead, especially on higher difficulties.

The arenas feature a lot of verticality and perfectly complement the weapons and movement options at your disposal. There is a huge variety in environments and you will not find yourself getting bored with the looks of the game. As soon as you've had your fill of one environment, DOOM Eternal makes sure to teleport you into something completely new.

The demons are well-varied, extremely aggressive and smart. They all behave differently from each other and you will quickly learn to distinguish between even the weenies. And you will have to if you want to survive - the weenies, while being made of paper, can still dish out significant damage.
Some of the demons have weak points and destroying those weak points is oh-so-satisfying.

Between fights there are short platforming sections, none of which are terribly hard. They give you a chance to play around with the movement and take a breather before the next arena-slaughter. They are also when you will explore and find various upgrades and collectibles. 100%-ing the game isn't terribly hard, but it's very rewarding nonetheless.

The sound design is superb.
First off, you get Mick Gordon's brutal metal soundtrack. It's not just a soundtrack though, it flows between each combat encounter, reaching it's peak during peak slaughter and lightly riffing in between fights. Every map has its own soundtrack with multiple plays on the main theme of the soundtrack.
The sounds themselves are excellently created with each action having its own easily recognizable sound. This allows you to focus on the action and simply hear when something in your arsenal is ready, or if that off-screen grenade has succesfully removed an enemy weak point.

There's a lot of fan service in DOOM Eternal - from the monster designs looking like DOOM II/64 sprites, the skins and collectible figures and albums. But this doesn't in the least detract from the experience of the game. It's a love letter to the older gamers who grew up on this, and it's a way for newer generations to be able to appreciate DOOM's roots.

In the end, a word of advice:
You will want to play this game on Nightmare. 
You don't need to do it in your first play-through, but do yourself a favor and try it out once you're familiar with the game.
I promise, you won't be able to play it on any other difficulty afterwards.

I've thoroughly enjoyed DOOM Eternal and I'm still playing it as of writing this review.
It's my choice for Game of the Year 2020, and I feel that it will last me a while longer than that.

If you buy this game expecting a FPS experience, it may take you more than the 2hrs Steam currently allows, for you to realize just how much FPP you'll have to endure to get the shooter experience you thought you were paying for.

This lesson cost me $50+ (purchased the deluxe edition during a steam sale), and because it took me 14hrs of play to realize the early platforming wasn't just to teach you techniques to use in the shooting portions of the game, but instead make-up at least 50% of the time you'll spend slogging through the campaign, Steam has refused my refund request.

Learn from my mistake... unless you enjoy platforming, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!

I am playing this game on Linux in Proton without any issues at all and I have to say that every dollar spend on that game was worth it. I have been playing only few hours, but its awesome! That game starts really slowly teaching you every possible button press (little bit annoying), then it throws you right into the combat which forced me to switch into easy mode since I was not able to beat the level, but after playing some time, I really got into it and now I feel like a killing machine! 

This game is exactly what I imagine a good FPS should be. Having a crazy back story when you hear how people think you are literally a god brutally killing the demones and of course the killing itself. Also the music fits perfectly. 

If I could, I would have played the entire game at once, but sadly I don't have that much time. That's how good it is. 

Only thing that I just want to note (it may be caused by me using Linux, but trying it on other machine with Windows seems to be exactly the same) is that in some levels the game just drops the FPS to really low like around 20 for few seconds until all the newly spawned enemies are loaded. It would be really nice if that was not happening, because sometimes in combat it cost me lot of health.

Doom 2016 was fun because it was simple. Yeah it added some minor RPG-like elements through Runes and Suit upgrades, but the combat itself was very simple.

Although Doom Eternal is not exactly a complex game, the bloat of combat features makes it less fun than it's predecessor in my opinion.

DOOM Eternal may just be one of the greatest games I have ever played. Knowing that it is a sequel but just because it is a sequel,  does not mean it needs to be a carbon copy of the previous game. DE succeeds in that a lot.
Also id pls give 2018 gameplay reveal hud.
[h1] Story [/h1]
I don't understand the entire plot but the gist of it is ""man too angry to die kicks out demons from Earth that were sent there because Heaven wants to exploit humanity for energy"".

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
(note: dont go in expecting the same gameplay as 2016)
[b]Speed is important. [/b]If you stop moving, then say hello to the  ""reload checkpoint"" button! You  have a bunch of weapons, [b]all situational[/b], that is. SSG won't always save you this time, bucko. Ammo is also handled differently this time, you need to chainsaw them mfs or you wont have jack. It makes it a bit more balanced because as mentioned before, it makes weapons not be your go to. In 2016, you had a hella(no pun intended) large amount of ammo, basically making the only decent weapons SSG and Gauss. Not here.
Ammo though can be upgraded up to 4 times. Some enemies also have weaknesses to certain weapons, so that's cool, I guess. 
[b]Upgrades, people, upgrades![/b] They are important in your demon slaying quest. Immune to barrel explosions? Yep. Switch weapons faster? Also here. Remote Detonaton rockets having flares? [b] Y E S [/b] .Other stuff aswell. There are also collectibles, such as cheat codes, toys and [b]Empyrean Keys, which give you something if you collect them all...[/b]
[i]Also you can play DOOM 1 and 2 on a PC in your fortress but you might aswell yeet them into a source port.[/i]

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
The graphics are pretty nice, even on low. The graphics are so optimised, in fact, that cranking up the settings does minimal stuff. In the recent update, there were some extra added decals to some things so yeah.(EDIT: Apparently these were always in game, but people with lower specs could not see them

[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]
Currently there is BATTLEMODE(caps because the devs said so dont @me), a 2v1 mode where a Slayer fights against 2 demons. No anti cheat and probably wont be for some time after the entire fiasco some time ago, so expect rapid fire BFG.  There will be the upcoming [b] Invasion mode [/b], where you can raid someones Campaign as a demon. If there is no AI friendly fire I ain't interested in the slightest.

[h1] Rating [/h1]

I hereby give DOOM Eternal, a 9/10, not enough Earth levels.

32,72050776,english,"I was hesitant from buying the game because of the reviews stating the gameplay is vastly different and more complex than Doom 2016.  I loved Doom 2016.  So I dragged my feet pulling the trigger on this game and due to the sale I pulled it.

45 minutes in to the game I was annoyed and bored.  I turned the game off.  The controls were complex.  Game play was complex.  I played on a harder difficulty than I usual do for Doom which is my fault but still the game was frustrating.  I turned the game off.  Strongly disliked it.

Fast forward to today and I decided to try again.  30 more minutes in to the game I was starting to catch the hang of it and the game began being fun.  I kept on it and kept working the controls and practicing in zones where I killed all the monsters to train my brain how to switch weapons, modes, and glory kills.  The more I practiced the more natural weapon and mode switching became and it became even more fun.  I have to admit though that all the weapon modes still make the game play frustrating...each weapon has different modes and has different modes on those modes plus you have to learn how to use flame, chainsawm and grenades.... which add to more complexity.  I have not learned those new weapons yet... but so far game is an absolute blast but I still am reserved on the overkill/complexity of weapons and fighting.  Parkour is not doing it for me either, and the dash/double dash is killing me.  Every game the shift key is sprint but this keeps throwing me in a dash.  I was using the shift key in this game without the shift key doing anything because that is so natural for me.  I was better off without the dash and hitting the useless shift key then hitting the shift key and dashing off a cliff.  More training on my brain required.

Regarldess I do recommend this game.  Sounds and looks great and I am sure the more I learn the game the better it will get.

Update:
Weapon switching still very difficult to learn.  I rarely run out of ammo which is a complaint many have said but I learned the chainsaw quite well.  I still get spanked because switching weapons is hard with a wide array of enemies in a spot, and they chase you so fast, much faster than Doom 2016.  I used to be able to run and buy time but this game very little chance.

Parkour, I really do dislike it.  So far I can get past every difficult parkour section, though I die a lot, but it adds no value to my enjoyment.  I know I will solve all the parkours to advance in the campaign but no sense of accomplishment, just eye rolls and *sighs.

Update 2:
I still hate the parkour.  But game is getting even better.  Their is a real sense of accomplishment as I progress.  This game is not like the reviewers say, you can kill all the monsters with all the weapons, it is just easier to kill with certain weapons.  This game is not entirely what the reviewers made it seem like.  I really enjoy this game.  it is really testing my old man reflexes...pushing them to the max.

The same principle was still there from the first two games, just more intense.

This is a good game don't get me wrong. but I don't get some of the design decisions compared to the first game. 
cons
•	This game is much more linear than the first one which is sad. I liked back tracking and exploring secrets hidden in those big levels.
•	This game still only has 4/5 ammo types and not one ammo type for each weapon. I find that annoying and baffling since the reason why you cant carry that much ammo  with you is that the devs want you to use and switch between all the different weapons in your arsenal, which would be fine if using one weapon didn’t deplete the other weapons ammo too. the regular shot gun uses the double barrels ammo, the regular assault rifle uses the gatling guns ammo etc… so you’re stuck again switching between the same 4 guns that the game switches in your hands when you run out of one weapon type to another. So, you barely get to use guns like the double barrel shot gun, pulse rifle, and gatling gun.
•	The platforming is fun but overused.
•	Same guns and abilities mostly.
•	The marauder is just not fun, it would have been fine if he just had a lot of health and no shield. 
•	Mostly the same gameplay as before, little innovation.
•	I know that we don’t play doom for the story, but I just kinda felt lost the whole way through not knowing who’s really the bad guy. (why was sam only introduced half way through the story? Did they forget him?)
•	The unlockables for your suit mostly don’t do anything substantial. (ex: grenades stun a bit longer, stay frozen a bit longer, big whoop)
•	Still only like 2 real bosses which is just sad.

Pros
•	Lots of new and fun enemies!

65,72129952,english,"DOOM Eternal (DE) looks great and runs really well, and its gunplay and weapon feel is incredibly tight. Sound effects have appropriate oomph, and the typical ensemble of roars, blasts, and squelchy dismemberment is pretty much what you'd expect. The game's not lying about the whole ""rip and tear"" thing. Props for the amazing automap, too; I wish more games would adopt something similar.

DE took the ""glory kill"" mechanic from 2016's DOOM reboot, added several more synergistic resource-on-hit/kill mechanics, and made them all super important to survival. Doomguy is faster, too, and once you get used to it all -- really, you can't hide behind cover or ""take it slow"" at all now -- the sprawling battle arenas are mostly a fun and chaotic romp. It's much harder than 2016, although increasing your mastery of the game's many new systems really amplifies your own damage and survivability in ways that more than make up for it. Enemies have ""weak spots"" now too, which make them much easier to kill and create more complex rock-paper-scissor elements for each engagement. My only wish is that they had dialed down their importance somewhat. It would be once thing if these optimal attack patterns were just encouraged for bigger and tougher fights, but in reality you need to be mindful of them for every mid-tier baddie and above. Larger demons especially are such ridiculous bullet sponges that you almost have to go after their weak points to have a chance.

I played it on easy and found that to be an enjoyable challenge. I doubt I could make it on anything higher than normal, so anyone looking for a Serious FPS Challenge(tm) will find it here -- and particularly anyone that thought DOOM 2016 was too easy or that it lacked the larger-scale battles of the originals. DE makes up for that and then some. I was less excited about all the platforming elements, though. Once you've figured out the handful of jump puzzle variations that game can pose, you've mostly seen it all, and I was always eager to get to the next battle but rarely excited about all the jumps, air-dashes, and wall climbs required to get there. At least the game is pretty forgiving about reloading you near the jump puzzle without taking away your extra lives.

Then there's the story and world/lore stuff. I remain skeptical of the need for the Doom franchise to have a story like this, and particularly since DE just drops you right in a year (I think) after the events of DOOM 2016 in a needlessly confusing and info-dumping fashion. You're on a quest to liberate Earth, which is already something of a hellscape, and you've picked up a ""Doom Fortress"" spaceship/station hub from which to launch your earthly incursions. There's more -- you're entrusted with the task of killing Really Important(tm) Hell Priests, a bunch of McGuffin-chasing on the road to killing some corrupted angel-types, and other forgettable C-grade nonsense -- but it doesn't really matter. It's just serves as a weirdly convoluted and largely unnecessary reason to shepherd you from one awesome battle arena to the next.

I honestly don't mind some context or story-lite in a game like this, but I'd rather it be more akin to 2016's reboot; instead, there's just so much here that it's hard not to get distracted, and although production values are great, B-movie schlock with high production values is still B-movie schlock. YMMV, of course, since this kind of thing is super subjective, but I would have appreciated a simpler narrative.

Anyway, this was still a really good time, and now that I've cleared the campaign I might try my luck in some of the challenge arenas -- on easy, of course. :)

Long Summery (This isn't a review if you where looking for one continue scrolling, but this is a rant.): The game is very flowy, if your good at it. I say 'if your good at it' lightly, many people will say things like: 'Get good' or 'you only had the game for 30 hrs (as of the time I am writing at), give it a little more time'. I am what people call a 'casual gamer'. And the game is good to play if your trying to kill time. I have only played the game for 30 hrs and I already have 22/33. But the game has a few things that I wouldn't account as bad. I started the game on Nightmare and as of the cultist base, I had to put the game on a lower difficulty (Hurt me plenty). Later I got all the challenges done all the collectables to far collected, maxed out suit, almost maxed out weapons, all the codexes found, most of the secrets found, etc.
I haven't even tried out the multiplayer (nor do intend too). Yet the gameplay feels more like pouring a cup of water in a sink, then the river of flowyness (if you count it as a word) I first thought this game was going to be. But just because it didn't live up to my level of hype for it, doesn't mean it let me down in most assets. Yes, the Con-makr boss make me want to die and I haven't finished the Icon of Sin level. But yet again I had 15 lives before the Con-makr but at the end I was finding myself panicing and trying to headshot a Makr drone for health, so I don't die and have to restart (I mean I used all of my lives). Might be that I refused to look at something in order to fight her/him efficiently or I am just bad, might be the ladder. This and I repeat, This Does Not Mean I Think The Game Is Bad, I am Just Complaining. Lets end this with something I though of now. Doom Eternal is not a river. It is a dam, some of the gameplay flows and provides power. The other parts of the content are held back and you have to go out of the way. And sometimes even that flows and provides power.

Stopping gameplay and forcing a player to look at a tutorial is bad game design.  Make it optional in the game (ie. press ALT to learn to wall climb) or introduce it to gameplay. Every other Doom game successfully blended the tutorials into the game.

Real shame, as I was enjoying the game up until now. I've been trying to beat that darn level all day! And it's only the second mission. I used to enjoy shooters such as the early Quake and Doom's, but not this. I'm not a hardened gamer, but I have just completed Dishonored 2 on medium level.

Edit: I went back to the beginning (twice). Got a little better. Made sure to practice every new move and every new mod as they came along. Changed my rune to the one that slows things down a little and gives you a few seconds to blast/run away when you are about to die. Also increased my health to 125. This was just enough to get me through that lava/platform level! 

But I still feel the game forces you to play a certain way. The chainsaw is not an option - it's a must (for ammo). Same with the glory kill (for health) and flamethrower (for shields). And this gets repetitive after a while. Dashing and jumping (away from danger) are also not optional. And then you have to remember to switch between weapons during the same battle (and also their mods!). That's a lot of finger movement on my XBOX PC controller.  Most weapons are crap and feel underpowered. 

The devs have programmed the game so you'll need to take out the ""weak"" part of enemies with turrets/missile launchers (i.e. destroy their turrets/missile launchers first) before they weaken and you can shoot/kill them. This is lame. It's really tough to aim and shoot their little turrets/missile launchers. Makes the game harder than it should be.

The new Doom Slayer looks really ugly. Why is he wearing less armour than before now? Also it seems like the Doom Slayer now cares about the story, which makes him a lot less cool than the Doom Guy from DOOM (2016) who didn't care about anything except killing demons.

[h1] The Guns [/h1]
For some reason the Doom Slayer downgraded all his guns. They have barely any ammo capacity so you constantly run out of ammo. The game wants you to use the chainsaw to get ammo, but where's the fun in having to chainsaw a demon every two minutes? Why not just make the demons drop emmo when you glory kill them? Despite this mechanic however, I did manage to beat the first two levels without ever using the chainsaw.

[h1] The Levels [/h1]
There's parkour now. Why? I don't know. Also you don't die anymore when you fall into a hole, you just teleport back to safety.
The arenas you fight in aren't as obvious as before but now there are demons everywhere which isn't that much better because it turns the entire level into an arena.
Some levels also include some purple goo that slows you down and prevents you from jumping. Because DOOM, a game about movement, needs goo that slows you down.

[b]UPDATE[/b] - I think I figured what this game needs; difficulty settings. Give me more ammo and health but keep the difficult AI.

For me: [b]Less fun than DOOM 2016[/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Graphics are gorgeous, the game is also optimised like no other. Every vista could easily be in a metal album cover.
- Music is still industrial metal, although with not quite the memorable tracks that the first one had.
- Fun to rip and tear as usual, some new interesting mechanics / weapons added.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Arcadey yet difficult at the same time. The pacing feels very weird. 
- Weapons are no longer found naturally as part of the story (remember picking up the shotgun from the dead guy in 2016?), they are literally glowing up in the middle of the room ol' DOOM / Quake like.
- Less ammo, you need to be more accurate with your hits. Not a bad thing per se but there's less of that ""Rip & Tear™"" feeling unfortunately. The game kinda forces you to concentrate on ""weak points"" and instead of blasting away you now try to snipe parts of enemies.
- Enemies are bullet sponges, again, unless you're hitting them at the right parts you waste precious (limited) ammo. 
- A LOT of weight given to traversing / platforming. Essentially the game is 3 parts platformer and 2 parts shooter. You dash/doublejump avoid obstacles, solve riddles to open doors then you get rewarded with a couple of battles.
- The game is trying to build up some epic mega fantasy lore around DOOM. A lot more reading, a lot more politics and the story is actually really dumb. The whole appeal of 2016 was that Doomguy gave no shits about the politics and just wanted to crush some demon skulls. Combine this with the arcade style and it all feels weird, as if they were parts of the game developed by different teams.

Uhh, how can i say something like while it got so many decent reviews?

Let me first say that i am a big ID games fan since they apeared on the market. And like different playstyles and game designs. So i am not focused on anything specifc, be it old doom or quake or what ever. But why i don't recommend this game?

1. Atmosphere. Well, what atmosphere? Doom 3 hat it like no title afterwards. It felt like a doomed situation, thrilled by wathcing your ammo, thinks attacking you around the corner... it was a good mix of horror and id-like shooting.
The atmosphere good killed nearly in the following title Doom. But this one absolutely extiguishes it.
The remainings of atmosphere are wiped out when you use your chainsaw and get that candy colored drops spreding around you (who the ... had this stupid idea?).

2. Gameplay. Well, basically it does many things better than i expected. Feels more like quake multiplayer old days doom multiplayer.
B U T : Those ""special abilities""-nonsense is killing the gameflow. Especially stupid is finishing kill. While in Doom it wasn't at least so pushing, not really needed. Here on the other side you are basically forced to use it as part of your health pool recovering. And this sucks! It totally distroys you shooter flow interrupting your game flow with that awkward boring and forced repetitive action.

This game is like trying to be the best at using good sounding game mechanics to annoy you as most as possible together with a zero doom atmosphere game topping it with candy drops for kids. I am wating for the rainbow unicord as powerup.

The movement in this is absolutely incredible. Even just traversing the level feels engaging, fluid and fun. I didn't use the super shotgun hookshot much, but I bet that would make it even more fun to move around in combat

Your arsenal is huge. There are so many buttons to press and it feels like you never stop getting more gear and upgrades. It absolutely feels a bit overwhelming at first but after a few levels it's almost second nature. Every weapon you get feels super fun to use as well, and I never had a weapon i felt like was a reserve and i only used because I had to

Battlemode is pretty fun. I still think snapmap would be better, but is one of the few asymmetrical multiplayer games ive played where one side isn't objectively dominant over the other. I can still see myself getting bored of it rather quickly though

66,68068770,english,"I pre-ordered the deluxe edition of this game before it got delayed, and I have no regrets. This is the game that made me actually feel legitimately excited for a video game for the first time in a long time. DOOM Eternal makes 2016 look easy and boring in comparison (As much as I love 2016). This game is literal FPS perfection and here's why:

- REALLY fun and a lot more challenging then DOOM 2016. To the point where I'm actually considering playing in the Ultra-Nightmare difficulty since you actually have something to work towards, unlike in 2016 (You can earn a golden skin for the DOOM Slayer if you beat the game on Ultra-Nightmare).
-Since it's a lot more challenging than 2016, you are are gonna get your ass kicked. A lot. But once you figure out the maps, learn to master the fluidity of the game's combat, learn each enemy's strengths, weaknesses, etc, you can completely DOMINATE the battlefield and feel like an absolute motherfucking badass doing so!
-Encourages you to manage your resources. Some examples: Glory Kill enemies to get health, use the shoulder mounted flame thrower (AKA, Flame Belch) to get armor, chainsaw fodder demons to get ammo, etc.
-Unlike 2016, where you could just beat the game with only 2-3 of your weapons, every weapon and their mods in Eternal feels useful. Which is great, because it encourages you to use every single tool at your disposal, and I really like that. 
-Pretty much the ultimate power fantasy. You are the DOOM Slayer, a being who is pretty much badassery incarnate and is feared by all demons. You are a man of action, not words. You don't give a fuck about anything else going on around you. You have a mission that's clear; to save the Earth (And possibly the rest of the universe) from demonic corruption and a higher being's arrogance.
-All the secrets in the game feel like they're worth collecting, encouraging you to explore every nook and cranny of each level, all while adding to making you feel like a true predator on the hunt (90's DOOM reference totally intended).
-Graphics look AMAZING! Even on low settings! I'm currently able to play the game at 1440p at an uncapped frame rate with most of the settings on high. 
-There are no microtransactions in DOOM Eternal (Well except for maybe the Twitch Prime skins, though I don't really know if those would count as microtransactions). Every skin can be earned by just playing the game. As it should be.
-Soundtrack is GODLY and metal as fuck! Mick Gordon (Composer of the game's soundtrack) has really outdone himself this time! Some of my favorite tracks include BFG 10K, Super Gore Nest, Meathook, Gladiator, Metal Hell, and more. The best part? Mick got to hire a bunch of metal vocalists to include their vocal talents into most of the tracks. If that doesn't make DOOM Eternal the most metal game ever, then I don't know what does. 

In conclusion: DOOM eternal has become one of, if not, my favorite games of all time. It's really fun, challenging, rewarding, and is definitely my game of the year for 2020.

69,72085905,english,"Отличный шутер!

Если сравнивать с предыдущей частью, то бои значительно улучшились. Перестрелки стали еще динамичнее и интереснее за счет серьезного ограничения патронов у каждой пушки, открытых арен и добавления уязвимых точек врагам.

Теперь для того, чтобы эффективно уничтожать полчища демонов, нужно применять определенное оружие против конкретного вида демонов. Какодемонам стрелять из гранатомета в открытую пасть, бронированному Манкубусу сшибать защиту ударом кулака, а от чарджа Пинки уворачиваться и отстреливать хвост из дробовика. Так же, многим демонам можно отстрелить оружие, это сильно их ослабляет. Вам не дадут стоять на месте и расстреливать врагов из любимого оружия. Нужно постоянно перемещаться, жонглировать оружием и искать нужные припасы на аренах. Главному герою добавили паркурных способностей, что дополнительно повышает динамику.

К сожалению, минус прошлой части остался без изменений, а возможно, что даже усилился. Все еще надо искать секреты по всей карте и почти на каждой арене. Это сильно ломает динамику игры. Вот ты только что мощно месил и разрывал демонов под металл, весь такой заведенный готов дальше бежать и врываться на следующую арену, но нет. Будьте любезны остановиться на 3-5 минут и разглядывать стены в поисках подсказки, как найти тот или иной секрет. Это не сложно, но не понятно зачем, игра же не про секреты. Игнорировать их не получится, так как часть прокачки оружия и способностей запрятаны как раз в этих секретах. Не хочется пропускать часть контента, поэтому приходится заниматься этой фигней.

Стрелять и сражаться с демонами весело и интересно, если бы не бесполезный эксплорейшн, цены бы не было этой игре. Ну и финал затянут.

70,72085862,english,"Do NOT buy this game if you were hoping for a sequel to Doom 2016.

It has to be by far one of the most disappointing games in the past few years. Everything that made Doom 2016 awesome has been forgotten about and replaced with new mechanics that makes it an entirely different game.

The enemy design is absolutely awful. In Doom 2016, the enemies had a purpose in combat and certain ""formation"" in the way they attacked -- in Doom Eternal, there are just swarms of enemies that feel more like combat in Warframe or Diablo, than a first person shooter.

Removing mechanics doesn't make it fun. There are several instances of this happening in the game -- the most prominent is the goo on the ground which makes it so you move incredibly slowly, and can no longer jump or dodge, bringing any combat pacing you had to an absolute crawl. Another example is the terrible shield enemies (of which there are multiple), that break the flow of combat completely.

The design of this game is completely the opposite of Doom 2016, and takes far too much influence from other genres and has lost a good chunk of identity in the process.

the previous title was simple yet extremely satisfying, the sequel, on the other hand, seems crowded with mechanics, systems, progress bars, collectibles and story. i'm not very far into the game but to me it feels like DOOM is like the matrix or fight club. simple yet perfect and timeless. eternal is more like the whole MCU. there is a lot happening all over the place and it is flashy as hell but it's not the best game ever made. like the MCU it's still worthwhile though.

my only real complaint with the game is that gunplay feels less impactful and overall 'less heavy'. if you punch a wall that you are supposed to punch you feel like a force of nature, but when you punch anything else you hear the tiniest 'thud', like someone dropping a hackysack. :|

- Monsters so beautiful, each one with personal behavior and aproach to kill
- The same for weapons. It makes you think and try different strategies in fighting scenes
- Graphics at movies level. Levels designers are true artists! Felt in love with Mars orbit level
Very minor gaps which don't matter in result:
- Too complex relief in fighting scenes, lost my orientation often and dropped away
- Final boss scene overfilled with monsters, so you fight not the boss but all others. Also the final cutscene too simple and short for such a great game

Unlike in DOOM 2016, you don't have any weapons with infinite ammo, so there isn't a very good alternative to the shotgun when starting out. Aside from a rocky start, DOOM Eternal is an absolute BLAST to play, with incredible gameplay, incredible graphics, an incredible soundtrack, and incredible sound design. I give the game a 9/10.

Side note: the game is quite a bit harder to run than DOOM 2016. I was able to run DOOM 2016 with high graphical settings at over 60 FPS very consistently, but in DOOM Eternal, with a mix of medium and high settings, the framerate has dropped into the 50's during the more intense encounters.

42,65417725,english,"Finally beat Ultra Nightmare, time to review this game again at around 70+ hours of game time...

The DOOM 2016 formula has been reworked and it works great. 

After playing all of the content available in the game as of now, 7/4/2020, I can confirm that this is my favourite shooter of all time and that I'm waiting very excitedly for either snapmap, more of the dlc campaigns or multiplayer to keep playing this game for a long time. If snapmap or multiplayer make it in, there will not be a reason to go back to DOOM 2016 in terms of extended community created content (in my opinion).

Now then, let's begin

COMBAT:

Every aspect of the game has been polished to the point where combat formula, the gameplay loop, feels perfect.

You need ammo? You get a chainsaw stock every 30 seconds or so, which comes nicely with the heavily nerfed ammo stock you carry. This might be a controversial point but it definitely allows for routing and smarter play and it's an incentive to use more of your weapons overall. Initially, my first playthrough was dominated by low ammo into no ammo situations, since I was playing with the 2016 mentality that one weapon could carry you forward to the entire game, however, this strict design decision incentivized me to use every single weapon for every single ammo type instead of just allowing me to dominate with the SSG and Gauss Cannon. If you're not convinced about this, perhaps I should explain why you can feel rewarded for playing like this.
There are now weak spots on certain demons that deactivate certain moves that they could use. This is a very important part of the game and it basically meant that I have to use the sniper mod for the rifle a LOT. The game knows that it's asking a lot from you so it has implemented certain key sounds for you to confirm that you broke a part or so you can notice that a special demon spawned.
Aside from the fact that the sniper mod in the rifle is mandatory from the beginning of the game (unless you 'stick' to the sticky grenades mod in the combat shotgun) this game distributes the sweet spot and weakness mechanics to several weapons, be it their capacity to stagger enemies, initiate an instant glory kill or allowing you to flat out kill them in one use of their weakness.
It's wonderful and the new equipment, the ice grenade helps a lot if you need a few seconds to think. The tools in this game are great overall.
Your equipment has now become a mechanic and, personally, I never used it in 2016, but now I'm inclined to learn to use it in order to survive Nightmare and Ultra Nightmare difficulty. I love it all, and the grenades feel very non-intrusive. With the right setup you can quickly use all of the tools comfortably.



You need armor? Find that perfect spot to blow fire on many demons with the flame belch to sustain yourself for a few moments (sometimes this is all that you need to play more relaxed, and this combos nicely with a well placed grenade on fodder demons). It's important to mention that all launchers and equipments are used from your shoulders, so you can activate all of these without needing to stop the shooting or aiming, meaning that it's always possible to use that life saving tool you had.

You need health? Nightmare difficulty isn't unfair anymore where the numbers are lowered, you can get around 60HP from a glory kill and it still feels fair and hard because of how complex the fights are. Go ahead and glory kill for that sweet health. Instead of being an unfair numbers game with the health, Nightmare and UN difficulty give back the heavy amounts of health that you lost fairly, allowing you to maintain that aggresiveness with demons, with 5 HP and 5 Armor per unit, meaning that those resource explosions will sustain any further hits as you absorb them.

Added to the game is a reworked regular melee attack called the blood punch, which is a risky (for harder enemies) but useful stun, damaging, AOE attack that can one shot a certain demon and hurt some other weak spots. It does need to charge up though. One gripe with this mechanic is that sometimes the blood punch will NOT come out, meaning that you will be punished heavily in harder difficulties (and maybe you will flat out die because of this momentum killer). This happens mainly with the mancubus though, so try to save your ice grenades for them as a small tip.

The demons are smarter and come in more quantities than before, which means that movement options are necessary and, thankfully, there are new movement options! The air dashes (and regular dashes) are an incredible tool for combat (and exploring) and it allows you to play faster and more creatively than ever. Whilst in 2016 you basically needed in flight mobility or seek and destroy to warp around the map in a more free-form manner, the suit upgrades based on dashing and the immense distance you can go through with the 2 uses of the dash allow you to add more versatility to your build with the other runes.

Before speaking about runes, it's important to mention that glory kills have been nerfed by the smarter AI in this game. Not only do the glory kills take longer (which makes them feel good, not gonna lie), but they now allow enemies to reposition themselves in order to (generally) disadvantage you or your movements options. There will be times where you will need to learn when to kill the enemy and when you can save ammo and go for the glory kill. If you ask me, you should investigate which glory kills are the fastest in order to still get the extra health, ammo saving and (if you light the demons up) armor as quickly as possible.

Now then, about runes! Before anything, all runes are static, and they cannot be upgraded, which does feel a bit sad, since you don't have much to look forward to in terms of rune challenges during gameplay. Apart from that, there are no longer rune unlock challenges, which makes the game feel slightly more focused (less loading screens and no strange combat arena), even if it does sacrifice some of the hellish mood. But what do the runes offer?
This time, the runes are divided in 3 slots: Glory kill buffs, equipment buffs and qualityy of life buffs. You can choose more mobility with glory kills (as well as making them faster) and a handy speed boost, or you might choose to get a cooldown reducer that incentivizes more effective usage out of your equipment, as well as giving you more conditions to use them (health from blood punch). If not, you might also want to defy gravity and time (and even death with a one use saving throw) by allowing you to move mid jump and letting you stop time in the air so you can aim and think in peace (This is kind of necessary with how hectic the game is... more on that in a bit). Any way you look at it, this game allows for several builds for the slayer, and even if you aren't convinced by most, you can change it up whenever you want.

But what about everything else?

Exploring is better than ever, and it feels fresh to look at with all of the new and more detailed areas. At times it feels like Metroid Prime, it even feels like they sampled the save station music. Some people seem to dislike the exploring but I really enjoyed it since there's always places to look at and many nods and fun references to other games from Id.

About the difficulty, I strictly believeD* that one should be playing in nightmare to accept the challenge and become a great player, however there are many bosses that are somewhat difficult to understand, and you probably have to die a couple times to learn the patterns since they have insane damage outputs. That would definitely be a small downside. Still, though, apart from certain questionable enemy spawns that COULD be my fault for sometimes standing still, it's a fair game. Kinda... play in a difficulty where you're comfortable with the mistakes you can make, as N or UN demand knowledge of everything.

49,72054639,english,"Having been a fan of Doom since the beginning I have mixed feelings about this Doom.

First, I don't do a lot of multiplayer anymore.  I'd rather play with friends than just hop into random servers.  Most of my experience is with single player.  For that, the game looks great, sounds great, and plays great.  Everything is very responsive and the mix of shooting and puzzly-platformer stuff is interesting, but not so difficult that folks who don't play platformers should have too much difficulty.

id certainly carried over a lot of mechanics from the previous Doom, while adding and reworking some things.  Most every gameplay feature from the previous game is here, plus some new ones.  It's nice that there are more options, but the game also seems to expect you to make full use of all of those options.  That means if you aren't managing your grenades, chainsaw, flame thrower, dashes, and general shooting all at the same time, you might have trouble with a lot of the bigger encounters.  It all just gets a little fiddly and takes away from pure run and gun skill and makes it more micro-managing.

The bigger encounters can be a problem too.  In the olden days you didn't have the big arena-type set piece encounters except for boss fights.  If you like that sort of thing, then this game does it about as much as the previous one.  I understand why they do it.  It allows them to make fun little battlegrounds.  At the same time it breaks the flow a bit.  You end up confined in a small space dealing with a bunch of baddies when there's the whole rest of the world out there you could be running through to try and manage them.  It's not a big complaint and it may not bother you at all.

Other than that, the story is fun and the environment definitely carries the hellish feel through quite well.",1593906716,1593906716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197990426210,246,9,2332,0,575,1595191296,,

Doom 2016 was excellent. Doom Eternal once again is a fantastic shooter and a fantastic game, it's a true credit to the genre and one of the best modern solo-shooters in existence, as was 2016 Doom. Unless you just hate shooting games as a rule, this game is a MUST BUY. If you liked the last Doom, you have no reason not to play it.",1593903968,1593903968,True,1,1,0.505208373069763184,0,True,False,False,76561198009808295,350,7,8179,0,7962,1597044545,,
52,72052346,english,"In and of itself, DOOM Eternal is a good game. It's obviously a labor of love, with fun mechanics, a great soundtrack, amazingly well-crafted scenery and lots of innovative stuff.

The problem is that it's the sequel to an earth-shattering wild ride of a game. And 2016's DOOM was better in most ways that matter.

For Eternal, it seems the developers came up with a bunch of fun ideas to improve the experience, and then decided to stick every single one of them into the game. That would probably have been okay, if they didn't then go on to design the game in such a way that you just HAVE to use all these mechanics.

We've got more guns, more ways to use them, more grenades and tools and extras and a flamethrower. And that would have been great if it had only meant you could figure out which tools fit your playstyle the best. But instead, you're forced to utilize pretty much every single thing all the time. Unlocking the cheat codes lets you play with e.g. infinite ammo, which to be honest is a lot more fun than just playing the regular game, since you're not constantly switching guns and chainsawing demons to get more bullets for things.

Another problem is that those wonderfully crafted surroundings have allowed the devs to put in a bunch of puzzles. SO MANY PUZZLES. At times it feels more like you're playing a Super Mario game, bouncing around from platform to platform and swinging around in the air. Fine, puzzles can be fun. But you also have to solve them exactly the way the devs demands of you; this is especially evident in the Mars Core level. ""You found a clever shortcut so you don't have to jump across ALL the platforms? Too bad, we'll stick an invisible wall in the way. Now go back and solve this the way we wanted you to solve it.""

But for all that, it's still a good game. But when you're following up on perfection, the flaws become so much more evident.",1593903351,1593903351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972436551,138,18,2150,0,2150,1593899457,,
53,72052215,english,"doom 2016 was better

better online gameplay (before it was ruined by cheaters, and there was very little anti cheat)

singleplayer was awesome and had a much better feel than eternal. you felt like the slayer, you didn't feel like you were struggling at all, unlike in eternal because of it's new stupid new ammo mechanic. literally 8 shots out of the super shotgun and you're out of ammo. use the full auto shotgun for 4 seconds and you're out of ammo. and before you say ""lol just get good"" yea i got good, i beat ultra nightmare, but i still prefer 2016's ammo and chainsaw system. you got like 7 pips of chainsaw in 2016 so you could actually beat down some higher tier demons, in this game you're forced to always chainsaw if you're not careful with your aim so you never have the ability to chainsaw higher tier demons. and when you chainsaw, you're out of the combat and looking for the nearest low level demon to kill, and sometimes you take 30 seconds-1 minute finally as you struggle to survive. the lack of animations in this game also makes it feel a bit boring, berserk only appears once, and it's like they gave 1 animation for each demon only. glory kills in 2016 were much more diverse, you could aim for their legs for different animations, in this game there's like 2-3 for each demon from the front. which is fine until you start seeing them too many times. some of the berserk kills are re used glory kills, some of the boss glory kills are reused glory kills. like wtf is that lol.




i personally LIKE this game, i really like the dash and some of the mods, graphics, and bosses. this new combat crap i dislike, but i got used to it, but still prefer 2016's system. however, i can't recommend it to others. it's too hard, and there's too much in this micro combat bs. i'm personally fine with it, but for other players that are looking for a fun game instead of a stressful/hard game id say go with doom 2016",1593903173,1593903173,False,1,1,0.474308311939239502,0,True,False,False,76561197972284863,81,7,1389,2,436,1601446518,,

But this absolutely does not feel like DOOM 2016. I preferred the more realistic style of the game rather than all the platforming and multiple (almost too much) special abilities and WAY TOO MUCH story for a game about a guy who's really angry and just doesn't care.

94,72037827,english,"I was skeptical at first but I am quite glad I decided to purchase this game. I am enjoying it. I am plying it on nightmare (the hardest difficulty) without any modifiers. I may end up playing it with some of the difficulty modifiers later on. It seems fun enough. 

I really dislike the whole melee animation kills. It is a way to provide you with additional health and ammo. I like the cooldown management aspect of things, but the way they go about it sort of detracts from the Doom formula. Basically Doom was always an arena shooter type, but it was more about avoiding damage and resource management. Now all of the resource management is absorbed into the cooldown management. I am feeling almost no resource management in the game at all. 

However, the game is balanced extremely well around the systems it has in place. as far away from Doom as the current formula is, it ends up with the same level of excitement. Just different. More short bursts of extreme adrenaline rather than long and lingering adrenaline the older games revolved around. You can die a million times and not have to worry about it. But the encounters are made to be much more exciting. I am squeezing tighter than if I was taking a shower in a federal prison. For this reason I am recommending it. 

I still stand by my opinion that the melee kill animations and constant flow of health/ammo is a bad direction. Everything else though makes up for it. The game is beautiful, challenging, and fun. I would go 8/10 from first impressions.",1593886339,1593886592,True,0,1,0.467267811298370361,1,True,False,False,76561198173986850,574,41,2269,0,90,1598831690,,
