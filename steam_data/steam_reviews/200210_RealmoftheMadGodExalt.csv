Edit: For the sake of being 500 hours in I'm gonna rewrite this as an actual review. This game is one of my favorites to waste time on, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS a form of progression, whether that be items or fame or trying to earn new skins, there is always a goal to accomplish. It can quickly go from a quick time wasting game, to a full fledged dedication, which is what I love about the game, the fact that it can appeal to more than one group of players. Pets and microtrasactions have plagued the game for a while, but that doesn't change the fact that you yourself do not have to pay for anything. Sure, it helps (as of writing this I have a combined total of like $100 spent on here), but I didn't buy a character slot till I got my first 4/8 (half maxed) character, and I did just fine with one slot.

Kabam, fix what you're doing, you're letting some of the best games die on pc!!!
I used to play this game on the kongerate when wild shadows owned the game, however simce my pc broke, I didn't come back for a while. Fast foward to today, where I see the game on steam, and I decided to give it a run. First thing I see, ads all over the place, and posters begging you to buy stuff you didn't need. Not Good. When I entered a server, four words total: Bots. There was bots spamming the chat, and back then the Nexus, there was people being cooperative. Nowadays, there are bots and scammers trying to get your items for free. I saw that players could also buy WC tops,a d that wasn;t so good. 3 bucks for a cosmic, not bad, but thet makes the game economy go downhill. 
All in all, Kabam fix what you did, or else I would not come back for years. You even failed to revive all the dead from the Nexus spawning!

41,30056285,english,"I've played this game on browser and flash player for all of my career in it, so hear me out despite Steam's hours on record.

First off, I'd like to note that this game recently has been moved into the control of a new developer, and they are taking great strides in terms of communication with the community, providing content, etc. With that aside, let's get to the game stuff.

I don't want to boil Realm of The Mad God down to pros and cons. Simply because, as experience has taught me, this game is all about personal taste. [b]Give it a try, and give it an extended chance before laying down judgement[/b]

Some cons [u] to get out of the way[/u]: This game will scare away the average casual gamer on first impression very easily. Your characters permanently die, you are bombarded by bullet hell-esque shots from enemies, and the game has quite a bit of a steep learning curve.
[b]In argument of its defense[/b] the game can feel extremely rewarding for the effort put into it. If you're not into that corny excuse, I'd like to point out that [i]even though it is perma death[/i] there are a few things you keep. Your vault(your storage, basically) keeps everything in it through death, you do not lose pets, and you acquire the in game currency called [b]fame[/b]. Fame is used to [b]level up your pets[/b] which is your best friend if you don't consider yourself ""good"" at the game. [b][i]Your deaths are not pointless, and are not setting you behind. They are moving you forward.[/i][/b]

The gameplay and visuals are charmingly simple. There's no unnecessary flair, and everything is clear to understand(sometimes it get cluttered with lots of people, but there are options in game to deal with this). 

Some people will see the gold currency(and not the fame currency) and assume all of the game's currency is microtransaction based. [b]This is a horrid misconception.[/b] There is no npc based currency, and the market is entirely a player run barter system. Microtransactions on in-game equipment are all items you can get for free by playing the game, and account upgrades/character fashion.

The gameplay is what you would expect from a ""bullet hell mmorpg"". There are patterned shots that you need to learn how to dodge, and you get progression in the form of levels and equipment. Learning the patterns of enemies can be gruelling at first, but it gets more and more fun as you learn and get better.

I absolutely love this game, and I honestly wish I had played on steam so I could keep track and show how many hours I've really spent on it. I would recommend you GIVE IT A CHANCE, and advise you to look up at least some basic hints and tips before getting angry over some of the small things lots of people seem to get angry about.

Now before it seems like I've turned this game into a holy grail, I need to point out two of the game's biggest flaws, just to be fair.

1) The community
This is a bit of a questionable flaw. I have met very nice people and there [i]are very nice people[/i] in game. However, if you pay attention to the public chat and focus in on it, alot of the majority vocalization is that of very terrible, ill mannered, children(I hate to put it this way). People telling eachother ""kys"", racist remarks, calling each other noobs. A lot of the time I have to [i]heavily advise[/i] to [u]never ask for free items[/u]. This makes people literally explode with uncontrollable teen rage, and you're better off waiting for someone to drop an item or offer it to you if you need help. [b][u]On the bright side[/u][/b], thankfully blocking terrible people is as easy as right clicking their comment in chat and clicking ""ignore"".

2) There are impossibly rare items
Impossible is an exaggeration, but this should get the point across. The game is permadeath, and there are items that are untradeable AND rare enough that people who have been playing this game for years have either:
a) never obtained them
b) only have gotten a couple of them.
You die with it? Too bad.
This is the biggest turn off for me as a player, and alot of people will feel disgusted to know this when they find out, so I'm letting you know now.
Again, [u]on the bright side[/u] the new developers have stated that they are looking into a way of making these more accessible while attempting to appease to the whiny individuals that would complain about such a change, and have already hosted a multitude of in game events that increase your likelihood of finding one.

79,29765080,english," Out of my respect, for the game's developers, some people may argue, that this game is actually GOOD. Well, at least it WAS.

 However; in recent updates, the controls are now TERRIBLE, and are barely even responsive, (either that, or it's my crap internet, from ""AT&T"") and that PISSED me off, into a meaningful RAGE QUIT, only without anger, involved! I hope they fix the controls.

 The gameplay however, it isn't HORRIBLE, and the game itself, has a GREAT basic idea, with a simplified action MMORPG, with a permadeath based system!

 Will I ever reccomend this? If they ever fix the controls, then the answer is ""yes""; otherwise, if it's NOT the game itself, but a crappy wi-fi connection, then I should HIGHLY suggest sticking with some of the BEST video games, that don't USE online gameplay. Like ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"", or even ""Mighty No. 9"".

 In my honest critique, ""Mighty No. 9"" was ONLY ""hated"" by fans, because they were expecting WAY too much, for a ""Mega Man"" alternative. But however; believe it or not, I played it, and it ACTUALLY isn't that bad! For $20 or less, it's actually a good deal! And if you LIKE the classic ""Mega Man"" series, you should POSSIBLY like ""Mighty No 9."", as well!
