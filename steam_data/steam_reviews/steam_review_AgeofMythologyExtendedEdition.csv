This is one of my favourite games. I've played it for years and recently bought it here on sale just so I could play with friends.

I bought this on sale just for fun and ended up reliving one of the best early video game experiences of my life.
That said, I was expecting more of the Chinese expansion... the gods and units are cool, but the campaign is incredibly lazy in both plot and map design. It definitely doesn't have the same quality as the originals.
So I unistall the game now with a smile on my face, but also with a bittersweet feeling caused by high expectations that were not met on a *fairly recently* released expansion. I wonder what's the story behind that. However I may come back to it to spend some much needed time in the editor.

The map editor needs a lot of improvements as well. No way near the qualities of the Warcraft 3 map editor. There is a ton of bugs and glitches and the performance is bad. They broke the saving system, now its working again. There is also still a bug present that allows you to build a Wonder in one of the campaign missions, even though youre not supposed to be able to do that. 

From what I have read, the ""dev team"" behind this ""update"" is just a bunch of modders that asked Microsoft for permission to work on the game. Could have just put it on steam for like 15€ in the original form with bugfixes and support. Instead, they are ruining one of my favourite games and Im paying money for it...

The Extended tag probably means the new bugs Skybox Labs managed to produce, that didn't exist in the original.

The AI pathfinding is messed up. Units often phase/clip through the walls and villagers often get stuck in larger buildings (Temple, Wonder, Titan Gate) they finished building.

The changes to the graphics are highly questionable. The new textures are washed out and blurry, so it's highly recommended to revert them to something that looks closer to the original (EG: Epic textures mod). Otherwise you will have a hard time finding your units, as they blend into the environment too well. 

Last but not least the netcode. Oh, boy! If you thought Age of Empires 2 HD's netcode was bad, then you have no idea what this game has in store for you. The online matches are insane lagfests, often freezing up for  seconds, rendering the game unplayable.

If you loved AOM then read no more and just get it.  The only problem other users have had are a few minor slow downs, which I have had as well.
This is easily fixable by either doing a few tweaks in the graphics settings, or playing on a different system.
This game is by far a great classic, especially the captivating story line which throws you into the middle of the Trojan war spin, and not only has you follow in the footsteps of the Odyssey as well but mixes in other amazing cultural myths; like the Egyptians and Norse.

Only thing that bothered me was the historical accuracy which a lot of you will find funny considering the mythical setting but hear me out. Greek mythology takes place way before events like Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire, The collapse of the Bronze Age, and Persia's multiple invasions of the Greek city states. Yet there is siege units in this game like siege towers, catapults, scorpions, and battering rams which the Greeks didn't even invent yet until Alexander's father King Phillip's rule in Macedonia. Also there are Cavalry units with men riding horses which is ridiculous because horses at this time hadn't developed into the strong and huge beasts we know them today. During days of the Hitties, Trojans, and ancient greeks in the Trojan War horses were more like Ponies and their backs wouldn't be able to support the weight of full grown men so that's another historical inaccuracy. There were no black people in Ancient Egypt they would have been resembled more to the Arabs, Persians, and brownish people at that time so just dumb blackwashing! I think that's all that bothered me about the historical accuracy. The mythical units however are a fantastic addition! Being able to summon armies of Hydras or Cyclops monsters to help and fight alongside your armies of men is so much fun! The singleplayer campaign is great! I recommend this game it is so beautiful the graphics and scenery hold up and this remaster does a fantastic job reminding people of it's beauty with new weather and graphical effects!",1599077225,1599156467,TRUE,2,0,0.496732026,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,453,216,1444,0,1444,1598588715

83,Age of Mythology Extended Edition,75358146,english,"I remember this game's original release back in the early 2000s and while the Steam version differs in some ways, it does give players the opportunity to continue playing this timeless classic. If you are considering buying this game for the first time or are a returning player wondering if it's worth it to buy the game again, here is a simple pro/con list to help with your decision.

Pros:

+Great campaigns (that's right, plural): the extended edition comes with a tutorial campaign, a 32 mission main story campaign, the Golden Gift prequel mini-campaign and the 13 mission Titan's expansion campaign. This totals over 50 levels if you include the tutorial and they are all well crafted.
+Good story: It clearly wont be as good as AAA titles that have the ability to create greater stories such as the Red Dead Redemption series, Elder Scrolls, Halo, or other top tier games, but it still has stunning moments as well as some twists and surprises to look forward to.
+Fantastic unit/building/terrain design: This is pretty straight forward as you can tell that the developers spent a good amount of time on the unique designs not only between the 4 civilizations, but to the individual buildings and units as well.
+Good soundtrack: The background music truly fits the time period and can be quite catchy at times.
+Replayability: With the different civilizations, main gods, and lesser gods to choose, there are many different playstyles to choose from that will offer plenty of paths to experience the game in different ways.
+Maps: There are dozens of maps set in every possible location both realistic and fictional and the multiplayer and custom games have many options for victory conditions as well as other settings.
+Myth units: The Myth units in the game add a lot of flavor to a genre that gravitates towards ordinary soldiers or uniform groups, especially since each creature is completely different in both design and usage.
+Strategy: As the name of genre would demand, this game has no end to the strategies and tactics that may be used.

Cons:

-Multiplayer: Since AoM was added to steam, it has suffered from very clear problems whether you host a custom game, or go right into the public matches. 
-Tale of The Dragon: The add-on dlc that the new developers created with the steam version is clearly not the same as the base game or the titans expansion. The other reviews for this game make it clear that it could have been handled better but luckily it comes as a separate purchase so you can avoid both the gameplay as well as the new (and lets be honest, inferior) main menu design.
-Graphics changes: For some unclear reason, the graphics options, as well as the settings menu, seems slightly more restrictive than the original. In fact, the units don't seem to stay high quality when exiting a cutscene like they did before (although it is possible that I am wrong in this case).

As a long time player of Age of Mythology, I can say that this is a worthy game of the money, especially if you have friends to play with.

When factoring everything in, I will give the game a 9/10 although I can see the more multiplayer focused players giving a slightly lower score.",1599106396,1599106396,TRUE,13,0,0.669128597,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,23,1,15440,0,15148,1599504102

37,Age of Mythology Extended Edition,74954621,english,"Age of Mythology build on the highly playable Age of Empires series with a few modifications. The biggest change is that you get to play with myth units, titans, and heroes, and you also get god powers after advancing to each of the four ages. I also enjoyed the fact that you get to play five different cultures, and each culture has its own advantages and disadvantages. The campaigns are very fun to play, and are sometimes very challenging. The extended edition offers three or four extra campaigns, so you will be spending 40 hrs + in finishing them. 

Then there is the random map mode where you can customize the number of players you want to play against, the map size, the god powers, etc. I spent COUNTLESS hours trying to beat the computer on the hard and even the moderate difficulty settings. The AI is brilliant and the enemy will try to exploit every possible weakness in your civilization. 

The music is brilliant, a mixture of ancient and modern instruments. 

One drawback of the game is that the enemy can easily break through walls in most cases, and siege weapons can level buildings very quickly if they are not destroyed right away. Also, I don't like the fact that the AI will frequently try to kill your villagers if they try to gather resources outside the walls of your civilization. Quite a few of the improvements such as stronger walls are too expensive.

I still love the game itself, it is and always will be a childhood classic for me, but this remake doesn't do much aside from make it easily playable on Steam and give it workshop support.
They neglected to modernize the hotkeys for the game, so playing can be exceedingly clunky when compared to other modern RTS experiences.
The night lighting on all but a few maps makes it hard to discern elements and units on the map. You can even see this in some of the screenshots on this store page, units are about as hard to see there as they are in game.
The improved water is hardly noticeable. Same with the shadows. Same with the specular maps. The improved lighting is noticeable but doesn't obscure that everything else looks like we're on a Windows Vista. You can put a ribbon on a dead frog, it's still a dead frog.
The antialiasing is nice I guess, I really needed my 40x40 texture quality and 6-poly models from the mid-2000s to be nice and smooth.
The view lock is stupidly constrained, no one would play like that, I have no idea why that's even on by default.
Literally couldn't care less about the trading cards, cloud saves, leagues, twitch, etc since the multiplayer scene is presumably dead. It doesn't help that the trading card art is ugly as sin. Why is Odin flashing me his nipple in a night-gown astride Sleipnir while casting magic missile? Why does Thor have a massive overbite with a beard that looks like a felt carpet? Why is Zeus a glowing eyes meme? What does any of this have to do with old pantheons? Do I care? No lol, just get rid of them, they're ugly.
Probably my biggest dig at this release is the almost objectively worse ui design and decisions. There's less variation in menu backgrounds from the original game. Some of them are deliberately hidden for the new DLC. The in-game hud ui looks uglier over-all (How you pull that off with a decades old game, idk) and is at times thematically inconsistent. Generally anything related to the ui they broke or made worse, instead of improving.
Thankfully much of the ui blunders are fixable with mods, but they really shouldn't have to be. I should want your new changes, not to cover them up.
The new art, namely the splash screen, game icon and other ui elements are laughably bad. I mean they got someone who knows how to draw, sure, but not someone who has any sense for design or composition. Why they didn't just retain much of the original art is beyond me.
They locked the larger map size behind a stupid DLC that has abysmal reviews with units that look like they were designed as part of a freshman level student project that got a C-.
And of course the AI is easily beaten unless you're playing against the Titan level which deliberately cheats in resources and isn't even close to being a proper analogue for challenging a competent, real player.
I haven't dipped into multiplayer and I won't be as I've seen enough in the reviews to expect either a dead scene or my first five games to result in disconnects.

Perhaps AOE2:DE has spoiled me, but there's a certain bare minimum that I expect with a re-release of a decades old game, and this doesn't meet it. I'd say buy it for the workshop content, but not at full price. I do hope Microsoft comes back to give this some love and just tidy up the mess.",1598315609,1598359737,FALSE,0,0,0.478260875,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,271,5,2084,0,664,1598881329

Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a moderately updated version of a classic RTS. The improvements are nice, but ultimately not too impactful.

The biggest change isn’t even really a part of the game, it’s the steam workshop integration. It gives access to a decently sized collection of maps, scenarios and mods. The community is surprisingly active given the game’s age and it helps round out the overall experience.

The RTS gameplay is largely unchanged from the original, so fans of Age of Mythology shouldn’t have any issue with this version. For newcomers, Age of Mythology’s defining feature is the Major and Minor Gods system. As you progress you pick gods to worship which unlock unique units, upgrades and god powers (spells). This adds a ton of variety as the same faction will have many different god combinations to try out that all play differently. It also adds a level of counter-play to the game, allowing factions that are normally bad against certain strategies to tailor their god choices around that weakness. The single player campaign is also pretty solid, although not particularly challenging. Overall, a great game that still holds up years later.

85,Age of Mythology Extended Edition,74576918,english,"I  love RTS and the ""Age of"" series is one of the best. Multiple resources, loads of buildings, varied missions, etc. Age of Mythology is quite similar to its older sibling Age of Empires II but has quite a few tricks up its sleeve the way it handles different ages. You get to chose the age which differs the units you get, the special powers you get and the perks you get. Some of the units completely change how you'll play the game (flying fire-breathing dinosaurs anyone?).

The first 5 levels I didn't like the game too much - combat felt messy and uncontrolled, a free for all where tactics went out of the window, but you slowly learn how the AI works, how to drag proper tactics back into things. Your units keep running through the gates instead of letting the guard towers do the work? Just build a wall covering the gate.  Or how about teasing  enemies to go after a fast unit whereas the slower ones pick them off one at a time as you run them around in circles. It's this that makes the game fun: figuring out all the mechanics so that the negatives no longer bother you as much.

There are some negatives though:
- terrible pathfinding causing enemies to refuse to move or even get stuck in scenery
- units don't make way for other units. Even in Command & Conquer, units would make way for other units trying to pass by. This game has no such thing. If units block a passage, no-one else will get through
- unit control is not as tactical as I'd like - there's no way to tell units to move back to their original position so when positioning units close to a gate, you constantly have to pull them back after each attack. Standing ground often  makes them stop attacking altogether.
- there are a LOT of units but I find quite a few have no real use in combat, being overshadowed by other better units. I never used the elephants for example because I felt they weren't worth it - slow, not that powerful and easily replaced by other units.

Not many games are still enjoyable both in game play and graphic after 18 years?

Its reasons to age so wonderfully are multi folded:

1) The extended edition push up the resolution to HD.  However, the character models are still polygon looking of low quality craft, as of the standard of 2002.

2) Fan mods further added stunning looking terrain tile sets to enhance the graphic, just grab them from workshop.  That solved the aged tile set problem.  Last problem is the look of the objects and characters.

3) Install the zoom out mod - this took advantage of modern computing power and also make all ugly polygon no longer noticeable because the zoom out act as anti-aliasing and all characters good looking now.  This complete the transformation from a 2002 crude looking game into a 2020 era game.

The above 3 factors made the game graphic look quite on par with modern release.  Incredible for a 18 years old game that was not remade.
