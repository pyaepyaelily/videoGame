The cheating and hacking is rampart in PC online play, more so than ever before in any previous NBA2k. Players are hacking in every aspect of this game from the Park, to the REC using controller mods and cheat engines. Just randomly checking players 2K cards will show you all you need to know. 50-55 3 point shooting and they'll green every shot in your face without a single miss and 2K will never do anything about it. The experience of online play is utter garbage. 

If you plan to only play single player, then it's a decent enough experience (Not worth full price and I'd wait for a sale or purchase an older 2K), but multiplayer is just broken and I would avoid it like it's infected with COVID-19.

2k20 with difficulty spike.  Worse animations and AI this year.  Less content in MyCareer.

I had to delete my previous positive review.  I've been playing 2K for over a decade. The more I play this game the more I dislike it and feel like it is a step backwards.  More feels out of your control than ever.  Not talking about just shooting.  I have gotten pretty good at greening my shot.  The AI is so bad this year.  It has always been terrible but how is it getting worse. I play mostly MyCareer and your teammates on any difficulty past All Star are useless.  Literal cardboard cutouts.  Stand there and do nothing neither end of the court and my team regularly gets blown out.  My team is above .500 but it still seems so arbitrary.  You can tell right away whether you will win or lose the game in mycareer.  Literally either your team is there or you will know right away your AI teammates did not show up that night.  Really ruins the experience.  Also some of the animations this year and defensive schemes need work.  Once again upset that somehow this game feels like a step backwards from last year.  By the way I have put plenty of hours into this game giving it a chance and the AI and animations are so horrendous this year.  Literally didn't think it could get this bad. Some of the animations feel like NBA Live.  I have always said 2k animations can make or break you in a game and the animations in this game make me laugh all the time.  I used to have experiences like that about 3 times per game.  It is easily 8x as bad this year.  Just counted 24 weird animations/AI fails in my last game.  Honestly could've been more if you count transition defense for your AI but that has always been trash in 2K.  Somehow that is even worse this year too.

Very dissappointing, I may be in the minority but I think 2k20 was probably my favorite 2k ever.  The MyCareer was at a good point and the Park was better than it had ever been.  I agree 2k20 was far from perfect and a difficulty spike was definitely needed but 2k literally made so many poor backwards decisions with this game its frustrating.  Will definitely be waiting a few years before I buy another 2k game and hopefully by then they will work out these issues.",1599710107,1600901616,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199066314513,8,1,5663,502,5160,1601328990

15,76333438,english,"The Good Gameplay
Everything about movement feels smoother. The biggest highlight is the dribbling. It feels as if the handcuffs have been removed from the user, and some truly impressive and gratifying moves are available with some skill required.
The shooting is a major hot-button issue in the 2K community, and without question, it is much harder to drain threes in this year’s game than in most versions of the game. There is a new shot meter that is giving most of us the flux, but I’m seeing improvement in my own play, and most definitely in others. I like the increased difficulty, and I believe there is some rhyme and reason to it. In offline modes and MyTeam, accuracy greatly improves with shooters with high attributes and related badges. In Neighborhood features, most are struggling mightily if they haven’t acquired enough badges. It’s not coming as easy to the 2K community, which can be one of the most spoiled gaming groups, but it’s coming. 2K also announced a hot-fix for the lower difficulty levels that will launch on Sunday, September 6, which should meet novices where they are.
The freelance offenses are beautiful to watch unfold, and diverse as it relates to the different teams. Real basketball heads will gain some enjoyment from watching the various offenses work to get their best players the ball.

Visuals-
A few players have updated renders, including legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
The 2K Beach Neighborhood is pleasing to the eye. It’s mostly just a cosmetic difference, but the design is strong.

Sounds and Presentation-
The voice acting and script in the MyCareer story is particularly strong this year. This is a double-edged sword, which I’ll get to in a minute, but for what it’s worth at this point, the story of Junior, the reluctant second-generation star was pretty compelling.
I’m kind of over soundtracks in these kinds of games, but as it is, there are some definite bangers. That said, there’s nothing present that will keep me from muting the entire thing on the first day of play.

Features-
MyTeam is phenomenal. 2K has added so many layers to the experience that it is difficult to encompass everything in a few paragraphs. The Ascension boards are one of the most rewarding, but nervy experiences I’ve had in a mini-game with a sports video title. Rising to the top of the tower is executed perfectly from a visual standpoint, and it’s a treat to earn one of the cards that gives you access to the board. The Seasons approach overall is exactly what the mode needs to keep it fresh, and to better establish goals for the user. Domination has new depth, and it also benefits from the Seasons concept. The new MyTeam Limited mode isn’t exactly what the feature needed in the way of a structured and restricted concept (that would have been a salary cap option) but it’s fun and exciting nonetheless. Quite honestly, I haven’t found one aspect of MyTeam I don’t like. This is without a question, the best iteration of the 2K card-collection concept ever.
There is a nice new feature added to MyLeague. The MyLeague Scenario share allows you to upload challenges for the community or simply facilitates the sharing of the fantasy season experience. This wasn’t advertised prior to the game’s release, but it is something valuable to users who play MyLeague.
Something about the badge grind seems more fun this year. The tracking of your progress and overall climb through the stages feels more satisfying and rewarding. I’m not usually a huge MyCareer guy, but this year’s build after the story hooked me a bit.
You can edit WNBA players in their Season mode now, which is a step in the right direction, but still leaves room for improvement.

The Bad Gameplay
Playing defense is still based too much on running into the ball-handler rather than cutting them off with some relation to impeding their progress to the basket. 2K still hasn’t quite figured out the cat-and-mouse game between dribbler and defender. It’s a delicate balance because they want to maintain the flow that originally made 2K a more fun game to play than NBA Live, but there needs to be a game within a game in this component, and 2K still misses the mark a bit in this regard.

Bad Visuals-
Almost nothing changed from NBA 2K20. With the exception of a few guys with different hairstyles, or perhaps a few more tattoos, this is visually the exact same game as NBA 2K20.

Bad Sound and Presentation-
The menus are extremely bland, taking the simplistic and clean approach to an unfortunate extreme.
The halftime show, pre-show, intros and national anthem are almost identical to NBA 2K20.
Much of the commentary is the same as last year’s game as well. Collectively, all of these untouched or under-developed details makes this aspect of the game more of a negative than positive.

Bad Features-
Aside from the feature I mentioned above, MyLeague and MyGM is almost completely unchanged from NBA 2K20. Some more tangible additions would have been ideal.
The creation suite is also still missing some valuable pieces. The number of hairstyles are limited. You cannot add tattoos to offline created players, and there is no image upload option available for created player faces.
I’m over the MyCareer guided story concept–at least as a part of the MyPlayer grind. I’d be all for the inclusion of an elaborate story–even if it had quick-time events–if it was a separate mode from the MyPlayer build that awarded VC for completion. It’s time to separate these two things.
You still can’t create female MyPlayers, though it seems like that might be coming for next-gen.
There is no way to set up leagues or tournaments in Pro-Am and Rec. Adding this feature would greatly aid the development of 2K’s eSports presence.

The Bottom Line
Aside from the polarizing shooting concept, a new look to the Neighborhood and a completely revamped MyTeam mode, there isn’t much difference in this and NBA 2K20. If you’re not a hardcore MyTeam player, I’m not sure this is a must-have for you–especially if you’re buying it on next-gen.

Also, were this a half-priced or free-to-play expansion to NBA 2K20, I would have evaluated it through a different lense. As it is, there are some strong components, but it doesn’t feel like a completely new game in as many aspects as usual.",1600699489,1600700767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199027077103,2,2,6174,3595,1661,1601949949

26,76305678,english,"Coming from NBA 2k19 (only played 2k20 for a couple hours when it was on sale for $5) the gameplay is a massive step down. No longer are players rewarded by playing in a realistic manner or trying to play the right way in MyLeague/Non-MyCareer game modes, the AI seemingly don't miss but cannot defend blow by's which lead to constant layups and dunks, what were considered ""contested"" shots in previous games are no longer and playing defense doesn't seem to matter which leads to players exploiting the now ever increasing (and now over used) badge system and depending on the player will exploit either the 3pt shooting or dunk/layup badges and cheese the game.

Not only is gameplay an issue but players now get sucked into certain animations more, games seem scripted at times with blatant clipping and warping of players, players not making realistic animations (particularly for blocks) and jumping AWAY(!) from players attemping shots near the basket, players have the ball ""stolen"" where your player drops the ball mid dribble (not just on drives but even when not moving) with the defender(s) not even  swiping for the ball. The list goes on in this regard.

MyCareer has had all the little details, cutscenes and cinematics that added atmosphere to the mode removed and it itself has not been improved in any way and is more barebones than we've seen in years.

The graphics and textures have been downgraded.

This is all topped off by the predictable F*ck you to the community by decreasing the amount of VC one gets each MyCareer game once again making it more difficult for players who do not wish to waste money on a character you pretty much rent for a year before the next release, not only that though, no longer does one get VC for playing Online MyLeague games. 

Avoid like the plague, if you have 2K19 and/or don't play online DO NOT buy this game at ANY price, having played all (but NBA 2K18) since 2K10 I can definitively say that this is the WORST 2k I have played. Absolute Garbage.

Yet its bugged, game slows to a crawl for 15-20 min. then freezes.. or the game is in slow motion until you actually appear, and then you play in slow motion...What a joke...

A lot of People are saying there's skill gap this year, Skill GAP!!!!!!!!! timing a Jumpshot on a 60FPS game does not require much skill, my friends.

Had there been a skill gap not everyone would be making a playmaking shot creator.

Now forget about the mechanics, lets move on to the cheaters. 2k doesn't want to do anything about cheaters on this platform (surprise!!). 
 
You pay 50$ and get to play vs all kinds of cheaters :)

Please buy it if u love playing vs cheaters. Please buy the mamba edition if you're gonna cheat yourself.

You could play as current NBA players and take them through the end of their career trying to get them to the HOF. The problems that plague 2K and Madden are the monetization mechanics. It doesn't matter how much the community complains, they will continue to copy and paste the base product every year and pour 95% of their resources into MyTeam and Ultimate Team. They can get away with it because even though they get pushback from their communities every, but the games still receive obscene amounts sales every year. So, why would they change their habits when the same people that complain, still spend their dollars. There is no reason to buy these sports games every year when the developers put so little effort into improving the title from year to year. When there are people in the community that spend hours putting together custom, realistic draft classes and rosters every year. You can download the current year roster, which is probably more true to life than what the base game comes with. In fact, in the case of Madden, I used to spend hundreds of hours playing franchise mode that had more features and was a better overall experience than modern versions. So, towrap this up, if you haven't bought 2K for the past 5 years this is a pretty good purchase.

47,76104591,english,"This is a review by someone that hasn't played the previous iterations of this game. I bought it despite seeing the numerous negative reviews, which is mostly a mistake. The good:-Adequate feel as a 3D basketball game-The career mode is interesting when it lets you play a game-Pick n roll is satisfyingThe bad:-Shooting is horrific until you put a lot of points into it and even then it's not great, i see others do well with it. Good for them, for me it's pretty terrible and makes me extremely gunshy to shoot an outside shot-If you want to avoid a slog you're going to have to pony up some extra $ and buy coins or whatever the currency is to upgrade your player to a playable state-The presentation is awful. It's modeled after the NBA television presentation; why would anyone think that would make a good game? Waiting around is the absolute worst. I spend half the games smashing the A button to skip the BS intro, crowd shot, sideline reporter, etc-When you finally are allowed to play the cuts and waiting continues. Someone gets fouled? Better start smashing A to get through a long pause, a 2K screen flash, more pausing, a free throw, then the process starts over. This game needs some serious oil-The career mode story is the most poorly written, worst melodramatic / cringy awful mess. Worse yet you can't skip any of it even if you've already been through it. Not as bad as the Madden storyline but still hot unnecessary garbage-The graphics aren't great, was hoping for betterI'm still playing this game because I'm a masochist I guess but I cannot recommend anyone buy it.",1600318578,1600318578,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197997530906,656,1,2800,587,1627,1601856813
48,76104099,english,"This game is enjoyable and, in my opinion, an upgrade to 2k20 (however, that upgrade is pretty small). I'm a big fan of the change in the shot meter and how there is a new challenge that essentially creates a soft reset in skill gaps. This makes it so the people who play the game more will be rewarded with understanding the mechanics more thoroughly and allows easier progression. Gameplay also feels smoother, with the AI actually doing proper off-ball movements.Also, I have only bought 2k20 previously, so this doesn't feel as repetitive to me as it would to someone who buys 2k every year. If you have only bought 2k20, I recommend buying this game.HOWEVER, the $65 (AUD$90) is very steep and I would advise to save your money during these times so if your funds are short, wait for a sale (closest one is the Winter Sale I'm pretty sure.)Hating on 2k has become a trend amongst the community and it is important to try the game without the negativity surrounding it.

This wouldn't be a terrible issue but there's zero way of reporting them, so you constantly are mocked by the same players with gorilla arms and a 99 ovr. Half the lobbies weren't populated during the first three weeks of playing the game, made even more annoying by forcing you to exit to the main menu in order to have the chance of hopefully finding a populated lobby. I hate the park matchmaking system, it forces players to sit and wait additional time in order to matchmake on glitchy servers that are plagued by modders. Rookie draft classes are not included in MyPlayer currently, so your MyPlayer goes unsigned after the draft combine and is forced to sign a terrible contract invalidating the entire BS story prelude even if you're projected to be a high draft pick.MyCareer doesn't allow for importing of draft classes ruining any form of immersion until the NBA draft. The mode has largely gone unchanged in the last few years.This game is worth it despite all of that, just not for $60.

The story was lacking, but honestly all I really cared about was increasing my overall to play with my friends and not get wrecked in My Neighborhood. I just wanted to have fun with my friends. I caught a few bugs here and there, but I usually just let it slide.

And then,
my Mycareer saves were deleted, three times. 1st time I was just 61, then the 2nd I was around 68. A nuisance, but tolerable. But then the third time, I was overall 81 and personally that took a lot of time for me without buying vc. It got deleted once more. I put up a ticket and they said they are still trying to figure it out, and will not have a feasible timeline on when it will be resolved. I spent 60 dollars to wait for them to resolve this issue, while my friends are waiting for me so that we can all play together. That makes this game unenjoyable all around. 

Honest input: they should just focus on making NBA 2k into one game, and then have continuous updates every season whether they add more functions and/or modes. Until they truly change their graphic engine and need different programming should they make it into a new game. I just find it ridiculous that they make new games every year without any real upgrades and it would also mean there will be new technical problems again and again. Instead, they could just make one game and call it NBA 2k 'something' and update it with dlc every season and make it not cost 60 dollars. Save some pain for both developers and the customers.

17,75875163,english,"[h1] I thought 2k20 was bad... 2k21 somehow got fucking worse [/h1]

Call me a fucking idiot because so far I have purchased nba 2k21 and madden 21. I am currently batting 0/2 and am out $120. I have read the reviews of how it is the same as nba 2k20. I did not pay caution to those warnings and am paying the price literally. Overall the game is marginally better than nba 2k20 and that's only because nba 2k20 would crash approximately 30min into playing without fail. nba 2k21 doesn't do that so it is competent enough to run. That's about it though. I bought the game to play the nba part (offline portion) of mycareer mode. Everything was going well until I was unable to load my mycareer save due to an e434de73  error code. Despite not being able to connect to 2k servers for mycareer I could play online h2h, play myteam online, make an online mygm/myleague... I could still purchase fucking VC but the servers would not work for mycareer. So I did some research and it seems I have been ""soft banned"" so I reached out to 2k on the matter as I was confused on how I incurred such a punishment. I, a classy fellow, use a VPN for various reasons. I prefer to peruse hentai across the web with the utmost privacy. I figured 2k may have gotten offended by my strict ""no sharing hentai to corporate giants"" policy and may have exacted revenge. It turns out it was something far more stupid than my last two brain cells that formulated this review could imagine. After a good 4 days they got back to me and said I had been ""abusing the in game currency to benefit myself in online matches"" Now I am not going to lie I fucking lost it and let me explain why. I, playing as a 62 ovr. player that has less talent for the game of hoop ball than an 89 year old paraplegic, who has no business being in the NBA let alone dribbling a ball, with a grand sum of  879 VC weighing down my pockets so much I struggle to move up and down the court. I, someone who has not played [b] ONE FUCKING PARK OR PRO AM GAME [/b] was deemed a cheater. Anyone who's played 2k games is aware of the cheating problem the game has but come the fuck on. I avoid online play and am content to play the single player portion of the game and somehow get banned? And you know what? I wouldn't mind the ban  [b] IF IT LET ME PLAY THE OFFLINE PART OF MY FUCKING SAVE [/b]. I wish I could give a proper review but I have received punishment for trying to enjoy one of the few offline aspects of the game apparently. I was told the soft ban lasts about half a day but I have no intentions to return. Just to make shit worst I passed the refund window trying to solve the error code bullshit so I can't get my money back. I earnestly suggest investing the $60 + whatever VC purchases you would make on this game and go buy a nice pair of basketball shoes, a quality basketball, find a court, and play an actual game of 21.

53,75811780,english,"There is a reason why the game has mostly negative reviews.

First of all this is one of the most rushed products i ever experienced, early access games have more polish than this.
Its like they took 2k20, tried to fix things that didnt need fixing, removed a bunch of stuff that would take time to make (various cutscenes in My Career, when visiting shops, endorsement events, etc.. Its not necessarily a bad thing but its gone) and even left most of the bugs from 2k20..

Story in My Career makes absolutely no sense..

They introduced a few new pie charts but also raised the requirements for being effective in a particular set of skills. 
So to have effective dribbling you need 85+ ball control, effective shooting also requires high attributes (75+ ? (dont quote me on that, dont know the exact numbers)) and full set badges..
So with those new restrictions it doesnt really matter, because there is only a handful of viable builds.. Parks are full of Paint Beasts and Play Shots..

Dont even get me started on the new shot meter mechanic..

Nope, still can't skip to my next appearance and the game is still in slow motion, so I'd have to wait like 20 minutes to get subbed in again for my minute of gameplay as a rookie.

57,75826231,english,"They took a perfectly fine game from last year and somehow ruined it.
The single player aspect of this game is a mess.
Zero immersion for NBA games after the initial story and you make it to the NBA. No interviews, no meetings, no events. They took all the things that played into the fantasy of being an NBA player and reduced it to emails you get after the game. Literally could've carbon-copied this from last year and it would've been better than this lazy garbage. 
The AI in single player is an absolute mess. In Pro, everybody shoots 90% from the field on both teams. Switch to HOF and your teammates can't hit open layups while your opponent shoots 50% from and gets 15 blocks.
The animations, which are exactly the same as last year, don't trigger properly. Driving to the basket undefended with 85 driving dunk and all the right animations and badges? Prepare for the most epic weak jumpshot that will get blocked from behind that you've EVER SEEN!
The new shot meter is a great idea, but HORRIBLY executed.
Scoring in the paint is a chore.
Scoring from the outside is a chore.
Shooting a freethrow is a chore.
Playing defense is cool until you shuffle with the person you cover and move halfway across the court in one step leaving your opponent with an open look at the basket.
I really don't understand how they took basically the same game and somehow screwed it up this much.
And to make it worse, PC won't even be getting the next gen features. We got half the game for all the price.

CONS:
-Running into players constantly; while the CPU is running zig zags around the paint, I constantly find myself getting stuck on the center and cannot for the life of me get around him in time.
-CPU teammates not switching on defensive plays or switch when there is no godly reason to (just for you to get defesive breakdown)
-CPU defenders are fucking top tier no matter the difficulty, for example Danny Green's nickname might as well be Gorilla Glue because that MF wont F off.
-Shot Meter can go give head to a 12 gauge; its so fucking bad its unreal why change something that is not broken. Yes people dont want the same game every year so make changes but dont change the shit people like.

The only reason I bought some cards, was not to win more games, but to make more interesting (don't play online that much in my team). But in this - 10 games so far and only one time I managed to get even close to winning. This just shows how money based this game is. Did not even try my park... well, beach. Don't understand the shooting mechanics - old way can't make the shots, new way - can't make the shots. Try to defend against CPU in the paint and they score on me like I am not even there. CPU defends - every single time some sort of contesting happening even though in the replay I can see that the player was just standing. Not even talking about the times then CPU actually defending. Then I can't make a single point in the paint. My teams CPU players can't rebound and if I switch to it and defend the shot, CPU will just take the ball and try again when one the other side if I miss a shot, there is basically no chance that the ball will be rebounded by my team or me. In short - broken game by choice. Was hearing and reading that this NBA 2K will be more fun for casual players and it is not because 2K sees us as money cows.

82,75707977,english,"It's a slight upgrade from NBA 2k20, but that upgrade is too small to really justify buying at full price. The biggest problem is that this is not the next-gen version, and PC will not be getting the next-gen version, which is annoying and insulting. It's a direct slap in the face to PC players, but when has 2k ever cared about PC.

Really all you're getting is the new shot stick, which I like but definitely isn't for everyone, some dribble move changes, and some small feature specific changes like the 'Boom or Bust' MyLeague system, which as a MyLeague guy I have yet to really experience at all.

If you like MyTeam you're probably going to like the changes more than most, since they introduced a cool season system and a few other things. MyCareer has a new story as it does every year, better than the past few imo but still pretty short and generic. 

None of the added features really make it worth full-price though, especially considering that you'll be stuck with what is essentially just a $60 expansion to 2k20 that actually even removes a few key features to certain modes. I mean, the first season of MyLeague is essentially just an unfinished product in itself. The upcoming Free Agent class is made up of the actual upcoming Free Agent class as well as the next one, just sorta merged together. Anyone whose contracts are ending this year just sorta ends up with a weird 1 year deal to make up for the lack of an offseason. There also aren't any rookies because the draft hasn't happened, which means no drafting LaMelo yet in MyLeague, no teaming up with Anthony Edwards in MyCareer. They just don't exist, unless you take a user created class, which may or may not exist at this early point in the game.


Overall just not worth it to buy at full price, I'd recommend spending $20 at the most, and even then it's worth waiting til the rookies and agents are updated so you don't start up a MyCareer with nothing but generated rookies, like I did.

It's been phrased as ""cut and paste"" from 2k20, and that description is fitting. There ARE some improvements here. AI of both teammates and opponents is improved (slightly). Defense has improved (slightly). But other than some adjustments, which quite frankly could have been patched right into 2k20 (or 2k19...etc..), The new shot mechanic, which is, at best, a neutral move for the game, does not justify a premium price tag of $60 ON TOP OF a notorious amount of micro transactions that plagued the game for years. A few years ago, EA put out a version of NBA live at a $40 dollar price tag because they knew they had an inferior product to their competition, but they were still proud of their game and stood by it's quality at that price point. It was fair, and worth the price. That's the kind of mentality that 2k should have brought to this years game if they were impacted (like the rest of us) by Covid-19, or they simply wanted to shift all their focus to the next-gen version.

20,75680735,english,"I will share the feedback I sent to 2K Sports:

""I am writing you out of complete frustration with the current state of NBA2K21. I am not often one to complain or even write to game companies regarding their games, but sadly I am at my wit's end. I have purchased the following products from you in the past: 

NBA2K13 (Steam)
NBA2K14 (Steam)
NBA2K15 (Steam)
NBA2K16 (PS4)
NBA2K20 (Steam)
NBA2K21 (Steam)

I must say, I have enjoyed previous iterations of the game, especially 2K20. I am primarily an offline mode gamer when it comes to your series. I came late into 2K20 and purchased it when it was on sale and I must say, it was the most fun I had in a basketball game in some time, especially dabbling for the first time into MyTeam as I was mostly focused on MyCareer. I enjoyed collecting player cards, scanning the auction house, and most importantly the gameplay. So I figured, it would make sense to get an early head-start on MyTeam when I pre-ordered NBA2K21.

Well it has been about a week since its been out now, and its quite honestly one of the most infuriating and frustrating game experiences I have had in quite some time. The obvious reason is the shooting mechanics. I understand that that we aren't meant to be shooting the lights out this early, but I can barely manage to make consistent shots in freestyle mode, never mind when the CPU opponent is so aggressively in your face 99% of the time. I have tried every combination of controller setting to find something that would allow me to make even the most basic jump shot but the failure rate is very high. 

Believe me when I hear the sentiment to ""git gud"" is even more deflating. I have honestly tried to master hitting that 1 pixel-wide shot mark, but I just cant consistently do it. The shot timing feature really is no help when it comes to mastering it within tenths of a second. I am not interested in being a professional 2K player, streamer, or youtuber. I have played this game for 90 hours so far. Games are supposed to be fun but sadly, this game is currently not fun...at all.""",1599624385,1599624655,False,2,0,0.528571426868438721,0,True,False,False,76561198032775525,623,8,9701,108,5515,1601903761

- Passing with the directional stick doesn't pass in the direction you want half the time. Tried to pass to the left corner once and my player ended up passing it to the top of the key when I had the stick pushed left and the settings are 80% direction
- Camera settings don't save and reset every single game
- Teammates hesitate and don't shoot 80% of the time when you give them the ball and they're wide open both in the paint and outside. Dude literally stood there after getting fed 2 ft from the basket and pumped faked when he was wide open and got a 3s violation because he didn't shoot

Not to mention it still has the same shitty Skyrim player interaction graphics (the try to run by a player, but they are a solid block, and you're running on ice).  After all this time, and as much as the dev's hyped this up, you'd think there would be something that is worth buying.  

The shot meter is a joke.  IF you can even see it, good like trying to use it.

The 2K devs were SO LAZY with the My Career, that they couldn't even bother to copy over the existing programming from 2k20 to put your name you choose on the back of your jersey, it's just ""Junior"".  It's just another thing that shows, 2k doesn't care about their fanbase, just the money.

2k21 is a waste of money.  It's about time another developer gets in the mix and makes sports games.  Get 2k out.

Update:  Still terrible even after the cheesy MyCareer path.  Good luck trying to make any shot.  It's almost as if the game as regressed by 5 years.   No matter your decision, or obtained ability, they choose how the game is going to roll out.  It's no surprise the majority of the complaints in the reviews are because of cheaters.

The My Career mode story is very blah besides a couple of spots, most of the time I'm texting while waiting for the next game.

I owe it to myself to be better and I deleted the game probably to never purchase again .

Additionally the mechanics of the game feels all weird compared to the last.  The dribbling and shooting are all over the place.  Sometimes you press one button and your player makes several moves.  The AI doesn't adhere to the same physics as the user player.  They're able to stay in front of you regardless of the position or speed.

41,75556088,english,"Hello everyone! I have been playing this game with my friend for 2 days straight. I think it's fun because of these reasons( please know that this is my second year playing MyPark or whatever its called)

A New Park- The park has a new theme, and i think its cool. It's based on the Los Angeles beach where the rollercoaster is and the peer. Although there are no new gamemodes, i still think its cool. 

Events- The events have always been great in 2k because its always good to have a new theme for a day or two while at the same time getting 2x the rep or another reward.

Graphics- If its your first time playing the game on PC it has WAYYYYY better graphics compared to playstation or xbox!

Easier to get VC without buying your way up- Trivia, The wheel, Boosts, NBA Games. Still nothing new but still cool! 

The way you can customize your player and the clothing that gets put into the game weekly. 

Cons and some ideas to make the game better- 

No New Gamemodes- Gameplay is the same and the gamemodes are the same, this game NEEDS a new gamemode(park)

New Shot Meter- It's Broken for the most part, idk if i have to get used to it. I think they should add a setting where you can pick which shot meter you want(From older 2k's)

Worst Con ever- Hackers.... Hackers are way more common on PC and its a little annoying to see people with legend status already and people being 99 overalls on the first day. It ruins the aspect of the game being fun and makes me want to ban the person myself. The developers don't really care about hackers to much.

Not so good developers- The developers don't care. If they even want to make something new or bring something cool they will always put it into the next game and most of the time they don't even do it. There are glitchs from last year and that angers me. Why is this game worth 60 bucks if there are going to be no new features, and no bug fixing. They really don't care at all. I think another company should develop 2k because maybe they would actually care. 

Now these are my only cons for now because the game isn't really fully developed and made yet. The game needs to show how fun it is in the next update before i can fully review it. 
But i have an idea to make this game better- quests!

Quests would be sooo cool! You would get rep and VC by doing this quests. For example if there was a quest that said ""Get 10 rebounds"" you would do the quest and then the quests would get harder and harder the more you do them. The Quests would also rise the amount of rep and VC the harder they get

I love that they start you back in High School for a few games then about 10 Collage games before you even get to the NBA, that was done very well. But you don't pay $60+ for a good storyline or development process, but buy it to play ball. From the start to my first NBA game I could not make a shot to save my life. Covered, wide open even a lot of free throws. Even when testing my build at 99 I could never hit a shot. I know they designed the shooting to widen the gap between the two player dynamics but all they did was loose people.

Great design is based on satisfying functional criteria, and giving a feeling of an overall pleasing aesthetic.

There will always be a very small portion of the population that will say this design can provide other useful functions (improved dribbling). But when a tsunami of people say it is garbage, then it is probably garbage.

93,75581094,english,"I could probably write 10 pages on my thoughts on this game. 

The Good:
Generally, gameplay is a bit more fluid in regards to handles and passing.
The interface looks nice.
The MyPlayer story is pretty good. 

The Bad:
Like everyone complains, not much changes year to year. It's disappointing to see how many assets are reused, how many players who have been in the league for at least a year still don't have photos, how many faces and voices are reused in MyPlayer, etc. 
MyTeam is SO exceptionally challenging vs last year. I'm not a great player, but am solid. I can do ok in the park. I'm very good in 2k20 single player modes, including MyTeam. In 2k21, I can't defend, or shoot. The AI can make ANY shot, from ANY distance, even with AD and Giannis in the shooter's face at the same time. Some of the shots that look like they should rim out appear to have a magnet dragging them in from impossible angles. The mode is unplayable for me, and it Feels Bad, Man.

MyLeague play is EXACTLY like 2k20. Of course, much of that is not 2K's fault as the we're still in the 19-20 season. But it's hard to get excited about playing the mode until after we get past the draft and free agency. 

The ugly:
Honestly, I feel like I got suckered into this game, and I'm not happy about it. THERE WAS NO PC DEMO. Maybe if I had played a demo I would have known this game is not for me. But that wasn't offered, which makes me feel like I was conned. 

My recommendation right now is that you not buy the game at this time. Consider it once we get past free agency and the draft. Hopefully in that time there is a PC demo so you can experience the game before you drop money on it.

The fact that I spent ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS on something that I am SO disappointed with really hurts.

Bonus complaint: The face scanning app is complete trash and doesn't work. Take it off the App Store / Play Store until it actually works.",1599457513,1599457714,False,5,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198043551705,45,1,3505,680,982,1602052669

They took off key legends off All-Time Rosters for no reason at all *cough cough* Wes Unseld...
The pictures of the players are so pixelized that I might as well play super mario bros on the SNES and still have more fun doing one level than trying to play anything on this game. 
And don't let me get started on the shot meter... You have to get it perfect or it's not going in, yes even for layups... even if you have a pink diamond Zach Randolph who was known for shooting in the paint, you still can't make layups. In real life, layups are the easiest shot, in this game, it's quite the opposite. 3 pointers which have to be 10% contested go in. If you think sitting in the corner with Nuggets Carmelo Anthony wide open is gonna make it, guess again, you air balled it...

The only different things about this game from 2k20 is the soundtrack, maybe the main menu, and Kobe Bryant actually hitting shots in a 2K game. Blacktop is identical, nothing at all changed, rosters... nothing, animations? all the same, MyCareer? yea they kinda took away all the freedom that 2k20 brought and you have to chose out of their builds, you can't make your own, the list goes on longer than the loading time for 2k17.

In all honesty, if you're an NBA fan and you want to have a bunch of ""new"" updates, buy 2k20. It's $40 cheaper, trash, but better than whatever you can call this... the game is very unfinished and it shows through everything you do in it.

So we got no new graphics, the exact same dialogue lines from coaches and trainers etc, the same glitched out ball return machine, BLM implemented everywhere they could, a smaller hard to see shot clock that pops up once you let go of the shoot button, The same verbal diarrhea from 2kMC and the braindead hosts, The same Asian and NA servers with terrible lag stutters all over the neighbourhood, No anticheat anywhere and green 3 shooting hacks in almost everygame... and the list goes on

The Shooting:
Really well made. Way better than 2k20. 

The Defense:
For me it is harder to stay on the shooter than 2k20. Fluid but i feel like real people wont take 5 seconds to go one way then turn around and go back because the npc you are guarding is not human and they pretty much teleport to the bucket.

44,75519509,english,"From a casual player perspective, this game was a pretty major disappointment. I mainly play the MyCareer and MyLeague when I'm by myself and Play Now when I'm with friends (not usually the online multiplayer modes). I was hesitant to pick this year's 2k up since it was pretty clearly recycling a lot from the previous title, since they shifted most of the development to the next gen console edition (which is not going to be getting a pc port). There were three major issues I had which I'll talk about below.

I ended up buying the game after finding out that the MyCareer story mode would follow you from high school through college and the draft. I had assumed that after the draft there would be continuation of events following your journey to become a great player, but they pretty much got rid of all the cutscenes after you enter the league and any ""story progression"" is told through a few emails. The story mode leading up to the league wasn't awful, but it really felt like it was completely unfinished. One of the limitations of the 2k franchise is that they need to release a new one every year, so it feels like with this title they left a lot of loose ends and unfinished plot points because of covid complications and time issues. Regardless, the story just left me feeling extremely unsatisfied because of its lack of a real conclusion point.

Second is the gameplay shifts. The game implemented a new shooting system which is tailored to increase the difficulty of shooting. The new system isn't awful, but it can be really unforgiving. They did keep the previous system as an option, but they nerfed it to the point where you will still miss a lot of wide open shots if you're past the 3 point line. I did finally find out how to shoot with the new system thanks to a reddit thread explaining some features and a lot of practice but nowhere in the game does it tell you how to actually shoot properly. 2k was ready to release a hotfix to make the shooting better but the community manager shot the idea down because he believed in the idea of a ""skill gap"" for park/rec players. 2k is releasing a patch tomorrow, and I'm confident it's only because Damian Lillard tweeted that the shooting was too hard. It feels like it's completely ignoring the casual player base here.

Finally we have MyLeague. There are no rookies and the whole system is pretty much exactly the same as how it is in 2k20.

The shot meter is crap. Inside scoring is practically impossible. Even with 85 Overall close shots and a size mismatch, I miss 90% of shots under the rim. There are major performance issues. I'm running this on 2 x Geforce 1080s and I'm getting stuttering in the neighborhood (internet connection is fine). Speaking of the neighborhood, there are TONS of hackers already. They're already at legendary rank and changing their names to ads for their hacking services. 

A LOT of the resources are reused from 2k20. the practice facility is exactly the same. The character models look exactly the same. The in-game presentation graphics are exactly the same.

Last year was an eye opening experience for me in terms of buying and playing 2k's yearly sports game, after buying them yearly like a good brainwashed lemming, I enjoyed the game for a few months until.. the dreaded crashes due to Nvidia video card..  I figured it was a good run, and I played the 2k20 for close to 150 hours, so I got my money worth... 

So I decided to give 2k another go this year,, I figured even with their lackluster support, I could probably count on the game at the very least lasting another 3 - 4 months of decent playtime before crashes and bugs hit..  well frig yeah, just starting up myteam and fiddling around with my line up and opening my packs caused the game to crash..

Ok I figure, lets try again, maybe I accidentally alt + f4 or something else.. Nope, not even 30 minutes into the game and it crashed twice..  Hit up the message boards and see nothing but complaints from other users about crashes again..  You fool once it's shame on you.. Fool me twice it's shame on me, but their won't be a third time..  

After this review is done, i'm refunding the game, it'll be the third time I requested a refund from steam but it'll be well worth the refund price.. These developers and 2k don't care about the PC community, they might fix the crashing issue.. MIGHT, but odds are just like last years crash this will be forgotten about and support will be busy working on next years cash grab..

In all honesty I would recommend you avoid buying this game and sent 2k the message that we are tired of getting broken unplayable games that crash and crash and crash, we are tired of giving them our money while their games sit unplayable..

67,75514160,english,"The differences between 2k20 and '21 are pretty subtle, but meaningful, IMO. 

Primarily, the players actually have weight and vast differences in agility. In previous games, while the bigs were slower in a footrace, they still moved like guards. Getting a switch wasn't very beneficial, as even lumbering centers could easily stay in front of even the quickest guards. Getting the blow-by took a lot of dribble-stick wizardry. This year, the movement differences in even small spaces is really a factor. In order to guard a swifter player, you have to respect them and give them space, which opens up more of a one-on-one meta game than in 2k20. This is also enhanced by the fact that they streamlined the dribble stick implementation. The step back animations have also gotten some love, as they create greater separation and are more effective. Another nice little dribble system upgrade is that you can now move around while sizing up, and the sizeup animations change by direction. They also chain nicely into the other moves, so it's easier to pull off slick looking dribble combos without having to do them manually. 

The off-ball movement is also a lot crisper. The CPU teammates seem to cut and screen for each other more. 

Overall, I loved the 5-on-5 NBA gameplay, and while this feels really similar, the changes are nuanced but do make an impact.

Dude, it's basketball. What the heck do you expect from year to year? The game isn't going to change. Dribbling is better. Animations and graphics overall are decent. Yes, it's a bummer seeing the same gym being used for every team practice. 

MyCareer is a lot of fun and for me that's what I mostly play. Much better story. Some cool things that happen along the way. You can actually go #1 in the draft. 

One big complaint I see are people saying they can't shoot anymore because they changed the shot meter. Do you even play video games? A change like that and you all of a sudden can't figure it out? I shoot better with the new meter and like it way more than the other one. Seriously, figure it out, it is not difficult. 

Until this game happens on a holo-deck like Star Trek things are not going to change a lot. Things can always be improved but this game still feels good to play. If you think you know something that will make this better, reach out to 2K and make suggestions. But honestly, this game is solid and from the standpoint of MyCareer way better than previous versions.

56,75483555,english,"Tried to give it a fair shot and unfortunately this game feels more like a 2K20 expansion rather than a new game. They've put aside the PC version again and they have zero plans to release the ""next-gen"" version of the game. 

Positives:
-New Shooting Mechanic: The only thing that feels entirely new. However, this is just an updated version of shooting that was in I believe 2K17. It feels far more polished an consistent and I actually quite like it, but one of the only things that's new.

-MyCareer: One of the first times the story hasn't felt too terrible. There's still lots of moments that make you question who was writing it, but overall it's actually quite playable.


Negatives: 
-""New"" game: Take the new shooting mechanic out of the game and it would be nearly indistinguishable from 2K20. Rosters aren't updated/accurate, player models aren't updated with lots of players just not having models all together, player creation is identical to last year and there's ONE new template to start with.

-MyLeague/GM: The mode I personally spend the most time in has had zero updates or changes outside of a ""new"" stat you can adjust in Player Morale. However, Player Morale was in previous games, just not adjustable. By far the biggest issue is that there's not even a rookie draft class implemented into the game yet. I understand with the season being delayed that it wouldn't be accurate, but just having zero draft or off-season in the first season all together is frustrating.

-Anti-cheat: There's still no anti-cheat on the game, so unfortunately things like CheatEngine are still viable. Eventually it's gonna get to the point when trainers are widespread and available for 2K21 and the park becomes impossible to play without running into any.

-Bug-fixes: Pretty much all the same old bugs that were prevalent in 2K20 are still in 2K21.

Overall it's just frustrating to not only see PC get neglected in comparison to the console versions of this game, but the game itself just not being remotely different from previous versions at all. This is 2K20v2. Do yourself a favor and probably don't buy the game.",1599310717,1599310717,False,179,0,0.865944564342498779,1,True,False,False,76561198054116129,653,1,2297,446,1252,1601443194

The gameplay is awful. The shooting is awful. The AI is awful. Nothing about this game screams ""fun"" in any sense of the word. Losers say ""oh its cause you need to get better"" which has NOTHING to do with it. The game absolutely punishes the shit out of you for being even SLIGHTLY off (even when you are definitely in the middle) and has a god awful system now where you are almost forced to use the right stick whereas you could get away with using ""X"" on a LOT of stuff. Sometimes when you are backing down someone and try to hookshot, you have to aim with the right stick AND time it right. It wouldn't be so insanely hard if it wasn't so damn touchy, but man oh man its awful.

70,75474418,english,"Personally I say don't listen to everyone whining about 'it's the same game' or 'i can't shoot now' and the 'slashers are nerfed zomg!' This year it's literally all about the badges. I played in the park before I got badges and then once I had HOF contact finisher and gold slithery plus I picked up elite contact dunks. With the badges and contact dunks there was a massively noticeable increase in my ability to finish at the rim. Granted you aren't going to dunk when 2 guys are standing there waiting on you, your dunk animation automatically changes into a layup, which means you were forced to change your shot and you're much more likely to miss-just like real life.

Another great way to complete dunks in traffic is alley-ops. BIGS HOLD THE DANG SHOOT BUTTON WHEN YOU DRIVE TOWARD THE RACK. So tired of bigs who want to sit under the basket on offense and when you lob to them as they drive in they just hop up and catch the ball. I'm in the park to get rep, help a playmaker out! I've been playing in the park almost exclusively minus the mycareer intro and a few games to get up some badges and while alley-ops don't hit 100% of the time if you have a good pass accuracy and lob city passer it's pretty effective. While repping on a playmaker use HOF lob city passer and I would suggest any bigs who are just repping right now get as much lob city finisher as they can. I ran the park with a friend of mine and we lost 2 games out of probably 20, we got a ton of rep just me lobbing up to him. I'm watching a ton of shooters hitting their shots right now too. So just because the kids don't want to put in the work doesn't mean the game sucks.. probably just means they do.

And finally ""OMG HACKERS NUU"" all I can say is I haven't encountered any that I know of, and if I did I guarantee they were beaten. The two times we lost today wasn't from any cheating, the guys were good I'll admit it. There's some real talent in the park already this year and lots of fun to be had if you're willing to put in the work to learn a new playstyle. If all you wanted was a copy/paste of 2k20 then you'll be disappointed, you're going to have to teach yourself to play a little different. Much of 21 is the same, but the mechanics are more realistic if you ask me.

Hope to see you all on the courts. Keep ballin'.",1599297212,1599297271,True,2,1,0.319910526275634766,4,True,False,False,76561198130078951,53,7,15507,4144,908,1602055657

I see alot of people complaining how the animations and the commentary are the same, of course its the same theyve kept it the same every year and they just add to it there is no reason why they would need to start from scratch! Alot of people complain that they have to buy VC to be good but thats the same with every game if you want to fast track or you could just play the game how its meant to be played and earn VC yourself like i do each year these people expect to hop into their rookie season and drop 70 points a game when thats just not realistic at all.

In 2k20 i had to drastically adjust the sliders heavily in the CPU's favour just to make it slightly competitive and id still quite easily win by 20+, i hop into 2k21 and i play on hall of fame and my games go really close and that tells me theyve made adjustments although we may not notice them at first it definitely feels harder to get to the rim easily and to consistently hit down  shots!

Overall i understand peoples views on them not doing alot and its 2k20.5 and i honestly do understand their point but at the same time the game has definitely improved in some factors and the game gets hit with such negative reviews for being a game full of microtransactions, every game nowadays is filled with microtransactions but you dont have to buy VC ive never brought it i just put it in the effort.",1599266906,1599266906,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198088685866,477,2,1523,312,741,1601845599

37,75455126,english,"NBA 2K21 is another one of the yearly released 2K games that seems to be a re-hash of previous ideas that have been explored through and through for 20 years or more, but that doesn't mean the genre is unenjoyable or dead. The biggest most glaring improvement this year is the User interface. Thankfully everything has been optimized in such an accessible and smooth way that as a yearly supporter, my main gripe with the game was finally fixed. The gameplay is only slightly different as the game sense needed to succeed in this game is almost exactly the same as NBA 2K20 except taking the ball to the rim is a little more clunkier to stop a lot of cheap baskets. The flip side is that the person on offence will make several contested drives in the paint, making this 'difference' a non factor. The animations have been thoroughly improved and built upon for more dynamic moments, but the noticeable texture/animation glitches kind of put a damper on that part of the experience thus far. I would recommend purchasing this game just to try out 2K if you like basketball or maybe if you just want to try getting into sports because the cultural significance of this game is understated by the gaming community at large. I hope that with regular updates this game will maintain it's trend of becoming more and more smooth and elegant while balancing the game- aspect and the simulation aspect.

I'm not quite sure what reviewers mean when they complain that it is still the same game. 
were people expecting a brand new take on basketball?

anyways, many bugs that will hopefully be patched soon. 
eg.
- camera angle sometimes changes during middle of a free-throw
-calling a pick and roll is really bugged. I expect giannis to roll to the basket. Instead,  10% of the time he will either, run around in a small circle, or; go on a fade route

BIGGEST CON is the new shot stick. 
-Could be from my own ignorance and lack of trying it out but, my god. you will air ball every shot until you learn it properly, and then you might be able to hit the rim
- I completely ignored using it and went to the controller settings to change the pro stick for dribbling exclusively. 
- shooting with square/X is the original way and seems to be the only way to shoot with consistency (again, i could just be bad)

Aside from the MyPlayer storyline, this is damn near the same exact game. If you play any of the offline modes (the modes that don't have microtransactions) the game will be no different than 2K20. Same layout and set-up, like EXACTLY THE SAME!

In offline MyLeague... Qualifying Offers are STILL BROKEN! Is that 3 years in a row now? That's a HUGE and very important aspect of signing new players.
On the Jazz at the end of the year, I can't Donovan Mitchell a good contract to keep my young prospect there. He will ALWAYS take a Qualifying Offer for a 1year contract for like 6million. Regardless if you choose to give him that offer or not hahahha it WILL be there and he WILL take it. This goes for any rookies on your team. This upsets them and messes with team chemistry and you may loose them altogether if you're playing a small market team and had a rough season.

Only a few minutes into it and since I've seen the absolute joke they've put forward I'm refunding the game and actually skipping this year. Really sucks cause I want to play a basketball game but I just can't back this anymore. 2K20 was the last year I let them do the copy paste and deal with it.
